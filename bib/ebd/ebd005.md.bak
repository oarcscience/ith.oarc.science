<span id="000">**Abjects**</span> ([Psa 35:15](../kjv/psa035.htm#015).md),
the translation of a Hebrew word meaning smiters; probably, in allusion
to the tongue, slanderers. (Compare [Jer 18:18](../kjv/jer018.htm#018)..md)

<span id="001">**Ablution**</span> Or washing, was practiced (1.) When a
person was initiated into a higher state: e.g., when Aaron and his sons
were set apart to the priest's office, they were washed with water
previous to their investiture with the priestly robes ([Lev
8:6](../kjv/lev008.htm#006)). (2..md) Before the priests approached the
altar of God, they were required, on pain of death, to wash their hands
and their feet to cleanse them from the soil of common life ([Exo
30:17](../kjv/exo030.htm#017).md). To this practice the Psalmist alludes,
[Psa 26:6](../kjv/psa026.htm#006). (3..md) There were washings prescribed
for the purpose of cleansing from positive defilement contracted by
particular acts. Of such washings eleven different species are
prescribed in the Levitical law (Lev. 12-15). (4.) A fourth class of
ablutions is mentioned, by which a person purified or absolved himself
from the guilt of some particular act. For example, the elders of the
nearest village where some murder was committed were required, when the
murderer was unknown, to wash their hands over the expiatory heifer
which was beheaded, and in doing so to say, "Our hands have not shed
this blood, neither have our eyes seen it" ([Deu
21:1](../kjv/deu021.htm#001).md). So also Pilate declared himself innocent
of the blood of Jesus by washing his hands ([Mat
27:24](../kjv/mat027.htm#024).md). This act of Pilate may not, however,
have been borrowed from the custom of the Jews. The same practice was
common among the Greeks and Romans. The Pharisees carried the practice
of ablution to great excess, thereby claiming extraordinary purity ([Mat
23:25](../kjv/mat023.htm#025)). Mark ([Mar 7:1](../kjv/mar007.htm#001).md)
refers to the ceremonial ablutions. The Pharisees washed their hands
"oft," more correctly, "with the fist" (R.V., "diligently"), or as an
old father, Theophylact, explains it, "up to the elbow." (Compare also
[Mar 7:4](../kjv/mar007.htm#004); [Lev 6:28](../kjv/lev006.htm#028.md);
[Lev 11:32](../kjv/lev011.htm#032); [Lev 15:22](../kjv/lev015.htm#022).md)
(See WASHING.)

<span id="002">**Abner**</span> Father of light; i.e., "enlightening",
the son of Ner and uncle of Saul. He was commander-in-chief of Saul's
army ([Sa1 14:50](../kjv/sa1014.htm#050.md); [Sa1
17:55](../kjv/sa1017.htm#055); [Sa1 20:25](../kjv/sa1020.htm#025).md). He
first introduced David to the court of Saul after the victory over
Goliath ([Sa1 17:57](../kjv/sa1017.htm#057).md). After the death of Saul,
David was made king over Judah, and reigned in Hebron. Among the other
tribes there was a feeling of hostility to Judah; and Abner, at the head
of Ephraim, fostered this hostility in the interest of the house of
Saul, whose son Ish-bosheth he caused to be proclaimed king ([Sa2
2:8](../kjv/sa2002.htm#008).md). A state of war existed between these two
kings. A battle fatal to Abner, who was the leader of Ish-boseth's army,
was fought with David's army under Joab at Gibeon ([Sa2
2:12](../kjv/sa2002.htm#012).md). Abner, escaping from the field, was
overtaken by Asahel, who was "light of foot as a wild roe," the brother
of Joab and Abishai, whom he thrust through with a back stroke of his
spear ([Sa2 2:18](../kjv/sa2002.htm#018).md). Being rebuked by Ish-bosheth
for the impropriety of taking to wife Rizpah, who had been a concubine
of King Saul, he found an excuse for going over to the side of David,
whom he now professed to regard as anointed by the Lord to reign over
all Israel. David received him favorably, and promised that he would
have command of the armies. At this time Joab was absent from Hebron,
but on his return he found what had happened. Abner had just left the
city; but Joab by a stratagem recalled him, and meeting him at the gate
of the city on his return, thrust him through with his sword ([Sa2
3:27](../kjv/sa2003.htm#027), [Sa2 3:31](../kjv/sa2003.htm#031.md); [Sa2
4:12](../kjv/sa2004.htm#012). Compare [Kg1 2:5](../kjv/kg1002.htm#005.md),
[Kg1 2:32](../kjv/kg1002.htm#032).md). David lamented in pathetic words the
death of Abner, "Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man
fallen this day in Israel?" ([Sa2 3:33](../kjv/sa2003.htm#033)..md)

<span id="003">**Abomination**</span> This word is used (1.) To express
the idea that the Egyptians considered themselves as defiled when they
ate with strangers ([Gen 43:32](../kjv/gen043.htm#032).md). The Jews
subsequently followed the same practice, holding it unlawful to eat or
drink with foreigners ([Joh 18:28](../kjv/joh018.htm#028.md); [Act
10:28](../kjv/act010.htm#028); [Act 11:3](../kjv/act011.htm#003)). (2..md)
Every shepherd was "an abomination" unto the Egyptians ([Gen
46:34](../kjv/gen046.htm#034).md). This aversion to shepherds, such as the
Hebrews, arose probably from the fact that Lower and Middle Egypt had
formerly been held in oppressive subjection by a tribe of nomad
shepherds (the Hyksos), who had only recently been expelled, and partly
also perhaps from this other fact that the Egyptians detested the
lawless habits of these wandering shepherds. (3.) Pharaoh was so moved
by the fourth plague, that while he refused the demand of Moses, he
offered a compromise, granting to the Israelites permission to hold
their festival and offer their sacrifices in Egypt. This permission
could not be accepted, because Moses said they would have to sacrifice
"the abomination of the Egyptians" ([Exo 8:26](../kjv/exo008.htm#026).md);
i.e., the cow or ox, which all the Egyptians held as sacred, and which
they regarded it as sacrilegious to kill. (4.) Daniel ([Dan
11:31](../kjv/dan011.htm#031).md), in that section of his prophecies which
is generally interpreted as referring to the fearful calamities that
were to fall on the Jews in the time of Antiochus Epiphanes, says, "And
they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate." Antiochus
Epiphanes caused an altar to be erected on the altar of burnt-offering,
on which sacrifices were offered to Jupiter Olympus. (Compare 1 Macc.
1:57). This was the abomination of the desolation of Jerusalem. The same
language is employed in [Dan 9:27](../kjv/dan009.htm#027.md) (compare [Mat
24:15](../kjv/mat024.htm#015).md), where the reference is probably to the
image-crowned standards which the Romans set up at the east gate of the
temple (A.D. 70), and to which they paid idolatrous honors. "Almost the
entire religion of the Roman camp consisted in worshipping the ensign,
swearing by the ensign, and in preferring the ensign before all other
gods." These ensigns were an "abomination" to the Jews, the "abomination
of desolation." This word is also used symbolically of sin in general
([Isa 66:3](../kjv/isa066.htm#003).md); an idol ([Isa
44:19](../kjv/isa044.htm#019).md); the ceremonies of the apostate Church of
Rome ([Rev 17:4](../kjv/rev017.htm#004).md); a detestable act ([Eze
22:11](../kjv/eze022.htm#011).md).

<span id="004">**Abram**</span> Exalted father

<span id="005">**Abraham**</span> Father of a multitude, son of Terah,
named ([Gen 11:27](../kjv/gen011.htm#027).md) before his older brothers
Nahor and Haran, because he was the heir of the promises. Till the age
of seventy, Abram sojourned among his kindred in his native country of
Chaldea. He then, with his father and his family and household, quitted
the city of Ur, in which he had hitherto dwelt, and went some 300 miles
north to Haran, where he abode fifteen years. The cause of his migration
was a call from God ([Act 7:2](../kjv/act007.htm#002).md). There is no
mention of this first call in the Old Testament; it is implied, however,
in Gen. 12. While they tarried at Haran, Terah died at the age of 205
years. Abram now received a second and more definite call, accompanied
by a promise from God ([Gen 12:1](../kjv/gen012.htm#001.md), [Gen
12:2](../kjv/gen012.htm#002).md); whereupon he took his departure, taking
his nephew Lot with him, "not knowing whither he went" ([Heb
11:8](../kjv/heb011.htm#008).md). He trusted implicitly to the guidance of
Him who had called him. Abram now, with a large household of probably a
thousand souls, entered on a migratory life, and dwelt in tents. Passing
along the valley of the Jabbok, in the land of Canaan, he formed his
first encampment at Sichem ([Gen 12:6](../kjv/gen012.htm#006).md), in the
vale or oak-grove of Moreh, between Ebal on the north and Gerizim on the
south. Here he received the great promise, "I will make of thee a great
nation," etc. ([Gen 12:2](../kjv/gen012.htm#002.md), [Gen
12:3](../kjv/gen012.htm#003), [Gen 12:7](../kjv/gen012.htm#007).md). This
promise comprehended not only temporal but also spiritual blessings. It
implied that he was the chosen ancestor of the great Deliverer whose
coming had been long ago predicted ([Gen 3:15](../kjv/gen003.htm#015).md).
Soon after this, for some reason not mentioned, he removed his tent to
the mountain district between Bethel, then called Luz, and Ai, towns
about two miles apart, where he built an altar to "Jehovah." He again
moved into the southern tract of Palestine, called by the Hebrews the
Negeb; and was at length, on account of a famine, compelled to go down
into Egypt. This took place in the time of the Hyksos, a Semitic race
which now held the Egyptians in bondage. Here occurred that case of
deception on the part of Abram which exposed him to the rebuke of
Pharaoh ([Gen 12:18](../kjv/gen012.htm#018).md). Sarai was restored to him;
and Pharaoh loaded him with presents, recommending him to withdraw from
the country. He returned to Canaan richer than when he left it, "in
cattle, in silver, and in gold" ([Gen 12:8](../kjv/gen012.htm#008.md); [Gen
13:2](../kjv/gen013.htm#002.md). Compare [Psa
105:13](../kjv/psa105.htm#013), [Psa 105:14](../kjv/psa105.htm#014).md).
The whole party then moved northward, and returned to their previous
station near Bethel. Here disputes arose between Lot's shepherds and
those of Abram about water and pasturage. Abram generously gave Lot his
choice of the pasture-ground. (Compare [Co1
6:7](../kjv/co1006.htm#007)..md) He chose the well-watered plain in which
Sodom was situated, and removed thither; and thus the uncle and nephew
were separated. Immediately after this Abram was cheered by a repetition
of the promises already made to him, and then removed to the plain or
"oakgrove" of Mamre, which is in Hebron. He finally settled here,
pitching his tent under a famous oak or terebinth tree, called "the oak
of Mamre" ([Gen 13:18](../kjv/gen013.htm#018).md). This was his third
resting-place in the land. Some fourteen years before this, while Abram
was still in Chaldea, Palestine had been invaded by Chedorlaomer, King
of Elam, who brought under tribute to him the five cities in the plain
to which Lot had removed. This tribute was felt by the inhabitants of
these cities to be a heavy burden, and after twelve years they revolted.
This brought upon them the vengeance of Chedorlaomer, who had in league
with him four other kings. He ravaged the whole country, plundering the
towns, and carrying the inhabitants away as slaves. Among those thus
treated was Lot. Hearing of the disaster that had fallen on his nephew,
Abram immediately gathered from his own household a band of 318 armed
men, and being joined by the Amoritish chiefs Mamre, Aner, and Eshcol,
he pursued after Chedorlaomer, and overtook him near the springs of the
Jordan. They attacked and routed his army, and pursued it over the range
of Anti-Libanus as far as to Hobah, near Damascus, and then returned,
bringing back all the spoils that had been carried away. Returning by
way of Salem, i.e., Jerusalem, the king of that place, Melchizedek, came
forth to meet them with refreshments. To him Abram presented a tenth of
the spoils, in recognition of his character as a priest of the most high
God ([Gen 14:18](../kjv/gen014.htm#018).md). In a recently-discovered
tablet, dated in the reign of the grandfather of Amraphel ([Gen
14:1](../kjv/gen014.htm#001).md), one of the witnesses is called "the
Amorite, the son of Abiramu," or Abram. Having returned to his home at
Mamre, the promises already made to him by God were repeated and
enlarged ([Gen 13:14](../kjv/gen013.htm#014).md). "The word of the Lord"
(an expression occurring here for the first time) "came to him" ([Gen
15:1](../kjv/gen015.htm#001).md). He now understood better the future that
lay before the nation that was to spring from him. Sarai, now
seventy-five years old, in her impatience, persuaded Abram to take
Hagar, her Egyptian maid, as a concubine, intending that whatever child
might be born should be reckoned as her own. Ishmael was accordingly
thus brought up, and was regarded as the heir of these promises (Gen.
16). When Ishmael was thirteen years old, God again revealed yet more
explicitly and fully his gracious purpose; and in token of the sure
fulfillment of that purpose the patriarch's name was now changed from
Abram to Abraham ([Gen 17:4](../kjv/gen017.htm#004.md), [Gen
17:5](../kjv/gen017.htm#005).md), and the rite of circumcision was
instituted as a sign of the covenant. It was then announced that the
heir to these covenant promises would be the son of Sarai, though she
was now ninety years old; and it was directed that his name should be
Isaac. At the same time, in commemoration of the promises, Sarai's name
was changed to Sarah. On that memorable day of God's thus revealing his
design, Abraham and his son Ishmael and all the males of his house were
circumcised (Gen. 17). Three months after this, as Abraham sat in his
tent door, he saw three men approaching. They accepted his proffered
hospitality, and, seated under an oak-tree, partook of the fare which
Abraham and Sarah provided. One of the three visitants was none other
than the Lord, and the other two were angels in the guise of men. The
Lord renewed on this occasion his promise of a son by Sarah, who was
rebuked for her unbelief. Abraham accompanied the three as they
proceeded on their journey. The two angels went on toward Sodom; while
the Lord tarried behind and talked with Abraham, making known to him the
destruction that was about to fall on that guilty city. The patriarch
interceded earnestly in behalf of the doomed city. But as not even ten
righteous persons were found in it, for whose sake the city would have
been spared, the threatened destruction fell upon it; and early next
morning Abraham saw the smoke of the fire that consumed it as the "smoke
of a furnace" (Gen. 19:1-28). After fifteen years' residence at Mamre,
Abraham moved southward, and pitched his tent among the Philistines,
near to Gerar. Here occurred that sad instance of prevarication on his
part in his relation to Abimelech the King (Gen. 20). (See ABIMELECH.)
Soon after this event, the patriarch left the vicinity of Gerar, and
moved down the fertile valley about 25 miles to Beer-sheba. It was
probably here that Isaac was born, Abraham being now an hundred years
old. A feeling of jealousy now arose between Sarah and Hagar, whose son,
Ishmael, was no longer to be regarded as Abraham's heir. Sarah insisted
that both Hagar and her son should be sent away. This was done, although
it was a hard trial to Abraham ([Gen 21:12](../kjv/gen021.htm#012).md).
(See HAGAR; ISHMAEL.) At this point there is a blank in the patriarch's
history of perhaps twenty-five years. These years of peace and happiness
were spent at Beer-sheba. The next time we see him his faith is put to a
severe test by the command that suddenly came to him to go and offer up
Isaac, the heir of all the promises, as a sacrifice on one of the
mountains of Moriah. His faith stood the test ([Heb
11:17](../kjv/heb011.htm#017).md). He proceeded in a spirit of unhesitating
obedience to carry out the command; and when about to slay his son, whom
he had laid on the altar, his uplifted hand was arrested by the angel of
Jehovah, and a ram, which was entangled in a thicket near at hand, was
seized and offered in his stead. From this circumstance that place was
called Jehovah-jireh, i.e., "The Lord will provide." The promises made
to Abraham were again confirmed (and this was the last recorded word of
God to the patriarch); and he descended the mount with his son, and
returned to his home at Beer-sheba ([Gen 22:19](../kjv/gen022.htm#019).md),
where he resided for some years, and then moved northward to Hebron.
Some years after this Sarah died at Hebron, being 127 years old. Abraham
acquired now the needful possession of a burying-place, the cave of
Machpelah, by purchase from the owner of it, Ephron the Hittite (Gen.
23); and there he buried Sarah. His next care was to provide a wife for
Isaac, and for this purpose he sent his steward, Eliezer, to Haran (or
Charran, [Act 7:2](../kjv/act007.htm#002).md), where his brother Nahor and
his family resided ([Gen 11:31](../kjv/gen011.htm#031).md). The result was
that Rebekah, the daughter of Nahor's son Bethuel, became the wife of
Isaac (Gen. 24). Abraham then himself took to wife Keturah, who became
the mother of six sons, whose descendants were afterwards known as the
"children of the east" ([Jdg 6:3](../kjv/jdg006.htm#003).md), and later as
"Saracens." At length all his wanderings came to an end. At the age of
175 years, 100 years after he had first entered the land of Canaan, he
died, and was buried in the old family burying-place at Machpelah ([Gen
25:7](../kjv/gen025.htm#007).md). The history of Abraham made a wide and
deep impression on the ancient world, and references to it are
interwoven in the religious traditions of almost all Eastern nations. He
is called "the friend of God" ([Jam 2:23](../kjv/jam002.htm#023).md),
"faithful Abraham" ([Gal 3:9](../kjv/gal003.htm#009).md), "the father of us
all" ([Rom 4:16](../kjv/rom004.htm#016).md).

<span id="006">**Abraham's Bosom**</span> ([Luk
16:22](../kjv/luk016.htm#022), [Luk 16:23](../kjv/luk016.htm#023).md)
refers to the custom of reclining on couches at table, which was
prevalent among the Jews, an arrangement which brought the head of one
person almost into the bosom of the one who sat or reclined above him.
To "be in Abraham's bosom" thus meant to enjoy happiness and rest ([Mat
8:11](../kjv/mat008.htm#011); [Luk 16:23](../kjv/luk016.htm#023).md) at the
banquet in Paradise. (See BANQUET; MEAL.)

<span id="007">**Abronah**</span> One of Israel's halting-places in the
desert ([Num 33:34](../kjv/num033.htm#034.md), [Num
33:35](../kjv/num033.htm#035).md), just before Ezion-gaber. In A.V.,
"Ebronah."

<span id="008">**Absalom**</span> Father of peace; i.e., "peaceful"
David's son by Maacah ([Sa2 3:3](../kjv/sa2003.htm#003.md); compare [Kg1
1:6](../kjv/kg1001.htm#006).md). He was noted for his personal beauty and
for the extra-ordinary profusion of the hair of his head ([Sa2
14:25](../kjv/sa2014.htm#025), [Sa2 14:26](../kjv/sa2014.htm#026).md). The
first public act of his life was the blood-revenge he executed against
Amnon, David's eldest son, who had basely wronged Absalom's sister
Tamar. This revenge was executed at the time of the festivities
connected with a great sheep-shearing at Baal-hazor. David's other sons
fled from the place in horror, and brought the tidings of the death of
Amnon to Jerusalem. Alarmed for the consequences of the act, Absalom
fled to his grandfather at Geshur, and there abode for three years ([Sa2
3:3](../kjv/sa2003.htm#003); 13:23-38.md). David mourned his absent son,
now branded with the guilt of fratricide. As the result of a stratagem
carried out by a woman of Tekoah, Joab received David's sanction to
invite Absalom back to Jerusalem. He returned accordingly, but two years
elapsed before his father admitted him into his presence ([Sa2
14:28](../kjv/sa2014.htm#028).md). Absalom was now probably the oldest
surviving son of David, and as he was of royal descent by his mother as
well as by his father, he began to aspire to the throne. His pretensions
were favoured by the people. By many arts he gained their affection; and
after his return from Geshur ([Sa2 15:7](../kjv/sa2015.htm#007.md); marg.,
R.V.) he went up to Hebron, the old capital of Judah, along with a great
body of the people, and there proclaimed himself king. The revolt was so
successful that David found it necessary to quit Jerusalem and flee to
Mahanaim, beyond Jordan; where upon Absalom returned to Jerusalem and
took possession of the throne without opposition. Ahithophel, who had
been David's chief counsellor, deserted him and joined Absalom, whose
chief counsellor he now became. Hushai also joined Absalom, but only for
the purpose of trying to counteract the counsels of Ahithophel, and so
to advantage David's cause. He was so far successful that by his advice,
which was preferred to that of Ahithophel, Absalom delayed to march an
army against his father, who thus gained time to prepare for the
defense. Absalom at length marched out against his father, whose army,
under the command of Joab, he encountered on the borders of the forest
of Ephraim. Twenty thousand of Absalom's army were slain in that fatal
battle, and the rest fled. Absalom fled on a swift mule; but his long
flowing hair, or more probably his head, was caught in the bough of an
oak, and there he was left suspended till Joab came up and pierced him
through with three darts. His body was then taken down and cast into a
pit dug in the forest, and a heap of stones was raised over his grave.
When the tidings of the result of that battle were brought to David, as
he sat impatiently at the gate of Mahanaim, and he was told that Absalom
had been slain, he gave way to the bitter lamentation: "O my son
Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O
Absalom, my son, my son!" ([Sa2 18:33](../kjv/sa2018.htm#033.md). Compare
[Exo 32:32](../kjv/exo032.htm#032); [Rom 9:3](../kjv/rom009.htm#003).md).
Absalom's three sons ([Sa2 14:27](../kjv/sa2014.htm#027.md); compare [Sa2
18:18](../kjv/sa2018.htm#018).md) had all died before him, so that he left
only a daughter, Tamar, who became the grandmother of Abijah.

<span id="009">**Acacia**</span> (Hebrew shittim) [Exo
25:5](../kjv/exo025.htm#005.md), R.V. probably the Acacia seyal (the
gum-arabic tree); called the "shittah" tree ([Isa
41:19](../kjv/isa041.htm#019).md). Its wood is called shittim wood ([Exo
26:15](../kjv/exo026.htm#015), [Exo 26:26](../kjv/exo026.htm#026.md); [Exo
25:10](../kjv/exo025.htm#010), [Exo 25:13](../kjv/exo025.htm#013.md), [Exo
25:23](../kjv/exo025.htm#023), [Exo 25:28](../kjv/exo025.htm#028.md),
etc.). This species (A. seyal) is like the hawthorn, a gnarled and
thorny tree. It yields the gum-arabic of commerce. It is found in
abundance in the Sinaitic peninsula.
