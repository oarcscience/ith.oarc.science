<span id="000">**Lemuel**</span> Dedicated to God, a king whom his
mother instructed ([Pro 31:1](../kjv/pro031.htm#001).md). Nothing is
certainly known concerning him. The rabbis identified him with Solomon.

<span id="001">**Lentiles**</span> (Heb. 'adashim ), a species of vetch
([Gen 25:34](../kjv/gen025.htm#034.md); [Sa2
23:11](../kjv/sa2023.htm#011).md), common in Syria under the name addas.
The red pottage made by Jacob was of lentils ([Gen
25:29](../kjv/gen025.htm#029).md). They were among the provisions brought
to David when he fled from Absalom ([Sa2 17:28](../kjv/sa2017.htm#028).md).
It is the Ervum lens of Linnaeus, a leguminous plant which produces a
fruit resembling a bean.

<span id="002">**Leopard**</span> (Heb. namer , so called because
spotted, [Sol 4:8](../kjv/sol004.htm#008).md), was that great spotted
feline which anciently infested the mountains of Syria, more
appropriately called a panther (Felis pardus). Its fierceness ([Isa
11:6](../kjv/isa011.htm#006).md), its watching for its prey ([Jer
5:6](../kjv/jer005.htm#006).md), its swiftness ([Hab
1:8](../kjv/hab001.htm#008).md), and the spots of its skin ([Jer
13:23](../kjv/jer013.htm#023).md), are noticed. This word is used
symbolically ([Dan 7:6](../kjv/dan007.htm#006.md); [Rev
13:2](../kjv/rev013.htm#002).md).

<span id="003">**Leprosy**</span> (Heb. tsara'ath , a "smiting," a
"stroke," because the disease was regarded as a direct providential
infliction). This name is from the Greek lepra , by which the Greek
physicians designated the disease from its scaliness. We have the
description of the disease, as well as the regulations connected with
it, in Lev. 13; 14; [Num 12:10](../kjv/num012.htm#010.md), etc. There were
reckoned six different circumstances under which it might develop
itself, (1.) without any apparent cause ([Lev
13:2](../kjv/lev013.htm#002)); (2..md) its reappearance ([Lev
13:9](../kjv/lev013.htm#009)); (3..md) from an inflammation ([Lev
13:18](../kjv/lev013.htm#018)); (4..md) on the head or chin ([Lev
13:29](../kjv/lev013.htm#029)); (5..md) in white polished spots ([Lev
13:38](../kjv/lev013.htm#038), [Lev 13:39](../kjv/lev013.htm#039)); (6..md)
at the back or in the front of the head ([Lev
13:40](../kjv/lev013.htm#040).md). Lepers were required to live outside the
camp or city ([Num 5:1](../kjv/num005.htm#001.md); [Num
12:10](../kjv/num012.htm#010), etc..md). This disease was regarded as an
awful punishment from the Lord ([Kg2 5:7](../kjv/kg2005.htm#007.md); [Ch2
26:20](../kjv/ch2026.htm#020)). (See MIRIAM; GEHAZI; UZZIAH..md) This
disease "begins with specks on the eyelids and on the palms, gradually
spreading over the body, bleaching the hair white wherever they appear,
crusting the affected parts with white scales, and causing terrible
sores and swellings. From the skin the disease eats inward to the bones,
rotting the whole body piecemeal." "In Christ's day no leper could live
in a walled town, though he might in an open village. But wherever he
was he was required to have his outer garment rent as a sign of deep
grief, to go bareheaded, and to cover his beard with his mantle, as if
in lamentation at his own virtual death. He had further to warn
passers-by to keep away from him, by calling out, 'Unclean! unclean!'
nor could he speak to any one, or receive or return a salutation, since
in the East this involves an embrace." That the disease was not
contagious is evident from the regulations regarding it ([Lev
13:12](../kjv/lev013.htm#012), [Lev 13:13](../kjv/lev013.htm#013.md), [Lev
13:36](../kjv/lev013.htm#036); [Kg2 5:1](../kjv/kg2005.htm#001).md).
Leprosy was "the outward and visible sign of the innermost spiritual
corruption; a meet emblem in its small beginnings, its gradual spread,
its internal disfigurement, its dissolution little by little of the
whole body, of that which corrupts, degrades, and defiles man's inner
nature, and renders him unmeet to enter the presence of a pure and holy
God" (Maclear's Handbook O.T). Our Lord cured lepers ([Mat
8:2](../kjv/mat008.htm#002), [Mat 8:3](../kjv/mat008.htm#003.md); [Mar
1:40](../kjv/mar001.htm#040).md). This divine power so manifested
illustrates his gracious dealings with men in curing the leprosy of the
soul the fatal taint of sin.

<span id="004">**Letter**</span> In [Rom 2:27](../kjv/rom002.htm#027.md),
[Rom 2:29](../kjv/rom002.htm#029.md) means the outward form. The "oldness
of the letter" ([Rom 7:6](../kjv/rom007.htm#006).md) is a phrase which
denotes the old way of literal outward obedience to the law as a system
of mere external rules of conduct. In [Co2 3:6](../kjv/co2003.htm#006.md),
"the letter" means the Mosaic law as a written law. (See WRITING.)

<span id="005">**Leummim**</span> Peoples; nations, the last mentioned
of the three sons of Dedan, and head of an Arabian tribe ([Gen
25:3](../kjv/gen025.htm#003).md).

<span id="006">**Levi**</span> Adhesion. (1.) The third son of Jacob by
Leah. The origin of the name is found in Leah's words ([Gen
29:34](../kjv/gen029.htm#034).md), "This time will my husband be joined
\[Heb. yillaveh \] unto me." He is mentioned as taking a prominent part
in avenging his sister Dinah ([Gen 34:25](../kjv/gen034.htm#025).md). He
and his three sons went down with Jacob ([Gen
46:11](../kjv/gen046.htm#011).md) into Egypt, where he died at the age of
one hundred and thirty-seven years ([Exo 6:16](../kjv/exo006.htm#016).md).
(2.) The father of Matthat, and son of Simeon, of the ancestors of
Christ ([Luk 3:29](../kjv/luk003.htm#029)). (3..md) [Luk
3:24](../kjv/luk003.htm#024). (4..md) One of the apostles, the son of
Alphaeus ([Mar 2:14](../kjv/mar002.htm#014.md); [Luk
5:27](../kjv/luk005.htm#027), [Luk 5:29](../kjv/luk005.htm#029).md), called
also Matthew ([Mat 9:9](../kjv/mat009.htm#009).md).

<span id="007">**Leviathan**</span> A transliterated Hebrew word
(livyathan), meaning "twisted," "coiled." In [Job
3:8](../kjv/job003.htm#008.md), Revised Version, and marg. of Authorized
Version, it denotes the dragon which, according to Eastern tradition, is
an enemy of light; in [Job 41:1](../kjv/job041.htm#001.md) the crocodile is
meant; in [Psa 104:26](../kjv/psa104.htm#026.md) it "denotes any large
animal that moves by writhing or wriggling the body, the whale, the
monsters of the deep." This word is also used figuratively for a cruel
enemy, as some think "the Egyptian host, crushed by the divine power,
and cast on the shores of the Red Sea" ([Psa
74:14](../kjv/psa074.htm#014).md). As used in [Isa
27:1](../kjv/isa027.htm#001.md), "leviathan the piercing \[R.V. 'swift'\]
serpent, even leviathan that crooked \[R.V. marg. 'winding'\] serpent,"
the word may probably denote the two empires, the Assyrian and the
Babylonian.

<span id="008">**Levirate Law**</span> From Latin levir , "a husband's
brother," the name of an ancient custom ordained by Moses, by which,
when an Israelite died without issue, his surviving brother was required
to marry the widow, so as to continue his brother's family through the
son that might be born of that marriage ([Gen
38:8](../kjv/gen038.htm#008); [Deu 25:5](../kjv/deu025.htm#005.md); compare
Ruth 3; [Rut 4:10](../kjv/rut004.htm#010).md). Its object was "to raise up
seed to the departed brother."

<span id="009">**Levite**</span> A descendant of the tribe of Levi ([Exo
6:25](../kjv/exo006.htm#025); [Lev 25:32](../kjv/lev025.htm#032.md); [Num
35:2](../kjv/num035.htm#002); [Jos 21:3](../kjv/jos021.htm#003.md), [Jos
21:41](../kjv/jos021.htm#041).md). This name is, however, generally used as
the title of that portion of the tribe which was set apart for the
subordinate offices of the sanctuary service ([Kg1
8:4](../kjv/kg1008.htm#004); [Ezr 2:70](../kjv/ezr002.htm#070).md), as
assistants to the priests. When the Israelites left Egypt, the ancient
manner of worship was still observed by them, the eldest son of each
house inheriting the priest's office. At Sinai the first change in this
ancient practice was made. A hereditary priesthood in the family of
Aaron was then instituted ([Exo 28:1](../kjv/exo028.htm#001).md). But it
was not till that terrible scene in connection with the sin of the
golden calf that the tribe of Levi stood apart and began to occupy a
distinct position (Ex. 32). The religious primogeniture was then
conferred on this tribe, which henceforth was devoted to the service of
the sanctuary ([Num 3:11](../kjv/num003.htm#011).md). They were selected
for this purpose because of their zeal for the glory of God ([Exo
32:26](../kjv/exo032.htm#026).md), and because, as the tribe to which Moses
and Aaron belonged, they would naturally stand by the lawgiver in his
work. The Levitical order consisted of all the descendants of Levi's
three sons, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; whilst Aaron, Amram's son
(Amram, son of Kohat), and his issue constituted the priestly order. The
age and qualification for Levitical service are specified in [Num
4:3](../kjv/num004.htm#003), [Num 4:23](../kjv/num004.htm#023.md), [Num
4:30](../kjv/num004.htm#030), [Num 4:39](../kjv/num004.htm#039.md), [Num
4:43](../kjv/num004.htm#043), [Num 4:47](../kjv/num004.htm#047.md). They
were not included among the armies of Israel ([Num
1:47](../kjv/num001.htm#047); [Num 2:33](../kjv/num002.htm#033.md); [Num
26:62](../kjv/num026.htm#062).md), but were reckoned by themselves. They
were the special guardians of the tabernacle ([Num
1:51](../kjv/num001.htm#051); [Num 18:22](../kjv/num018.htm#022).md). The
Gershonites pitched their tents on the west of the tabernacle ([Num
3:23](../kjv/num003.htm#023).md), the Kohathites on the south ([Num
3:29](../kjv/num003.htm#029).md), the Merarites on the north ([Num
3:35](../kjv/num003.htm#035).md), and the priests on the east ([Num
3:38](../kjv/num003.htm#038).md). It was their duty to move the tent and
carry the parts of the sacred structure from place to place. They were
given to Aaron and his sons the priests to wait upon them and do work
for them at the sanctuary services ([Num 8:19](../kjv/num008.htm#019.md);
[Num 18:2](../kjv/num018.htm#002).md). As being wholly consecrated to the
service of the Lord, they had no territorial possessions. Jehovah was
their inheritance ([Num 18:20](../kjv/num018.htm#020.md); [Num
26:62](../kjv/num026.htm#062); [Deu 10:9](../kjv/deu010.htm#009.md); [Deu
18:1](../kjv/deu018.htm#001), [Deu 18:2](../kjv/deu018.htm#002).md), and
for their support it was ordained that they should receive from the
other tribes the tithes of the produce of the land. Forty-eight cities
also were assigned to them, thirteen of which were for the priests "to
dwell in", i.e., along with their other inhabitants. Along with their
dwellings they had "suburbs", i.e., "commons", for their herds and
flocks, and also fields and vineyards ([Num
35:2](../kjv/num035.htm#002).md). Nine of these cities were in Judah, three
in Naphtali, and four in each of the other tribes (Josh. 21). Six of the
Levitical cities were set apart as "cities of refuge" (q.v.). Thus the
Levites were scattered among the tribes to keep alive among them the
knowledge and service of God. (See PRIEST.)
