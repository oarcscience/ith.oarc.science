<span id="000">**Ahijah**</span> Brother (i.e., "friend") of Jehovah.
(1.) One of the sons of Bela ([Ch1 8:7](../kjv/ch1008.htm#007), R.V..md).
In A.V. called "Ahiah." (2.) One of the five sons of Jerahmeel, who was
great-grandson of Judah ([Ch1 2:25](../kjv/ch1002.htm#025)). (3..md) Son of
Ahitub ([Sa1 14:3](../kjv/sa1014.htm#003.md), [Sa1
14:18](../kjv/sa1014.htm#018).md), Ichabod's brother; the same probably as
Ahimelech, who was high priest at Nob in the reign of Saul ([Sa1
22:11](../kjv/sa1022.htm#011).md). Some, however, suppose that Ahimelech
was the brother of Ahijah, and that they both officiated as high
priests, Ahijah at Gibeah or Kirjath-jearim, and Ahimelech at Nob. (4.)
A Pelonite, one of David's heroes ([Ch1 11:36](../kjv/ch1011.htm#036).md);
called also Eliam ([Sa2 23:34](../kjv/sa2023.htm#034)). (5..md) A Levite
having charge of the sacred treasury in the temple ([Ch1
26:20](../kjv/ch1026.htm#020)). (6..md) One of Solomon's secretaries ([Kg1
4:3](../kjv/kg1004.htm#003)). (7..md) A prophet of Shiloh ([Kg1
11:29](../kjv/kg1011.htm#029); [Kg1 14:2](../kjv/kg1014.htm#002).md),
called the "Shilonite," in the days of Rehoboam. We have on record two
of his remarkable prophecies, [Kg1 11:31](../kjv/kg1011.htm#031.md),
announcing the rending of the ten tribes from Solomon; and [Kg1
14:6](../kjv/kg1014.htm#006.md), delivered to Jeroboam's wife, foretelling
the death of Abijah the king's son, the destruction of Jeroboam's house,
and the captivity of Israel "beyond the river." Jeroboam bears testimony
to the high esteem in which he was held as a prophet of God ([Kg1
14:2](../kjv/kg1014.htm#002), [Kg1 14:3](../kjv/kg1014.htm#003).md).

<span id="001">**Ahikam**</span> Brother of support = helper, one of the
five whom Josiah sent to consult the prophetess Huldah in connection
with the discovery of the book of the law ([Kg2
22:12](../kjv/kg2022.htm#012); [Ch2 34:20](../kjv/ch2034.htm#020).md). He
was the son of Shaphan, the royal secretary, and the father of Gedaliah,
governor of Judea after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians
([Kg2 25:22](../kjv/kg2025.htm#022); [Jer 40:5](../kjv/jer040.htm#005.md);
[Jer 43:6](../kjv/jer043.htm#006).md). On one occasion he protected
Jeremiah against the fury of Jehoiakim ([Jer
26:24](../kjv/jer026.htm#024).md). It was in the chamber of another son
(Germariah) of Shaphan that Baruch read in the ears of all the people
Jeremiah's roll.

<span id="002">**Ahimaaz**</span> Brother of anger = irascible. (1.) The
father Ahinoam, the wife of Saul ([Sa1 14:50](../kjv/sa1014.htm#050).md).
(2.) The son and successor of Zadok in the office of high priest ([Ch1
6:8](../kjv/ch1006.htm#008), [Ch1 6:53](../kjv/ch1006.htm#053).md). On the
occasion of the revolt of Absalom he remained faithful to David, and was
of service to him in conveying to him tidings of the proceedings of
Absalom in Jerusalem ([Sa2 15:24](../kjv/sa2015.htm#024.md); [Sa2
17:15](../kjv/sa2017.htm#015).md). He was swift of foot, and was the first
to carry to David tidings of the defeat of Absalom, although he
refrained, from delicacy of feeling, from telling him of his death ([Sa2
18:19](../kjv/sa2018.htm#019).md).

<span id="003">**Ahiman**</span> Brother of a gift = liberal. (1.) One
of the three giant Anakim brothers whom Caleb and the spies saw in Mount
Hebron ([Num 13:22](../kjv/num013.htm#022).md) when they went in to explore
the land. They were afterwards driven out and slain ([Jos
15:14](../kjv/jos015.htm#014); [Jdg 1:10](../kjv/jdg001.htm#010)). (2..md)
One of the guardians of the temple after the Exile ([Ch1
9:17](../kjv/ch1009.htm#017).md).

<span id="004">**Ahimelech**</span> Brother of the king, the son of
Ahitub and father of Abiathar ([Sa1 22:20](../kjv/sa1022.htm#020).md). He
descended from Eli in the line of Ithamar. In [Ch1
18:16](../kjv/ch1018.htm#016.md) he is called Abimelech, and is probably
the same as Ahiah ([Sa1 14:3](../kjv/sa1014.htm#003.md), [Sa1
14:18](../kjv/sa1014.htm#018).md). He was the twelfth high priest, and
officiated at Nob, where he was visited by David (to whom and his
companions he gave five loaves of the showbread) when he fled from Saul
([Sa1 21:1](../kjv/sa1021.htm#001).md). He was summoned into Saul's
presence, and accused, on the information of Doeg the Edomite, of
disloyalty because of his kindness to David; whereupon the king
commanded that he, with the other priests who stood beside him (86 in
all), should be put to death. This sentence was carried into execution
by Doeg in the most cruel manner ([Sa1 22:9](../kjv/sa1022.htm#009).md).
Possibly Abiathar had a son also called Ahimelech, or the two names, as
some think, may have been accidentally transposed in [Sa2
8:17](../kjv/sa2008.htm#017); [Ch1 18:16](../kjv/ch1018.htm#016.md), marg.;
[Ch1 24:3](../kjv/ch1024.htm#003), [Ch1 24:6](../kjv/ch1024.htm#006.md),
[Ch1 24:31](../kjv/ch1024.htm#031.md).

<span id="005">**Ahinadab**</span> Brother of liberality = liberal one
of the twelve commissariat officers appointed by Solomon in so many
districts of his kingdom to raise supplies by monthly rotation for his
household. He was appointed to the district of Mahanaim ([Kg1
4:14](../kjv/kg1004.htm#014).md), east of Jordan.

<span id="006">**Ahinoam**</span> Brother of pleasantness = pleasant.
(1.) The daughter of Ahimaaz, and wife of Saul ([Sa1
14:50](../kjv/sa1014.htm#050)). (2..md) A Jezreelitess, the first wife of
David ([Sa1 25:43](../kjv/sa1025.htm#043.md); [Sa1
27:3](../kjv/sa1027.htm#003).md). She was the mother of Amnon ([Sa2
3:2](../kjv/sa2003.htm#002)). (See [Sa1 30:5](../kjv/sa1030.htm#005.md),
[Sa1 30:18](../kjv/sa1030.htm#018); [Sa2 2:2](../kjv/sa2002.htm#002)..md)

<span id="007">**Ahio**</span> Brotherly. (1.) One of the sons of Beriah
([Ch1 8:14](../kjv/ch1008.htm#014)). (2..md) One of the sons of Jehiel the
Gibeonite ([Ch1 8:31](../kjv/ch1008.htm#031.md); [Ch1
9:37](../kjv/ch1009.htm#037)). (3..md) One of the sons of Abinadab the
Levite. While Uzzah went by the side of the ark, he walked before it
guiding the oxen which drew the cart on which it was carried, after
having brought it from his father's house in Gibeah ([Ch1
13:7](../kjv/ch1013.htm#007); [Sa2 6:3](../kjv/sa2006.htm#003.md), [Sa2
6:4](../kjv/sa2006.htm#004).md).

<span id="008">**Ahira**</span> Brother of evil = unlucky, or my brother
is friend, chief of the tribe of Naphtali at the Exodus ([Num
1:15](../kjv/num001.htm#015); [Num 2:29](../kjv/num002.htm#029).md).

<span id="009">**Ahishar**</span> Brother of song = singer, the officer
who was "over the household" of Solomon ([Kg1
4:6](../kjv/kg1004.htm#006).md).
