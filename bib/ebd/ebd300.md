<span id="000">**Prayer**</span> Is converse with God; the intercourse
of the soul with God, not in contemplation or meditation, but in direct
address to him. Prayer may be oral or mental, occasional or constant,
ejaculatory or formal. It is a "beseeching the Lord" ([Exo
32:11](../kjv/exo032.htm#011)); "pouring out the soul before the Lord"
([Sa1 1:15](../kjv/sa1001.htm#015)); "praying and crying to heaven"
([Ch2 32:20](../kjv/ch2032.htm#020)); "seeking unto God and making
supplication" ([Job 8:5](../kjv/job008.htm#005)); "drawing near to God"
([Psa 73:28](../kjv/psa073.htm#028)); "bowing the knees" ([Eph
3:14](../kjv/eph003.htm#014)). Prayer presupposes a belief in the
personality of God, his ability and willingness to hold intercourse with
us, his personal control of all things and of all his creatures and all
their actions. Acceptable prayer must be sincere ([Heb
10:22](../kjv/heb010.htm#022)), offered with reverence and godly fear,
with a humble sense of our own insignificance as creatures and of our
own unworthiness as sinners, with earnest importunity, and with
unhesitating submission to the divine will. Prayer must also be offered
in the faith that God is, and is the hearer and answerer of prayer, and
that he will fulfill his word, "Ask, and ye shall receive" ([Mat
7:7](../kjv/mat007.htm#007), [Mat 7:8](../kjv/mat007.htm#008); [Mat
21:22](../kjv/mat021.htm#022); [Mar 11:24](../kjv/mar011.htm#024); [Joh
14:13](../kjv/joh014.htm#013), [Joh 14:14](../kjv/joh014.htm#014)), and
in the name of Christ ([Joh 16:23](../kjv/joh016.htm#023), [Joh
16:24](../kjv/joh016.htm#024); [Joh 15:16](../kjv/joh015.htm#016); [Eph
2:18](../kjv/eph002.htm#018); [Eph 5:20](../kjv/eph005.htm#020); [Col
3:17](../kjv/col003.htm#017); [Pe1 2:5](../kjv/pe1002.htm#005)). Prayer
is of different kinds, secret ([Mat 6:6](../kjv/mat006.htm#006));
social, as family prayers, and in social worship; and public, in the
service of the sanctuary. Intercessory prayer is enjoined ([Num
6:23](../kjv/num006.htm#023); [Job 42:8](../kjv/job042.htm#008); [Isa
62:6](../kjv/isa062.htm#006); [Psa 122:6](../kjv/psa122.htm#006); [Ti1
2:1](../kjv/ti1002.htm#001); [Jam 5:14](../kjv/jam005.htm#014)), and
there are many instances on record of answers having been given to such
prayers, e.g., of Abraham ([Gen 17:18](../kjv/gen017.htm#018), [Gen
17:20](../kjv/gen017.htm#020); [Gen 18:23](../kjv/gen018.htm#023); [Gen
20:7](../kjv/gen020.htm#007), [Gen 20:17](../kjv/gen020.htm#017), [Gen
20:18](../kjv/gen020.htm#018)), of Moses for Pharaoh ([Exo
8:12](../kjv/exo008.htm#012), [Exo 8:13](../kjv/exo008.htm#013), [Exo
8:30](../kjv/exo008.htm#030), [Exo 8:31](../kjv/exo008.htm#031); [Exo
9:33](../kjv/exo009.htm#033)), for the Israelites ([Exo
17:11](../kjv/exo017.htm#011), [Exo 17:13](../kjv/exo017.htm#013); [Exo
32:11](../kjv/exo032.htm#011), [Exo 32:31](../kjv/exo032.htm#031); [Num
21:7](../kjv/num021.htm#007), [Num 21:8](../kjv/num021.htm#008); [Deu
9:18](../kjv/deu009.htm#018), [Deu 9:19](../kjv/deu009.htm#019), [Deu
9:25](../kjv/deu009.htm#025)), for Miriam ([Num
12:13](../kjv/num012.htm#013)), for Aaron ([Deu
9:20](../kjv/deu009.htm#020)), of Samuel ([Sa1
7:5](../kjv/sa1007.htm#005)), of Solomon (1 Kings 8; 2 Chr. 6), Elijah
([Kg1 17:20](../kjv/kg1017.htm#020)), Elisha ([Kg2
4:33](../kjv/kg2004.htm#033)), Isaiah (2 Kings 19), Jeremiah ([Jer
42:2](../kjv/jer042.htm#002)), Peter ([Act
9:40](../kjv/act009.htm#040)), the church ([Act
12:5](../kjv/act012.htm#005)), Paul ([Act 28:8](../kjv/act028.htm#008)).
No rules are anywhere in Scripture laid down for the manner of prayer or
the attitude to be assumed by the suppliant. There is mention made of
kneeling in prayer ([Kg1 8:54](../kjv/kg1008.htm#054); [Ch2
6:13](../kjv/ch2006.htm#013); [Psa 95:6](../kjv/psa095.htm#006); [Isa
45:23](../kjv/isa045.htm#023); [Luk 22:41](../kjv/luk022.htm#041); [Act
7:60](../kjv/act007.htm#060); [Act 9:40](../kjv/act009.htm#040); [Eph
3:14](../kjv/eph003.htm#014), etc.); of bowing and falling prostrate
([Gen 24:26](../kjv/gen024.htm#026), [Gen 24:52](../kjv/gen024.htm#052);
[Exo 4:31](../kjv/exo004.htm#031); [Exo 12:27](../kjv/exo012.htm#027);
[Mat 26:39](../kjv/mat026.htm#039); [Mar 14:35](../kjv/mar014.htm#035),
etc.); of spreading out the hands ([Kg1 8:22](../kjv/kg1008.htm#022),
[Kg1 8:38](../kjv/kg1008.htm#038), [Kg1 8:54](../kjv/kg1008.htm#054);
[Psa 28:2](../kjv/psa028.htm#002); [Psa 63:4](../kjv/psa063.htm#004);
[Psa 88:9](../kjv/psa088.htm#009); [Ti1 2:8](../kjv/ti1002.htm#008),
etc.); and of standing ([Sa1 1:26](../kjv/sa1001.htm#026); [Kg1
8:14](../kjv/kg1008.htm#014), [Kg1 8:55](../kjv/kg1008.htm#055); [Ch2
20:9](../kjv/ch2020.htm#009); [Mar 11:25](../kjv/mar011.htm#025); [Luk
18:11](../kjv/luk018.htm#011), [Luk 18:13](../kjv/luk018.htm#013)). If
we except the "Lord's Prayer" ([Mat 6:9](../kjv/mat006.htm#009)), which
is, however, rather a model or pattern of prayer than a set prayer to be
offered up, we have no special form of prayer for general use given us
in Scripture. Prayer is frequently enjoined in Scripture ([Exo
22:23](../kjv/exo022.htm#023), [Exo 22:27](../kjv/exo022.htm#027); [Kg1
3:5](../kjv/kg1003.htm#005); [Ch2 7:14](../kjv/ch2007.htm#014); [Psa
37:4](../kjv/psa037.htm#004); [Isa 55:6](../kjv/isa055.htm#006); [Joe
2:32](../kjv/joe002.htm#032); [Eze 36:37](../kjv/eze036.htm#037), etc.),
and we have very many testimonies that it has been answered ([Psa
3:4](../kjv/psa003.htm#004); [Psa 4:1](../kjv/psa004.htm#001); [Psa
6:8](../kjv/psa006.htm#008); [Psa 18:6](../kjv/psa018.htm#006); [Psa
28:6](../kjv/psa028.htm#006); [Psa 30:2](../kjv/psa030.htm#002); [Psa
34:4](../kjv/psa034.htm#004); [Psa 118:5](../kjv/psa118.htm#005); [Jam
5:16](../kjv/jam005.htm#016), etc.). "Abraham's servant prayed to God,
and God directed him to the person who should be wife to his master's
son and heir ([Gen 24:10](../kjv/gen024.htm#010)). "Jacob prayed to God,
and God inclined the heart of his irritated brother, so that they met in
peace and friendship ([Gen 32:24](../kjv/gen032.htm#024); [Gen
33:1](../kjv/gen033.htm#001)). "Samson prayed to God, and God showed him
a well where he quenched his burning thirst, and so lived to judge
Israel ([Jdg 15:18](../kjv/jdg015.htm#018)). "David prayed, and God
defeated the counsel of Ahithophel ([Sa2 15:31](../kjv/sa2015.htm#031);
[Sa2 16:20](../kjv/sa2016.htm#020); [Sa2 17:14](../kjv/sa2017.htm#014)).
"Daniel prayed, and God enabled him both to tell Nebuchadnezzar his
dream and to give the interpretation of it ([Dan
2:16](../kjv/dan002.htm#016)). "Nehemiah prayed, and God inclined the
heart of the king of Persia to grant him leave of absence to visit and
rebuild Jerusalem ([Neh 1:11](../kjv/neh001.htm#011); [Neh
2:1](../kjv/neh002.htm#001)). "Esther and Mordecai prayed, and God
defeated the purpose of Haman, and saved the Jews from destruction ([Est
4:15](../kjv/est004.htm#015); [Est 6:7](../kjv/est006.htm#007), [Est
6:8](../kjv/est006.htm#008)). "The believers in Jerusalem prayed, and
God opened the prison doors and set Peter at liberty, when Herod had
resolved upon his death ([Act 12:1](../kjv/act012.htm#001)). "Paul
prayed that the thorn in the flesh might be removed, and his prayer
brought a large increase of spiritual strength, while the thorn perhaps
remained ([Co2 12:7](../kjv/co2012.htm#007)). "Prayer is like the dove
that Noah sent forth, which blessed him not only when it returned with
an olive-leaf in its mouth, but when it never returned at all."
Robinson's Job.

<span id="001">**Predestination**</span> This word is properly used only
with reference to God's plan or purpose of salvation. The Greek word
rendered "predestinate" is found only in these six passages, [Act
4:28](../kjv/act004.htm#028); [Rom 8:29](../kjv/rom008.htm#029), [Rom
8:30](../kjv/rom008.htm#030); [Co1 2:7](../kjv/co1002.htm#007); [Eph
1:5](../kjv/eph001.htm#005), [Eph 1:11](../kjv/eph001.htm#011); and in
all of them it has the same meaning. They teach that the eternal,
sovereign, immutable, and unconditional decree or "determinate purpose"
of God governs all events. This doctrine of predestination or election
is beset with many difficulties. It belongs to the "secret things" of
God. But if we take the revealed word of God as our guide, we must
accept this doctrine with all its mysteriousness, and settle all our
questionings in the humble, devout acknowledgment, "Even so, Father: for
so it seemed good in thy sight." For the teaching of Scripture on this
subject let the following passages be examined in addition to those
referred to above; [Gen 21:12](../kjv/gen021.htm#012); [Exo
9:16](../kjv/exo009.htm#016); [Exo 33:19](../kjv/exo033.htm#019); [Deu
10:15](../kjv/deu010.htm#015); [Deu 32:8](../kjv/deu032.htm#008); [Jos
11:20](../kjv/jos011.htm#020); [Sa1 12:22](../kjv/sa1012.htm#022); [Ch2
6:6](../kjv/ch2006.htm#006); [Psa 33:12](../kjv/psa033.htm#012); [Psa
65:4](../kjv/psa065.htm#004); [Psa 78:68](../kjv/psa078.htm#068); [Psa
135:4](../kjv/psa135.htm#004); [Isa 41:1](../kjv/isa041.htm#001); [Jer
1:5](../kjv/jer001.htm#005); [Mar 13:20](../kjv/mar013.htm#020); [Luk
22:22](../kjv/luk022.htm#022); [Joh 6:37](../kjv/joh006.htm#037); [Joh
15:16](../kjv/joh015.htm#016); [Joh 17:2](../kjv/joh017.htm#002), [Joh
17:6](../kjv/joh017.htm#006), [Joh 17:9](../kjv/joh017.htm#009); [Act
2:28](../kjv/act002.htm#028); [Act 3:18](../kjv/act003.htm#018); [Act
4:28](../kjv/act004.htm#028); [Act 13:48](../kjv/act013.htm#048); [Act
17:26](../kjv/act017.htm#026); [Rom 9:11](../kjv/rom009.htm#011), [Rom
9:18](../kjv/rom009.htm#018), [Rom 9:21](../kjv/rom009.htm#021); [Rom
11:5](../kjv/rom011.htm#005); [Eph 3:11](../kjv/eph003.htm#011); [Th1
1:4](../kjv/th1001.htm#004); [Th2 2:13](../kjv/th2002.htm#013); [Ti2
1:9](../kjv/ti2001.htm#009); [Tit 1:2](../kjv/tit001.htm#002); [Pe1
1:2](../kjv/pe1001.htm#002). (See DECREES OF GOD; ELECTION.) Hodge has
well remarked that, "rightly understood, this doctrine (1.) exalts the
majesty and absolute sovereignty of God, while it illustrates the riches
of his free grace and his just displeasure with sin. (2.) It enforces
upon us the essential truth that salvation is entirely of grace. That no
one can either complain if passed over, or boast himself if saved. (3.)
It brings the inquirer to absolute self-despair and the cordial embrace
of the free offer of Christ. (4.) In the case of the believer who has
the witness in himself, this doctrine at once deepens his humility and
elevates his confidence to the full assurance of hope" (Outlines).

<span id="002">**Presidents**</span> Three presidents are mentioned, of
whom Daniel was the first ([Dan 6:2](../kjv/dan006.htm#002)). The name
in the original is sarkhin, probably a Persian word meaning perfects or
ministers.

<span id="003">**Priest**</span> The Heb. kohen , Gr. hierus , Lat.
sacerdos , always denote one who offers sacrifices. At first every man
was his own priest, and presented his own sacrifices before God.
Afterwards that office devolved on the head of the family, as in the
cases of Noah ([Gen 8:20](../kjv/gen008.htm#020)), Abraham ([Gen
12:7](../kjv/gen012.htm#007); [Gen 13:4](../kjv/gen013.htm#004)), Isaac
([Gen 26:25](../kjv/gen026.htm#025)), Jacob ([Gen
31:54](../kjv/gen031.htm#054)), and Job ([Job
1:5](../kjv/job001.htm#005)). The name first occurs as applied to
Melchizedek ([Gen 14:18](../kjv/gen014.htm#018)). Under the Levitical
arrangements the office of the priesthood was limited to the tribe of
Levi, and to only one family of that tribe, the family of Aaron. Certain
laws respecting the qualifications of priests are given in [Lev
21:16](../kjv/lev021.htm#016). There are ordinances also regarding the
priests' dress ([Exo 28:40](../kjv/exo028.htm#040)) and the manner of
their consecration to the office (Ex. 29:1-37). Their duties were
manifold ([Exo 27:20](../kjv/exo027.htm#020), [Exo
27:21](../kjv/exo027.htm#021); [Exo 29:38](../kjv/exo029.htm#038); [Lev
6:12](../kjv/lev006.htm#012); [Lev 10:11](../kjv/lev010.htm#011); [Lev
24:8](../kjv/lev024.htm#008); [Num 10:1](../kjv/num010.htm#001); [Deu
17:8](../kjv/deu017.htm#008); [Deu 33:10](../kjv/deu033.htm#010); [Mal
2:7](../kjv/mal002.htm#007)). They represented the people before God,
and offered the various sacrifices prescribed in the law. In the time of
David the priests were divided into twenty-four courses or classes ([Ch1
24:7](../kjv/ch1024.htm#007)). This number was retained after the
Captivity ([Ezr 2:36](../kjv/ezr002.htm#036); [Neh
7:39](../kjv/neh007.htm#039)). "The priests were not distributed over
the country, but lived together in certain cities \[forty-eight in
number, of which six were cities of refuge, q.v.\], which had been
assigned to their use. From thence they went up by turns to minister in
the temple at Jerusalem. Thus the religious instruction of the people in
the country generally was left to the heads of families, until the
establishment of synagogues, an event which did not take place till the
return from the Captivity, and which was the main source of the freedom
from idolatry that became as marked a feature of the Jewish people
thenceforward as its practice had been hitherto their great national
sin." The whole priestly system of the Jews was typical. It was a shadow
of which the body is Christ. The priests all prefigured the great Priest
who offered "one sacrifice for sins" "once for all" ([Heb
10:10](../kjv/heb010.htm#010), [Heb 10:12](../kjv/heb010.htm#012)).
There is now no human priesthood. (See [Heb 1:1](../kjv/heb001.htm#001)
and throughout.) The term "priest" is indeed applied to believers ([Pe1
2:9](../kjv/pe1002.htm#009); [Rev 1:6](../kjv/rev001.htm#006)), but in
these cases it implies no sacerdotal functions. All true believers are
now "kings and priests unto God." As priests they have free access into
the holiest of all, and offer up the sacrifices of praise and
thanksgiving, and the sacrifices of grateful service from day to day.

<span id="004">**Prince**</span> The title generally applied to the
chief men of the state. The "princes of the provinces" ([Kg1
20:14](../kjv/kg1020.htm#014)) were the governors or lord-lieutenants of
the provinces. So also the "princes" mentioned in [Dan
6:1](../kjv/dan006.htm#001), [Dan 6:3](../kjv/dan006.htm#003), [Dan
6:4](../kjv/dan006.htm#004), [Dan 6:6](../kjv/dan006.htm#006), [Dan
6:7](../kjv/dan006.htm#007) were the officers who administered the
affairs of the provinces; the "satraps" (as rendered in R.V.). These are
also called "lieutenants" ([Est 3:12](../kjv/est003.htm#012); [Est
8:9](../kjv/est008.htm#009); R.V., "satraps"). The promised Saviour is
called by Daniel ([Dan 9:25](../kjv/dan009.htm#025)) "Messiah the
Prince" (Heb. nagid ); compare [Act 3:15](../kjv/act003.htm#015); [Act
5:31](../kjv/act005.htm#031). The angel Micheal is called ([Dan
12:1](../kjv/dan012.htm#001)) a "prince" (Heb. sar , whence "Sarah," the
"princes").

<span id="005">**Priscilla**</span> The wife of Aquila ([Act
18:2](../kjv/act018.htm#002)), who is never mentioned without her. Her
name sometimes takes the precedence of his ([Rom
16:3](../kjv/rom016.htm#003); [Ti2 4:19](../kjv/ti2004.htm#019)). She
took part with Aquila (q.v.) in instructing Apollos ([Act
18:26](../kjv/act018.htm#026)).

<span id="006">**Prison**</span> The first occasion on which we read of
a prison is in the history of Joseph in Egypt. Then Potiphar, "Joseph's
master, took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's
prisoners were bound" ([Gen 39:20](../kjv/gen039.htm#020)). The Heb.
word here used ( sohar ) means properly a round tower or fortress. It
seems to have been a part of Potiphar's house, a place in which state
prisoners were kept. The Mosaic law made no provision for imprisonment
as a punishment. In the wilderness two persons were "put in ward" ([Lev
24:12](../kjv/lev024.htm#012); [Num 15:34](../kjv/num015.htm#034)), but
it was only till the mind of God concerning them should be ascertained.
Prisons and prisoners are mentioned in the book of Psalms ([Psa
69:33](../kjv/psa069.htm#033); [Psa 79:11](../kjv/psa079.htm#011); [Psa
142:7](../kjv/psa142.htm#007)). Samson was confined in a Philistine
prison ([Jdg 16:21](../kjv/jdg016.htm#021), [Jdg
16:25](../kjv/jdg016.htm#025)). In the subsequent history of Israel
frequent references are made to prisons ([Kg1
22:27](../kjv/kg1022.htm#027); [Kg2 17:4](../kjv/kg2017.htm#004); [Kg2
25:27](../kjv/kg2025.htm#027), [Kg2 25:29](../kjv/kg2025.htm#029); [Ch2
16:10](../kjv/ch2016.htm#010); [Isa 42:7](../kjv/isa042.htm#007); [Jer
32:2](../kjv/jer032.htm#002)). Prisons seem to have been common in New
Testament times ([Mat 11:2](../kjv/mat011.htm#002); [Mat
25:36](../kjv/mat025.htm#036), [Mat 25:43](../kjv/mat025.htm#043)). The
apostles were put into the "common prison" at the instance of the Jewish
council ([Act 5:18](../kjv/act005.htm#018), [Act
5:23](../kjv/act005.htm#023); [Act 8:3](../kjv/act008.htm#003)); and at
Philippi Paul and Silas were thrust into the "inner prison" ([Act
16:24](../kjv/act016.htm#024); compare [Act 4:3](../kjv/act004.htm#003);
[Act 12:4](../kjv/act012.htm#004), [Act 12:5](../kjv/act012.htm#005)).

<span id="007">**Prophecy**</span> Or prediction, was one of the
functions of the prophet. It has been defined as a "miracle of
knowledge, a declaration or description or representation of something
future, beyond the power of human sagacity to foresee, discern, or
conjecture." (See PROPHET.) The great prediction which runs like a
golden thread through the whole contents of the Old Testament is that
regarding the coming and work of the Messiah; and the great use of
prophecy was to perpetuate faith in his coming, and to prepare the world
for that event. But there are many subordinate and intermediate
prophecies also which hold an important place in the great chain of
events which illustrate the sovereignty and all-wise overruling
providence of God. Then there are many prophecies regarding the Jewish
nation, its founder Abraham ([Gen 12:1](../kjv/gen012.htm#001); [Gen
13:16](../kjv/gen013.htm#016); [Gen 15:5](../kjv/gen015.htm#005); [Gen
17:2](../kjv/gen017.htm#002), [Gen 17:4](../kjv/gen017.htm#004), etc.),
and his posterity, Isaac and Jacob and their descendants ([Gen
12:7](../kjv/gen012.htm#007); [Gen 13:14](../kjv/gen013.htm#014), [Gen
13:15](../kjv/gen013.htm#015), [Gen 13:17](../kjv/gen013.htm#017); [Gen
15:18](../kjv/gen015.htm#018); [Exo 3:8](../kjv/exo003.htm#008), [Exo
3:17](../kjv/exo003.htm#017)), which have all been fulfilled. The
twenty-eighth chapter of Deuteronomy contains a series of predictions
which are even now in the present day being fulfilled. In the writings
of the prophets Isaiah ([Isa 2:18](../kjv/isa002.htm#018)), Jeremiah
([Jer 27:3](../kjv/jer027.htm#003); [Jer 29:11](../kjv/jer029.htm#011)),
Ezekiel ([Eze 5:12](../kjv/eze005.htm#012); 8), Daniel (Dan. 8; [Dan
9:26](../kjv/dan009.htm#026), [Dan 9:27](../kjv/dan009.htm#027)), Hosea
([Hos 9:17](../kjv/hos009.htm#017)), there are also many prophecies
regarding the events which were to befall that people. There is in like
manner a large number of prophecies relating to those nations with which
the Jews came into contact, as Tyre ([Eze 26:3](../kjv/eze026.htm#003),
[Eze 26:14](../kjv/eze026.htm#014)), Egypt ([Eze
29:10](../kjv/eze029.htm#010), [Eze 29:15](../kjv/eze029.htm#015); [Eze
30:6](../kjv/eze030.htm#006), [Eze 30:12](../kjv/eze030.htm#012), [Eze
30:13](../kjv/eze030.htm#013)), Ethiopia ([Nah
3:8](../kjv/nah003.htm#008)), Nineveh ([Nah
1:10](../kjv/nah001.htm#010); [Nah 2:8](../kjv/nah002.htm#008); [Nah
3:17](../kjv/nah003.htm#017)), Babylon ([Isa
13:4](../kjv/isa013.htm#004); [Jer 51:7](../kjv/jer051.htm#007); [Isa
44:27](../kjv/isa044.htm#027); [Jer 50:38](../kjv/jer050.htm#038); [Jer
51:36](../kjv/jer051.htm#036), [Jer 51:39](../kjv/jer051.htm#039), [Jer
51:57](../kjv/jer051.htm#057)), the land of the Philistines ([Jer
47:4](../kjv/jer047.htm#004); [Eze 25:15](../kjv/eze025.htm#015); [Amo
1:6](../kjv/amo001.htm#006); [Zep 2:4](../kjv/zep002.htm#004); [Zac
9:5](../kjv/zac009.htm#005)), and of the four great monarchies ([Dan
2:39](../kjv/dan002.htm#039), [Dan 2:40](../kjv/dan002.htm#040); [Dan
7:1](../kjv/dan007.htm#001), [Dan 8:1](../kjv/dan008.htm#001), [Dan
9:1](../kjv/dan009.htm#001)). But the great body of Old Testament
prophecy relates directly to the advent of the Messiah, beginning with
[Gen 3:15](../kjv/gen003.htm#015), the first great promise, and
extending in ever-increasing fulness and clearness all through to the
very close of the canon. The Messianic prophecies are too numerous to be
quoted. "To him gave all the prophets witness." (Compare [Mic
5:2](../kjv/mic005.htm#002); [Hag 2:6](../kjv/hag002.htm#006); [Isa
7:14](../kjv/isa007.htm#014); [Isa 9:6](../kjv/isa009.htm#006), [Isa
9:7](../kjv/isa009.htm#007); [Isa 11:1](../kjv/isa011.htm#001), [Isa
11:2](../kjv/isa011.htm#002); [Isa 53:1](../kjv/isa053.htm#001); [Isa
60:10](../kjv/isa060.htm#010), [Isa 60:13](../kjv/isa060.htm#013); [Psa
16:11](../kjv/psa016.htm#011); [Psa 68:18](../kjv/psa068.htm#018).) Many
predictions also were delivered by Jesus and his apostles. Those of
Christ were very numerous. (Compare [Mat 10:23](../kjv/mat010.htm#023),
[Mat 10:24](../kjv/mat010.htm#024); [Mat 11:23](../kjv/mat011.htm#023);
[Mat 19:28](../kjv/mat019.htm#028); [Mat 21:43](../kjv/mat021.htm#043),
[Mat 21:44](../kjv/mat021.htm#044); 24; 25:31-46; 26:17-35, [Mat
26:46](../kjv/mat026.htm#046), [Mat 26:64](../kjv/mat026.htm#064); [Mar
9:1](../kjv/mar009.htm#001); [Mar 10:30](../kjv/mar010.htm#030); 13;
[Mar 11:1](../kjv/mar011.htm#001), [Mar 11:14](../kjv/mar011.htm#014);
14:12-31, [Mar 14:42](../kjv/mar014.htm#042), [Mar
14:62](../kjv/mar014.htm#062); [Mar 16:17](../kjv/mar016.htm#017), etc.)

<span id="008">**Prophet**</span> (Heb. nabi , from a root meaning "to
bubble forth, as from a fountain," hence "to utter", compare [Psa
45:1](../kjv/psa045.htm#001)). This Hebrew word is the first and the
most generally used for a prophet. In the time of Samuel another word,
ro'eh , "seer", began to be used ([Sa1 9:9](../kjv/sa1009.htm#009)). It
occurs seven times in reference to Samuel. Afterwards another word,
hozeh , "seer" ([Sa2 24:11](../kjv/sa2024.htm#011)), was employed. In
[Ch1 29:29](../kjv/ch1029.htm#029) all these three words are used:
"Samuel the seer ( ro'eh ), Nathan the prophet ( nabi' ), Gad the seer"
( hozeh ). In [Jos 13:22](../kjv/jos013.htm#022) Balaam is called (Heb.)
a kosem = "diviner," a word used only of a false prophet. The "prophet"
proclaimed the message given to him, as the "seer" beheld the vision of
God. (See [Num 12:6](../kjv/num012.htm#006), [Num
12:8](../kjv/num012.htm#008).) Thus a prophet was a spokesman for God;
he spake in God's name and by his authority ([Exo
7:1](../kjv/exo007.htm#001)). He is the mouth by which God speaks to men
([Jer 1:9](../kjv/jer001.htm#009); [Isa 51:16](../kjv/isa051.htm#016)),
and hence what the prophet says is not of man but of God ([Pe2
1:20](../kjv/pe2001.htm#020), [Pe2 1:21](../kjv/pe2001.htm#021); compare
[Heb 3:7](../kjv/heb003.htm#007); [Act 4:25](../kjv/act004.htm#025);
[Act 28:25](../kjv/act028.htm#025)). Prophets were the immediate organs
of God for the communication of his mind and will to men ([Deu
18:18](../kjv/deu018.htm#018), [Deu 18:19](../kjv/deu018.htm#019)). The
whole Word of God may in this general sense be spoken of as prophetic,
inasmuch as it was written by men who received the revelation they
communicated from God, no matter what its nature might be. The
foretelling of future events was not a necessary but only an incidental
part of the prophetic office. The great task assigned to the prophets
whom God raised up among the people was "to correct moral and religious
abuses, to proclaim the great moral and religious truths which are
connected with the character of God, and which lie at the foundation of
his government." Any one being a spokesman for God to man might thus be
called a prophet. Thus Enoch, Abraham, and the patriarchs, as bearers of
God's message ([Gen 20:7](../kjv/gen020.htm#007); [Exo
7:1](../kjv/exo007.htm#001); [Psa 105:15](../kjv/psa105.htm#015)), as
also Moses ([Deu 18:15](../kjv/deu018.htm#015); [Deu
34:10](../kjv/deu034.htm#010); [Hos 12:13](../kjv/hos012.htm#013)), are
ranked among the prophets. The seventy elders of Israel ([Num
11:16](../kjv/num011.htm#016)), "when the spirit rested upon them,
prophesied;" Asaph and Jeduthun "prophesied with a harp" ([Ch1
25:3](../kjv/ch1025.htm#003)). Miriam and Deborah were prophetesses
([Exo 15:20](../kjv/exo015.htm#020); [Jdg 4:4](../kjv/jdg004.htm#004)).
The title thus has a general application to all who have messages from
God to men. But while the prophetic gift was thus exercised from the
beginning, the prophetical order as such began with Samuel. Colleges,
"schools of the prophets", were instituted for the training of prophets,
who were constituted, a distinct order ([Sa1
19:18](../kjv/sa1019.htm#018); [Kg2 2:3](../kjv/kg2002.htm#003), [Kg2
2:15](../kjv/kg2002.htm#015); [Kg2 4:38](../kjv/kg2004.htm#038)), which
continued to the close of the Old Testament. Such "schools" were
established at Ramah, Bethel, Gilgal, Gibeah, and Jericho. The "sons" or
"disciples" of the prophets were young men ([Kg2
5:22](../kjv/kg2005.htm#022); [Kg2 9:1](../kjv/kg2009.htm#001), [Kg2
9:4](../kjv/kg2009.htm#004)) who lived together at these different
"schools" ([Kg2 4:38](../kjv/kg2004.htm#038)). These young men were
taught not only the rudiments of secular knowledge, but they were
brought up to exercise the office of prophet, "to preach pure morality
and the heart-felt worship of Jehovah, and to act along and coordinately
with the priesthood and monarchy in guiding the state aright and
checking all attempts at illegality and tyranny." In New Testament times
the prophetical office was continued. Our Lord is frequently spoken of
as a prophet ([Luk 13:33](../kjv/luk013.htm#033); [Luk
24:19](../kjv/luk024.htm#019)). He was and is the great Prophet of the
Church. There was also in the Church a distinct order of prophets ([Co1
12:28](../kjv/co1012.htm#028); [Eph 2:20](../kjv/eph002.htm#020); [Eph
3:5](../kjv/eph003.htm#005)), who made new revelations from God. They
differed from the "teacher," whose office it was to impart truths
already revealed. Of the Old Testament prophets there are sixteen, whose
prophecies form part of the inspired canon. These are divided into four
groups: (1.) The prophets of the northern kingdom (Israel), viz., Hosea,
Amos, Joel, Jonah. (2.) The prophets of Judah, viz., Isaiah, Jeremiah,
Obadiah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah. (3.) The prophets of
Captivity, viz., Ezekiel and Daniel. (4.) The prophets of the
Restoration, viz., Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.

<span id="009">**Propitiation**</span> That by which God is rendered
propitious, i.e., by which it becomes consistent with his character and
government to pardon and bless the sinner. The propitiation does not
procure his love or make him loving; it only renders it consistent for
him to exercise his love towards sinners. In [Rom
3:25](../kjv/rom003.htm#025) and [Heb 9:5](../kjv/heb009.htm#005) (A.V.,
"mercy-seat") the Greek word hilasterion is used. It is the word
employed by the LXX. translators in [Exo 25:17](../kjv/exo025.htm#017)
and elsewhere as the equivalent for the Hebrew kapporeth , which means
"covering," and is used of the lid of the ark of the covenant ([Exo
25:21](../kjv/exo025.htm#021); [Exo 30:6](../kjv/exo030.htm#006)). This
Greek word ( hilasterion ) came to denote not only the mercy-seat or lid
of the ark, but also propitiation or reconciliation by blood. On the
great day of atonement the high priest carried the blood of the
sacrifice he offered for all the people within the veil and sprinkled
with it the "mercy-seat," and so made propitiation. In [Jo1
2:2](../kjv/jo1002.htm#002); [Jo1 4:10](../kjv/jo1004.htm#010), Christ
is called the "propitiation for our sins." Here a different Greek word
is used ( hilasmos ). Christ is "the propitiation," because by his
becoming our substitute and assuming our obligations he expiated our
guilt, covered it, by the vicarious punishment which he endured.
(Compare [Heb 2:17](../kjv/heb002.htm#017), where the expression "make
reconciliation" of the A.V. is more correctly in the R.V. "make
propitiation.")
