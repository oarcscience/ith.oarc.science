<span id="000">**Perez-uzzah**</span> The breach of Uzzah, a place where
God "burst forth upon Uzzah, so that he died," when he rashly "took
hold" of the ark ([Sa2 6:6](../kjv/sa2006.htm#006).md). It was not far from
Kirjath-jearim (q.v.).

<span id="001">**Perfection**</span> See SANCTIFICATION.

<span id="002">**Perfumes**</span> Were used in religious worship, and
for personal and domestic enjoyment ([Exo 30:35](../kjv/exo030.htm#035.md);
[Pro 7:17](../kjv/pro007.htm#017); [Sol 3:6](../kjv/sol003.htm#006.md);
[Isa 57:9](../kjv/isa057.htm#009).md); and also in embalming the dead, and
in other funeral ceremonies ([Mar 14:8](../kjv/mar014.htm#008.md); [Luk
24:1](../kjv/luk024.htm#001); [Joh 19:39](../kjv/joh019.htm#039).md).

<span id="003">**Perga**</span> The capital of Pamphylia, on the coast
of Asia Minor. Paul and his companions landed at this place from Cyprus
on their first missionary journey ([Act 13:13](../kjv/act013.htm#013.md),
[Act 13:14](../kjv/act013.htm#014).md), and here Mark forsook the party and
returned to Jerusalem. Some time afterwards Paul and Barnabas again
visited this city and "preached the word" ([Act
14:25](../kjv/act014.htm#025).md). It stood on the banks of the river
Cestrus, some 7 miles from its mouth, and was a place of some commercial
importance. It is now a ruin, called Eski Kalessi.

<span id="004">**Pergamos**</span> The chief city of Mysia, in Asia
Minor. One of the "seven churches" was planted here ([Rev
1:11](../kjv/rev001.htm#011); [Rev 2:17](../kjv/rev002.htm#017).md). It was
noted for its wickedness, inasmuch that our Lord says "Satan's seat" was
there. The church of Pergamos was rebuked for swerving from the truth
and embracing the doctrines of Balaam and the Nicolaitanes. Antipas,
Christ's "faithful martyr," here sealed his testimony with his blood.
This city stood on the banks of the river Caicus, about 20 miles from
the sea. It is now called Bergama, and has a population of some twenty
thousand, of whom about two thousand profess to be Christians. Parchment
(q.v.) was first made here, and was called by the Greeks pergamene, from
the name of the city.

<span id="005">**Perida**</span> Kernel, [Neh
7:57](../kjv/neh007.htm#057). (See PERUDA..md)

<span id="006">**Perizzites**</span> Villagers; dwellers in the open
country, the Canaanitish nation inhabiting the fertile regions south and
south-west of Carmel. "They were the grazers, farmers, and peasants of
the time." They were to be driven out of the land by the descendants of
Abraham ([Gen 15:20](../kjv/gen015.htm#020.md); [Exo
3:8](../kjv/exo003.htm#008), [Exo 3:17](../kjv/exo003.htm#017.md); [Exo
23:23](../kjv/exo023.htm#023); [Exo 33:2](../kjv/exo033.htm#002.md); [Exo
34:11](../kjv/exo034.htm#011).md). They are afterwards named among the
conquered tribes ([Jos 24:11](../kjv/jos024.htm#011).md). Still lingering
in the land, however, they were reduced to servitude by Solomon ([Kg1
9:20](../kjv/kg1009.htm#020).md).

<span id="007">**Persecution**</span> The first great persecution for
religious opinion of which we have any record was that which broke out
against the worshippers of God among the Jews in the days of Ahab, when
that king, at the instigation of his wife Jezebel, "a woman in whom,
with the reckless and licentious habits of an Oriental queen, were
united the fiercest and sternest qualities inherent in the old Semitic
race", sought in the most relentless manner to extirpate the worship of
Jehovah and substitute in its place the worship of Ashtoreth and Baal.
Ahab's example in this respect was followed by Manasseh, who "shed
innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to
another" ([Kg2 21:16](../kjv/kg2021.htm#016.md); compare [Kg2
24:4](../kjv/kg2024.htm#004).md). In all ages, in one form or another, the
people of God have had to suffer persecution. In its earliest history
the Christian church passed through many bloody persecutions. Of
subsequent centuries in our own and in other lands the same sad record
may be made. Christians are forbidden to seek the propagation of the
gospel by force ([Mat 7:1](../kjv/mat007.htm#001.md); [Luk
9:54](../kjv/luk009.htm#054); [Rom 14:4](../kjv/rom014.htm#004.md); [Jam
4:11](../kjv/jam004.htm#011), [Jam 4:12](../kjv/jam004.htm#012).md). The
words of [Psa 7:13](../kjv/psa007.htm#013.md), "He ordaineth his arrows
against the persecutors," ought rather to be, as in the Revised Version,
"He maketh his arrows fiery \[shafts\]."

<span id="008">**Perseverance of the Saints**</span> Their certain
continuance in a state of grace. Once justified and regenerated, the
believer can neither totally nor finally fall away from grace, but will
certainly persevere therein and attain everlasting life. This doctrine
is clearly taught in these passages, [Joh 10:28](../kjv/joh010.htm#028.md),
[Joh 10:29](../kjv/joh010.htm#029); [Rom 11:29](../kjv/rom011.htm#029.md);
[Phi 1:6](../kjv/phi001.htm#006); [Pe1 1:5](../kjv/pe1001.htm#005.md). It,
moreover, follows from a consideration of (1.) the immutability of the
divine decrees ([Jer 31:3](../kjv/jer031.htm#003.md); [Mat
24:22](../kjv/mat024.htm#022); [Act 13:48](../kjv/act013.htm#048.md); [Rom
8:30](../kjv/rom008.htm#030)); (2..md) the provisions of the covenant of
grace ([Jer 32:40](../kjv/jer032.htm#040.md); [Joh
10:29](../kjv/joh010.htm#029); [Joh 17:2](../kjv/joh017.htm#002)); (3..md)
the atonement and intercession of Christ ([Isa
53:6](../kjv/isa053.htm#006), [Isa 53:11](../kjv/isa053.htm#011.md); [Mat
20:28](../kjv/mat020.htm#028); [Pe1 2:24](../kjv/pe1002.htm#024.md); [Joh
11:42](../kjv/joh011.htm#042); [Joh 17:11](../kjv/joh017.htm#011.md), [Joh
17:15](../kjv/joh017.htm#015), [Joh 17:20](../kjv/joh017.htm#020.md); [Rom
8:34](../kjv/rom008.htm#034)); and (4..md) the indwelling of the Holy Ghost
([Joh 14:16](../kjv/joh014.htm#016); [Co2 1:21](../kjv/co2001.htm#021.md),
[Co2 1:22](../kjv/co2001.htm#022); [Co2 5:5](../kjv/co2005.htm#005.md);
[Eph 1:14](../kjv/eph001.htm#014); [Jo1 3:9](../kjv/jo1003.htm#009).md).
This doctrine is not inconsistent with the truth that the believer may
nevertheless fall into grievous sin, and continue therein for some time.

<span id="009">**Persia**</span> An ancient empire, extending from the
Indus to Thrace, and from the Caspian Sea to the Red Sea and the Persian
Gulf. The Persians were originally a Medic tribe which settled in
Persia, on the eastern side of the Persian Gulf. They were Aryans, their
language belonging to the eastern division of the Indo-European group.
One of their chiefs, Teispes, conquered Elam in the time of the decay of
the Assyrian Empire, and established himself in the district of Anzan.
His descendants branched off into two lines, one line ruling in Anzan,
while the other remained in Persia. Cyrus II., king of Anzan, finally
united the divided power, conquered Media, Lydia, and Babylonia, and
carried his arms into the far East. His son, Cambyses, added Egypt to
the empire, which, however, fell to pieces after his death. It was
reconquered and thoroughly organized by Darius, the son of Hystaspes,
whose dominions extended from India to the Danube.
