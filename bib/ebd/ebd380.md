<span id="000">**Wax**</span> Made by melting the combs of bees.
Mentioned ([Psa 22:14](../kjv/psa022.htm#014); [Psa
68:2](../kjv/psa068.htm#002); [Psa 97:5](../kjv/psa097.htm#005); [Mic
1:4](../kjv/mic001.htm#004)) in illustration.

<span id="001">**Wean**</span> Among the Hebrews children (whom it was
customary for the mothers to nurse, [Exo 2:7](../kjv/exo002.htm#007);
[Sa1 1:23](../kjv/sa1001.htm#023); [Sol 8:1](../kjv/sol008.htm#001))
were not generally weaned till they were three or four years old.

<span id="002">**Weasel**</span> (Heb. holedh ), enumerated among
unclean animals ([Lev 11:29](../kjv/lev011.htm#029)). Some think that
this Hebrew word rather denotes the mole (Spalax typhlus) common in
Palestine. There is no sufficient reason, however, to depart from the
usual translation. The weasel tribe are common also in Palestine.

<span id="003">**Weaving**</span> Or weavers, weaving was an art
practiced in very early times ([Exo 35:35](../kjv/exo035.htm#035)). The
Egyptians were specially skilled in it ([Isa
19:9](../kjv/isa019.htm#009); [Eze 27:7](../kjv/eze027.htm#007)), and
some have regarded them as its inventors. In the wilderness, the Hebrews
practiced it ([Exo 26:1](../kjv/exo026.htm#001), [Exo
26:8](../kjv/exo026.htm#008); [Exo 28:4](../kjv/exo028.htm#004), [Exo
28:39](../kjv/exo028.htm#039); [Lev 13:47](../kjv/lev013.htm#047)). It
is referred to in subsequent times as specially the women's work ([Kg2
23:7](../kjv/kg2023.htm#007); [Pro 31:13](../kjv/pro031.htm#013), [Pro
31:24](../kjv/pro031.htm#024)). No mention of the loom is found in
Scripture, but we read of the "shuttle" ([Job
7:6](../kjv/job007.htm#006)), "the pin" of the beam ([Jdg
16:14](../kjv/jdg016.htm#014)), "the web" ([Jdg
16:13](../kjv/jdg016.htm#013), [Jdg 16:14](../kjv/jdg016.htm#014)), and
"the beam" ([Sa1 17:7](../kjv/sa1017.htm#007); [Sa2
21:19](../kjv/sa2021.htm#019)). The rendering, "with pining sickness,"
in [Isa 38:12](../kjv/isa038.htm#012) (A.V.) should be, as in the
Revised Version, "from the loom," or, as in the margin, "from the
thrum." We read also of the "wrap" and "woof" ([Lev
13:48](../kjv/lev013.htm#048), [Lev 13:49](../kjv/lev013.htm#049), [Lev
13:51](../kjv/lev013.htm#051), [Lev 13:58](../kjv/lev013.htm#058), [Lev
13:59](../kjv/lev013.htm#059)), but the Revised Version margin has,
instead of "wrap," "woven or knitted stuff."

<span id="004">**Week**</span> From the beginning, time was divided into
weeks, each consisting of six days of working and one of rest ([Gen
2:2](../kjv/gen002.htm#002), [Gen 2:3](../kjv/gen002.htm#003); [Gen
7:10](../kjv/gen007.htm#010); [Gen 8:10](../kjv/gen008.htm#010), [Gen
8:12](../kjv/gen008.htm#012); [Gen 29:28](../kjv/gen029.htm#028)). The
references to this division of days becomes afterwards more frequent
([Exo 34:22](../kjv/exo034.htm#022); [Lev 12:5](../kjv/lev012.htm#005);
[Num 28:26](../kjv/num028.htm#026); [Deu 16:16](../kjv/deu016.htm#016);
[Ch2 8:13](../kjv/ch2008.htm#013); [Jer 5:24](../kjv/jer005.htm#024);
[Dan 9:24](../kjv/dan009.htm#024); [Dan 10:2](../kjv/dan010.htm#002),
[Dan 10:3](../kjv/dan010.htm#003)). It has been found to exist among
almost all nations.

<span id="005">**Weeks, Feast of**</span> See PENTECOST.

<span id="006">**Weights**</span> Reduced to English troy-weight, the
Hebrew weights were:, (1.) The gerah ([Lev
27:25](../kjv/lev027.htm#025); [Num 3:47](../kjv/num003.htm#047)), a
Hebrew word, meaning a grain or kernel, and hence a small weight. It was
the twentieth part of a shekel, and equal to 12 grains. (2.) Bekah ([Exo
38:26](../kjv/exo038.htm#026)), meaning "a half" i.e., "half a shekel,"
equal to 5 pennyweight. (3.) Shekel , "a weight," only in the Old
Testament, and frequently in its original form ([Gen
23:15](../kjv/gen023.htm#015), [Gen 23:16](../kjv/gen023.htm#016); [Exo
21:32](../kjv/exo021.htm#032); [Exo 30:13](../kjv/exo030.htm#013), [Exo
30:15](../kjv/exo030.htm#015); [Exo 38:24](../kjv/exo038.htm#024),
etc.). It was equal to 10 pennyweight. (4.) Ma'neh , "a part" or
"portion" ([Eze 45:12](../kjv/eze045.htm#012)), equal to 60 shekels,
i.e., to 2 lb. 6 oz. (5.) Talent of silver ([Kg2
5:22](../kjv/kg2005.htm#022)), equal to 3,000 shekels, i.e., 125 lb.
(6.) Talent of gold ([Exo 25:39](../kjv/exo025.htm#039)), double the
preceding, i.e., 250 lb.

<span id="007">**Well**</span> (Heb. beer ), to be distinguished from a
fountain (Heb. 'ain ). A "beer" was a deep shaft, bored far under the
rocky surface by the art of man, which contained water which percolated
through the strata in its sides. Such wells were those of Jacob and
Beersheba, etc. (see [Gen 21:19](../kjv/gen021.htm#019), [Gen
21:25](../kjv/gen021.htm#025), [Gen 21:30](../kjv/gen021.htm#030), [Gen
21:31](../kjv/gen021.htm#031); [Gen 24:11](../kjv/gen024.htm#011); [Gen
26:15](../kjv/gen026.htm#015), [Gen 26:18](../kjv/gen026.htm#018), [Gen
26:32](../kjv/gen026.htm#032), etc.). In the Pentateuch this word beer,
so rendered, occurs twenty-five times.

<span id="008">**Westward**</span> Sea-ward, i.e., toward the
Mediterranean ([Deu 3:27](../kjv/deu003.htm#027)).

<span id="009">**Whale**</span> The Hebrew word tan (plural, tannin) is
so rendered in [Job 7:12](../kjv/job007.htm#012) (A.V.; but R.V.,
"sea-monster"). It is rendered by "dragons" in [Deu
32:33](../kjv/deu032.htm#033); [Psa 91:13](../kjv/psa091.htm#013); [Jer
51:34](../kjv/jer051.htm#034); [Psa 74:13](../kjv/psa074.htm#013)
(marg., "whales;" and marg. of R.V., "sea-monsters"); [Isa
27:1](../kjv/isa027.htm#001); and "serpent" in [Exo
7:9](../kjv/exo007.htm#009) (R.V. marg., "any large reptile," and so in
[Exo 7:10](../kjv/exo007.htm#010), [Exo 7:12](../kjv/exo007.htm#012)).
The words of Job ([Job 7:12](../kjv/job007.htm#012)), uttered in bitter
irony, where he asks, "Am I a sea or a whale?" simply mean, "Have I a
wild, untamable nature, like the waves of the sea, which must be
confined and held within bounds, that they cannot pass?" "The serpent of
the sea, which was but the wild, stormy sea itself, wound itself around
the land, and threatened to swallow it up... Job inquires if he must be
watched and plagued like this monster, lest he throw the world into
disorder" (Davidson's Job). The whale tribe are included under the
general Hebrew name tannin ([Gen 1:21](../kjv/gen001.htm#021); [Lam
4:3](../kjv/lam004.htm#003)). "Even the sea-monsters \[tanninim\] draw
out the breast." The whale brings forth its young alive, and suckles
them. It is to be noticed of the story of Jonah's being "three days and
three nights in the whale's belly," as recorded in [Mat
12:40](../kjv/mat012.htm#040), that here the Gr. ketos means properly
any kind of sea-monster of the shark or the whale tribe, and that in the
book of Jonah ([Jon 1:17](../kjv/jon001.htm#017)) it is only said that
"a great fish" was prepared to swallow Jonah. This fish may have been,
therefore, some great shark. The white shark is known to frequent the
Mediterranean Sea, and is sometimes found 30 feet in length.
