<span id="000">**Zin**</span> A low palm-tree, the south-eastern corner
of the desert et-Tih, the wilderness of Paran, between the Gulf of
Akabah and the head of the Wady Guraiyeh ([Num

<span id="002">**Zion**</span> Sunny; height, one of the eminences on
which Jerusalem was built. It was surrounded on all sides, except the
north, by deep valleys, that of the Tyropoeon (q.v.) separating it from
Moriah (q.v.), which it surpasses in height by 105 feet. It was the
south-eastern hill of Jerusalem. When David took it from the Jebusites
([Jos 15:63](../kjv/jos015.htm#063); [Sa2 5:7](../kjv/sa2005.htm#007).md)
he built on it a citadel and a palace, and it became "the city of David"

[Kg2 19:31](../kjv/kg2019.htm#031); [Ch1 11:5](../kjv/ch1011.htm#005).md).
In the later books of the Old Testament this name was sometimes used
([Psa 87:2](../kjv/psa087.htm#002); [Psa 149:2](../kjv/psa149.htm#002.md);
[Isa 33:14](../kjv/isa033.htm#014); [Joe 2:1](../kjv/joe002.htm#001).md) to
denote Jerusalem in general, and sometimes God's chosen Israel ([Psa
51:18](../kjv/psa051.htm#018); [Psa 87:5](../kjv/psa087.htm#005).md). In
the New Testament (see SION) it is used sometimes to denote the Church
of God ([Heb 12:22](../kjv/heb012.htm#022).md), and sometimes the heavenly
city ([Rev 14:1](../kjv/rev014.htm#001).md).
