<P><A NAME="002"><B>Hatred</B></A>     Among the works of the flesh (<A HREF="../kjv/gal005.htm#020">Gal 5:20</A>). Altogether different is the meaning of the word in <A HREF="../kjv/deu021.htm#015">Deu 21:15</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat006.htm#024">Mat 6:24</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/luk014.htm#026">Luk 14:26</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/rom009.htm#013">Rom 9:13</A>, where it denotes only a less degree of love.

(3.) <A HREF="../kjv/neh003.htm#010">Neh 3:10</A>. (4.) <A HREF="../kjv/neh010.htm#004">Neh 10:4</A>. (5.) <A HREF="../kjv/ch1003.htm#022">Ch1 3:22</A>. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Hauran</B></A>     Cave-land, mentioned only in <A HREF="../kjv/eze047.htm#016">Eze 47:16</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/eze047.htm#018">Eze 47:18</A>. It was one of the ancient divisions of Bashan (q.v.), and lay on the south-east of Gaulanitis or the Jaulan, and on the south of Lejah, extending from the Arnon to the Hieromax. It was the most fertile region in Syria, and to this day abounds in the ruins of towns, many of which have stone doors and massive walls. It retains its ancient name. It was known by the Greeks and Romans as &quot;Auranitis.&quot; 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Haven</B></A>     A harbour (<A HREF="../kjv/psa107.htm#030">Psa 107:30</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/act027.htm#012">Act 27:12</A>). The most famous on the coast of Palestine was that of Tyre (<A HREF="../kjv/eze027.htm#003">Eze 27:3</A>). That of Crete, called &quot;Fair Havens,&quot; is mentioned <A HREF="../kjv/act027.htm#008">Act 27:8</A>. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Havilah</B></A>     The sand region.     (1.) A land mentioned in <A HREF="../kjv/gen002.htm#011">Gen 2:11</A> rich in gold and bdellium and onyx stone. The question as to the locality of this region has given rise to a great diversity of opinion. It may perhaps be identified with the sandy tract which skirts Babylonia along the whole of its western border, stretching from the lower Euphrates to the mountains of Edom. (2.) A district in Arabia-Felix. It is uncertain whether the tribe gave its name to this region or derived its name from it, and whether it was originally a Cushite (<A HREF="../kjv/gen010.htm#007">Gen 10:7</A>) or a Joktanite tribe (<A HREF="../kjv/gen010.htm#029">Gen 10:29</A>; compare <A HREF="../kjv/gen025.htm#018">Gen 25:18</A>), or whether there were both a Cushite and a Joktanite Havilah. It is the opinion of Kalisch, however, that Havilah &quot;in both instances designates the same country, extending at least from the Persian to the Arabian Gulf, and on account of its vast extent easily divided into two distinct parts.&quot; This opinion may be well vindicated. (3.) One of the sons of Cush (<A HREF="../kjv/gen010.htm#007">Gen 10:7</A>). (4.) A son of Joktan (<A HREF="../kjv/gen010.htm#029">Gen 10:29</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch1001.htm#023">Ch1 1:23</A>).
