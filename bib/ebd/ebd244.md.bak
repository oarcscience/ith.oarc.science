<span id="000">**Mattathias**</span> Ibid. (1.) The son of Amos, in the
genealogy of our Lord ([Luk 3:25](../kjv/luk003.htm#025)). (2..md) The son
of Semei, in the same genealogy ([Luk 3:26](../kjv/luk003.htm#026).md).

<span id="001">**Matthan**</span> Gift, one of our Lord's ancestry ([Mat
1:15](../kjv/mat001.htm#015).md).

<span id="002">**Matthat**</span> Gift of God. (1.) The son of Levi, and
father of Heli ([Luk 3:24](../kjv/luk003.htm#024)). (2..md) Son of another
Levi ([Luk 3:29](../kjv/luk003.htm#029).md).

<span id="003">**Matthew**</span> Gift of God, a common Jewish name
after the Exile. He was the son of Alphaeus, and was a publican or
tax-gatherer at Capernaum. On one occasion Jesus, coming up from the
side of the lake, passed the custom-house where Matthew was seated, and
said to him, "Follow me." Matthew arose and followed him, and became his
disciple ([Mat 9:9](../kjv/mat009.htm#009).md). Formerly the name by which
he was known was Levi ([Mar 2:14](../kjv/mar002.htm#014.md); [Luk
5:27](../kjv/luk005.htm#027).md); he now changed it, possibly in grateful
memory of his call, to Matthew. The same day on which Jesus called him
he made a "great feast" ([Luk 5:29](../kjv/luk005.htm#029).md), a farewell
feast, to which he invited Jesus and his disciples, and probably also
many of old associates. He was afterwards selected as one of the twelve
([Luk 6:15](../kjv/luk006.htm#015).md). His name does not occur again in
the Gospel history except in the lists of the apostles. The last notice
of him is in [Act 1:13](../kjv/act001.htm#013.md). The time and manner of
his death are unknown.

<span id="004">**Matthew, Gospel According to**</span> The author of
this book was beyond a doubt the Matthew, an apostle of our Lord, whose
name it bears. He wrote the Gospel of Christ according to his own plans
and aims, and from his own point of view, as did also the other
"evangelists." As to the time of its composition, there is little in the
Gospel itself to indicate. It was evidently written before the
destruction of Jerusalem (Matt. 24), and some time after the events it
records. The probability is that it was written between the years A.D.
60 and 65. The cast of thought and the forms of expression employed by
the writer show that this Gospel was written for Jewish Christians of
Palestine. His great object is to prove that Jesus of Nazareth was the
promised Messiah, and that in him the ancient prophecies had their
fulfillment. The Gospel is full of allusions to those passages of the
Old Testament in which Christ is predicted and foreshadowed. The one aim
pervading the whole book is to show that Jesus is he "of whom Moses in
the law and the prophets did write." This Gospel contains no fewer than
sixty-five references to the Old Testament, forty-three of these being
direct verbal citations, thus greatly outnumbering those found in the
other Gospels. The main feature of this Gospel may be expressed in the
motto, "I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill." As to the language in
which this Gospel was written there is much controversy. Many hold, in
accordance with old tradition, that it was originally written in Hebrew
(i.e., the Aramaic or Syro-Chaldee dialect, then the vernacular of the
inhabitants of Palestine), and afterwards translated into Greek, either
by Matthew himself or by some person unknown. This theory, though
earnestly maintained by able critics, we cannot see any ground for
adopting. From the first this Gospel in Greek was received as of
authority in the Church. There is nothing in it to show that it is a
translation. Though Matthew wrote mainly for the Jews, yet they were
everywhere familiar with the Greek language. The same reasons which
would have suggested the necessity of a translation into Greek would
have led the evangelist to write in Greek at first. It is confessed that
this Gospel has never been found in any other form than that in which we
now possess it. The leading characteristic of this Gospel is that it
sets forth the kingly glory of Christ, and shows him to be the true heir
to David's throne. It is the Gospel of the kingdom. Matthew uses the
expression "kingdom of heaven" (thirty-two times), while Luke uses the
expression "kingdom of God" (thirty-three times). Some Latinized forms
occur in this Gospel, as kodrantes ([Mat 5:26](../kjv/mat005.htm#026).md),
for the Latin quadrans , and phragello ([Mat
27:26](../kjv/mat027.htm#026).md), for the Latin flagello . It must be
remembered that Matthew was a tax-gatherer for the Roman government, and
hence in contact with those using the Latin language. As to the relation
of the Gospels to each other, we must maintain that each writer of the
synoptics (the first three) wrote independently of the other two,
Matthew being probably first in point of time. "Out of a total of 1071
verses, Matthew has 387 in common with Mark and Luke, 130 with Mark, 184
with Luke; only 387 being peculiar to itself." (See MARK; LUKE;
GOSPELS.) The book is fitfully divided into these four parts: (1.)
Containing the genealogy, the birth, and the infancy of Jesus (Matt. 1;
2). (2.) The discourses and actions of John the Baptist preparatory to
Christ's public ministry (Matt. 3; [Mat 4:11](../kjv/mat004.htm#011).md).
(3.) The discourses and actions of Christ in Galilee (Matt. 4:12 -
20:16). (4.) The sufferings, death and resurrection of our Lord ([Mat
20:17](../kjv/mat020.htm#017).md).

<span id="005">**Matthias**</span> Gift of God. [Act
1:23](../kjv/act001.htm#023.md).

<span id="006">**Mattithiah**</span> Gift of Jehovah. (1.) One of the
sons of Jeduthun ([Ch1 25:3](../kjv/ch1025.htm#003.md), [Ch1
25:21](../kjv/ch1025.htm#021)). (2..md) The eldest son of Shallum, of the
family of Korah ([Ch1 9:31](../kjv/ch1009.htm#031)). (3..md) One who stood
by Ezra while reading the law ([Neh 8:4](../kjv/neh008.htm#004)). (4..md)
The son of Amos, and father of Joseph, in the genealogy of our Lord
([Luk 3:25](../kjv/luk003.htm#025).md).

<span id="007">**Mattock**</span> (1.) Heb. ma'eder , an instrument for
dressing or pruning a vineyard ([Isa 7:25](../kjv/isa007.htm#025).md); a
weeding-hoe. (2.) Heb. mahareshah ([Sa1 13:1](../kjv/sa1013.htm#001).md),
perhaps the ploughshare or coulter. (3.) Heb. herebh , marg. of text
([Ch2 34:6](../kjv/ch2034.htm#006).md). Authorized Version, "with their
mattocks," marg. "mauls." The Revised Version renders "in their ruins,"
marg. "with their axes." The Hebrew text is probably corrupt.

<span id="008">**Maul**</span> An old name for a mallet, the rendering
of the Hebrew mephits ([Pro 25:18](../kjv/pro025.htm#018).md), properly a
war-club.

<span id="009">**Mazzaroth**</span> Prognostications, found only [Job
38:32](../kjv/job038.htm#032.md), probably meaning "the twelve signs" (of
the zodiac), as in the margin (Compare [Kg2
23:5](../kjv/kg2023.htm#005).md).
