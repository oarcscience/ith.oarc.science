<span id="000">**Amplias**</span> A Roman Christian saluted by Paul
([Rom 16:8](../kjv/rom016.htm#008).md).

<span id="001">**Amram**</span> Kindred of the High; i.e., "friend of
Jehovah." (1.) The son of Kohath, the son of Levi. He married Jochebed,
"his father's sister," and was the father of Aaron, Miriam, and Moses
([Exo 6:18](../kjv/exo006.htm#018), [Exo 6:20](../kjv/exo006.htm#020.md);
[Num 3:19](../kjv/num003.htm#019).md). He died in Egypt at the age of 137
years ([Exo 6:20](../kjv/exo006.htm#020).md). His descendants were called
Amramites ([Num 3:27](../kjv/num003.htm#027.md); [Ch1
26:23](../kjv/ch1026.htm#023)). (2.) [Ezr 10:34](../kjv/ezr010.htm#034.md).

<span id="002">**Amraphel**</span> King of Shinar, southern Chaldea, one
of the confederates of Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, in a war against
Sodom and cities of the plain ([Gen 14:1](../kjv/gen014.htm#001.md), [Gen
14:4](../kjv/gen014.htm#004).md). It is now found that Amraphel (or
Ammirapaltu) is the Khammu-rabi whose name appears on
recently-discovered monuments. (See CHEDORLAOMER.) After defeating
Arioch (q.v.) he united Babylonia under one rule, and made Babylon his
capital

<span id="003">**Anab**</span> Grape-town, one of the cities in the
mountains of Judah, from which Joshua expelled the Anakim ([Jos
11:21](../kjv/jos011.htm#021); [Jos 15:50](../kjv/jos015.htm#050).md). It
still retains its ancient name. It lies among the hills, 10 miles
south-south-west of Hebron.

<span id="004">**Anah**</span> Speech. (1.) One of the sons of Seir, and
head of an Idumean tribe, called a Horite, as in course of time all the
branches of this tribe were called from their dwelling in caves in Mount
Seir ([Gen 36:20](../kjv/gen036.htm#020.md), [Gen
36:29](../kjv/gen036.htm#029); [Ch1 1:38](../kjv/ch1001.htm#038)). (2..md)
One of the two sons of Zibeon the Horite, and father of Esau's wife
Aholibamah ([Gen 36:18](../kjv/gen036.htm#018.md), [Gen
36:24](../kjv/gen036.htm#024).md).

<span id="005">**Anak**</span> Long-necked, the son of Arba, father of
the Anakim ([Jos 15:13](../kjv/jos015.htm#013.md); [Jos
21:11](../kjv/jos021.htm#011), Heb. Anok .md).

<span id="006">**Anakim**</span> The descendants of Anak ([Jos
11:21](../kjv/jos011.htm#021); [Num 13:33](../kjv/num013.htm#033.md); [Deu
9:2](../kjv/deu009.htm#002).md). They dwelt in the south of Palestine, in
the neighbourhood of Hebron ([Gen 23:2](../kjv/gen023.htm#002.md); [Jos
15:13](../kjv/jos015.htm#013).md). In the days of Abraham ([Gen
14:5](../kjv/gen014.htm#005), [Gen 14:6](../kjv/gen014.htm#006).md) they
inhabited the region afterwards known as Edom and Moab, east of the
Jordan. They were probably a remnant of the original inhabitants of
Palestine before the Canaanites, a Cushite tribe from Babel, and of the
same race as the Phoenicians and the Egyptian shepherd kings. Their
formidable warlike appearance, as described by the spies sent to search
the land, filled the Israelites with terror. They seem to have
identified them with the Nephilim, the "giants" ([Gen
6:4](../kjv/gen006.htm#004); [Num 13:33](../kjv/num013.htm#033).md) of the
antediluvian age. There were various tribes of Anakim ([Jos
15:14](../kjv/jos015.htm#014).md). Joshua finally expelled them from the
land, except a remnant that found a refuge in the cities of Gaza, Gath,
and Ashdod ([Jos 11:22](../kjv/jos011.htm#022).md). The Philistine giants
whom David encountered ([Sa2 21:15](../kjv/sa2021.htm#015).md) were
descendants of the Anakim. (See GIANTS.)

<span id="007">**Anamim**</span> The name of an Egyptian tribe descended
from Mizraim ([Gen 10:13](../kjv/gen010.htm#013.md); [Ch1
1:11](../kjv/ch1001.htm#011).md).

<span id="008">**Anammelech**</span> One of the gods worshipped by the
people of Sepharvaim, who colonized Samaria ([Kg2
17:31](../kjv/kg2017.htm#031).md). The name means "Anu is king." It was a
female deity representing the moon, as Adrammelech (q.v.) was the male
representing the sun.

<span id="009">**Anan**</span> Cloud, one of the Israelites who sealed
the covenant after the return from Babylon ([Neh
10:26](../kjv/neh010.htm#026).md).
