<P><A NAME="000"><B>Baal-peor</B></A>     Lord of the opening, a god of the Moabites (<A HREF="../kjv/num025.htm#003">Num 25:3</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/num031.htm#016">Num 31:16</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jos022.htm#017">Jos 22:17</A>), worshipped by obscene rites. So called from Mount Peor, where this worship was celebrated, the Baal of Peor. The Israelites fell into the worship of this idol (<A HREF="../kjv/num025.htm#003">Num 25:3</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/num025.htm#005">Num 25:5</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/num025.htm#018">Num 25:18</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/deu004.htm#003">Deu 4:3</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa106.htm#028">Psa 106:28</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/hos009.htm#010">Hos 9:10</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Baal-perazim</B></A>     Baal having rents, bursts, or destructions, the scene of a victory gained by David over the Philistines (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2005.htm#020">Sa2 5:20</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch1014.htm#011">Ch1 14:11</A>). Called Mount Perazim (<A HREF="../kjv/isa028.htm#021">Isa 28:21</A>). It was near the valley of Rephaim, west of Jerusalem. Identified with the modern Jebel Aly.

<P><A NAME="003"><B>Baal-tamar</B></A>     Lord of palm trees, a place in the tribe of Benjamin near Gibeah of Saul (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg020.htm#033">Jdg 20:33</A>). It was one of the sanctuaries or groves of Baal. Probably the palm tree of Deborah (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg004.htm#005">Jdg 4:5</A>) is alluded to in the name. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Baal-zebub</B></A>     Fly-lord, the god of the Philistines at Ekron (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2001.htm#002">Kg2 1:2</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/kg2001.htm#003">Kg2 1:3</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/kg2001.htm#016">Kg2 1:16</A>.

It is probably to be identified with the modern Jebel Deraj or Kulalah, on the western shore of the Gulf of Suez. Baal-capuna of the Egyptians was a place of worship.
