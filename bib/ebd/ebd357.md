<span id="000">**Tabrimon**</span> Good is Rimmon, the father of
Benhadad, king of Syria ([Kg1 15:18](../kjv/kg1015.htm#018)).

<span id="001">**Taches**</span> Hooks or clasps by which the tabernacle
curtains were connected ([Exo 26:6](../kjv/exo026.htm#006), [Exo
26:11](../kjv/exo026.htm#011), [Exo 26:33](../kjv/exo026.htm#033); [Exo
35:11](../kjv/exo035.htm#011)).

<span id="002">**Tachmonite**</span> =Hachmonite a name given to
Jashobeam ([Sa2 23:8](../kjv/sa2023.htm#008); compare [Ch1
11:11](../kjv/ch1011.htm#011)).

<span id="003">**Tackling**</span> ([Isa 33:23](../kjv/isa033.htm#023)),
the ropes attached to the mast of a ship. In [Act
27:19](../kjv/act027.htm#019) this word means generally the furniture of
the ship or the "gear" ([Act 27:17](../kjv/act027.htm#017)), all that
could be removed from the ship.

<span id="004">**Tadmor**</span> Palm, a city built by Solomon "in the
wilderness" ([Ch2 8:4](../kjv/ch2008.htm#004)). In [Kg1
9:18](../kjv/kg1009.htm#018), where the word occurs in the Authorized
Version, the Hebrew text and the Revised Version read "Tamar," which is
properly a city on the southern border of Palestine and toward the
wilderness (compare [Eze 47:19](../kjv/eze047.htm#019); [Eze
48:28](../kjv/eze048.htm#028)). In [Ch2 8:14](../kjv/ch2008.htm#014)
Tadmor is mentioned in connection with Hamath-zobah. It is called
Palmyra by the Greeks and Romans. It stood in the great Syrian
wilderness, 176 miles from Damascus and 130 from the Mediterranean and
was the centre of a vast commercial traffic with Western Asia. It was
also an important military station. (See SOLOMON.) "Remains of ancient
temples and palaces, surrounded by splendid colonnades of white marble,
many of which are yet standing, and thousands of prostrate pillars,
scattered over a large extent of space, attest the ancient magnificence
of this city of palms, surpassing that of the renowned cities of Greece
and Rome."

<span id="005">**Tahapanes**</span> =Tahpanhes=Tehaphnehes (called
"Daphne" by the Greeks, now Tell Defenneh), an ancient Egyptian city, on
the Tanitic branch of the Nile, about 16 miles from Pelusium. The Jews
from Jerusalem fled to this place after the death of Gedaliah (q.v.),
and settled there for a time ([Jer 2:16](../kjv/jer002.htm#016); [Jer
43:7](../kjv/jer043.htm#007); [Jer 44:1](../kjv/jer044.htm#001); [Jer
46:14](../kjv/jer046.htm#014)). A platform of brick-work, which there is
every reason to believe was the pavement at the entry of Pharaoh's
palace, has been discovered at this place. "Here," says the discoverer,
Mr. Petrie, "the ceremony described by Jeremiah \[[Jer
43:8](../kjv/jer043.htm#008); "brick-kiln", i.e., pavement of brick\]
took place before the chiefs of the fugitives assembled on the platform,
and here Nebuchadnezzar spread his royal pavilion" (R.V., "brickwork").

<span id="006">**Tahpenes**</span> The wife of Pharaoh, who gave her
sister in marriage to Hadad the Edomite ([Kg1
11:19](../kjv/kg1011.htm#019), [Kg1 11:20](../kjv/kg1011.htm#020)).

<span id="007">**Tahtim-hodshi**</span> The land of the newly inhabited,
([Sa2 24:6](../kjv/sa2024.htm#006)). It is conjectured that, instead of
this word, the reading should be, "the Hittites of Kadesh," the Hittite
capital, on the Orontes. It was apparently some region east of the
Jordan and north of Gilead.

<span id="008">**Tale**</span> (1.) Heb. tokhen , "a task," as weighed
and measured out = tally, i.e., the number told off; the full number
([Exo 5:18](../kjv/exo005.htm#018); see [Sa1
18:27](../kjv/sa1018.htm#027); [Ch1 9:28](../kjv/ch1009.htm#028)). In
[Eze 45:11](../kjv/eze045.htm#011) rendered "measure." (2.) Heb. hegeh ,
"a thought;" "meditation" ([Psa 90:9](../kjv/psa090.htm#009)); meaning
properly "as a whisper of sadness," which is soon over, or "as a
thought." The LXX. and Vulgate render it "spider;" the Authorized
Version and Revised Version, "as a tale" that is told. In [Job
37:2](../kjv/job037.htm#002) this word is rendered "sound;" Revised
Version margin, "muttering;" and in [Eze 2:10](../kjv/eze002.htm#010),
"mourning."

<span id="009">**Talent**</span> Of silver contained 3,000 shekels ([Exo
38:25](../kjv/exo038.htm#025), [Exo 38:26](../kjv/exo038.htm#026)), and
was equal to 94 3/7 lb. avoirdupois. The Greek talent, however, as in
the LXX., was only 82 1/4 lb. It was in the form of a circular mass, as
the Hebrew name kikkar denotes. A talent of gold was double the weight
of a talent of silver ([Sa2 12:30](../kjv/sa2012.htm#030)). Parable of
the talents ([Mat 18:24](../kjv/mat018.htm#024); [Mat
25:15](../kjv/mat025.htm#015)).
