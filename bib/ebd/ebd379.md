<span id="000">**Wars of the Lord, The Book of the**</span> ([Num
21:14](../kjv/num021.htm#014), [Num 21:15](../kjv/num021.htm#015)), some
unknown book so called (compare [Gen 14:14](../kjv/gen014.htm#014); [Exo
17:8](../kjv/exo017.htm#008); [Num 14:40](../kjv/num014.htm#040); [Num
21:1](../kjv/num021.htm#001), [Num 21:21](../kjv/num021.htm#021), [Num
21:33](../kjv/num021.htm#033); 31. The wars here recorded might be thus
designated).

<span id="001">**Ward**</span> A prison ([Gen
40:3](../kjv/gen040.htm#003), [Gen 40:4](../kjv/gen040.htm#004)); a
watch station ([Isa 21:8](../kjv/isa021.htm#008)); a guard ([Neh
13:30](../kjv/neh013.htm#030)).

<span id="002">**Washing**</span> ([Mar 7:1](../kjv/mar007.htm#001)).
The Jews, like other Orientals, used their fingers when taking food, and
therefore washed their hands before doing so, for the sake of
cleanliness. Here the reference is to the ablutions prescribed by
tradition, according to which "the disciples ought to have gone down to
the side of the lake, washed their hands thoroughly, 'rubbing the fist
of one hand in the hollow of the other, then placed the ten finger-tips
together, holding the hands up, so that any surplus water might flow
down to the elbow, and thence to the ground.'" To neglect to do this had
come to be regarded as a great sin, a sin equal to the breach of any of
the ten commandments. Moses had commanded washings oft, but always for
some definite cause; but the Jews multiplied the legal observance till
they formed a large body of precepts. To such precepts about ceremonial
washing Mark here refers. (See ABLUTION.)

<span id="003">**Watches**</span> The periods into which the time
between sunset and sunrise was divided. They are so called because
watchmen relieved each other at each of these periods. There are
frequent references in Scripture to the duties of watchmen who were
appointed to give notice of the approach of an enemy ([Sa2
18:24](../kjv/sa2018.htm#024); [Kg2 9:17](../kjv/kg2009.htm#017); [Isa
21:5](../kjv/isa021.htm#005)). They were sometimes placed for this
purpose on watchtowers ([Kg2 17:9](../kjv/kg2017.htm#009); [Kg2
18:8](../kjv/kg2018.htm#008)). Ministers or teachers are also spoken of
under this title ([Jer 6:17](../kjv/jer006.htm#017); [Eze
33:2](../kjv/eze033.htm#002); [Heb 13:17](../kjv/heb013.htm#017)). The
watches of the night were originally three in number, (1.) "the
beginning of the watches" ([Lam 2:19](../kjv/lam002.htm#019)); (2.) "the
middle watch" ([Jdg 7:19](../kjv/jdg007.htm#019)); and (3.) "the morning
watch" ([Exo 14:24](../kjv/exo014.htm#024); [Sa1
11:11](../kjv/sa1011.htm#011)), which extended from two o'clock to
sunrise. But in the New Testament we read of four watches, a division
probably introduced by the Romans ([Mat 14:25](../kjv/mat014.htm#025);
[Mar 6:48](../kjv/mar006.htm#048); [Luk 12:38](../kjv/luk012.htm#038)).
(See DAY.)

<span id="004">**Watchings**</span> ([Co2 6:5](../kjv/co2006.htm#005)),
lit. "sleeplessnesses," the result of "manual labour, teaching,
traveling, meditating, praying, cares, and the like" (Meyer's Com.).

<span id="005">**Water of Jealousy**</span> A phrase employed (not,
however, in Scripture) to denote the water used in the solemn ordeal
prescribed by the law of Moses (Num. 5:11-31) in cases of "jealousy."

<span id="006">**Water of Purification**</span> Used in cases of
ceremonial cleansings at the consecration of the Levites ([Num
8:7](../kjv/num008.htm#007)). It signified, figuratively, that purifying
of the heart which must characterize the servants of God.

<span id="007">**Water of Separation**</span> Used along with the ashes
of a red heifer for the ceremonial cleansing of persons defiled by
contact with a dead body (Num. 19).

<span id="008">**Waterspouts**</span> ([Psa
42:7](../kjv/psa042.htm#007); marg. R.V., "cataracts"). If we regard
this psalm as descriptive of David's feelings when banished from
Jerusalem by the revolt of Absalom, this word may denote "waterfalls,"
inasmuch as Mahanaim, where he abode, was near the Jabbok, and the
region abounded with rapids and falls.

<span id="009">**Wave Offerings**</span> Parts of peace-offerings were
so called, because they were waved by the priests ([Exo
29:24](../kjv/exo029.htm#024), [Exo 29:26](../kjv/exo029.htm#026), [Exo
29:27](../kjv/exo029.htm#027); [Lev 7:20](../kjv/lev007.htm#020); [Lev
8:27](../kjv/lev008.htm#027); [Lev 9:21](../kjv/lev009.htm#021); [Lev
10:14](../kjv/lev010.htm#014), [Lev 10:15](../kjv/lev010.htm#015),
etc.), in token of a solemn special presentation to God. They then
became the property of the priests. The first-fruits, a sheaf of barley,
offered at the feast of Pentecost ([Lev 23:17](../kjv/lev023.htm#017)),
and wheat-bread, the first-fruits of the second harvest, offered at the
Passover ([Lev 23:10](../kjv/lev023.htm#010)), were wave-offerings.
