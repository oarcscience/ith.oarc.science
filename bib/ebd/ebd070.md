<span id="000">**Camel**</span> From the Hebrew gamal, "to repay" or
"requite," as the camel does the care of its master. There are two
distinct species of camels, having, however, the common characteristics
of being "ruminants without horns, without muzzle, with nostrils forming
oblique slits, the upper lip divided and separately movable and
extensile, the soles of the feet horny, with two toes covered by claws,
the limbs long, the abdomen drawn up, while the neck, long and slender,
is bent up and down, the reverse of that of a horse, which is arched."
(1.) The Bactrian camel is distinguished by two humps. It is a native of
the high table-lands of Central Asia. (2.) The Arabian camel or
dromedary, from the Greek dromos , "a runner" ([Isa
60:6](../kjv/isa060.htm#006); [Jer 2:23](../kjv/jer002.htm#023).md), has
but one hump, and is a native of Western Asia or Africa. The camel was
early used both for riding and as a beast of burden ([Gen
24:64](../kjv/gen024.htm#064); [Gen 37:25](../kjv/gen037.htm#025).md), and
in war ([Sa1 30:17](../kjv/sa1030.htm#017.md); [Isa
21:7](../kjv/isa021.htm#007).md). Mention is made of the camel among the
cattle given by Pharaoh to Abraham ([Gen 12:16](../kjv/gen012.htm#016).md).
Its flesh was not to be eaten, as it was ranked among unclean animals
([Lev 11:4](../kjv/lev011.htm#004); [Deu 14:7](../kjv/deu014.htm#007).md).
Abraham's servant rode on a camel when he went to fetch a wife for Isaac
([Gen 24:10](../kjv/gen024.htm#010.md), [Gen
24:11](../kjv/gen024.htm#011).md). Jacob had camels as a portion of his
wealth ([Gen 30:43](../kjv/gen030.htm#043).md), as Abraham also had ([Gen
24:35](../kjv/gen024.htm#035).md). He sent a present of thirty milch camels
to his brother Esau ([Gen 32:15](../kjv/gen032.htm#015).md). It appears to
have been little in use among the Jews after the conquest. It is,
however, mentioned in the history of David ([Ch1
27:30](../kjv/ch1027.htm#030).md), and after the Exile ([Ezr
2:67](../kjv/ezr002.htm#067); [Neh 7:69](../kjv/neh007.htm#069).md). Camels
were much in use among other nations in the East. The queen of Sheba
came with a caravan of camels when she came to see the wisdom of Solomon
([Kg1 10:2](../kjv/kg1010.htm#002); [Ch2 9:1](../kjv/ch2009.htm#001).md).
Benhadad of Damascus also sent a present to Elisha, "forty camels'
burden" ([Kg2 8:9](../kjv/kg2008.htm#009).md). To show the difficulty in
the way of a rich man's entering into the kingdom, our Lord uses the
proverbial expression that it was easier for a camel to go through the
eye of a needle ([Mat 19:24](../kjv/mat019.htm#024).md). To strain at
(rather, out) a gnat and swallow a camel was also a proverbial
expression ([Mat 23:24](../kjv/mat023.htm#024).md), used with reference to
those who were careful to avoid small faults, and yet did not hesitate
to commit the greatest sins. The Jews carefully filtered their wine
before drinking it, for fear of swallowing along with it some insect
forbidden in the law as unclean, and yet they omitted openly the
"weightier matters" of the law. The raiment worn by John the Baptist was
made of camel's hair ([Mat 3:4](../kjv/mat003.htm#004.md); [Mar
1:6](../kjv/mar001.htm#006).md), by which he was distinguished from those
who resided in royal palaces and wore soft raiment. This was also the
case with Elijah ([Kg2 1:8](../kjv/kg2001.htm#008).md), who is called "a
hairy man," from his wearing such raiment. "This is one of the most
admirable materials for clothing; it keeps out the heat, cold, and
rain." The "sackcloth" so often alluded to ([Kg2
1:8](../kjv/kg2001.htm#008); [Isa 15:3](../kjv/isa015.htm#003.md); [Zac
13:4](../kjv/zac013.htm#004), etc..md) was probably made of camel's hair.

<span id="001">**Camon**</span> Full of stalks, a place ([Jdg
10:5](../kjv/jdg010.htm#005).md) where Jair was buried. It has usually been
supposed to have been a city of Gilead, on the east of Jordan. It is
probably, however, the modern Tell-el-Kaimun, on the southern slopes of
Carmel, the Jokneam of Carmel ([Jos 12:22](../kjv/jos012.htm#022.md); [Kg1
4:12](../kjv/kg1004.htm#012).md), since it is not at all unlikely that
after he became judge, Jair might find it more convenient to live on the
west side of Jordan; and that he was buried where he had lived.

<span id="002">**Camp**</span> During their journeys across the
wilderness, the twelve tribes formed encampments at the different places
where they halted ([Exo 16:13](../kjv/exo016.htm#013.md); [Num
2:3](../kjv/num002.htm#003).md). The diagram here given shows the position
of the different tribes and the form of the encampment during the
wanderings, according to [Num 1:53](../kjv/num001.htm#053.md); 2:2-31; [Num
3:29](../kjv/num003.htm#029), [Num 3:35](../kjv/num003.htm#035.md), [Num
3:38](../kjv/num003.htm#038.md); 10:13-28. The area of the camp would be in
all about 3 square miles. After the Hebrews entered Palestine, the camps
then spoken of were exclusively warlike ([Jos
11:5](../kjv/jos011.htm#005), [Jos 11:7](../kjv/jos011.htm#007.md); [Jdg
5:19](../kjv/jdg005.htm#019), [Jdg 5:21](../kjv/jdg005.htm#021.md); [Jdg
7:1](../kjv/jdg007.htm#001); [Sa1 29:1](../kjv/sa1029.htm#001.md); [Sa1
30:9](../kjv/sa1030.htm#009), etc..md). Arrangement of the Tribal Camps Dan

<span id="003">**Camphire**</span> (Heb. copher ), mentioned in [Sol
1:14](../kjv/sol001.htm#014) (R.V., "henna-flowers".md); [Sol
4:13](../kjv/sol004.htm#013) (R.V., "henna".md), is the al-henna of the
Arabs, a native of Egypt, producing clusters of small white and yellow
odoriferous flowers, whence is made the Oleum Cyprineum. From its leaves
is made the peculiar auburn dye with which Eastern women stain their
nails and the palms of their hands. It is found only at Engedi, on the
shore of the Dead Sea. It is known to botanists by the name Lawsonia
alba or inermis, a kind of privet, which grows 6 or 8 feet high. The
margin of the Authorized Version of the passages above referred to has
"or cypress," not with reference to the conifer so called, but to the
circumstance that one of the most highly appreciated species of this
plant grew in the island of Cyprus.

<span id="004">**Cana**</span> Reedy, a town of Galilee, near Capernaum.
Here our Lord wrought his first miracle, the turning of water into wine
([Joh 2:1](../kjv/joh002.htm#001); [Joh 4:46](../kjv/joh004.htm#046).md).
It is also mentioned as the birth-place of Nathanael ([Joh
21:2](../kjv/joh021.htm#002).md). It is not mentioned in the Old Testament.
It has been identified with the modern Kana el-Jelil, also called
Khurbet Kana, a place 8 or 9 miles north of Nazareth. Others have
identified it with Kefr Kenna, which lies on the direct road to the Sea
of Galilee, about 5 miles north-east of Nazareth, and 12 in a direct
course from Tiberias. It is called "Cana of Galilee," to distinguish it
from Cana of Asher ([Jos 19:28](../kjv/jos019.htm#028).md).

<span id="005">**Canaan**</span> (1.) The fourth son of Ham ([Gen
10:6](../kjv/gen010.htm#006).md). His descendants were under a curse in
consequence of the transgression of his father ([Gen
9:22](../kjv/gen009.htm#022).md). His eldest son, Zidon, was the father of
the Sidonians and Phoenicians. He had eleven sons, who were the founders
of as many tribes ([Gen 10:15](../kjv/gen010.htm#015)). (2..md) The country
which derived its name from the preceding. The name as first used by the
Phoenicians denoted only the maritime plain on which Sidon was built.
But in the time of Moses and Joshua it denoted the whole country to the
west of the Jordan and the Dead Sea ([Deu
11:30](../kjv/deu011.htm#030)). In [Jos 5:12](../kjv/jos005.htm#012.md) the
LXX. read, "land of the Phoenicians," instead of "land of Canaan." The
name signifies "the lowlands," as distinguished from the land of Gilead
on the east of Jordan, which was a mountainous district. The extent and
boundaries of Canaan are fully set forth in different parts of Scripture
([Gen 10:19](../kjv/gen010.htm#019); [Gen 17:8](../kjv/gen017.htm#008.md);
[Num 13:29](../kjv/num013.htm#029); [Num 34:8](../kjv/num034.htm#008).md).
(See CANAANITES, PALESTINE.)

<span id="006">**Canaan, The Language of**</span> Mentioned in [Isa
19:18](../kjv/isa019.htm#018.md), denotes the language spoken by the Jews
resident in Palestine. The language of the Canaanites and of the Hebrews
was substantially the same. This is seen from the fragments of the
Phoenician language which still survive, which show the closest analogy
to the Hebrew. Yet the subject of the language of the "Canaanites" is
very obscure. The cuneiform writing of Babylon, as well as the
Babylonian language, was taught in the Canaanitish schools, and the clay
tablets of Babylonian literature were stored in the Canaanitish
libraries. Even the Babylonian divinities were borrowed by the
Canaanites.

<span id="007">**Canaanites**</span> The descendants of Canaan, the son
of Ham. Migrating from their original home, they seem to have reached
the Persian Gulf, and to have there so-journed for some time. They
thence "spread to the west, across the mountain chain of Lebanon to the
very edge of the Mediterranean Sea, occupying all the land which later
became Palestine, also to the north-west as far as the mountain chain of
Taurus. This group was very numerous, and broken up into a great many
peoples, as we can judge from the list of nations (Gen. 10), the 'sons
of Canaan.'" Six different tribes are mentioned in [Exo
3:8](../kjv/exo003.htm#008), [Exo 3:17](../kjv/exo003.htm#017.md); [Exo
23:23](../kjv/exo023.htm#023); [Exo 33:2](../kjv/exo033.htm#002.md); [Exo
34:11](../kjv/exo034.htm#011). In [Exo 13:5](../kjv/exo013.htm#005.md) the
"Perizzites" are omitted. The "Girgashites" are mentioned in addition to
the foregoing in [Deu 7:1](../kjv/deu007.htm#001.md); [Jos
3:10](../kjv/jos003.htm#010.md). The "Canaanites," as distinguished from
the Amalekites, the Anakim, and the Rephaim, were "dwellers in the
lowlands" ([Num 13:29](../kjv/num013.htm#029).md), the great plains and
valleys, the richest and most important parts of Palestine. Tyre and
Sidon, their famous cities, were the centres of great commercial
activity; and hence the name "Canaanite" came to signify a "trader" or
"merchant" ([Job 41:6](../kjv/job041.htm#006.md); [Pro
31:24](../kjv/pro031.htm#024.md), lit. "Canaanites;" compare [Zep
1:11](../kjv/zep001.htm#011); [Eze 17:4](../kjv/eze017.htm#004).md). The
name "Canaanite" is also sometimes used to designate the non-Israelite
inhabitants of the land in general ([Gen 12:6](../kjv/gen012.htm#006.md);
[Num 21:3](../kjv/num021.htm#003); [Jdg 1:10](../kjv/jdg001.htm#010).md).
The Israelites, when they were led to the Promised Land, were commanded
utterly to destroy the descendants of Canaan then possessing it ([Exo
23:23](../kjv/exo023.htm#023); [Num 33:52](../kjv/num033.htm#052.md), [Num
33:53](../kjv/num033.htm#053); [Deu 20:16](../kjv/deu020.htm#016.md), [Deu
20:17](../kjv/deu020.htm#017).md). This was to be done "by little and
little," lest the beasts of the field should increase ([Exo
23:29](../kjv/exo023.htm#029); [Deu 7:22](../kjv/deu007.htm#022.md), [Deu
7:23](../kjv/deu007.htm#023).md). The history of these wars of conquest is
given in the Book of Joshua. The extermination of these tribes, however,
was never fully carried out. Jerusalem was not taken till the time of
David ([Sa2 5:6](../kjv/sa2005.htm#006.md), [Sa2
5:7](../kjv/sa2005.htm#007).md). In the days of Solomon bond-service was
exacted from the fragments of the tribes still remaining in the land
([Kg1 9:20](../kjv/kg1009.htm#020), [Kg1 9:21](../kjv/kg1009.htm#021).md).
Even after the return from captivity survivors of five of the
Canaanitish tribes were still found in the land. In the Tell-el-Amarna
tablets Canaan is found under the forms of Kinakhna and Kinakhkhi. Under
the name of Kanana the Canaanites appear on Egyptian monuments, wearing
a coat of mail and helmet, and distinguished by the use of spear and
javelin and the battle-axe. They were called Phoenicians by the Greeks
and Poeni by the Romans. By race the Canaanites were Semitic. They were
famous as merchants and seamen, as well as for their artistic skill. The
chief object of their worship was the sun-god, who was addressed by the
general name of Baal, "lord." Each locality had its special Baal, and
the various local Baals were summed up under the name of Baalim,
"lords."

<span id="008">**Canaanite**</span> A name given to the apostle Simon
([Mat 10:4](../kjv/mat010.htm#004); [Mar 3:18](../kjv/mar003.htm#018).md).
The word here does not, however, mean a descendant of Canaan, but is a
translation, or rather almost a transliteration, of the Syriac word
Kanenyeh (R.V. rendered "Cananaen"), which designates the Jewish sect of
the Zealots. Hence he is called elsewhere ([Luk
6:15](../kjv/luk006.htm#015).md) "Simon Zelotes;" i.e., Simon of the sect
of the Zealots. (See SIMON.)

<span id="009">**Candace**</span> The queen of the Ethiopians whose
"eunuch" or chamberlain was converted to Christianity by the
instrumentality of Philip the evangelist ([Act
8:27](../kjv/act008.htm#027).md). The country which she ruled was called by
the Greeks Meroe, in Upper Nubia. It was long the centre of commercial
intercourse between Africa and the south of Asia, and hence became
famous for its wealth ([Isa 45:14](../kjv/isa045.htm#014).md). It is
somewhat singular that female sovereignty seems to have prevailed in
Ethiopia, the name Candace (compare "Pharaoh," "Ptolemy," "Caesar")
being a title common to several successive queens. It is probable that
Judaism had taken root in Ethiopia at this time, and hence the visit of
the queen's treasurer to Jerusalem to keep the feast. There is a
tradition that Candace was herself converted to Christianity by her
treasurer on his return, and that he became the apostle of Christianity
in that whole region, carrying it also into Abyssinia. It is said that
he also preached the gospel in Arabia Felix and in Ceylon, where he
suffered martyrdom. (See PHILIP.)
