<span id="000">**Threshold**</span> (1.) Heb. miphtan , probably a
projecting beam at a higher point than the threshold proper ([Sa1
5:4](../kjv/sa1005.htm#004), [Sa1 5:5](../kjv/sa1005.htm#005.md); [Eze
9:3](../kjv/eze009.htm#003); [Eze 10:4](../kjv/eze010.htm#004.md), [Eze
10:18](../kjv/eze010.htm#018); [Eze 46:2](../kjv/eze046.htm#002.md); [Eze
47:1](../kjv/eze047.htm#001).md); also rendered "door" and "door-post."
(2.) 'Asuppim , pl. ([Neh 12:25](../kjv/neh012.htm#025).md), rendered
correctly "storehouses" in the Revised Version. In [Ch1
26:15](../kjv/ch1026.htm#015), [Ch1 26:17](../kjv/ch1026.htm#017.md) the
Authorized Version retains the word as a proper name, while in the
Revised Version it is translated "storehouses."

<span id="001">**Throne**</span> (Heb. kiss'e ), a royal chair or seat
of dignity ([Deu 17:18](../kjv/deu017.htm#018.md); [Sa2
7:13](../kjv/sa2007.htm#013); [Psa 45:6](../kjv/psa045.htm#006).md); an
elevated seat with a canopy and hangings, which cover it. It denotes the
seat of the high priest in [Sa1 1:9](../kjv/sa1001.htm#009.md); [Sa1
4:13](../kjv/sa1004.htm#013.md), and of a provincial governor in [Neh
3:7](../kjv/neh003.htm#007) and [Psa 122:5](../kjv/psa122.htm#005.md). The
throne of Solomon is described at length in [Kg1
10:18](../kjv/kg1010.htm#018.md).

<span id="002">**Thummim**</span> Perfection (LXX., "truth;" Vulg.,
"veritas"), [Exo 28:30](../kjv/exo028.htm#030.md); [Deu
33:8](../kjv/deu033.htm#008); [Jdg 1:1](../kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md); [Jdg
20:18](../kjv/jdg020.htm#018); [Sa1 14:3](../kjv/sa1014.htm#003.md), [Sa1
14:18](../kjv/sa1014.htm#018); [Sa1 23:9](../kjv/sa1023.htm#009.md); [Sa2
21:1](../kjv/sa2021.htm#001.md). What the "Urim and Thummim" were cannot be
determined with any certainty. All we certainly know is that they were a
certain divinely-given means by which God imparted, through the high
priest, direction and counsel to Israel when these were needed. The
method by which this was done can be only a matter of mere conjecture.
They were apparently material objects, quite distinct from the
breastplate, but something added to it after all the stones had been set
in it, something in addition to the breastplate and its jewels. They may
have been, as some suppose, two small images, like the teraphim (compare
[Jdg 17:5](../kjv/jdg017.htm#005); [Jdg 18:14](../kjv/jdg018.htm#014.md),
[Jdg 18:17](../kjv/jdg018.htm#017), [Jdg 18:20](../kjv/jdg018.htm#020.md);
[Hos 3:4](../kjv/hos003.htm#004).md), which were kept in the bag of the
breastplate, by which, in some unknown way, the high priest could give
forth his divinely imparted decision when consulted. They were probably
lost at the destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar. They were never
seen after the return from captivity.

<span id="003">**Thunder**</span> Often referred to in Scripture ([Job
40:9](../kjv/job040.htm#009); [Psa 77:18](../kjv/psa077.htm#018.md); [Psa
104:7](../kjv/psa104.htm#007).md). James and John were called by our Lord
"sons of thunder" ([Mar 3:17](../kjv/mar003.htm#017).md). In [Job
39:19](../kjv/job039.htm#019.md), instead of "thunder," as in the
Authorized Version, the Revised Version translates ( ra'amah ) by
"quivering main" (marg., "shaking"). Thunder accompanied the giving of
the law at Sinai ([Exo 19:16](../kjv/exo019.htm#016).md). It was regarded
as the voice of God ([Job 37:2](../kjv/job037.htm#002.md); [Psa
18:13](../kjv/psa018.htm#013); [Psa 81:7](../kjv/psa081.htm#007.md);
compare [Joh 12:29](../kjv/joh012.htm#029).md). In answer to Samuel's
prayer ([Sa1 12:17](../kjv/sa1012.htm#017.md), [Sa1
12:18](../kjv/sa1012.htm#018).md), God sent thunder, and "all the people
greatly feared," for at such a season (the wheat-harvest) thunder and
rain were almost unknown in Palestine.

<span id="004">**Thyatira**</span> A city of Asia Minor, on the borders
of Lydia and Mysia. Its modern name is Ak-hissar, i.e., "white castle."
Here was one of the seven churches ([Rev 1:11](../kjv/rev001.htm#011.md);
[Rev 2:18](../kjv/rev002.htm#018).md). Lydia, the seller of purple, or
rather of cloth dyed with this colour, was from this city ([Act
16:14](../kjv/act016.htm#014).md). It was and still is famous for its
dyeing. Among the ruins, inscriptions have been found relating to the
guild of dyers in that city in ancient times.

<span id="005">**Thyine Wood**</span> Mentioned only in [Rev
18:12](../kjv/rev018.htm#012.md) among the articles which would cease to be
purchased when Babylon fell. It was called citrus, citron wood, by the
Romans. It was the Callitris quadrivalvis of botanists, of the
cone-bearing order of trees, and of the cypress tribe of this order. The
name of this wood is derived from the Greek word thuein , "to
sacrifice," and it was so called because it was burnt in sacrifices, on
account of its fragrance. The wood of this tree was reckoned very
valuable, and was used for making articles of furniture by the Greeks
and Romans. Like the cedars of Lebanon, it is disappearing from the
forests of Palestine.

<span id="006">**Tiberias**</span> A city, the modern Tubarich, on the
western shore of the Sea of Tiberias. It is said to have been founded by
Herod Antipas (A.D.16), on the site of the ruins of an older city called
Rakkath, and to have been thus named by him after the Emperor Tiberius.
It is mentioned only three times in the history of our Lord ([Joh
6:1](../kjv/joh006.htm#001), [Joh 6:23](../kjv/joh006.htm#023.md); [Joh
21:1](../kjv/joh021.htm#001).md). In 1837 about one-half of the inhabitants
perished by an earthquake. The population of the city is now about six
thousand, nearly the one-half being Jews. "We do not read that our Lord
ever entered this city. The reason of this is probably to be found in
the fact that it was practically a heathen city, though standing upon
Jewish soil. Herod, its founder, had brought together the arts of
Greece, the idolatry of Rome, and the gross lewdness of Asia. There were
in it a theatre for the performance of comedies, a forum, a stadium, a
palace roofed with gold in imitation of those in Italy, statues of the
Roman gods, and busts of the deified emperors. He who was not sent but
to the lost sheep of the house of Israel might well hold himself aloof
from such scenes as these" (Manning's Those Holy Fields). After the fall
of Jerusalem (A.D. 70), Tiberias became one of the chief residences of
the Jews in Palestine. It was for more than three hundred years their
metropolis. from about A.D.150 the Sanhedrin settled here, and
established rabbinical schools, which rose to great celebrity. Here the
Jerusalem (or Palestinian) Talmud was compiled about the beginning of
the fifth century. To this same rabbinical school also we are indebted
for the Masora, a "body of traditions which transmitted the readings of
the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, and preserved, by means of the
vowel-system, the pronunciation of the Hebrew." In its original form,
and in all manuscripts, the Hebrew is written without vowels; hence,
when it ceased to be a spoken language, the importance of knowing what
vowels to insert between the consonants. This is supplied by the Masora,
and hence these vowels are called the "Masoretic vowel-points."

<span id="007">**Tiberias, Sea of**</span> Called also the Sea of
Galilee (q.v.) and of Gennesaret. In the Old Testament it is called the
Sea of Chinnereth or Chinneroth. John ([Joh
21:1](../kjv/joh021.htm#001).md) is the only evangelist who so designates
this lake. His doing so incidentally confirms the opinion that he wrote
after the other evangelists, and at a period subsequent to the taking of
Jerusalem (A.D. 70). Tiberias had by this time become an important city,
having been spared by the Romans, and made the capital of the province
when Jerusalem was destroyed. It thus naturally gave its name to the
lake.

<span id="008">**Tiberius Caesar**</span> I.e., as known in Roman
history, Tiberius Claudius Nero, only mentioned in [Luk
3:1](../kjv/luk003.htm#001.md). He was the stepson of Augustus, whom he
succeeded on the throne, A.D. 14. He was noted for his vicious and
infamous life. In the fifteenth year of his reign John the Baptist
entered on his public ministry, and under him also our Lord taught and
suffered. He died A.D.37. He is frequently referred to simply as
"Caesar" ([Mat 22:17](../kjv/mat022.htm#017.md), [Mat
22:21](../kjv/mat022.htm#021); [Mar 12:14](../kjv/mar012.htm#014.md), [Mar
12:16](../kjv/mar012.htm#016), [Mar 12:17](../kjv/mar012.htm#017.md); [Luk
20:22](../kjv/luk020.htm#022), [Luk 20:24](../kjv/luk020.htm#024.md), [Luk
20:25](../kjv/luk020.htm#025); [Luk 23:2](../kjv/luk023.htm#002.md); [Joh
19:12](../kjv/joh019.htm#012), [Joh 19:15](../kjv/joh019.htm#015).md).

<span id="009">**Tibni**</span> Building of Jehovah, the son of Ginath,
a man of some position, whom a considerable number of the people chose
as monarch. For the period of four years he contended for the throne
with Omri ([Kg1 16:21](../kjv/kg1016.htm#021.md), [Kg1
16:22](../kjv/kg1016.htm#022).md), who at length gained the mastery, and
became sole monarch of Israel.
