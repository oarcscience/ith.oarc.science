------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Coffer**</span> The receptacle or small box placed
beside the ark by the Philistines, in which they deposited the golden
mice and the emerods as their trespass-offering ([Sa1
6:8](../kjv/sa1006.htm#008), [Sa1 6:11](../kjv/sa1006.htm#011.md), [Sa1
6:15](../kjv/sa1006.htm#015).md).

<span id="001">**Coffin**</span> Used in [Gen
50:26](../kjv/gen050.htm#026.md) with reference to the burial of Joseph.
Here, it means a mummy - chest. The same Hebrew word is rendered "chest"
in [Kg2 12:9](../kjv/kg2012.htm#009.md), [Kg2
12:10](../kjv/kg2012.htm#010.md).

<span id="002">**Cogitations**</span> (or "thoughts," as the Chaldee
word in [Dan 7:28](../kjv/dan007.htm#028) literally means.md), earnest
meditation.

<span id="003">**Coin**</span> Before the Exile the Jews had no
regularly stamped money. They made use of uncoined shekels or talents of
silver, which they weighed out ([Gen 23:16](../kjv/gen023.htm#016.md); [Exo
38:24](../kjv/exo038.htm#024); [Sa2 18:12](../kjv/sa2018.htm#012).md).
Probably the silver ingots used in the time of Abraham may have been of
a fixed weight, which was in some way indicated on them. The "pieces of
silver" paid by Abimelech to Abraham ([Gen
20:16](../kjv/gen020.htm#016).md), and those also for which Joseph was sold
([Gen 37:28](../kjv/gen037.htm#028).md), were proably in the form of rings.
The shekel was the common standard of weight and value among the Hebrews
down to the time of the Captivity. Only once is a shekel of gold
mentioned ([Ch1 21:25](../kjv/ch1021.htm#025).md). The "six thousand of
gold" mentioned in the transaction between Naaman and Gehazi ([Kg2
5:5](../kjv/kg2005.htm#005).md) were probably so many shekels of gold. The
"piece of money" mentioned in [Job 42:11](../kjv/job042.htm#011.md); [Gen
33:19](../kjv/gen033.htm#019) (marg., "lambs".md) was the Hebrew kesitah,
probably an uncoined piece of silver of a certain weight in the form of
a sheep or lamb, or perhaps having on it such an impression. The same
Hebrew word is used in [Jos 24:32](../kjv/jos024.htm#032.md), which is
rendered by Wickliffe "an hundred yonge scheep."

<span id="004">**Collar**</span> (Heb. peh ), means in [Job
30:18](../kjv/job030.htm#018.md) the mouth or opening of the garment that
closes round the neck in the same way as a tunic ([Exo
39:23](../kjv/exo039.htm#023)). The "collars" (Heb. netiphoth .md) among
the spoils of the Midianites ([Jdg 8:26](../kjv/jdg008.htm#026.md); R.V.,
"pendants") were ear-drops. The same Hebrew word is rendered "chains" in
[Isa 3:19](../kjv/isa003.htm#019.md).

<span id="005">**Collection**</span> The Christians in Palestine, from
various causes, suffered from poverty. Paul awakened an interest in them
among the Gentile churches, and made pecuniary collections in their
behalf ([Act 24:17](../kjv/act024.htm#017.md); [Rom
15:25](../kjv/rom015.htm#025), [Rom 15:26](../kjv/rom015.htm#026.md); [Co1
16:1](../kjv/co1016.htm#001); [Co2 8:9](../kjv/co2008.htm#009.md); [Gal
2:10](../kjv/gal002.htm#010).md).

<span id="006">**College**</span> Heb. mishneh ([Kg2
22:14](../kjv/kg2022.htm#014); [Ch2 34:22](../kjv/ch2034.htm#022).md),
rendered in Revised Version "second quarter", the residence of the
prophetess Huldah. The Authorized Version followed the Jewish
commentators, word its post-Biblical sense, as if it meant a place of
instruction. It properly meant a place of instruction. It properly means
the "second," and may therefore denote the lower city (Acra), which was
built after the portion of the city on Mount Zion, and was enclosed by a
second wall.

<span id="007">**Colony**</span> The city of Philippi was a Roman colony
([Act 16:12](../kjv/act016.htm#012).md), i.e., a military settlement of
Roman soldiers and citizens, planted there to keep in subjection a
newly-conquered district. A colony was Rome in miniature, under Roman
municipal law, but governed by military officers (praetors and lictors),
not by proconsuls. It had an independent internal government, the jus
Italicum; i.e., the privileges of Italian citizens.

<span id="008">**Colour**</span> The subject of colours holds an
important place in the Scriptures. White occurs as the translation of
various Hebrew words. It is applied to milk ([Gen
49:12](../kjv/gen049.htm#012).md), manna ([Exo
16:31](../kjv/exo016.htm#031).md), snow ([Isa
1:18](../kjv/isa001.htm#018).md), horses ([Zac
1:8](../kjv/zac001.htm#008).md), raiment ([Ecc
9:8](../kjv/ecc009.htm#008).md). Another Hebrew word so rendered is applied
to marble ([Est 1:6](../kjv/est001.htm#006).md), and a cognate word to the
lily ([Sol 2:16](../kjv/sol002.htm#016).md). A different term, meaning
"dazzling," is applied to the countenance ([Sol
5:10](../kjv/sol005.htm#010).md). This colour was an emblem of purity and
innocence ([Mar 16:5](../kjv/mar016.htm#005.md); [Joh
20:12](../kjv/joh020.htm#012); [Rev 19:8](../kjv/rev019.htm#008.md), [Rev
19:14](../kjv/rev019.htm#014).md), of joy ([Ecc
9:8](../kjv/ecc009.htm#008).md), and also of victory ([Zac
6:3](../kjv/zac006.htm#003); [Rev 6:2](../kjv/rev006.htm#002).md). The
hangings of the tabernacle court ([Exo 27:9](../kjv/exo027.htm#009.md);
[Exo 38:9](../kjv/exo038.htm#009).md), the coats, mitres, bonnets, and
breeches of the priests ([Exo 39:27](../kjv/exo039.htm#027.md), [Exo
39:28](../kjv/exo039.htm#028).md), and the dress of the high priest on the
day of Atonement ([Lev 16:4](../kjv/lev016.htm#004.md), [Lev
16:32](../kjv/lev016.htm#032).md), were white. Black, applied to the hair
([Lev 13:31](../kjv/lev013.htm#031); [Sol 5:11](../kjv/sol005.htm#011).md),
the complexion ([Sol 1:5](../kjv/sol001.htm#005).md), and to horses ([Zac
6:2](../kjv/zac006.htm#002), [Zac 6:6](../kjv/zac006.htm#006).md). The word
rendered "brown" in [Gen 30:32](../kjv/gen030.htm#032) (R.V., "black".md)
means properly "scorched", i.e., the colour produced by the influence of
the sun's rays. "Black" in [Job 30:30](../kjv/job030.htm#030.md) means
dirty, blackened by sorrow and disease. The word is applied to a
mourner's robes ([Jer 8:21](../kjv/jer008.htm#021.md); [Jer
14:2](../kjv/jer014.htm#002).md), to a clouded sky ([Kg1
18:45](../kjv/kg1018.htm#045).md), to night ([Mic
3:6](../kjv/mic003.htm#006); [Jer 4:28](../kjv/jer004.htm#028).md), and to
a brook rendered turbid by melted snow ([Job
6:16](../kjv/job006.htm#016).md). It is used as symbolical of evil in [Zac
6:2](../kjv/zac006.htm#002), [Zac 6:6](../kjv/zac006.htm#006.md); [Rev
6:5](../kjv/rev006.htm#005.md). It was the emblem of mourning, affliction,
calamity ([Jer 14:2](../kjv/jer014.htm#002.md); [Lam
4:8](../kjv/lam004.htm#008); [Lam 5:10](../kjv/lam005.htm#010).md). Red,
applied to blood (2 Kings 3; 22), a heifer ([Num
19:2](../kjv/num019.htm#002).md), pottage of lentis ([Gen
25:30](../kjv/gen025.htm#030).md), a horse ([Zac
1:8](../kjv/zac001.htm#008)), wine ([Pro 23:31](../kjv/pro023.htm#031).md),
the complexion ([Gen 25:25](../kjv/gen025.htm#025.md); [Sol
5:10](../kjv/sol005.htm#010).md). This colour is symbolical of bloodshed
([Zac 6:2](../kjv/zac006.htm#002); [Rev 6:4](../kjv/rev006.htm#004.md);
[Rev 12:3](../kjv/rev012.htm#003).md). Purple, a colour obtained from the
secretion of a species of shell-fish (the Murex trunculus) which was
found in the Mediterranean, and particularly on the coasts of Phoenicia
and Asia Minor. The colouring matter in each separate shell-fish
amounted to only a single drop, and hence the great value of this dye.
Robes of this colour were worn by kings ([Jdg
8:26](../kjv/jdg008.htm#026).md) and high officers ([Est
8:15](../kjv/est008.htm#015).md). They were also worn by the wealthy and
luxurious ([Jer 10:9](../kjv/jer010.htm#009.md); [Eze
27:7](../kjv/eze027.htm#007); [Luk 16:19](../kjv/luk016.htm#019.md); [Rev
17:4](../kjv/rev017.htm#004).md). With this colour was associated the idea
of royalty and majesty ([Jdg 8:26](../kjv/jdg008.htm#026.md); [Sol
3:10](../kjv/sol003.htm#010); [Sol 7:5](../kjv/sol007.htm#005.md); [Dan
5:7](../kjv/dan005.htm#007), [Dan 5:16](../kjv/dan005.htm#016.md), [Dan
5:29](../kjv/dan005.htm#029).md). Blue. This colour was also procured from
a species of shell-fish, the chelzon of the Hebrews, and the Helix
ianthina of modern naturalists. The tint was emblematic of the sky, the
deep dark hue of the Eastern sky. This colour was used in the same way
as purple. The ribbon and fringe of the Hebrew dress were of this colour
([Num 15:38](../kjv/num015.htm#038).md). The loops of the curtains ([Exo
26:4](../kjv/exo026.htm#004).md), the lace of the high priest's
breastplate, the robe of the ephod, and the lace on his mitre, were blue
([Exo 28:28](../kjv/exo028.htm#028), [Exo 28:31](../kjv/exo028.htm#031.md),
[Exo 28:37](../kjv/exo028.htm#037).md). Scarlet, or Crimson. In [Isa
1:18](../kjv/isa001.htm#018.md) a Hebrew word is used which denotes the
worm or grub whence this dye was procured. In [Gen
38:28](../kjv/gen038.htm#028), [Gen 38:30](../kjv/gen038.htm#030.md), the
word so rendered means "to shine," and expresses the brilliancy of the
colour. The small parasitic insects from which this dye was obtained
somewhat resembled the cochineal which is found in Eastern countries. It
is called by naturalists Coccus ilics. The dye was procured from the
female grub alone. The only natural object to which this colour is
applied in Scripture is the lips, which are likened to a scarlet thread
([Sol 4:3](../kjv/sol004.htm#003).md). Scarlet robes were worn by the rich
and luxurious ([Sa2 1:24](../kjv/sa2001.htm#024.md); [Pro
31:21](../kjv/pro031.htm#021); [Jer 4:30](../kjv/jer004.htm#030.md); [Rev
17:4](../kjv/rev017.htm#004).md). It was also the hue of the warrior's
dress ([Nah 2:3](../kjv/nah002.htm#003.md); [Isa
9:5](../kjv/isa009.htm#005).md). The Phoenicians excelled in the art of
dyeing this colour ([Ch2 2:7](../kjv/ch2002.htm#007).md). These four
colours - white, purple, blue, and scarlet - were used in the textures
of the tabernacle curtains ([Exo 26:1](../kjv/exo026.htm#001.md), [Exo
26:31](../kjv/exo026.htm#031), [Exo 26:36](../kjv/exo026.htm#036).md), and
also in the high priest's ephod, girdle, and breastplate ([Exo
28:5](../kjv/exo028.htm#005), [Exo 28:6](../kjv/exo028.htm#006.md), [Exo
28:8](../kjv/exo028.htm#008), [Exo 28:15](../kjv/exo028.htm#015).md).
Scarlet thread is mentioned in connection with the rites of cleansing
the leper ([Lev 14:4](../kjv/lev014.htm#004.md), [Lev
14:6](../kjv/lev014.htm#006), [Lev 14:51](../kjv/lev014.htm#051).md) and of
burning the red heifer ([Num 19:6](../kjv/num019.htm#006).md). It was a
crimson thread that Rahab was to bind on her window as a sign that she
was to be saved alive ([Jos 2:18](../kjv/jos002.htm#018.md); [Jos
6:25](../kjv/jos006.htm#025).md) when the city of Jericho was taken.
Vermilion, the red sulphuret of mercury, or cinnabar; a colour used for
drawing the figures of idols on the walls of temples ([Eze
23:14](../kjv/eze023.htm#014).md), or for decorating the walls and beams of
houses ([Jer 22:14](../kjv/jer022.htm#014).md).

<span id="009">**Colossae**</span> Or Colosse, a city of Phrygia, on the
Lycus, which is a tributary of the Maeander. It was about 12 miles above
Laodicea, and near the greatroad from Ephesus to the Euphrates, and was
consequently of some mercantile importance. It does not appear that Paul
had visited this city when he wrote his letter to the church there ([Col
1:2](../kjv/col001.htm#002).md). He expresses in his letter to Philemon
([Col 1:22](../kjv/col001.htm#022).md) his hope to visit it on being
delivered from his imprisonment. From [Col 1:7](../kjv/col001.htm#007.md);
[Col 4:12](../kjv/col004.htm#012.md) it has been concluded that Epaphras
was the founder of the Colossian church. This town afterwards fell into
decay, and the modern town of Chonas or Chonum occupies a site near its
ruins.
