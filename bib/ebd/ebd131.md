<span id="000">**Famine**</span> The first mentioned in Scripture was so
grievous as to compel Abraham to go down to the land of Egypt ([Gen
26:1](../kjv/gen026.htm#001)). Another is mentioned as having occurred
in the days of Isaac, causing him to go to Gerar ([Gen
26:1](../kjv/gen026.htm#001), [Gen 26:17](../kjv/gen026.htm#017)). But
the most remarkable of all was that which arose in Egypt in the days of
Joseph, which lasted for seven years (Gen. 41 - 45). Famines were sent
as an effect of God's anger against a guilty people ([Kg2
8:1](../kjv/kg2008.htm#001), [Kg2 8:2](../kjv/kg2008.htm#002); [Amo
8:11](../kjv/amo008.htm#011); Deut. 28:22-42; [Sa2
21:1](../kjv/sa2021.htm#001); [Kg2 6:25](../kjv/kg2006.htm#025); [Kg2
25:3](../kjv/kg2025.htm#003); [Jer 14:15](../kjv/jer014.htm#015); [Jer
19:9](../kjv/jer019.htm#009); [Jer 42:17](../kjv/jer042.htm#017), etc.).
A famine was predicted by Agabus ([Act 11:28](../kjv/act011.htm#028)).
Josephus makes mention of the famine which occurred A.D. 45. Helena,
queen of Adiabene, being at Jerusalem at that time, procured corn from
Alexandria and figs from Cyprus for its poor inhabitants.

<span id="001">**Fan**</span> A winnowing shovel by which grain was
thrown up against the wind that it might be cleansed from broken straw
and chaff ([Isa 30:24](../kjv/isa030.htm#024); [Jer
15:7](../kjv/jer015.htm#007); [Mat 3:12](../kjv/mat003.htm#012)). (See
AGRICULTURE.)

<span id="002">**Farm**</span> ([Mat 22:5](../kjv/mat022.htm#005)).
Every Hebrew had a certain portion of land assigned to him as a
possession (Num. 26:33-56). In Egypt the lands all belonged to the king,
and the husbandman were obliged to give him a fifth part of the produce;
so in Palestine Jehovah was the sole possessor of the soil, and the
people held it by direct tenure from him. By the enactment of Moses, the
Hebrews paid a tithe of the produce to Jehovah, which was assigned to
the priesthood. Military service when required was also to be rendered
by every Hebrew at his own expense. The occupation of a husbandman was
held in high honour ([Sa1 11:5](../kjv/sa1011.htm#005); [Kg1
19:19](../kjv/kg1019.htm#019); [Ch2 26:10](../kjv/ch2026.htm#010)). (See
TITHE.)

<span id="003">**Farthing**</span> (1.) [Mat
10:29](../kjv/mat010.htm#029); [Luk 12:6](../kjv/luk012.htm#006). Greek
assarion , i.e., a small as, which was a Roman coin equal to a tenth of
a denarius or drachma , nearly equal to a half-penny of our money. (2.)
[Mat 5:26](../kjv/mat005.htm#026); [Mar 12:42](../kjv/mar012.htm#042)
(Gr. kodrantes ), the quadrant, the fourth of an as , equal to two lepta
, mites. The lepton (mite) was the very smallest copper coin.

<span id="004">**Fast**</span> The sole fast required by the law of
Moses was that of the great Day of Atonement (q.v.), [Lev
23:26](../kjv/lev023.htm#026). It is called "the fast" ([Act
27:9](../kjv/act027.htm#009)). The only other mention of a periodical
fast in the Old Testament is in [Zac 7:1](../kjv/zac007.htm#001); [Zac
8:19](../kjv/zac008.htm#019), from which it appears that during their
captivity the Jews observed four annual fasts. (1.) The fast of the
fourth month, kept on the seventeenth day of Tammuz, the anniversary of
the capture of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans; to commemorate also the
incident recorded [Exo 32:19](../kjv/exo032.htm#019). (Compare [Jer
52:6](../kjv/jer052.htm#006), [Jer 52:7](../kjv/jer052.htm#007).) (2.)
The fast of the fifth month, kept on the ninth of Ab (compare [Num
14:27](../kjv/num014.htm#027)), to commemorate the burning of the city
and temple ([Jer 52:12](../kjv/jer052.htm#012), [Jer
52:13](../kjv/jer052.htm#013)). (3.) The fast of the seventh month, kept
on the third of Tisri (compare 2 Kings 25), the anniversary of the
murder of Gedaliah ([Jer 41:1](../kjv/jer041.htm#001), [Jer
41:2](../kjv/jer041.htm#002)). (4.) The fast of the tenth month (compare
[Jer 52:4](../kjv/jer052.htm#004); [Eze 33:21](../kjv/eze033.htm#021);
[Kg2 25:1](../kjv/kg2025.htm#001)), to commemorate the beginning of the
siege of the holy city by Nebuchadnezzar. There was in addition to these
the fast appointed by Esther ([Est 4:16](../kjv/est004.htm#016)). Public
national fasts on account of sin or to supplicate divine favour were
sometimes held. (1.) [Sa1 7:6](../kjv/sa1007.htm#006); (2.) [Ch2
20:3](../kjv/ch2020.htm#003); (3.) [Jer 36:6](../kjv/jer036.htm#006);
4.) [Neh 9:1](../kjv/neh009.htm#001). There were also local fasts. (1.)
[Jdg 20:26](../kjv/jdg020.htm#026); (2.) [Sa2
1:12](../kjv/sa2001.htm#012); (3.) [Sa1 31:13](../kjv/sa1031.htm#013);
(4.) [Kg1 21:9](../kjv/kg1021.htm#009); (5.) [Ezr
8:21](../kjv/ezr008.htm#021); (6.) [Jon 3:5](../kjv/jon003.htm#005).
There are many instances of private occasional fasting ([Sa1
1:7](../kjv/sa1001.htm#007); [Sa1 20:34](../kjv/sa1020.htm#034); [Sa2
3:35](../kjv/sa2003.htm#035); [Sa2 12:16](../kjv/sa2012.htm#016); [Kg1
21:27](../kjv/kg1021.htm#027); [Ezr 10:6](../kjv/ezr010.htm#006); [Neh
1:4](../kjv/neh001.htm#004); [Dan 10:2](../kjv/dan010.htm#002), [Dan
10:3](../kjv/dan010.htm#003)). Moses fasted forty days ([Exo
24:18](../kjv/exo024.htm#018); [Exo 34:28](../kjv/exo034.htm#028)), and
so also did Elijah ([Kg1 19:8](../kjv/kg1019.htm#008)). Our Lord fasted
forty days in the wilderness ([Mat 4:2](../kjv/mat004.htm#002)). In the
lapse of time the practice of fasting was lamentably abused ([Isa
58:4](../kjv/isa058.htm#004); [Jer 14:12](../kjv/jer014.htm#012); [Zac
7:5](../kjv/zac007.htm#005)). Our Lord rebuked the Pharisees for their
hypocritical pretenses in fasting ([Mat 6:16](../kjv/mat006.htm#016)).
He himself appointed no fast. The early Christians, however, observed
the ordinary fasts according to the law of their fathers ([Act
13:3](../kjv/act013.htm#003); [Act 14:23](../kjv/act014.htm#023); [Co2
6:5](../kjv/co2006.htm#005)).

<span id="005">**Fat**</span> (Heb. heleb ) denotes the richest part of
the animal, or the fattest of the flock, in the account of Abel's
sacrifice ([Gen 4:4](../kjv/gen004.htm#004)). It sometimes denotes the
best of any production ([Gen 45:18](../kjv/gen045.htm#018); [Num
18:12](../kjv/num018.htm#012); [Psa 81:16](../kjv/psa081.htm#016); [Psa
147:14](../kjv/psa147.htm#014)). The fat of sacrifices was to be burned
([Lev 3:9](../kjv/lev003.htm#009); [Lev 4:8](../kjv/lev004.htm#008);
[Lev 7:3](../kjv/lev007.htm#003); [Lev 8:25](../kjv/lev008.htm#025);
[Num 18:17](../kjv/num018.htm#017). Compare [Exo
29:13](../kjv/exo029.htm#013); [Lev 3:3](../kjv/lev003.htm#003)). It is
used figuratively for dull, stupid. In [Joe 2:24](../kjv/joe002.htm#024)
the word is equivalent to "vat," a vessel. The hebrew word here thus
rendered is elsewhere rendered "wine-fat" and "press-fat" ([Hag
2:16](../kjv/hag002.htm#016); [Isa 63:2](../kjv/isa063.htm#002)).

<span id="006">**Father**</span> A name applied (1.) to any ancestor
([Deu 1:11](../kjv/deu001.htm#011); [Kg1 15:11](../kjv/kg1015.htm#011);
[Mat 3:9](../kjv/mat003.htm#009); [Mat 23:30](../kjv/mat023.htm#030),
etc.); and (2.) as a title of respect to a chief, ruler, or elder, etc.
([Jdg 17:10](../kjv/jdg017.htm#010); [Jdg 18:19](../kjv/jdg018.htm#019);
[Sa1 10:12](../kjv/sa1010.htm#012); [Kg2 2:12](../kjv/kg2002.htm#012);
[Mat 23:9](../kjv/mat023.htm#009), etc.). (3.) The author or beginner of
anything is also so called; e.g., Jabal and Jubal ([Gen
4:20](../kjv/gen004.htm#020), [Gen 4:21](../kjv/gen004.htm#021); compare
[Job 38:28](../kjv/job038.htm#028)). Applied to God ([Exo
4:22](../kjv/exo004.htm#022); [Deu 32:6](../kjv/deu032.htm#006); [Sa2
7:14](../kjv/sa2007.htm#014); [Psa 89:27](../kjv/psa089.htm#027), [Psa
89:28](../kjv/psa089.htm#028), etc.). (1.) As denoting his covenant
relation to the Jews ([Jer 31:9](../kjv/jer031.htm#009); [Isa
63:16](../kjv/isa063.htm#016); [Isa 64:8](../kjv/isa064.htm#008); [Joh
8:41](../kjv/joh008.htm#041), etc.). (2.) Believers are called God's
"sons" ([Joh 1:12](../kjv/joh001.htm#012); [Rom
8:16](../kjv/rom008.htm#016); [Mat 6:4](../kjv/mat006.htm#004), [Mat
6:8](../kjv/mat006.htm#008), [Mat 6:15](../kjv/mat006.htm#015), [Mat
6:18](../kjv/mat006.htm#018); [Mat 10:20](../kjv/mat010.htm#020), [Mat
10:29](../kjv/mat010.htm#029)). They also call him "Father" ([Rom
1:7](../kjv/rom001.htm#007); [Co1 1:3](../kjv/co1001.htm#003); [Co2
1:2](../kjv/co2001.htm#002); [Gal 1:4](../kjv/gal001.htm#004))

<span id="007">**Fathom**</span> Old A.S. faethm, "bosom," (or the
outstretched arms), a span of six feet ([Act
27:28](../kjv/act027.htm#028)). Gr. orguia (from orego , "I stretch"),
the distance between the extremities of both arms fully stretched out.

<span id="008">**Fatling**</span> (1.) A fatted animal for slaughter
([Sa2 6:13](../kjv/sa2006.htm#013); [Isa 11:6](../kjv/isa011.htm#006);
[Eze 39:18](../kjv/eze039.htm#018). Compare [Mat
22:4](../kjv/mat022.htm#004), where word used in the original, sitistos,
means literally "corn-fed;" i.e., installed, fat). (2.) [Psa
66:15](../kjv/psa066.htm#015) (Heb. meah , meaning "marrowy," "fat," a
species of sheep). (3.) [Sa1 15:9](../kjv/sa1015.htm#009) (Heb. mishneh
, meaning "the second," and hence probably "cattle of a second quality,"
or lambs of the second birth, i.e., autumnal lambs, and therefore of
less value).

<span id="009">**Fear of the Lord**</span> Is in the Old Testament used
as a designation of true piety ([Pro 1:7](../kjv/pro001.htm#007); [Job
28:28](../kjv/job028.htm#028); [Psa 19:9](../kjv/psa019.htm#009)). It is
a fear conjoined with love and hope, and is therefore not a slavish
dread, but rather filial reverence. (Compare [Deu
32:6](../kjv/deu032.htm#006); [Hos 11:1](../kjv/hos011.htm#001); [Isa
1:2](../kjv/isa001.htm#002); [Isa 63:16](../kjv/isa063.htm#016); [Isa
64:8](../kjv/isa064.htm#008).) God is called "the Fear of Isaac" ([Gen
31:42](../kjv/gen031.htm#042), [Gen 31:53](../kjv/gen031.htm#053)),
i.e., the God whom Isaac feared. A holy fear is enjoined also in the New
Testament as a preventive of carelessness in religion, and as an
incentive to penitence ([Mat 10:28](../kjv/mat010.htm#028); [Co2
5:11](../kjv/co2005.htm#011); [Co2 7:1](../kjv/co2007.htm#001); [Phi
2:12](../kjv/phi002.htm#012); [Eph 5:21](../kjv/eph005.htm#021); [Heb
12:28](../kjv/heb012.htm#028), [Heb 12:29](../kjv/heb012.htm#029)).
