<span id="000">**Swan**</span> Mentioned in the list of unclean birds
([Lev 11:18](../kjv/lev011.htm#018); [Deu
14:16](../kjv/deu014.htm#016)), is sometimes met with in the Jordan and
the Sea of Galilee.

<span id="001">**Swelling**</span> Of Jordan ([Jer
12:5](../kjv/jer012.htm#005)), literally the "pride" of Jordan (as in
R.V.), i.e., the luxuriant thickets of tamarisks, poplars, reeds, etc.,
which were the lair of lions and other beasts of prey. The reference is
not to the overflowing of the river banks. (Compare [Jer
49:19](../kjv/jer049.htm#019); [Jer 50:44](../kjv/jer050.htm#044); [Zac
11:3](../kjv/zac011.htm#003)).

<span id="002">**Swine**</span> (Heb. hazir ), regarded as the most
unclean and the most abhorred of all animals ([Lev
11:7](../kjv/lev011.htm#007); [Isa 65:4](../kjv/isa065.htm#004); [Isa
66:3](../kjv/isa066.htm#003), [Isa 66:17](../kjv/isa066.htm#017); [Luk
15:15](../kjv/luk015.htm#015), [Luk 15:16](../kjv/luk015.htm#016)). A
herd of swine were drowned in the Sea of Galilee ([Luk
8:32](../kjv/luk008.htm#032), [Luk 8:33](../kjv/luk008.htm#033)). Spoken
of figuratively in [Mat 7:6](../kjv/mat007.htm#006) (see [Pro
11:22](../kjv/pro011.htm#022)). It is frequently mentioned as a wild
animal, and is evidently the wild boar (Arab. khanzir ), which is common
among the marshes of the Jordan valley ([Psa
80:13](../kjv/psa080.htm#013)).

<span id="003">**Sword**</span> Of the Hebrew was pointed, sometimes
two-edged, was worn in a sheath, and suspended from the girdle ([Exo
32:27](../kjv/exo032.htm#027); [Sa1 31:4](../kjv/sa1031.htm#004); [Ch1
21:27](../kjv/ch1021.htm#027); [Psa 149:6](../kjv/psa149.htm#006); [Pro
5:4](../kjv/pro005.htm#004); [Eze 16:40](../kjv/eze016.htm#040); [Eze
21:3](../kjv/eze021.htm#003)). It is a symbol of divine chastisement
([Deu 32:25](../kjv/deu032.htm#025); [Psa 7:12](../kjv/psa007.htm#012);
[Psa 78:62](../kjv/psa078.htm#062)), and of a slanderous tongue ([Psa
57:4](../kjv/psa057.htm#004); [Psa 64:3](../kjv/psa064.htm#003); [Pro
12:18](../kjv/pro012.htm#018)). The word of God is likened also to a
sword ([Heb 4:12](../kjv/heb004.htm#012); [Eph
6:17](../kjv/eph006.htm#017); [Rev 1:16](../kjv/rev001.htm#016)).
Gideon's watchword was, "The sword of the Lord" ([Jdg
7:20](../kjv/jdg007.htm#020)).

<span id="004">**Sycamine Tree**</span> Mentioned only in [Luk
17:6](../kjv/luk017.htm#006). It is rendered by Luther "mulberry tree"
(q.v.), which is most probably the correct rendering. It is found of two
species, the black mulberry (Morus nigra) and the white mulberry
(Mourea), which are common in Palestine. The silk-worm feeds on their
leaves. The rearing of them is one of the chief industries of the
peasantry of Lebanon and of other parts of the land. It is of the order
of the fig-tree. Some contend, however, that this name denotes the
sycamore-fig of [Luk 19:4](../kjv/luk019.htm#004).

<span id="005">**Sycamore**</span> More properly sycomore (Heb. shikmoth
and shikmim , Gr. sycomoros ), a tree which in its general character
resembles the fig-tree, while its leaves resemble those of the mulberry;
hence it is called the fig-mulberry (Ficus sycomorus). At Jericho,
Zacchaeus climbed a sycomore-tree to see Jesus as he passed by ([Luk
19:4](../kjv/luk019.htm#004)). This tree was easily destroyed by frost
([Psa 78:47](../kjv/psa078.htm#047)), and therefore it is found mostly
in the "vale" ([Kg1 10:27](../kjv/kg1010.htm#027); [Ch2
1:15](../kjv/ch2001.htm#015) : in both passages the R.V. has properly
"lowland"), i.e., the "low country," the shephelah, where the climate is
mild. Amos ([Amo 7:14](../kjv/amo007.htm#014)) refers to its fruit,
which is of an inferior character; so also probably Jeremiah ([Jer
24:2](../kjv/jer024.htm#002)). It is to be distinguished from our
sycamore (the Acer pseudo-platanus), which is a species of maple often
called a plane-tree.

<span id="006">**Sychar**</span> Liar or drunkard (see [Isa
28:1](../kjv/isa028.htm#001), [Isa 28:7](../kjv/isa028.htm#007)), has
been from the time of the Crusaders usually identified with Sychem or
Shechem ([Joh 4:5](../kjv/joh004.htm#005)). It has now, however, as the
result of recent explorations, been identified with 'Askar , a small
Samaritan town on the southern base of Ebal, about a mile to the north
of Jacob's well.

<span id="007">**Sychem**</span> See SHECHEM.

<span id="008">**Syene**</span> Opening ([Eze
29:10](../kjv/eze029.htm#010); [Eze 30:6](../kjv/eze030.htm#006)), a
town of Egypt, on the borders of Ethiopia, now called Assouan, on the
right bank of the Nile, notable for its quarries of beautiful red
granite called "syenite." It was the frontier town of Egypt in the
south, as Migdol was in the north-east.

<span id="009">**Synagogue**</span> (Gr. sunagoge , i.e., "an
assembly"), found only once in the Authorized Version of [Psa
74:8](../kjv/psa074.htm#008), where the margin of Revised Version has
"places of assembly," which is probably correct; for while the origin of
synagogues is unknown, it may well be supposed that buildings or tents
for the accommodation of worshippers may have existed in the land from
an early time, and thus the system of synagogues would be gradually
developed. Some, however, are of opinion that it was specially during
the Babylonian captivity that the system of synagogue worship, if not
actually introduced, was at least reorganized on a systematic plan ([Eze
8:1](../kjv/eze008.htm#001); [Eze 14:1](../kjv/eze014.htm#001)). The
exiles gathered together for the reading of the law and the prophets as
they had opportunity, and after their return synagogues were established
all over the land ([Ezr 8:15](../kjv/ezr008.htm#015); [Neh
8:2](../kjv/neh008.htm#002)). In after years, when the Jews were
dispersed abroad, wherever they went they erected synagogues and kept up
the stated services of worship ([Act 9:20](../kjv/act009.htm#020); [Act
13:5](../kjv/act013.htm#005); [Act 17:1](../kjv/act017.htm#001); [Act
17:17](../kjv/act017.htm#017); [Act 18:4](../kjv/act018.htm#004)). The
form and internal arrangements of the synagogue would greatly depend on
the wealth of the Jews who erected it, and on the place where it was
built. "Yet there are certain traditional peculiarities which have
doubtless united together by a common resemblance the Jewish synagogues
of all ages and countries. The arrangements for the women's place in a
separate gallery or behind a partition of lattice-work; the desk in the
centre, where the reader, like Ezra in ancient days, from his 'pulpit of
wood,' may 'open the book in the sight of all of people and read in the
book of the law of God distinctly, and give the sense, and cause them to
understand the reading' ([Neh 8:4](../kjv/neh008.htm#004), [Neh
8:8](../kjv/neh008.htm#008)); the carefully closed ark on the side of
the building nearest to Jerusalem, for the preservation of the rolls or
manuscripts of the law; the seats all round the building, whence 'the
eyes of all them that are in the synagogue' may 'be fastened' on him who
speaks ([Luk 4:20](../kjv/luk004.htm#020)); the 'chief seats' ([Mat
23:6](../kjv/mat023.htm#006)) which were appropriated to the 'ruler' or
'rulers' of the synagogue, according as its organization may have been
more or less complete;", these were features common to all the
synagogues. Where perfected into a system, the services of the
synagogue, which were at the same hours as those of the temple,
consisted, (1.) of prayer, which formed a kind of liturgy, there were in
all eighteen prayers; (2.) the reading of the Scriptures in certain
definite portions; and (3.) the exposition of the portions read. (See
[Luk 4:15](../kjv/luk004.htm#015), [Luk 4:22](../kjv/luk004.htm#022);
[Act 13:14](../kjv/act013.htm#014).) The synagogue was also sometimes
used as a court of judicature, in which the rulers presided ([Mat
10:17](../kjv/mat010.htm#017); [Mar 5:22](../kjv/mar005.htm#022); [Luk
12:11](../kjv/luk012.htm#011); [Luk 21:12](../kjv/luk021.htm#012); [Act
13:15](../kjv/act013.htm#015); [Act 22:19](../kjv/act022.htm#019)); also
as public schools. The establishment of synagogues wherever the Jews
were found in sufficient numbers helped greatly to keep alive Israel's
hope of the coming of the Messiah, and to prepare the way for the spread
of the gospel in other lands. The worship of the Christian Church was
afterwards modeled after that of the synagogue. Christ and his disciples
frequently taught in the synagogues ([Mat 13:54](../kjv/mat013.htm#054);
[Mar 6:2](../kjv/mar006.htm#002); [Joh 18:20](../kjv/joh018.htm#020);
[Act 13:5](../kjv/act013.htm#005), [Act 13:15](../kjv/act013.htm#015),
[Act 13:44](../kjv/act013.htm#044); [Act 14:1](../kjv/act014.htm#001);
[Act 17:2](../kjv/act017.htm#002), [Act 17:10](../kjv/act017.htm#010),
[Act 17:17](../kjv/act017.htm#017); [Act 18:4](../kjv/act018.htm#004),
[Act 18:26](../kjv/act018.htm#026); [Act 19:8](../kjv/act019.htm#008)).
To be "put out of the synagogue," a phrase used by John ([Joh
9:22](../kjv/joh009.htm#022); [Joh 12:42](../kjv/joh012.htm#042); [Joh
16:2](../kjv/joh016.htm#002)), means to be excommunicated.
