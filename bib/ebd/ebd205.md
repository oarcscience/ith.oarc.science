<span id="004">**Jeshurun**</span> A poetical name for the people of
Israel, used in token of affection, meaning, "the dear upright people"
([Deu 32:15](../kjv/deu032.htm#015); [Deu 33:5](../kjv/deu033.htm#005),
[Deu 33:26](../kjv/deu033.htm#026); [Isa 44:2](../kjv/isa044.htm#002)).

<span id="005">**Jesse**</span> Firm, or a gift, a son of Obed, the son
of Boaz and Ruth ([Rut 4:17](../kjv/rut004.htm#017), [Rut
4:22](../kjv/rut004.htm#022); [Mat 1:5](../kjv/mat001.htm#005), [Mat
1:6](../kjv/mat001.htm#006); [Luk 3:32](../kjv/luk003.htm#032)). He was
the father of eight sons, the youngest of whom was David ([Sa1
17:12](../kjv/sa1017.htm#012)). The phrase "stem of Jesse" is used for
the family of David ([Isa 11:1](../kjv/isa011.htm#001)), and "root of
Jesse" for the Messiah ([Isa 11:10](../kjv/isa011.htm#010); [Rev
5:5](../kjv/rev005.htm#005)). Jesse was a man apparently of wealth and
position at Bethlehem ([Sa1 17:17](../kjv/sa1017.htm#017), [Sa1
17:18](../kjv/sa1017.htm#018), [Sa1 17:20](../kjv/sa1017.htm#020); [Psa
78:71](../kjv/psa078.htm#071)). The last reference to him is of David's
procuring for him an asylum with the king of Moab ([Sa1
22:3](../kjv/sa1022.htm#003)). See table of descendants: Jesse Eliab,
Abinadab, Shammah, Nethaneel, Zeruiah Abigail Raddai, Ozem, a son not

<span id="006">**Jesus**</span> (1.) Joshua, the son of Nun ([Act
7:45](../kjv/act007.htm#045); [Heb 4:8](../kjv/heb004.htm#008); R.V.,
"Joshua"). (2.) A Jewish Christian surnamed Justus ([Col
4:11](../kjv/col004.htm#011)). (3.) The proper, as Christ is the
official, name of our Lord. To distinguish him from others so called, he
is spoken of as "Jesus of Nazareth" ([Joh 18:7](../kjv/joh018.htm#007)),
and "Jesus the son of Joseph" ([Joh 6:42](../kjv/joh006.htm#042)). This
is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Joshua , which was originally
Hoshea ([Num 13:8](../kjv/num013.htm#008), [Num
13:16](../kjv/num013.htm#016)), but changed by Moses into Jehoshua ([Num
13:16](../kjv/num013.htm#016); [Ch1 7:27](../kjv/ch1007.htm#027)), or
Joshua. After the Exile it assumed the form Jeshua , whence the Greek
form Jesus . It was given to our Lord to denote the object of his
mission, to save ([Mat 1:21](../kjv/mat001.htm#021)). The life of Jesus
on earth may be divided into two great periods, (a.) that of his private
life, till he was about thirty years of age; and (b.) that of his public
life, which lasted about three years. In the "fulness of time" he was
born at Bethlehem, in the reign of the emperor Augustus, of Mary, who
was betrothed to Joseph, a carpenter ([Mat 1:1](../kjv/mat001.htm#001);
[Luk 3:23](../kjv/luk003.htm#023); compare [Joh
7:42](../kjv/joh007.htm#042)). His birth was announced to the shepherds
([Luk 2:8](../kjv/luk002.htm#008)). Wise men from the east came to
Bethlehem to see him who was born "King of the Jews," bringing gifts
with them ([Mat 2:1](../kjv/mat002.htm#001)). Herod's cruel jealousy led
to Joseph's flight into Egypt with Mary and the infant Jesus, where they
tarried till the death of this king ([Mat 2:13](../kjv/mat002.htm#013)),
when they returned and settled in Nazareth, in Lower Galilee ([Mat
2:23](../kjv/mat002.htm#023); compare [Luk 4:16](../kjv/luk004.htm#016);
[Joh 1:46](../kjv/joh001.htm#046), etc.). At the age of twelve years he
went up to Jerusalem to the Passover with his parents. There, in the
temple, "in the midst of the doctors," all that heard him were
"astonished at his understanding and answers" ([Luk
2:41](../kjv/luk002.htm#041), etc.). Eighteen years pass, of which we
have no record beyond this, that he returned to Nazareth and "increased
in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man" ([Luk
2:52](../kjv/luk002.htm#052)). He entered on his public ministry when he
was about thirty years of age. It is generally reckoned to have extended
to about three years. "Each of these years had peculiar features of its
own. (a.) The first year may be called the year of obscurity, both
because the records of it which we possess are very scanty, and because
he seems during it to have been only slowly emerging into public notice.
It was spent for the most part in Judea. (b.) The second year was the
year of public favour, during which the country had become thoroughly
aware of him; his activity was incessant, and his frame rang through the
length and breadth of the land. It was almost wholly passed in Galilee.
(c.) The third was the year of opposition, when the public favour ebbed
away. His enemies multiplied and assailed him with more and more
pertinacity, and at last he fell a victim to their hatred. The first six
months of this final year were passed in Galilee, and the last six in
other parts of the land." Stalker's Life of Jesus Christ, p. 45. The
only reliable sources of information regarding the life of Christ on
earth are the Gospels, which present in historical detail the words and
the work of Christ in so many different aspects. (See CHIRST.)

8:20](../kjv/jdg008.htm#020)). (3.) The father of Amasa, David's general

called Ithra ([Sa2 17:25](../kjv/sa2017.htm#025)). (4.) [Ch1
7:38](../kjv/ch1007.htm#038). (5.) [Ch1 2:32](../kjv/ch1002.htm#032);
one of Judah's posterity. (6.) [Ch1 4:17](../kjv/ch1004.htm#017).

of Dan ([Jos 19:42](../kjv/jos019.htm#042)).
