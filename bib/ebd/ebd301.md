<span id="000">**Proportion of Faith**</span> ([Rom
12:6](../kjv/rom012.htm#006)). Paul says here that each one was to
exercise his gift of prophecy, i.e., of teaching, "according to the
proportion of faith." The meaning is, that the utterances of the
"prophet" were not to fluctuate according to his own impulses or
independent thoughts, but were to be adjusted to the truth revealed to
him as a believer, i.e., were to be accordance with it. In
post-Reformation times this phrase was used as meaning that all
Scripture was to be interpreted with reference to all other Scripture,
i.e., that no words or expressions were to be isolated or interpreted in
a way contrary to its general teaching. This was also called the
"analogy of faith."

<span id="001">**Proselyte**</span> Is used in the LXX. for "stranger"
([Ch1 22:2](../kjv/ch1022.htm#002)), i.e., a comer to Palestine; a
sojourner in the land ([Exo 12:48](../kjv/exo012.htm#048); [Exo
20:10](../kjv/exo020.htm#010); [Exo 22:21](../kjv/exo022.htm#021)), and
in the New Testament for a convert to Judaism. There were such converts
from early times ([Isa 56:3](../kjv/isa056.htm#003); [Neh
10:28](../kjv/neh010.htm#028); [Est 8:17](../kjv/est008.htm#017)). The
law of Moses made specific regulations regarding the admission into the
Jewish church of such as were not born Israelites ([Exo
20:10](../kjv/exo020.htm#010); [Exo 23:12](../kjv/exo023.htm#012); [Exo
12:19](../kjv/exo012.htm#019), [Exo 12:48](../kjv/exo012.htm#048); [Deu
5:14](../kjv/deu005.htm#014); 16; 11, 14, etc.). The Kenites, the
Gibeonites, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites were thus admitted to
the privileges of Israelites. Thus also we hear of individual proselytes
who rose to positions of prominence in Israel, as of Doeg the Edomite,
Uriah the Hittite, Araunah the Jebusite, Zelek the Ammonite, Ithmah and
Ebedmelech the Ethiopians. In the time of Solomon there were one hundred
and fifty-three thousand six hundred strangers in the land of Israel
([Ch1 22:2](../kjv/ch1022.htm#002); [Ch2 2:17](../kjv/ch2002.htm#017),
[Ch2 2:18](../kjv/ch2002.htm#018)). And the prophets speak of the time
as coming when the strangers shall share in all the privileges of Israel
([Eze 47:22](../kjv/eze047.htm#022); [Isa 2:2](../kjv/isa002.htm#002);
[Isa 11:10](../kjv/isa011.htm#010); [Isa 56:3](../kjv/isa056.htm#003);
[Mic 4:1](../kjv/mic004.htm#001)). Accordingly, in New Testament times,
we read of proselytes in the synagogues, ([Act
10:2](../kjv/act010.htm#002), [Act 10:7](../kjv/act010.htm#007); [Act
13:42](../kjv/act013.htm#042), [Act 13:43](../kjv/act013.htm#043), [Act
13:50](../kjv/act013.htm#050); [Act 17:4](../kjv/act017.htm#004); [Act
18:7](../kjv/act018.htm#007); [Luk 7:5](../kjv/luk007.htm#005)). The
"religious proselytes" here spoken of were proselytes of righteousness,
as distinguished from proselytes of the gate. The distinction between
"proselytes of the gate" ([Exo 20:10](../kjv/exo020.htm#010)) and
"proselytes of righteousness" originated only with the rabbis. According
to them, the "proselytes of the gate" (half proselytes) were not
required to be circumcised nor to comply with the Mosaic ceremonial law.
They were bound only to conform to the so-called seven precepts of Noah,
viz., to abstain from idolatry, blasphemy, bloodshed, uncleanness, the
eating of blood, theft, and to yield obedience to the authorities.
Besides these laws, however, they were required to abstain from work on
the Sabbath, and to refrain from the use of leavened bread during the
time of the Passover. The "proselytes of righteousness", religious of
devout proselytes ([Act 13:43](../kjv/act013.htm#043)), were bound to
all the doctrines and precepts of the Jewish economy, and were members
of the synagogue in full communion. The name "proselyte" occurs in the
New Testament only in [Mat 23:15](../kjv/mat023.htm#015); [Act
2:10](../kjv/act002.htm#010); [Act 6:5](../kjv/act006.htm#005); [Act
13:43](../kjv/act013.htm#043). The name by which they are commonly
designated is that of "devout men," or men "fearing God" or "worshipping
God."

<span id="002">**Proverb**</span> A trite maxim; a similitude; a
parable. The Hebrew word thus rendered (mashal) has a wide
signification. It comes from a root meaning "to be like," "parable."
Rendered "proverb" in [Isa 14:4](../kjv/isa014.htm#004); [Hab
2:6](../kjv/hab002.htm#006); "dark saying" in [Psa
49:4](../kjv/psa049.htm#004), [Num 12:8](../kjv/num012.htm#008). Ahab's
defiant words in answer to the insolent demands of Benhadad, "Let not
him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it
off," is a well known instance of a proverbial saying ([Kg1
20:11](../kjv/kg1020.htm#011)).

<span id="003">**Proverbs, Book of**</span> A collection of moral and
philosophical maxims of a wide range of subjects presented in a poetic
form. This book sets forth the "philosophy of practical life. It is the
sign to us that the Bible does not despise common sense and discretion.
It impresses upon us in the most forcible manner the value of
intelligence and prudence and of a good education. The whole strength of
the Hebrew language and of the sacred authority of the book is thrown
upon these homely truths. It deals, too, in that refined,
discriminating, careful view of the finer shades of human character so
often overlooked by theologians, but so necessary to any true estimate
of human life" (Stanley's Jewish Church). As to the origin of this book,
"it is probable that Solomon gathered and recast many proverbs which
sprang from human experience in preceding ages and were floating past
him on the tide of time, and that he also elaborated many new ones from
the material of his own experience. Towards the close of the book,
indeed, are preserved some of Solomon's own sayings that seem to have
fallen from his lips in later life and been gathered by other hands."
(Arnot's Laws from Heaven, etc.) This book is usually divided into three
parts: (1.) Consisting of Prov. 1 - 9, which contain an exhibition of
wisdom as the highest good. (2.) Consisting of Prov. 10 - 24. (3.)
Containing proverbs of Solomon "which the men of Hezekiah, the king of
Judah, collected" (Prov. 25 - 29). These are followed by two
supplements, (1.) "The words of Agur" (Prov. 30); and (2.) "The words of
king Lemuel" (Prov. 31). Solomon is said to have written three thousand
proverbs, and those contained in this book may be a selection from these
([Kg1 4:32](../kjv/kg1004.htm#032)). In the New Testament there are
thirty-five direct quotations from this book or allusions to it.

<span id="004">**Providence**</span> Literally means foresight, but is
generally used to denote God's preserving and governing all things by
means of second causes ([Psa 18:35](../kjv/psa018.htm#035); [Psa
63:8](../kjv/psa063.htm#008); [Act 17:28](../kjv/act017.htm#028); [Col
1:17](../kjv/col001.htm#017); [Heb 1:3](../kjv/heb001.htm#003)). God's
providence extends to the natural world ([Psa
104:14](../kjv/psa104.htm#014); [Psa 135:5](../kjv/psa135.htm#005); [Act
14:17](../kjv/act014.htm#017)), the brute creation ([Psa
104:21](../kjv/psa104.htm#021); [Mat 6:26](../kjv/mat006.htm#026); [Mat
10:29](../kjv/mat010.htm#029)), and the affairs of men ([Ch1
16:31](../kjv/ch1016.htm#031); [Psa 47:7](../kjv/psa047.htm#007); [Pro
21:1](../kjv/pro021.htm#001); [Job 12:23](../kjv/job012.htm#023); [Dan
2:21](../kjv/dan002.htm#021); [Dan 4:25](../kjv/dan004.htm#025)), and of
individuals ([Sa1 2:6](../kjv/sa1002.htm#006); [Psa
18:30](../kjv/psa018.htm#030); [Luk 1:53](../kjv/luk001.htm#053); [Jam
4:13](../kjv/jam004.htm#013)). It extends also to the free actions of
men ([Exo 12:36](../kjv/exo012.htm#036); [Sa1
24:9](../kjv/sa1024.htm#009); [Psa 33:14](../kjv/psa033.htm#014), [Psa
33:15](../kjv/psa033.htm#015); [Pro 16:1](../kjv/pro016.htm#001); [Pro
19:21](../kjv/pro019.htm#021); [Pro 20:24](../kjv/pro020.htm#024); [Pro
21:1](../kjv/pro021.htm#001)), and things sinful ([Sa2
16:10](../kjv/sa2016.htm#010); [Sa2 24:1](../kjv/sa2024.htm#001); [Rom
11:32](../kjv/rom011.htm#032); [Act 4:27](../kjv/act004.htm#027), [Act
4:28](../kjv/act004.htm#028)), as well as to their good actions ([Phi
2:13](../kjv/phi002.htm#013); [Phi 4:13](../kjv/phi004.htm#013); [Co2
12:9](../kjv/co2012.htm#009), [Co2 12:10](../kjv/co2012.htm#010); [Eph
2:10](../kjv/eph002.htm#010); [Gal 5:22](../kjv/gal005.htm#022)). As
regards sinful actions of men, they are represented as occurring by
God's permission ([Gen 45:5](../kjv/gen045.htm#005); [Gen
50:20](../kjv/gen050.htm#020). Compare [Sa1 6:6](../kjv/sa1006.htm#006);
[Exo 7:13](../kjv/exo007.htm#013); [Exo 14:17](../kjv/exo014.htm#017);
[Act 2:3](../kjv/act002.htm#003); [Act 3:18](../kjv/act003.htm#018);
[Act 4:27](../kjv/act004.htm#027), [Act 4:28](../kjv/act004.htm#028)),
and as controlled ([Psa 76:10](../kjv/psa076.htm#010)) and overruled for
good ([Gen 50:20](../kjv/gen050.htm#020); [Act
3:13](../kjv/act003.htm#013)). God does not cause or approve of sin, but
only limits, restrains, overrules it for good. The mode of God's
providential government is altogether unexplained. We only know that it
is a fact that God does govern all his creatures and all their actions;
that this government is universal ([Psa 103:17](../kjv/psa103.htm#017)),
particular ([Mat 10:29](../kjv/mat010.htm#029)), efficacious ([Psa
33:11](../kjv/psa033.htm#011); [Job 23:13](../kjv/job023.htm#013)),
embraces events apparently contingent ([Pro
16:9](../kjv/pro016.htm#009), [Pro 16:33](../kjv/pro016.htm#033); [Pro
19:21](../kjv/pro019.htm#021); [Pro 21:1](../kjv/pro021.htm#001)), is
consistent with his own perfection ([Ti2 2:13](../kjv/ti2002.htm#013)),
and to his own glory ([Rom 9:17](../kjv/rom009.htm#017); [Rom
11:36](../kjv/rom011.htm#036)).

<span id="005">**Psalms**</span> The psalms are the production of
various authors. "Only a portion of the Book of Psalms claims David as
its author. Other inspired poets in successive generations added now one
now another contribution to the sacred collection, and thus in the
wisdom of Providence it more completely reflects every phase of human
emotion and circumstances than it otherwise could." But it is specially
to David and his contemporaries that we owe this precious book. In the
"titles" of the psalms, the genuineness of which there is no sufficient
reason to doubt, 73 are ascribed to David. Peter and John ([Act
4:25](../kjv/act004.htm#025)) ascribe to him also the second psalm,
which is one of the 48 that are anonymous. About two-thirds of the whole
collection have been ascribed to David. [Psa
39:1](../kjv/psa039.htm#001), [Psa 62:1](../kjv/psa062.htm#001), and 77
are addressed to Jeduthun, to be sung after his manner or in his choir.
Ps. 50 and 73 - 83 are addressed to Asaph, as the master of his choir,
to be sung in the worship of God. The "sons of Korah," who formed a
leading part of the Kohathite singers ([Ch2
20:19](../kjv/ch2020.htm#019)), were entrusted with the arranging and
singing of [Psa 42:1](../kjv/psa042.htm#001), 44 - 49, [Psa
84:1](../kjv/psa084.htm#001), [Psa 85:1](../kjv/psa085.htm#001), [Psa
87:1](../kjv/psa087.htm#001), and 88. In [Luk
24:44](../kjv/luk024.htm#044) the word "psalms" means the Hagiographa,
i.e., the holy writings, one of the sections into which the Jews divided
the Old Testament. (See BIBLE.) None of the psalms can be proved to have
been of a later date than the time of Ezra and Nehemiah, hence the whole
collection extends over a period of about 1,000 years. There are in the
New Testament 116 direct quotations from the Psalter. The Psalter is
divided, after the analogy of the Pentateuch, into five books, each
closing with a doxology or benediction:, (1.) The first book comprises
the first 41 psalms, all of which are ascribed to David except [Psa
1:1](../kjv/psa001.htm#001), [Psa 2:1](../kjv/psa002.htm#001), 10, and
33, which, though anonymous, may also be ascribed to him. (2.) Book
second consists of the next 31 psalms (Ps. 42 - 72), 18 of which are
ascribed to David and 1 to Solomon (Ps. 72). The rest are anonymous.
(3.) The third book contains 17 psalms (Ps. 73 - 89), of which Ps. 86 is
ascribed to David, Ps. 88 to Heman the Ezrahite, and Ps. 89 to Ethan the
Ezrahite. (4.) The fourth book also contains 17 psalms (Ps. 90 - 106),
of which Ps. 90 is ascribed to Moses, and [Psa
101:1](../kjv/psa101.htm#001) and 103 to David. (5.) The fifth book
contains the remaining psalms, 44 in number. Of these, 15 are ascribed
to David, and [Psa 127:1](../kjv/psa127.htm#001) to Solomon. Ps. 136 is
generally called "the great hallel." But the Talmud includes also Ps.
120 - 135. Ps. 113 - 118, inclusive, constitute the "hallel" recited at
the three great feasts, at the new moon, and on the eight days of the
feast of dedication. "It is presumed that these several collections were
made at times of high religious life: the first, probably, near the
close of David's life; the second in the days of Solomon; the third by
the singers of Jehoshaphat ([Ch2 20:19](../kjv/ch2020.htm#019)); the
fourth by the men of Hezekiah (2 Chr. 29, 30, 31); and the fifth in the
days of Ezra." The Mosaic ritual makes no provision for the service of
song in the worship of God. David first taught the Church to sing the
praises of the Lord. He first introduced into the ritual of the
tabernacle music and song. Diverse names are given to the psalms. (1.)
Some bear the Hebrew designation shir (Gr. ode , a song). Thirteen have
this title. It means the flow of speech, as it were, in a straight line
or in a regular strain. This title includes secular as well as sacred
song. (2.) Fifty-eight psalms bear the designation (Heb.) mitsmor (Gr.
psalmos , a psalm), a lyric ode, or a song set to music; a sacred song
accompanied with a musical instrument. (3.) Ps. 145, and many others,
have the designation (Heb.) tehillah (Gr. hymnos , a hymn), meaning a
song of praise; a song the prominent thought of which is the praise of
God. (4.) Six psalms ([Psa 16:1](../kjv/psa016.htm#001), 56 - 60) have
the title (Heb.) michtam (q.v.). (5.) Ps. 7 and Hab. 3 bear the title
(Heb.) shiggaion (q.v.).

<span id="006">**Psaltery**</span> A musical instrument, supposed to
have been a kind of lyre, or a harp with twelve strings. The Hebrew word
nebhel, so rendered, is translated "viol" in [Isa
5:12](../kjv/isa005.htm#012) (R.V., "lute"); [Isa
14:11](../kjv/isa014.htm#011). In [Dan 3:5](../kjv/dan003.htm#005), [Dan
3:7](../kjv/dan003.htm#007), [Dan 3:10](../kjv/dan003.htm#010), [Dan
3:15](../kjv/dan003.htm#015), the word thus rendered is Chaldaic,
pesanterin , which is supposed to be a word of Greek origin denoting an
instrument of the harp kind.

<span id="007">**Ptolemais**</span> A maritime city of Galilee ([Act
21:7](../kjv/act021.htm#007)). It was originally called "Accho" (q.v.),
and received the name Ptolemais from Ptolemy Soter when he was in
possession of Coele-Syria.

<span id="008">**Puah**</span> Splendid. (1.) One of the two midwives
who feared God, and refused to kill the Hebrew male children at their
birth ([Exo 1:15](../kjv/exo001.htm#015)). (2.) A descendant of Issachar
([Jdg 10:1](../kjv/jdg010.htm#001)).

<span id="009">**Publican**</span> One who farmed the taxes (e.g.,
Zacchaeus, [Luk 19:2](../kjv/luk019.htm#002)) to be levied from a town
or district, and thus undertook to pay to the supreme government a
certain amount. In order to collect the taxes, the publicans employed
subordinates ([Luk 5:27](../kjv/luk005.htm#027); [Luk
15:1](../kjv/luk015.htm#001); [Luk 18:10](../kjv/luk018.htm#010)), who,
for their own ends, were often guilty of extortion and peculation. In
New Testament times these taxes were paid to the Romans, and hence were
regarded by the Jews as a very heavy burden, and hence also the
collectors of taxes, who were frequently Jews, were hated, and were
usually spoken of in very opprobrious terms. Jesus was accused of being
a "friend of publicans and sinners" ([Luk 7:34](../kjv/luk007.htm#034)).
