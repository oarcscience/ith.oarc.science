<span id="000">**Aner**</span> A boy. (1.) A Canaanitish chief who
joined his forces with those of Abraham in pursuit of Chedorlaomer ([Gen
14:13](../kjv/gen014.htm#013), [Gen 14:24](../kjv/gen014.htm#024)). (2.)
A city of Manasseh given to the Levites of Kohath's family ([Ch1
6:70](../kjv/ch1006.htm#070)).

<span id="001">**Angel**</span> A word signifying, both in the Hebrew
and Greek, a "messenger," and hence employed to denote any agent God
sends forth to execute his purposes. It is used of an ordinary messenger
([Job 1:14](../kjv/job001.htm#014); [Sa1 11:3](../kjv/sa1011.htm#003);
[Luk 7:24](../kjv/luk007.htm#024); [Luk 9:52](../kjv/luk009.htm#052)),
of prophets ([Isa 42:19](../kjv/isa042.htm#019); [Hag
1:13](../kjv/hag001.htm#013)), of priests ([Mal
2:7](../kjv/mal002.htm#007)), and ministers of the New Testament ([Rev
1:20](../kjv/rev001.htm#020)). It is also applied to such impersonal
agents as the pestilence ([Sa2 24:16](../kjv/sa2024.htm#016), [Sa2
24:17](../kjv/sa2024.htm#017); [Kg2 19:35](../kjv/kg2019.htm#035)), the
wind ([Psa 104:4](../kjv/psa104.htm#004)). But its distinctive
application is to certain heavenly intelligences whom God employs in
carrying on his government of the world. The name does not denote their
nature but their office as messengers. The appearances to Abraham at
Mamre ([Gen 18:2](../kjv/gen018.htm#002), [Gen
18:22](../kjv/gen018.htm#022). Compare [Gen
19:1](../kjv/gen019.htm#001)), to Jacob at Peniel ([Gen
32:24](../kjv/gen032.htm#024), [Gen 32:30](../kjv/gen032.htm#030)), to
Joshua at Gilgal ([Jos 5:13](../kjv/jos005.htm#013), [Jos
5:15](../kjv/jos005.htm#015)), of the Angel of the Lord, were doubtless
manifestations of the Divine presence, "foreshadowings of the
incarnation," revelations before the "fulness of the time" of the Son of
God. (1.) The existence and orders of angelic beings can only be
discovered from the Scriptures. Although the Bible does not treat of
this subject specially, yet there are numerous incidental details that
furnish us with ample information. Their personal existence is plainly
implied in such passages as [Gen 16:7](../kjv/gen016.htm#007), [Gen
16:10](../kjv/gen016.htm#010), [Gen 16:11](../kjv/gen016.htm#011); Judg.
13:1-21; [Mat 28:2](../kjv/mat028.htm#002); [Heb
1:4](../kjv/heb001.htm#004), etc. These superior beings are very
numerous. "Thousand thousands," etc. ([Dan 7:10](../kjv/dan007.htm#010);
[Mat 26:53](../kjv/mat026.htm#053); [Luk 2:13](../kjv/luk002.htm#013);
[Heb 12:22](../kjv/heb012.htm#022), [Heb 12:23](../kjv/heb012.htm#023)).
They are also spoken of as of different ranks in dignity and power ([Zac
1:9](../kjv/zac001.htm#009), [Zac 1:11](../kjv/zac001.htm#011); [Dan
10:13](../kjv/dan010.htm#013); [Dan 12:1](../kjv/dan012.htm#001); [Th1
4:16](../kjv/th1004.htm#016); [Jde 1:9](../kjv/jde001.htm#009); [Eph
1:21](../kjv/eph001.htm#021); [Col 1:16](../kjv/col001.htm#016)). (2.)
As to their nature, they are spirits ([Heb
1:14](../kjv/heb001.htm#014)), like the soul of man, but not
incorporeal. Such expressions as "like the angels" ([Luk
20:36](../kjv/luk020.htm#036)), and the fact that whenever angels
appeared to man it was always in a human form ([Gen
18:2](../kjv/gen018.htm#002); [Gen 19:1](../kjv/gen019.htm#001), [Gen
19:10](../kjv/gen019.htm#010); [Luk 24:4](../kjv/luk024.htm#004); [Act
1:10](../kjv/act001.htm#010)), and the titles that are applied to them
("sons of God," [Job 1:6](../kjv/job001.htm#006); [Job
38:7](../kjv/job038.htm#007); [Dan 3:25](../kjv/dan003.htm#025); compare
[Dan 3:28](../kjv/dan003.htm#028)) and to men ([Luk
3:38](../kjv/luk003.htm#038)), seem all to indicate some resemblance
between them and the human race. Imperfection is ascribed to them as
creatures ([Job 4:18](../kjv/job004.htm#018); [Mat
24:36](../kjv/mat024.htm#036); [Pe1 1:12](../kjv/pe1001.htm#012)). As
finite creatures they may fall under temptation; and accordingly we read
of "fallen angels." Of the cause and manner of their "fall" we are
wholly ignorant. We know only that "they left their first estate" ([Mat
25:41](../kjv/mat025.htm#041); [Rev 12:7](../kjv/rev012.htm#007), [Rev
12:9](../kjv/rev012.htm#009)), and that they are "reserved unto
judgment" ([Pe2 2:4](../kjv/pe2002.htm#004)). When the manna is called
"angels' food," this is merely to denote its excellence ([Psa
78:25](../kjv/psa078.htm#025)). Angels never die ([Luk
20:36](../kjv/luk020.htm#036)). They are possessed of superhuman
intelligence and power ([Mar 13:32](../kjv/mar013.htm#032); [Th2
1:7](../kjv/th2001.htm#007); [Psa 103:20](../kjv/psa103.htm#020)). They
are called "holy" ([Luk 9:26](../kjv/luk009.htm#026)), "elect" ([Ti1
5:21](../kjv/ti1005.htm#021)). The redeemed in glory are "like unto the
angels" ([Luk 20:36](../kjv/luk020.htm#036)). They are not to be
worshipped ([Col 2:18](../kjv/col002.htm#018); [Rev
19:10](../kjv/rev019.htm#010)). (3.) Their functions are manifold. (a)
In the widest sense they are agents of God's providence ([Exo
12:23](../kjv/exo012.htm#023); [Psa 104:4](../kjv/psa104.htm#004); [Heb
11:28](../kjv/heb011.htm#028); [Co1 10:10](../kjv/co1010.htm#010); [Sa2
24:16](../kjv/sa2024.htm#016); [Ch1 21:16](../kjv/ch1021.htm#016); [Kg2
19:35](../kjv/kg2019.htm#035); [Act 12:23](../kjv/act012.htm#023)). (b)
They are specially God's agents in carrying on his great work of
redemption. There is no notice of angelic appearances to man till after
the call of Abraham. From that time onward there are frequent references
to their ministry on earth (Gen. 18; 19; [Gen
24:7](../kjv/gen024.htm#007), [Gen 24:40](../kjv/gen024.htm#040); [Gen
28:12](../kjv/gen028.htm#012); [Gen 32:1](../kjv/gen032.htm#001)). They
appear to rebuke idolatry ([Jdg 2:1](../kjv/jdg002.htm#001)), to call
Gideon ([Jdg 6:11](../kjv/jdg006.htm#011), [Jdg
6:12](../kjv/jdg006.htm#012)), and to consecrate Samson ([Jdg
13:3](../kjv/jdg013.htm#003)). In the days of the prophets, from Samuel
downward, the angels appear only in their behalf ([Kg1
19:5](../kjv/kg1019.htm#005); [Kg2 6:17](../kjv/kg2006.htm#017); Zech.
1-6; [Dan 4:13](../kjv/dan004.htm#013), [Dan
4:23](../kjv/dan004.htm#023); [Dan 10:10](../kjv/dan010.htm#010), [Dan
10:13](../kjv/dan010.htm#013), [Dan 10:20](../kjv/dan010.htm#020), [Dan
10:21](../kjv/dan010.htm#021)). The Incarnation introduces a new era in
the ministrations of angels. They come with their Lord to earth to do
him service while here. They predict his advent ([Mat
1:20](../kjv/mat001.htm#020); [Luk 1:26](../kjv/luk001.htm#026)),
minister to him after his temptation and agony ([Mat
4:11](../kjv/mat004.htm#011); [Luk 22:43](../kjv/luk022.htm#043)), and
declare his resurrection and ascension ([Mat
28:2](../kjv/mat028.htm#002); [Joh 20:12](../kjv/joh020.htm#012), [Joh
20:13](../kjv/joh020.htm#013); [Act 1:10](../kjv/act001.htm#010), [Act
1:11](../kjv/act001.htm#011)). They are now ministering spirits to the
people of God ([Heb 1:14](../kjv/heb001.htm#014); [Psa
34:7](../kjv/psa034.htm#007); [Psa 91:11](../kjv/psa091.htm#011); [Mat
18:10](../kjv/mat018.htm#010); [Act 5:19](../kjv/act005.htm#019); [Act
8:26](../kjv/act008.htm#026); [Act 10:3](../kjv/act010.htm#003); [Act
12:7](../kjv/act012.htm#007); [Act 27:23](../kjv/act027.htm#023)). They
rejoice over a penitent sinner ([Luk 15:10](../kjv/luk015.htm#010)).
They bear the souls of the redeemed to paradise ([Luk
16:22](../kjv/luk016.htm#022)); and they will be the ministers of
judgment hereafter on the great day ([Mat 13:39](../kjv/mat013.htm#039),
[Mat 13:41](../kjv/mat013.htm#041), [Mat 13:49](../kjv/mat013.htm#049);
[Mat 16:27](../kjv/mat016.htm#027); [Mat 24:31](../kjv/mat024.htm#031)).
The passages ([Psa 34:7](../kjv/psa034.htm#007), [Mat
18:10](../kjv/mat018.htm#010)) usually referred to in support of the
idea that every individual has a particular guardian angel have no such
meaning. They merely indicate that God employs the ministry of angels to
deliver his people from affliction and danger, and that the angels do
not think it below their dignity to minister even to children and to the
least among Christ's disciples. The "angel of his presence" ([Isa
63:9](../kjv/isa063.htm#009). Compare [Exo
23:20](../kjv/exo023.htm#020), [Exo 23:21](../kjv/exo023.htm#021); [Exo
32:34](../kjv/exo032.htm#034); [Exo 33:2](../kjv/exo033.htm#002); [Num
20:16](../kjv/num020.htm#016)) is probably rightly interpreted of the
Messiah as the guide of his people. Others have supposed the expression
to refer to Gabriel ([Luk 1:19](../kjv/luk001.htm#019)).

<span id="002">**Anger**</span> The emotion of instant displeasure on
account of something evil that presents itself to our view. In itself it
is an original susceptibility of our nature, just as love is, and is not
necessarily sinful. It may, however, become sinful when causeless, or
excessive, or protracted ([Mat 5:22](../kjv/mat005.htm#022); [Eph
4:26](../kjv/eph004.htm#026); [Col 3:8](../kjv/col003.htm#008)). As
ascribed to God, it merely denotes his displeasure with sin and with
sinners ([Psa 7:11](../kjv/psa007.htm#011)).

<span id="003">**Anim**</span> Fountains, a city in the mountains of
Judah ([Jos 15:50](../kjv/jos015.htm#050)), now el Guwein, near
Eshtemoh, about 10 miles south-west of Hebron.

<span id="004">**Animal**</span> An organized living creature endowed
with sensation. The Levitical law divided animals into clean and
unclean, although the distinction seems to have existed before the Flood
([Gen 7:2](../kjv/gen007.htm#002)). The clean could be offered in
sacrifice and eaten. All animals that had not cloven hoofs and did not
chew the cud were unclean. The list of clean and unclean quadrupeds is
set forth in the Levitical law (Deut. 14:3-20; Lev. 11).

<span id="005">**Anise**</span> This word is found only in [Mat
23:23](../kjv/mat023.htm#023). It is the plant commonly known by the
name of dill, the Peucedanum graveolens of the botanist. This name dill
is derived from a Norse word which means to soothe, the plant having the
carminative property of allaying pain. The common dill, the Anethum
graveolens, is an annual growing wild in the cornfields of Spain and
Portugal and the south of Europe generally. There is also a species of
dill cultivated in Eastern countries known by the name of shubit. It was
this species of garden plant of which the Pharisees were in the habit of
paying tithes. The Talmud requires that the seeds, leaves, and stem of
dill shall pay tithes. It is an umbelliferous plant, very like the
caraway its leaves, which are aromatic, being used in soups and pickles.
The proper anise is the Pimpinella anisum.

<span id="006">**Anna**</span> Grace, an aged widow, the daughter of
Phanuel. She was a "prophetess," like Miriam, Deborah, and Huldah ([Ch2
34:22](../kjv/ch2034.htm#022)). After seven years of married life her
husband died, and during her long widowhood she daily attended the
temple services. When she was eighty-four years old, she entered the
temple at the moment when the aged Simeon uttered his memorable words of
praise and thanks to God that he had fulfilled his ancient promise in
sending his Son into the world ([Luk 2:36](../kjv/luk002.htm#036), [Luk
2:37](../kjv/luk002.htm#037)).

<span id="007">**Annas**</span> Was high priest A.D. 7-14. In A.D. 25
Caiaphas, who had married the daughter of Annas ([Joh
18:13](../kjv/joh018.htm#013)), was raised to that office, and probably
Annas was now made president of the Sanhedrim, or deputy or coadjutor of
the high priest, and thus was also called high priest along with
Caiaphas ([Luk 3:2](../kjv/luk003.htm#002)). By the Mosaic law the
high-priesthood was held for life ([Num 3:10](../kjv/num003.htm#010));
and although Annas had been deposed by the Roman procurator, the Jews
may still have regarded him as legally the high priest. Our Lord was
first brought before Annas, and after a brief questioning of him ([Joh
18:19](../kjv/joh018.htm#019)) was sent to Caiaphas, when some members
of the Sanhedrim had met, and the first trial of Jesus took place ([Mat
26:57](../kjv/mat026.htm#057)). This examination of our Lord before
Annas is recorded only by John. Annas was president of the Sanhedrim
before which Peter and John were brought ([Act
4:6](../kjv/act004.htm#006)).

<span id="008">**Anoint**</span> The practice of anointing with perfumed
oil was common among the Hebrews. (1.) The act of anointing was
significant of consecration to a holy or sacred use; hence the anointing
of the high priest ([Exo 29:29](../kjv/exo029.htm#029); [Lev
4:3](../kjv/lev004.htm#003)) and of the sacred vessels ([Exo
30:26](../kjv/exo030.htm#026)). The high priest and the king are thus
called "the anointed" ([Lev 4:3](../kjv/lev004.htm#003), [Lev
4:5](../kjv/lev004.htm#005), [Lev 4:16](../kjv/lev004.htm#016); [Lev
6:20](../kjv/lev006.htm#020); [Psa 132:10](../kjv/psa132.htm#010)).
Anointing a king was equivalent to crowning him ([Sa1
16:13](../kjv/sa1016.htm#013); [Sa2 2:4](../kjv/sa2002.htm#004), etc.).
Prophets were also anointed ([Kg1 19:16](../kjv/kg1019.htm#016); [Ch1
16:22](../kjv/ch1016.htm#022); [Psa 105:15](../kjv/psa105.htm#015)). The
expression, "anoint the shield" ([Isa 21:5](../kjv/isa021.htm#005)),
refers to the custom of rubbing oil on the leather of the shield so as
to make it supple and fit for use in war. (2.) Anointing was also an act
of hospitality ([Luk 7:38](../kjv/luk007.htm#038), [Luk
7:46](../kjv/luk007.htm#046)). It was the custom of the Jews in like
manner to anoint themselves with oil, as a means of refreshing or
invigorating their bodies ([Deu 28:40](../kjv/deu028.htm#040); [Rut
3:3](../kjv/rut003.htm#003); [Sa2 14:2](../kjv/sa2014.htm#002); [Psa
104:15](../kjv/psa104.htm#015), etc.). This custom is continued among
the Arabians to the present day. (3.) Oil was used also for medicinal
purposes. It was applied to the sick, and also to wounds ([Psa
109:18](../kjv/psa109.htm#018); [Isa 1:6](../kjv/isa001.htm#006); [Mar
6:13](../kjv/mar006.htm#013); [Jam 5:14](../kjv/jam005.htm#014)). (4.)
The bodies of the dead were sometimes anointed ([Mar
14:8](../kjv/mar014.htm#008); [Luk 23:56](../kjv/luk023.htm#056)). (5.)
The promised Delivered is twice called the "Anointed" or Messiah ([Psa
2:2](../kjv/psa002.htm#002); [Dan 9:25](../kjv/dan009.htm#025), [Dan
9:26](../kjv/dan009.htm#026)), because he was anointed with the Holy
Ghost ([Isa 61:1](../kjv/isa061.htm#001)), figuratively styled the "oil
of gladness" ([Psa 45:7](../kjv/psa045.htm#007); [Heb
1:9](../kjv/heb001.htm#009)). Jesus of Nazareth is this anointed One
([Joh 1:41](../kjv/joh001.htm#041); [Act 9:22](../kjv/act009.htm#022);
[Act 17:2](../kjv/act017.htm#002), [Act 17:3](../kjv/act017.htm#003);
[Act 18:5](../kjv/act018.htm#005), [Act 18:28](../kjv/act018.htm#028)),
the Messiah of the Old Testament.

<span id="009">**Ant**</span> (Heb. nemalah from a word meaning to
creep, cut off, destroy), referred to in [Pro
6:6](../kjv/pro006.htm#006); [Pro 30:25](../kjv/pro030.htm#025), as
distinguished for its prudent habits. Many ants in Palestine feed on
animal substances, but others draw their nourishment partly or
exclusively from vegetables. To the latter class belongs the ant to
which Solomon refers. This ant gathers the seeds in the season of
ripening, and stores them for future use; a habit that has been observed
in ants in Texas, India, and Italy.
