<span id="000">**East**</span> (1.) The orient (mizrah); the rising of
the sun. Thus "the east country" is the country lying to the east of
Syria, the Elymais ([Zac 8:7](../kjv/zac008.htm#007)). (2..md) Properly
what is in front of one, or a country that is before or in front of
another; the rendering of the word kedem. In pointing out the quarters,
a Hebrew always looked with his face toward the east. The word kedem is
used when the four quarters of the world are described ([Gen
13:14](../kjv/gen013.htm#014); [Gen 28:14](../kjv/gen028.htm#014).md); and
mizrah when the east only is distinguished from the west ([Jos
11:3](../kjv/jos011.htm#003); [Psa 50:1](../kjv/psa050.htm#001.md); [Psa
103:12](../kjv/psa103.htm#012), etc..md). In [Gen
25:6](../kjv/gen025.htm#006.md) "eastward" is literally "unto the land of
kedem;" i.e., the lands lying east of Palestine, namely, Arabia,
Mesopotamia, etc.

<span id="001">**East gate**</span> ([Jer 19:2](../kjv/jer019.htm#002).md),
properly the Potter's gate, the gate which led to the potter's field, in
the valley of Hinnom.

<span id="002">**East, Children of the**</span> The Arabs as a whole,
known as the Nabateans or Kedarenes, nomad tribes ([Jdg
6:3](../kjv/jdg006.htm#003), [Jdg 6:33](../kjv/jdg006.htm#033.md); [Jdg
7:12](../kjv/jdg007.htm#012); [Jdg 8:10](../kjv/jdg008.htm#010).md).

<span id="003">**East sea**</span> ([Joe 2:20](../kjv/joe002.htm#020.md);
[Eze 47:18](../kjv/eze047.htm#018).md), the Dead Sea, which lay on the east
side of the Holy Land. The Mediterranean, which lay on the west, was
hence called the "great sea for the west border" ([Num
34:6](../kjv/num034.htm#006).md).

<span id="004">**East wind**</span> The wind coming from the east ([Job
27:21](../kjv/job027.htm#021); [Isa 27:8](../kjv/isa027.htm#008), etc..md).
Blight caused by this wind, "thin ears" ([Gen
41:6](../kjv/gen041.htm#006).md); the withered "gourd" ([Jon
4:8](../kjv/jon004.htm#008).md). It was the cause and also the emblem of
evil ([Eze 17:10](../kjv/eze017.htm#010.md); [Eze
19:12](../kjv/eze019.htm#012); [Hos 13:15](../kjv/hos013.htm#015).md). In
Palestine this wind blows from a burning desert, and hence is destitute
of moisture necessary for vegetation.

<span id="005">**Easter**</span> Originally a Saxon word (Eostre),
denoting a goddess of the Saxons, in honour of whom sacrifices were
offered about the time of the Passover. Hence the name came to be given
to the festival of the Resurrection of Christ, which occurred at the
time of the Passover. In the early English versions this word was
frequently used as the translation of the Greek pascha (the Passover).
When the Authorized Version (1611) was formed, the word "passover" was
used in all passages in which this word pascha occurred, except in Act
[Gen 12:4](../kjv/gen012.htm#004.md). In the Revised Version the proper
word, "passover," is always used.

<span id="006">**Eating**</span> The ancient Hebrews would not eat with
the Egyptians ([Gen 43:32](../kjv/gen043.htm#032).md). In the time of our
Lord they would not eat with Samaritans ([Joh
4:9](../kjv/joh004.htm#009).md), and were astonished that he ate with
publicans and sinners ([Mat 9:11](../kjv/mat009.htm#011).md). The Hebrews
originally sat at table, but afterwards adopted the Persian and Chaldean
practice of reclining ([Luk 7:36](../kjv/luk007.htm#036).md). Their
principal meal was at noon ([Gen 43:16](../kjv/gen043.htm#016.md); [Kg1
20:16](../kjv/kg1020.htm#016); [Rut 2:14](../kjv/rut002.htm#014.md); [Luk
14:12](../kjv/luk014.htm#012).md). The word "eat" is used metaphorically in
[Jer 15:16](../kjv/jer015.htm#016); [Eze 3:1](../kjv/eze003.htm#001.md);
[Rev 10:9](../kjv/rev010.htm#009). In [Joh 6:53](../kjv/joh006.htm#053.md),
"eating and drinking" means believing in Christ. Women were never
present as guests at meals (q.v.).

<span id="007">**Ebal**</span> Stony. (1.) A mountain 3,076 feet above
the level of the sea, and 1,200 feet above the level of the valley, on
the north side of which stood the city of Shechem (q.v.). On this
mountain six of the tribes ([Deu 27:12](../kjv/deu027.htm#012.md), [Deu
27:13](../kjv/deu027.htm#013).md) were appointed to take their stand and
respond according to a prescribed form to the imprecations uttered in
the valley, where the law was read by the Levites ([Deu
11:29](../kjv/deu011.htm#029); [Deu 29:4](../kjv/deu029.htm#004.md), [Deu
29:13](../kjv/deu029.htm#013).md). This mountain was also the site of the
first great altar erected to Jehovah ([Deu 27:5](../kjv/deu027.htm#005.md);
[Jos 8:30](../kjv/jos008.htm#030).md). After this the name of Ebal does not
again occur in Jewish history. (See GERIZIM.) (2.) A descendant of Eber
([Ch1 1:22](../kjv/ch1001.htm#022).md), called also Obal ([Gen
10:28](../kjv/gen010.htm#028)). (3..md) A descendant of Seir the Horite
([Gen 36:23](../kjv/gen036.htm#023).md).

<span id="008">**Ebed**</span> Slave, the father of Gaal, in whom the
men of Shechem "put confidence" in their conspiracy against Abimelech
([Jdg 9:26](../kjv/jdg009.htm#026), [Jdg 9:26](../kjv/jdg009.htm#026.md),
[Jdg 9:30](../kjv/jdg009.htm#030), [Jdg 9:31](../kjv/jdg009.htm#031).md).

<span id="009">**Ebed-melech**</span> A servant of the king; probably an
official title, an Ethiopian, "one of the eunuchs which was in the
king's house;" i.e., in the palace of Zedekiah, king of Judah. He
interceded with the king in Jeremiah's behalf, and was the means of
saving him from death by famine ([Jer 38:7](../kjv/jer038.htm#007.md);
compare [Jer 39:15](../kjv/jer039.htm#015).md).
