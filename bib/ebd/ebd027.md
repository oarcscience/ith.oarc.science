<span id="000">**Apparel**</span> In Old Testament times the distinction
between male and female attire was not very marked. The statute
forbidding men to wear female apparel ([Deu
22:5](../kjv/deu022.htm#005)) referred especially to ornaments and
head-dresses. Both men and women wore (1.) an under garment or tunic,
which was bound by a girdle. One who had only this tunic on was spoken
of as "naked" ([Sa1 19:24](../kjv/sa1019.htm#024); [Job
24:10](../kjv/job024.htm#010); [Isa 20:2](../kjv/isa020.htm#002)). Those
in high stations sometimes wore two tunics, the outer being called the
"upper garment" ([Sa1 15:27](../kjv/sa1015.htm#027); [Sa1
18:4](../kjv/sa1018.htm#004); [Sa1 24:5](../kjv/sa1024.htm#005); [Job
1:20](../kjv/job001.htm#020)). (2.) They wore in common an over-garment
("mantle," [Isa 3:22](../kjv/isa003.htm#022); [Kg1
19:13](../kjv/kg1019.htm#013); [Kg2 2:13](../kjv/kg2002.htm#013)), a
loose and flowing robe. The folds of this upper garment could be formed
into a lap ([Rut 3:15](../kjv/rut003.htm#015); [Psa
79:12](../kjv/psa079.htm#012); [Pro 17:23](../kjv/pro017.htm#023); [Luk
6:38](../kjv/luk006.htm#038)). Generals of armies usually wore scarlet
robes ([Jdg 8:26](../kjv/jdg008.htm#026); [Nah
2:3](../kjv/nah002.htm#003)). A form of conspicuous raiment is mentioned
in [Luk 20:46](../kjv/luk020.htm#046); compare [Mat
23:5](../kjv/mat023.htm#005). Priests alone wore trousers. Both men and
women wore turbans. Kings and nobles usually had a store of costly
garments for festive occasions ([Isa 3:22](../kjv/isa003.htm#022); [Zac
3:4](../kjv/zac003.htm#004)) and for presents ([Gen
45:22](../kjv/gen045.htm#022); [Est 4:4](../kjv/est004.htm#004); [Est
6:8](../kjv/est006.htm#008), [Est 6:11](../kjv/est006.htm#011); [Sa1
18:4](../kjv/sa1018.htm#004); [Kg2 5:5](../kjv/kg2005.htm#005); [Kg2
10:22](../kjv/kg2010.htm#022)). Prophets and ascetics wore coarse
garments ([Isa 20:2](../kjv/isa020.htm#002); [Zac
13:4](../kjv/zac013.htm#004); [Mat 3:4](../kjv/mat003.htm#004)).

<span id="001">**Appeal**</span> A reference of any case from an
inferior to a superior court. Moses established in the wilderness a
series of judicatories such that appeals could be made from a lower to a
higher ([Exo 18:13](../kjv/exo018.htm#013).) Under the Roman law the
most remarkable case of appeal is that of Paul from the tribunal of
Festus at Caesarea to that of the emperor at Rome ([Act
25:11](../kjv/act025.htm#011), [Act 25:12](../kjv/act025.htm#012), [Act
25:21](../kjv/act025.htm#021), [Act 25:25](../kjv/act025.htm#025)). Paul
availed himself of the privilege of a Roman citizen in this matter.

<span id="002">**Apphia**</span> Increasing, a female Christian at
Colosse ([Plm 1:2](../kjv/plm001.htm#002)), supposed by some to have
been the wife of Philemon.

<span id="003">**Appii Forum**</span> I.e., "the market of Appius" ([Act
28:15](../kjv/act028.htm#015), R.V.), a town on the road, the "Appian
Way," from Rome to Brundusium. It was 43 miles from Rome. Here Paul was
met by some Roman Christians on his way to the capital. It was natural
that they should halt here and wait for him, because from this place
there were two ways by which travelers might journey to Rome.

<span id="004">**Apple**</span> (Heb. tappuah , meaning "fragrance").
Probably the apricot or quince is intended by the word, as Palestine was
too hot for the growth of apples proper. It is enumerated among the most
valuable trees of Palestine ([Joe 1:12](../kjv/joe001.htm#012)), and
frequently referred to in Canticles, and noted for its beauty ([Sol
2:3](../kjv/sol002.htm#003), [Sol 2:5](../kjv/sol002.htm#005); [Sol
8:5](../kjv/sol008.htm#005)). There is nothing to show that it was the
"tree of the knowledge of good and evil." Dr. Tristram has suggested
that the apricot has better claims than any other fruit-tree to be the
apple of Scripture. It grows to a height of 30 feet, has a roundish mass
of glossy leaves, and bears an orange colored fruit that gives out a
delicious perfume. The "apple of the eye" is the Heb. ishon , meaning
manikin, i.e., the pupil of the eye ([Pro 7:2](../kjv/pro007.htm#002)).
(Compare the promise, [Zac 2:8](../kjv/zac002.htm#008); the prayer, [Psa
17:8](../kjv/psa017.htm#008); and its fulfillment, [Deu
32:10](../kjv/deu032.htm#010).) The so-called "apple of Sodom" some have
supposed to be the Solanum sanctum (Heb. hedek ), rendered "brier"
(q.v.) in [Mic 7:4](../kjv/mic007.htm#004), a thorny plant bearing fruit
like the potato-apple. This shrub abounds in the Jordan valley. (See
ENGEDI.)

<span id="005">**Apron**</span> Found in the Authorized Version in [Gen
3:7](../kjv/gen003.htm#007), of the bands of fig-leaves made by our
first parents. In [Act 19:12](../kjv/act019.htm#012), it denotes the
belt or half-girdle worn by artisans and servants round the waist for
the purpose of preserving the clothing from injury. In marg. of
Authorized Version, [Rut 3:15](../kjv/rut003.htm#015), correctly
rendered instead of "vail." (R.V., "mantle.")

<span id="006">**Aquila**</span> Eagle, a native of Pontus, by
occupation a tent-maker, whom Paul met on his first visit to Corinth
([Act 18:2](../kjv/act018.htm#002)). Along with his wife Priscilla he
had fled from Rome in consequence of a decree (A.D. 50) by Claudius
commanding all Jews to leave the city. Paul sojourned with him at
Corinth, and they wrought together at their common trade, making
Cilician hair-cloth for tents. On Paul's departure from Corinth after
eighteen months, Aquila and his wife accompanied him to Ephesus, where
they remained, while he proceeded to Syria ([Act
18:18](../kjv/act018.htm#018), [Act 18:26](../kjv/act018.htm#026)). When
they became Christians we are not informed, but in Ephesus they were
([Co1 16:19](../kjv/co1016.htm#019)) Paul's "helpers in Christ Jesus."
We find them afterwards at Rome ([Rom 16:3](../kjv/rom016.htm#003)),
interesting themselves still in the cause of Christ. They are referred
to some years after this as being at Ephesus ([Ti2
4:19](../kjv/ti2004.htm#019)). This is the last notice we have of them.

<span id="007">**Arab**</span> Ambush, a city in the mountains of Judah
([Jos 15:52](../kjv/jos015.htm#052)), now Er-Rabiyeh.

<span id="008">**Arabah**</span> Plain, in the Revised Version of [Kg2
14:25](../kjv/kg2014.htm#025); [Jos 3:16](../kjv/jos003.htm#016); [Jos
8:14](../kjv/jos008.htm#014); [Sa2 2:29](../kjv/sa2002.htm#029); [Sa2
4:7](../kjv/sa2004.htm#007) (in all these passages the A.V. has
"plain"); [Amo 6:14](../kjv/amo006.htm#014) (A.V. "wilderness"). This
word is found in the Authorized Version only in [Jos
18:18](../kjv/jos018.htm#018). It denotes the hollow depression through
which the Jordan flows from the Lake of Galilee to the Dead Sea. It is
now called by the Arabs el-Ghor. But the Ghor is sometimes spoken of as
extending 10 miles south of the Dead Sea, and thence to the Gulf of
Akabah on the Red Sea is called the Wady el-Arabah.

<span id="009">**Arabia**</span> Arid, an extensive region in the
south-west of Asia. It is bounded on the west by the Isthmus of Suez and
the Red Sea, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the east by the
Persian Gulf and the Euphrates. It extends far into the north in barren
deserts, meeting those of Syria and Mesopotamia. It is one of the few
countries of the world from which the original inhabitants have never
been expelled. See map, of Arabia It was anciently divided into three
parts:, (1.) Arabia Felix (Happy Arabia), so called from its fertility.
It embraced a large portion of the country now known by the name of
Arabia. The Arabs call it Yemen. It lies between the Red Sea and the
Persian Gulf. (2.) Arabia Deserta, the el-Badieh or "Great Wilderness"
of the Arabs. From this name is derived that which is usually given to
the nomadic tribes which wander over this region, the "Bedaween," or,
more generally, "Bedouin," (3.) Arabia Petraea, i.e., the Rocky Arabia,
so called from its rocky mountains and stony plains. It comprehended all
the north-west portion of the country, and is much better known to
travelers than any other portion. This country is, however, divided by
modern geographers into (1.) Arabia Proper, or the Arabian Peninsula;
(2.) Northern Arabia, or the Arabian Desert; and (3.) Western Arabia,
which includes the peninsula of Sinai and the Desert of Petra,
originally inhabited by the Horites ([Gen 14:6](../kjv/gen014.htm#006),
etc.), but in later times by the descendants of Esau, and known as the
Land of Edom or Idumea, also as the Desert of Seir or Mount Seir. The
whole land appears (Gen. 10) to have been inhabited by a variety of
tribes of different lineage, Ishmaelites, Arabians, Idumeans, Horites,
and Edomites; but at length becoming amalgamated, they came to be known
by the general designation of Arabs. The modern nation of Arabs is
predominantly Ishmaelite. Their language is the most developed and the
richest of all the Semitic languages, and is of great value to the
student of Hebrew. The Israelites wandered for forty years in Arabia. In
the days of Solomon, and subsequently, commercial intercourse was to a
considerable extent kept up with this country ([Kg1
10:15](../kjv/kg1010.htm#015); [Ch2 9:14](../kjv/ch2009.htm#014); [Ch2
17:11](../kjv/ch2017.htm#011)). Arabians were present in Jerusalem at
Pentecost ([Act 2:11](../kjv/act002.htm#011)). Paul retired for a season
into Arabia after his conversion ([Gal 1:17](../kjv/gal001.htm#017)).
This country is frequently referred to by the prophets ([Isa
21:11](../kjv/isa021.htm#011); [Isa 42:11](../kjv/isa042.htm#011); [Jer
25:24](../kjv/jer025.htm#024), etc.)
