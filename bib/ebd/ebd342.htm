<P><A NAME="000"><B>Shunammite</B></A>     A person of Shunem (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1001.htm#003">Kg1 1:3</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/kg2004.htm#012">Kg2 4:12</A>). The Syr. and Arab. read &quot;Sulamite.&quot; 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Shunem</B></A>     Two resting-places, a little village in the tribe of Issachar, to the north of Jezreel and south of Mount Gilboa (<A HREF="../kjv/jos019.htm#018">Jos 19:18</A>), where the Philistines encamped when they came against Saul (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1028.htm#004">Sa1 28:4</A>), and where Elisha was hospitably entertained by a rich woman of the place. On the sudden death of this woman's son she hastened to Carmel, 20 miles distant across the plain, to tell Elisha, and to bring him with her to Shunem. There, in the &quot;prophet's chamber,&quot; the dead child lay; and Elisha entering it, shut the door and prayed earnestly: and the boy was restored to life (2 Kings 4:8-37). This woman afterwards retired during the famine to the low land of the Philistines; and on returning a few years afterwards, found her house and fields in the possession of a stranger. She appealed to the king at Samaria, and had them in a somewhat remarkable manner restored to her (compare <A HREF="../kjv/kg2008.htm#001">Kg2 8:1</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Shur</B></A>     An enclosure; a wall, a part, probably, of the Arabian desert, on the north-eastern border of Egypt, giving its name to a wilderness extending from Egypt toward Philistia (<A HREF="../kjv/gen016.htm#007">Gen 16:7</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gen020.htm#001">Gen 20:1</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gen025.htm#018">Gen 25:18</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/exo015.htm#022">Exo 15:22</A>). The name was probably given to it from the wall (or shur) which the Egyptians built to defend their frontier on the north-east from the desert tribes. This wall or line of fortifications extended from Pelusium to Heliopolis.

<P><A NAME="003"><B>Shushan</B></A>     A lily, the Susa of Greek and Roman writers, once the capital of Elam. It lay in the uplands of Susiana, on the east of the Tigris, about 150 miles to the north of the head of the Persian Gulf. It is the modern Shush, on the northwest of Shuster. Once a magnificent city, it is now an immense mass of ruins. Here Daniel saw one of his visions (Dan. 8); and here also Nehemiah (<A HREF="../kjv/neh001.htm#001">Neh 1:1</A>) began his public life. Most of the events recorded in the Book of Esther took place here. Modern explorers have brought to light numerous relics, and the ground-plan of the splendid palace of Shushan, one of the residences of the great king, together with numerous specimens of ancient art, which illustrate the statements of Scripture regarding it (<A HREF="../kjv/dan008.htm#002">Dan 8:2</A>). The great hall of this palace (Esther 1) &quot;consisted of several magnificent groups of columns, together with a frontage of 343 feet 9 inches, and a depth of 244 feet. These groups were arranged into a central phalanx of thirty-six columns (six rows of six each), flanked on the west, north, and east by an equal number, disposed in double rows of six each, and distant from them 64 feet 2 inches.&quot; The inscriptions on the ruins represent that the palace was founded by Darius and completed by Artaxerxes.

<P><A NAME="004"><B>Shushan-Eduth</B></A>     Lily of the testimony, the title of <A HREF="../kjv/psa060.htm#001">Psa 60:1</A>. (See SHOSHANNIM.) 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Sibbecai</B></A>     The Lord sustains, one of David's heroes (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1011.htm#029">Ch1 11:29</A>), general of the eighth division of the army (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1027.htm#011">Ch1 27:11</A>). He slew the giant Saph in the battle of Gob (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2021.htm#018">Sa2 21:18</A>; R.V., &quot;Sibbechai&quot;). Called also Mebunnai (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2023.htm#027">Sa2 23:27</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Sibmah</B></A>     Coolness; fragrance, a town in Reuben, in the territory of Moab, on the east of Jordan (<A HREF="../kjv/jos013.htm#019">Jos 13:19</A>); called also Shebam and Shibmah (<A HREF="../kjv/num032.htm#003">Num 32:3</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/num032.htm#038">Num 32:38</A>). It was famous for its vines (<A HREF="../kjv/isa016.htm#009">Isa 16:9</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer048.htm#032">Jer 48:32</A>). It has been identified with the ruin of Sumieh, where there are rock-cut wine-presses. This fact explains the words of the prophets referred to above. It was about 5 miles east of Heshbon. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Sichem</B></A>     =Shechem (q.v.), <A HREF="../kjv/gen012.htm#006">Gen 12:6</A>. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Sickle</B></A>     Of the Egyptians resembled that in modern use. The ears of corn were cut with it near the top of the straw. There was also a sickle used for warlike purposes, more correctly, however, called a pruning-hook (<A HREF="../kjv/deu016.htm#009">Deu 16:9</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer050.htm#016">Jer 50:16</A>, marg., &quot;scythe;&quot; <A HREF="../kjv/joe003.htm#013">Joe 3:13</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mar004.htm#029">Mar 4:29</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Siddim, Vale of</B></A>     Valley of the broad plains, &quot;which is the salt sea&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/gen014.htm#003">Gen 14:3</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gen014.htm#008">Gen 14:8</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gen014.htm#010">Gen 14:10</A>), between Engedi and the cities of the plain, at the south end of the Dead Sea. It was &quot;full of slime-pits&quot; (R.V., &quot;bitumen pits&quot;). Here Chedorlaomer and the confederate kings overthrew the kings of Sodom and the cities of the plain. God afterwards, on account of their wickedness, &quot;overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities;&quot; and the smoke of their destruction &quot;went up as the smoke of a furnace&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/gen019.htm#024">Gen 19:24</A>), and was visible from Mamre, where Abraham dwelt. Some, however, contend that the &quot;cities of the plain&quot; were somewhere at the north of the Dead Sea. (See SODOM.)
