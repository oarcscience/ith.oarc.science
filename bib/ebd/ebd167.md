<span id="000">**Hat**</span> Chald. karb'ela , ([Dan
3:21](../kjv/dan003.htm#021)), properly mantle or pallium. The Revised
Version renders it "tunic."

<span id="001">**Hatach**</span> Verity, one of the eunuchs or
chamberlains in the palace of Ahasuerus ([Est
4:5](../kjv/est004.htm#005), [Est 4:6](../kjv/est004.htm#006), [Est
4:9](../kjv/est004.htm#009), [Est 4:10](../kjv/est004.htm#010)).

<span id="002">**Hatred**</span> Among the works of the flesh ([Gal
5:20](../kjv/gal005.htm#020)). Altogether different is the meaning of
the word in [Deu 21:15](../kjv/deu021.htm#015); [Mat
6:24](../kjv/mat006.htm#024); [Luk 14:26](../kjv/luk014.htm#026); [Rom
9:13](../kjv/rom009.htm#013), where it denotes only a less degree of
love.

<span id="003">**Hathath**</span> Terror, son of Othniel ([Ch1
4:13](../kjv/ch1004.htm#013)).

<span id="004">**Hatipha**</span> Captured, one of the Nethinim ([Ezr
2:54](../kjv/ezr002.htm#054)).

<span id="005">**Hatita**</span> Exploration, one of the temple porters
or janitors ([Ezr 2:42](../kjv/ezr002.htm#042)). He returned from
Babylon with Zerubbabel.

<span id="006">**Hattush**</span> Assembled. (1.) A priest who returned
with Zerubbabel ([Neh 12:2](../kjv/neh012.htm#002)). (2.) [Ezr
8:2](../kjv/ezr008.htm#002). (3.) [Neh 3:10](../kjv/neh003.htm#010).
(4.) [Neh 10:4](../kjv/neh010.htm#004). (5.) [Ch1
3:22](../kjv/ch1003.htm#022).

<span id="007">**Hauran**</span> Cave-land, mentioned only in [Eze
47:16](../kjv/eze047.htm#016), [Eze 47:18](../kjv/eze047.htm#018). It
was one of the ancient divisions of Bashan (q.v.), and lay on the
south-east of Gaulanitis or the Jaulan, and on the south of Lejah,
extending from the Arnon to the Hieromax. It was the most fertile region
in Syria, and to this day abounds in the ruins of towns, many of which
have stone doors and massive walls. It retains its ancient name. It was
known by the Greeks and Romans as "Auranitis."

<span id="008">**Haven**</span> A harbour ([Psa
107:30](../kjv/psa107.htm#030); [Act 27:12](../kjv/act027.htm#012)). The
most famous on the coast of Palestine was that of Tyre ([Eze
27:3](../kjv/eze027.htm#003)). That of Crete, called "Fair Havens," is
mentioned [Act 27:8](../kjv/act027.htm#008).

<span id="009">**Havilah**</span> The sand region. (1.) A land mentioned
in [Gen 2:11](../kjv/gen002.htm#011) rich in gold and bdellium and onyx
stone. The question as to the locality of this region has given rise to
a great diversity of opinion. It may perhaps be identified with the
sandy tract which skirts Babylonia along the whole of its western
border, stretching from the lower Euphrates to the mountains of Edom.
(2.) A district in Arabia-Felix. It is uncertain whether the tribe gave
its name to this region or derived its name from it, and whether it was
originally a Cushite ([Gen 10:7](../kjv/gen010.htm#007)) or a Joktanite
tribe ([Gen 10:29](../kjv/gen010.htm#029); compare [Gen
25:18](../kjv/gen025.htm#018)), or whether there were both a Cushite and
a Joktanite Havilah. It is the opinion of Kalisch, however, that Havilah
"in both instances designates the same country, extending at least from
the Persian to the Arabian Gulf, and on account of its vast extent
easily divided into two distinct parts." This opinion may be well
vindicated. (3.) One of the sons of Cush ([Gen
10:7](../kjv/gen010.htm#007)). (4.) A son of Joktan ([Gen
10:29](../kjv/gen010.htm#029); [Ch1 1:23](../kjv/ch1001.htm#023)).
