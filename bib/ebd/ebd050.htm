<P><A NAME="000"><B>Bee</B></A>     First mentioned in <A HREF="../kjv/deu001.htm#044">Deu 1:44</A>. Swarms of bees, and the danger of their attacks, are mentioned in <A HREF="../kjv/psa118.htm#012">Psa 118:12</A>. Samson found a &quot;swarm of bees&quot; in the carcass of a lion he had slain (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg014.htm#008">Jdg 14:8</A>). Wild bees are described as laying up honey in woods and in clefts of rocks (<A HREF="../kjv/deu032.htm#013">Deu 32:13</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa081.htm#016">Psa 81:16</A>). In <A HREF="../kjv/isa007.htm#018">Isa 7:18</A> the &quot;fly&quot; and the &quot;bee&quot; are personifications of the Egyptians and Assyrians, the inveterate enemies of Israel. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Beelzebub</B></A>     (Gr. form  Beelzebul ), the name given to Satan, and found only in the New Testament (<A HREF="../kjv/mat010.htm#025">Mat 10:25</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat012.htm#024">Mat 12:24</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/mat012.htm#027">Mat 12:27</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mar003.htm#022">Mar 3:22</A>). It is probably the same as Baalzebub (q.v.), the god of Ekron, meaning &quot;the lord of flies,&quot; or, as others think, &quot;the lord of dung,&quot; or &quot;the dung-god.&quot; 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Beer</B></A>     Well.     (1.) A place where a well was dug by the direction of Moses, at the forty-fourth station of the Hebrews in their wanderings (<A HREF="../kjv/num021.htm#016">Num 21:16</A>) in the wilderness of Moab. (See WELL). (2.) A town in the tribe of Judah to which Jotham fled for fear of Abimelech (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg009.htm#021">Jdg 9:21</A>). Some have identified this place with Beeroth. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Beer-elim</B></A>     Well of heroes, probably the name given to Beer, the place where the chiefs of Israel dug a well (<A HREF="../kjv/num021.htm#016">Num 21:16</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa015.htm#008">Isa 15:8</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Beeri</B></A>     Illustrious, or the well-man.     (1.) The father of Judith, one of the wives of Esau (<A HREF="../kjv/gen026.htm#034">Gen 26:34</A>), the same as Adah (<A HREF="../kjv/gen036.htm#002">Gen 36:2</A>). (2.) The father of the prophet Hosea (<A HREF="../kjv/hos001.htm#001">Hos 1:1</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Beer-lahai-roi</B></A>     I.e., &quot;the well of him that liveth and seeth me,&quot; or, as some render it, &quot;the well of the vision of life&quot;, the well where the Lord met with Hagar (<A HREF="../kjv/gen016.htm#007">Gen 16:7</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gen016.htm#014">Gen 16:14</A>). Isaac dwelt beside this well (<A HREF="../kjv/gen024.htm#062">Gen 24:62</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gen025.htm#011">Gen 25:11</A>). It has been identified with  'Ain Muweileh , or  Moilahhi , south-west of Beersheba, and about 12 miles W. from Kadesh-barnea. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Beeroth</B></A>     Wells, one of the four cities of the Hivites which entered by fraud into a league with Joshua. It belonged to Benjamin (<A HREF="../kjv/jos018.htm#025">Jos 18:25</A>). It has by some been identified with el-Bireh on the way to Nablus, 10 miles north of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Beeroth of the Children of Jaakan</B></A>     (<A HREF="../kjv/deu010.htm#006">Deu 10:6</A>). The same as Bene-jaakan (<A HREF="../kjv/num033.htm#031">Num 33:31</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Beersheba</B></A>     Well of the oath, or well of seven, a well dug by Abraham, and so named because he and Abimelech here entered into a compact (<A HREF="../kjv/gen021.htm#031">Gen 21:31</A>). On re-opening it, Isaac gave it the same name (<A HREF="../kjv/gen026.htm#031">Gen 26:31</A>). It was a favourite place of abode of both of these patriarchs (Gen. 21:33-22:1, <A HREF="../kjv/gen022.htm#019">Gen 22:19</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gen026.htm#033">Gen 26:33</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gen028.htm#010">Gen 28:10</A>). It is mentioned among the &quot;cities&quot; given to the tribe of Simeon (<A HREF="../kjv/jos019.htm#002">Jos 19:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch1004.htm#028">Ch1 4:28</A>). From Dan to Beersheba, a distance of about 144 miles (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg020.htm#001">Jdg 20:1</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch1021.htm#002">Ch1 21:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa2024.htm#002">Sa2 24:2</A>), became the usual way of designating the whole Promised Land, and passed into a proverb. After the return from the Captivity the phrase is narrowed into &quot;from Beersheba unto the valley of Hinnom&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/neh011.htm#030">Neh 11:30</A>). The kingdom of the ten tribes extended from Beersheba to Mount Ephraim (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2019.htm#004">Ch2 19:4</A>). The name is not found in the New Testament. It is still called by the Arabs Bir es-Seba, i.e., &quot;well of the seven&quot;, where there are to the present day two principal wells and five smaller ones. It is nearly midway between the southern end of the Dead Sea and the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Beetle</B></A>     Heb.  hargol , meaning &quot;leaper&quot;). Mention of it is made only in <A HREF="../kjv/lev011.htm#022">Lev 11:22</A>, where it is obvious the word cannot mean properly the beetle. It denotes some winged creeper with at least four feet, &quot;which has legs above its feet, to leap withal.&quot; The description plainly points to the locust (q.v.). This has been an article of food from the earliest times in the East to the present day. The word is rendered &quot;cricket&quot; in the Revised Version.
