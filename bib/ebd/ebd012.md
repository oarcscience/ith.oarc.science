<span id="000">**Agate**</span> (Heb. shebo ), a precious stone in the
breast-plate of the high priest ([Exo 28:19](../kjv/exo028.htm#019.md);
[Exo 39:12](../kjv/exo039.htm#012).md), the second in the third row. This
may be the agate properly so called, a semi-transparent crystallized
quartz, probably brought from Sheba, whence its name. In [Isa
54:12](../kjv/isa054.htm#012) and [Eze 27:16](../kjv/eze027.htm#016.md),
this word is the rendering of the Hebrew cadcod, which means "ruddy,"
and denotes a variety of minutely crystalline silica more or less in
bands of different tints. This word is from the Greek name of a stone
found in the river Achates in Sicily.

<span id="001">**Age**</span> Used to denote the period of a man's life
([Gen 47:28](../kjv/gen047.htm#028).md), the maturity of life ([Joh
9:21](../kjv/joh009.htm#021).md), the latter end of life ([Job
11:17](../kjv/job011.htm#017).md), a generation of the human race ([Job
8:8](../kjv/job008.htm#008).md), and an indefinite period ([Eph
2:7](../kjv/eph002.htm#007); [Eph 3:5](../kjv/eph003.htm#005.md), [Eph
3:21](../kjv/eph003.htm#021); [Col 1:26](../kjv/col001.htm#026).md).
Respect to be shown to the aged ([Lev 19:32](../kjv/lev019.htm#032).md). It
is a blessing to communities when they have old men among them ([Isa
65:20](../kjv/isa065.htm#020); [Zac 8:4](../kjv/zac008.htm#004).md). The
aged supposed to excel in understanding ([Job
12:20](../kjv/job012.htm#020); [Job 15:10](../kjv/job015.htm#010.md); [Job
32:4](../kjv/job032.htm#004), [Job 32:9](../kjv/job032.htm#009.md); [Kg1
12:6](../kjv/kg1012.htm#006), [Kg1 12:8](../kjv/kg1012.htm#008).md). A full
age the reward of piety ([Job 5:26](../kjv/job005.htm#026.md); [Gen
15:15](../kjv/gen015.htm#015).md).

<span id="002">**Agee**</span> Fugitive, the father of Shammah, who was
one of David's mighty men ([Sa2 23:11](../kjv/sa2023.htm#011).md).

<span id="003">**Agony**</span> Contest; wrestling; severe struggling
with pain and suffering. Anguish is the reflection on evil that is
already past, while agony is a struggle with evil at the time present.
It is only used in the New Testament by Luke ([Luk
22:44](../kjv/luk022.htm#044).md) to describe our Lord's fearful struggle
in Gethsemane. The verb from which the noun "agony" is derived is used
to denote an earnest endeavour or striving, as "Strive \[agonize\] to
enter" ([Luk 13:24](../kjv/luk013.htm#024).md); "Then would my servants
fight" \[agonize\] ([Joh 18:36](../kjv/joh018.htm#036).md). Compare [Co1
9:25](../kjv/co1009.htm#025); [Col 1:29](../kjv/col001.htm#029.md); [Col
4:12](../kjv/col004.htm#012); [Ti1 6:12](../kjv/ti1006.htm#012.md); [Ti2
4:7](../kjv/ti2004.htm#007.md), where the words "striveth," "labour,"
"conflict," "fight," are the renderings of the same Greek verb.

<span id="004">**Agriculture**</span> Tilling the ground ([Gen
2:15](../kjv/gen002.htm#015); [Gen 4:2](../kjv/gen004.htm#002.md), [Gen
4:3](../kjv/gen004.htm#003), [Gen 4:12](../kjv/gen004.htm#012).md) and
rearing cattle were the chief employments in ancient times. The
Egyptians excelled in agriculture. And after the Israelites entered into
the possession of the Promised Land, their circumstances favoured in the
highest degree a remarkable development of this art. Agriculture became
indeed the basis of the Mosaic commonwealth. See table for The year in
Palestine was divided into six agricultural periods: I. Sowing Time
Months Tisri, latter half Marchesvan Kisleu, former half Beginning about
the autumnal equinox. Cultivation time Early rain due - First showers of
autumn II. Unripe Time Kisleu, latter half Tebet Sebat, former half
Cultivation time III. Cold Season Sebat, latter half Adar \[Veader\]
Nisan, former half Cultivation time Latter rain due. ([Deu
11:14](../kjv/deu011.htm#014); [Jer 5:24](../kjv/jer005.htm#024.md); [Hos
6:3](../kjv/hos006.htm#003); [Zac 10:1](../kjv/zac010.htm#001.md); [Jam
5:7](../kjv/jam005.htm#007); [Job 29:23](../kjv/job029.htm#023).md) IV.
Harvest Time Nisan, latter half Ijar Sivan, former half Beginning about
vernal equinox. Barley green. Passover. V. Summer Sivan, latter half
Tammuz Ab, former half Total absence of rain VI. Sultry Season Ab,
latter half Elul Tisri, former half Ingathering of fruits The six months
from the middle of Tisri to the middle of Nisan were occupied with the
work of cultivation, and the rest of the year mainly with the gathering
in of the fruits. The extensive and easily-arranged system of irrigation
from the rills and streams from the mountains made the soil in every
part of Palestine richly productive ([Psa 1:3](../kjv/psa001.htm#003.md);
[Psa 65:10](../kjv/psa065.htm#010); [Pro 21:1](../kjv/pro021.htm#001.md);
[Isa 30:25](../kjv/isa030.htm#025); [Isa 32:2](../kjv/isa032.htm#002.md),
[Isa 32:20](../kjv/isa032.htm#020); [Hos 12:11](../kjv/hos012.htm#011).md),
and the appliances of careful cultivation and of manure increased its
fertility to such an extent that in the days of Solomon, when there was
an abundant population, "20,000 measures of wheat year by year" were
sent to Hiram in exchange for timber ([Kg1
5:11](../kjv/kg1005.htm#011).md), and in large quantities also wheat was
sent to the Tyrians for the merchandise in which they traded ([Eze
27:17](../kjv/eze027.htm#017).md). The wheat sometimes produced an
hundredfold ([Gen 26:12](../kjv/gen026.htm#012.md); [Mat
13:23](../kjv/mat013.htm#023).md). Figs and pomegranates were very
plentiful ([Num 13:23](../kjv/num013.htm#023).md), and the vine and the
olive grew luxuriantly and produced abundant fruit ([Deu
33:24](../kjv/deu033.htm#024).md). Lest the productiveness of the soil
should be exhausted, it was enjoined that the whole land should rest
every seventh year, when all agricultural labour would entirely cease
([Lev 25:1](../kjv/lev025.htm#001); [Deu 15:1](../kjv/deu015.htm#001).md).
It was forbidden to sow a field with divers seeds ([Deu
22:9](../kjv/deu022.htm#009).md). A passer-by was at liberty to eat any
quantity of corn or grapes, but he was not permitted to carry away any
([Deu 23:24](../kjv/deu023.htm#024), [Deu 23:25](../kjv/deu023.htm#025.md);
[Mat 12:1](../kjv/mat012.htm#001).md). The poor were permitted to claim the
corners of the fields and the gleanings. A forgotten sheaf in the field
was to be left also for the poor. (See [Lev
19:9](../kjv/lev019.htm#009), [Lev 19:10](../kjv/lev019.htm#010.md); [Deu
24:19](../kjv/deu024.htm#019)..md)

<span id="005">**Agricultural Implements and Operations**</span> The
sculptured monuments and painted tombs of Egypt and Assyria throw much
light on this subject, and on the general operations of agriculture.
plows of a simple construction were known in the time of Moses ([Deu
22:10](../kjv/deu022.htm#010.md); compare [Job
1:14](../kjv/job001.htm#014).md). They were very light, and required great
attention to keep them in the ground ([Luk
9:62](../kjv/luk009.htm#062).md). They were drawn by oxen ([Job
1:14](../kjv/job001.htm#014)), cows ([Sa1 6:7](../kjv/sa1006.htm#007).md),
and asses ([Isa 30:24](../kjv/isa030.htm#024).md); but an ox and an ass
must not be yoked together in the same plough ([Deu
22:10](../kjv/deu022.htm#010).md). Men sometimes followed the plough with a
hoe to break the clods ([Isa 28:24](../kjv/isa028.htm#024).md). The oxen
were urged on by a "goad," or long staff pointed at the end, so that if
occasion arose it could be used as a spear also ([Jdg
3:31](../kjv/jdg003.htm#031); [Sa1 13:21](../kjv/sa1013.htm#021).md). When
the soil was prepared, the seed was sown broadcast over the field ([Mat
13:3](../kjv/mat013.htm#003).md). The "harrow" mentioned in [Job
39:10](../kjv/job039.htm#010.md) was not used to cover the seeds, but to
break the clods, being little more than a thick block of wood. In highly
irrigated spots the seed was trampled in by cattle ([Isa
32:20](../kjv/isa032.htm#020).md); but doubtless there was some kind of
harrow also for covering in the seed scattered in the furrows of the
field. The reaping of the corn was performed either by pulling it up by
the roots, or cutting it with a species of sickle, according to
circumstances. The corn when cut was generally put up in sheaves ([Gen
37:7](../kjv/gen037.htm#007); [Lev 23:10](../kjv/lev023.htm#010.md); [Rut
2:7](../kjv/rut002.htm#007), [Rut 2:15](../kjv/rut002.htm#015.md); [Job
24:10](../kjv/job024.htm#010); [Jer 9:22](../kjv/jer009.htm#022.md); [Mic
4:12](../kjv/mic004.htm#012).md), which were afterwards gathered to the
threshing-floor or stored in barns ([Mat 6:26](../kjv/mat006.htm#026).md).
The process of threshing was performed generally by spreading the
sheaves on the threshing-floor and causing oxen and cattle to tread
repeatedly over them ([Deu 25:4](../kjv/deu025.htm#004.md); [Isa
28:28](../kjv/isa028.htm#028).md). On occasions flails or sticks were used
for this purpose ([Rut 2:17](../kjv/rut002.htm#017.md); [Isa
28:27](../kjv/isa028.htm#027).md). There was also a "threshing instrument"
([Isa 41:15](../kjv/isa041.htm#015); [Amo 1:3](../kjv/amo001.htm#003).md)
which was drawn over the corn. It was called by the Hebrews a moreg, a
threshing roller or sledge ([Sa2 24:22](../kjv/sa2024.htm#022.md); [Ch1
21:23](../kjv/ch1021.htm#023); [Isa 3:15](../kjv/isa003.htm#015).md). It
was somewhat like the Roman tribulum, or threshing instrument. When the
grain was threshed, it was winnowed by being thrown up against the wind
([Jer 4:11](../kjv/jer004.htm#011).md), and afterwards tossed with wooden
scoops ([Isa 30:24](../kjv/isa030.htm#024).md). The shovel and the fan for
winnowing are mentioned in [Psa 35:5](../kjv/psa035.htm#005.md); [Job
21:18](../kjv/job021.htm#018); [Isa 17:13](../kjv/isa017.htm#013.md). The
refuse of straw and chaff was burned ([Isa
5:24](../kjv/isa005.htm#024).md). Freed from impurities, the grain was then
laid up in granaries till used ([Deu 28:8](../kjv/deu028.htm#008.md); [Pro
3:10](../kjv/pro003.htm#010); [Mat 6:26](../kjv/mat006.htm#026.md); [Mat
13:30](../kjv/mat013.htm#030); [Luk 12:18](../kjv/luk012.htm#018).md).

<span id="006">**Agrippa I**</span> The grandson of Herod the Great, and
son of Aristobulus and Bernice. The Roman emperor Caligula made him
governor first of the territories of Philip, then of the tetrarchy of
Lysanias, with the title of king ("king Herod"), and finally of that of
Antipas, who was banished, and of Samaria and Judea. Thus he became
ruler over the whole of Palestine. He was a persecutor of the early
Christians. He slew James, and imprisoned Peter ([Act
12:1](../kjv/act012.htm#001).md). He died at Caesarea, being "eaten of
worms" ([Act 12:23](../kjv/act012.htm#023).md), A.D. 44. (Compare Josephus,
Ant. xix. 8.)

<span id="007">**Agrippa II**</span> Son of the foregoing, was born at
Rome, A.D. 27. He was the brother of Bernice and Drusilla. The Emperor
Claudius (A.D. 48) invested him with the office of superintendent of the
Temple of Jerusalem, and made him governor (A.D. 50) of Chalcis. He was
afterwards raised to the rank of king, and made governor over the
tetrarchy of Philip and Lysanias ([Act 25:13](../kjv/act025.htm#013.md);
[Act 26:2](../kjv/act026.htm#002), [Act 26:7](../kjv/act026.htm#007).md).
It was before him that Paul delivered (A.D. 59) his speech recorded in
Acts 26. His private life was very profligate. He died (the last of his
race) at Rome, at the age of about seventy years, A.D. 100.

<span id="008">**Ague**</span> The translation in [Lev
26:16](../kjv/lev026.htm#016) (R.V., "fever".md) of the Hebrew word
kaddah'ath , meaning "kindling", i.e., an inflammatory or burning fever.
In [Deu 28:22](../kjv/deu028.htm#022.md) the word is rendered "fever."

<span id="009">**Agur**</span> Gatherer; the collector, mentioned as
author of the sayings in Prov. 30. Nothing is known of him beyond what
is there recorded.
