<P><A NAME="000"><B>Zatthu</B></A>     A sprout, <A HREF="../kjv/neh010.htm#014">Neh 10:14</A>. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Zattu</B></A>     Id., one whose descendants returned from the Captivity with Zerubbabel (<A HREF="../kjv/ezr002.htm#008">Ezr 2:8</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/neh007.htm#013">Neh 7:13</A>); probably the same as Zatthu. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Zaza</B></A>     Plenty, a descendant of Judah (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1002.htm#033">Ch1 2:33</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Zeal</B></A>     An earnest temper; may be enlightened (<A HREF="../kjv/num025.htm#011">Num 25:11</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/co2007.htm#011">Co2 7:11</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/co2009.htm#002">Co2 9:2</A>), or ignorant and misdirected (<A HREF="../kjv/rom010.htm#002">Rom 10:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/phi003.htm#006">Phi 3:6</A>). As a Christian grace, it must be grounded on right principles and directed to right ends (<A HREF="../kjv/gal004.htm#018">Gal 4:18</A>). It is sometimes ascribed to God (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2019.htm#031">Kg2 19:31</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa009.htm#007">Isa 9:7</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa037.htm#032">Isa 37:32</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/eze005.htm#013">Eze 5:13</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Zealots</B></A>     A sect of Jews which originated with Judas the Gaulonite (<A HREF="../kjv/act005.htm#037">Act 5:37</A>). They refused to pay tribute to the Romans, on the ground that this was a violation of the principle that God was the only king of Israel. They rebelled against the Romans, but were soon scattered, and became a lawless band of mere brigands. They were afterwards called Sicarii, from their use of the sica, i.e., the Roman dagger. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Zebadiah</B></A>     Gift of Jehovah.     (1.) A son of Asahel, Joab's brother (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1027.htm#007">Ch1 27:7</A>). (2.) A Levite who took part as one of the teachers in the system of national education instituted by Jehoshaphat (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2017.htm#007">Ch2 17:7</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/ch2017.htm#008">Ch2 17:8</A>). (3.) The son of Ishmael, &quot;the ruler of the house of Judah in all the king's matters&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2019.htm#008">Ch2 19:8</A>). (4.) A son of Beriah (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1008.htm#015">Ch1 8:15</A>). (5.) A Korhite porter of the Lord's house (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1026.htm#002">Ch1 26:2</A>). Three or four others of this name are also mentioned. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Zebah</B></A>     Man-killer, or sacrifice, one of the two kings who led the vast host of the Midianites who invaded the land of Israel, and over whom Gideon gained a great and decisive victory (Judg. 8). Zebah and Zalmunna had succeeded in escaping across the Jordan with a remnant of the Midianite host, but were overtaken at Karkor, probably in the Hauran, and routed by Gideon. The kings were taken alive and brought back across the Jordan; and confessing that they had personally taken part in the slaughter of Gideon's brothers, they were put to death (compare <A HREF="../kjv/sa1012.htm#011">Sa1 12:11</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa010.htm#026">Isa 10:26</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa083.htm#011">Psa 83:11</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Zebaim</B></A>     (<A HREF="../kjv/ezr002.htm#057">Ezr 2:57</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/neh007.htm#059">Neh 7:59</A>). &quot;Pochereth of Zebaim&quot; should be read as in the Revised Version, &quot;Pochereth-hazzebaim&quot; (&quot;snaring the antelopes&quot;), probably the name of some hunter. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Zebedee</B></A>     A Galilean fisherman, the husband of Salome (q.v.), and the father of James and John, two of our Lord's disciples (<A HREF="../kjv/mat004.htm#021">Mat 4:21</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat027.htm#056">Mat 27:56</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mar015.htm#040">Mar 15:40</A>). He seems to have been a man of some position in Capernaum, for he had two boats (<A HREF="../kjv/luk005.htm#004">Luk 5:4</A>) and &quot;hired servants&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/mar001.htm#020">Mar 1:20</A>) of his own. No mention is made of him after the call of his two sons by Jesus. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Zeboim</B></A>     Gazelles or roes.     (1.) One of the &quot;five cities of the plain&quot; of Sodom, generally coupled with Admah (<A HREF="../kjv/gen010.htm#019">Gen 10:19</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gen014.htm#002">Gen 14:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/deu029.htm#023">Deu 29:23</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/hos011.htm#008">Hos 11:8</A>). It had a king of its own (Shemeber), and was therefore a place of some importance. It was destroyed along with the other cities of the plain. (2.) A valley or rugged glen somewhere near Gibeah in Benjamin (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1013.htm#018">Sa1 13:18</A>). It was probably the ravine now bearing the name Wady  Shakh-ed-Dub'a , or &quot;ravine of the hyena,&quot; north of Jericho. (3.) A place mentioned only in <A HREF="../kjv/neh011.htm#034">Neh 11:34</A>, inhabited by the Benjamites after the Captivity.
