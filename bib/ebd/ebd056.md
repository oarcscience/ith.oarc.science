<span id="000">**Beth-gamul**</span> Camel-house, a city in the "plain
country" of Moab denounced by the prophet ([Jer
48:23](../kjv/jer048.htm#023).md); probably the modern Um-el-Jemal, near
Bozrah, one of the deserted cities of the Hauran.

<span id="001">**Beth-gilgal**</span> House of Gilgal, a place from
which the inhabitants gathered for the purpose of celebrating the
rebuilding of the walls on the return exile ([Neh
12:29](../kjv/neh012.htm#029)). (See GILGAL..md)

<span id="002">**Beth-haccerem**</span> House of a vineyard, a place in
the tribe of Judah ([Neh 3:14](../kjv/neh003.htm#014).md) where the
Benjamites were to set up a beacon when they heard the trumpet against
the invading army of the Babylonians ([Jer 6:1](../kjv/jer006.htm#001).md).
It is probable that this place is the modern 'Ain Karim , or "well of
the vineyards," near which there is a ridge on which are cairns which
may have served as beacons of old, one of which is 40 feet high and 130
in diameter.

<span id="003">**Beth-horon**</span> House of the hollow, or of the
cavern, the name of two towns or villages ([Ch2
8:5](../kjv/ch2008.htm#005); [Ch1 7:24](../kjv/ch1007.htm#024).md) in the
territory of Ephraim, on the way from Jerusalem to Joppa. They are
distinguished as Bethhoron "the upper" and Beth-horon "the nether." They
are about 2 miles apart, the former being about 10 miles north-west of
Jerusalem. Between the two places was the ascent and descent of
Beth-horon, leading from Gibeon down to the western plain ([Jos
10:10](../kjv/jos010.htm#010), [Jos 10:11](../kjv/jos010.htm#011.md); [Jos
18:13](../kjv/jos018.htm#013), [Jos 18:14](../kjv/jos018.htm#014).md), down
which the five kings of the Amorites were driven by Joshua in that great
battle, the most important in which the Hebrews had been as yet engaged,
being their first conflict with their enemies in the open field. Jehovah
interposed in behalf of Israel by a terrific hailstorm, which caused
more deaths among the Canaanites than did the swords of the Israelites.
Beth-horon is mentioned as having been taken by Shishak, 945 B.C., in
the list of his conquests, and the pass was the scene of a victory of
Judas Maccabeus. (Compare [Exo 9:19](../kjv/exo009.htm#019.md), [Exo
9:25](../kjv/exo009.htm#025); [Job 38:22](../kjv/job038.htm#022.md), [Job
38:23](../kjv/job038.htm#023); [Psa 18:12](../kjv/psa018.htm#012.md); [Isa
30:30](../kjv/isa030.htm#030)..md) The modern name of these places is
Beit-ur, distinguished by el-Foka, "the upper," and el-Tahta, "the
nether." The lower was at the foot of the pass, and the upper, 500 feet
higher, at the top, west of Gibeon. (See GIBEON.)

<span id="004">**Beth-jeshimoth**</span> House of wastes, or deserts, a
town near Abel-shittim, east of Jordan, in the desert of Moab, where the
Israelites encamped not long before crossing the Jordan ([Num
33:49](../kjv/num033.htm#049); A.V., "Bethjesimoth".md). It was within the
territory of Sihon, king of the Amorites ([Jos
12:3](../kjv/jos012.htm#003).md).

<span id="005">**Bethlehem**</span> House of bread. (1.) A city in the
"hill country" of Judah. It was originally called Ephrath ([Gen
35:16](../kjv/gen035.htm#016), [Gen 35:19](../kjv/gen035.htm#019.md); [Gen
48:7](../kjv/gen048.htm#007); [Rut 4:11](../kjv/rut004.htm#011).md). It was
also called Beth-lehem Ephratah ([Mic 5:2](../kjv/mic005.htm#002).md),
Beth-lehem-judah ([Sa1 17:12](../kjv/sa1017.htm#012).md), and "the city of
David" ([Luk 2:4](../kjv/luk002.htm#004).md). It is first noticed in
Scripture as the place where Rachel died and was buried "by the
wayside," directly to the north of the city ([Gen
48:7](../kjv/gen048.htm#007).md). The valley to the east was the scene of
the story of Ruth the Moabitess. There are the fields in which she
gleaned, and the path by which she and Naomi returned to the town. Here
was David's birth-place, and here also, in after years, he was anointed
as king by Samuel ([Sa1 16:4](../kjv/sa1016.htm#004).md); and it was from
the well of Bethlehem that three of his heroes brought water for him at
the risk of their lives when he was in the cave of Adullam ([Sa2
23:13](../kjv/sa2023.htm#013).md). But it was distinguished above every
other city as the birth-place of "Him whose goings forth have been of
old" ([Mat 2:6](../kjv/mat002.htm#006.md); compare [Mic
5:2](../kjv/mic005.htm#002).md). Afterwards Herod, "when he saw that he was
mocked of the wise men," sent and slew "all the children that were in
Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under"
([Mat 2:16](../kjv/mat002.htm#016), [Mat 2:18](../kjv/mat002.htm#018.md);
[Jer 31:15](../kjv/jer031.htm#015).md). Bethlehem bears the modern name of
Beit-Lahm, i.e., "house of flesh." It is about 5 miles south of
Jerusalem, standing at an elevation of about 2,550 feet above the sea,
thus 100 feet higher than Jerusalem. There is a church still existing,
built by Constantine the Great (A.D. 330), called the "Church of the
Nativity," over a grotto or cave called the "holy crypt," and said to be
the "stable" in which Jesus was born. This is perhaps the oldest
existing Christian church in the world. Close to it is another grotto,
where Jerome the Latin father is said to have spent thirty years of his
life in translating the Scriptures into Latin. (See VERSIONS.) (2.) A
city of Zebulun, mentioned only in [Jos 19:15](../kjv/jos019.htm#015.md).
Now Beit-Lahm, a ruined village about 6 miles west-north-west of
Nazareth.

<span id="006">**Beth-le-Aphrah**</span> (R.V. [Mic
1:10](../kjv/mic001.htm#010).md), house of dust. The Authorized Version
reads "in the house of Aphrah." This is probably the name of a town in
the Shephelah, or "low country," between Joppa and Gaza.

<span id="007">**Beth-peor**</span> House of Peor; i.e., "temple of
Baal-peor", a place in Moab, on the east of Jordan, opposite Jericho. It
was in the tribe of Reuben ([Jos 13:20](../kjv/jos013.htm#020.md); [Deu
3:29](../kjv/deu003.htm#029); [Deu 4:46](../kjv/deu004.htm#046).md). In the
"ravine" or valley over against Beth-peor Moses was probably buried
([Deu 34:6](../kjv/deu034.htm#006).md).

<span id="008">**Beth-phage**</span> House of the unripe fig, a village
on the Mount of Olives, on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho ([Mat
21:1](../kjv/mat021.htm#001); [Mar 11:1](../kjv/mar011.htm#001.md); [Luk
19:29](../kjv/luk019.htm#029).md), and very close to Bethany. It was the
limit of a Sabbath-day's journey from Jerusalem, i.e., 2,000 cubits. It
has been identified with the modern Kefr-et-Tur.

<span id="009">**Bethsaida**</span> House of fish. (1.) A town in
Galilee, on the west side of the sea of Tiberias, in the "land of
Gennesaret." It was the native place of Peter, Andrew, and Philip, and
was frequently resorted to by Jesus ([Mar 6:45](../kjv/mar006.htm#045.md);
[Joh 1:44](../kjv/joh001.htm#044); [Joh 12:21](../kjv/joh012.htm#021).md).
It is supposed to have been at the modern 'Ain Tabighah , a bay to the
north of Gennesaret. (2.) A city near which Christ fed 5,000 ([Luk
9:10](../kjv/luk009.htm#010); compare [Joh 6:17](../kjv/joh006.htm#017.md);
[Mat 14:15](../kjv/mat014.htm#015).md), and where the blind man had his
sight restored ([Mar 8:22](../kjv/mar008.htm#022).md), on the east side of
the lake, two miles up the Jordan. It stood within the region of
Gaulonitis, and was enlarged by Philip the tetrarch, who called it
"Julias," after the emperor's daughter. Or, as some have supposed, there
may have been but one Bethsaida built on both sides of the lake, near
where the Jordan enters it. Now the ruins et-Tel.
