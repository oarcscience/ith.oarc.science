<span id="000">**Shimea**</span> The hearing prayer. (1.) One of David's
sons by Bathsheba ([Ch1 3:5](../kjv/ch1003.htm#005).md); called also
Shammua ([Ch1 14:4](../kjv/ch1014.htm#004)). (2..md) A Levite of the family
of Merari ([Ch1 6:30](../kjv/ch1006.htm#030)). (3..md) Another Levite of
the family of Gershon ([Ch1 6:39](../kjv/ch1006.htm#039)). (4..md) One of
David's brothers ([Sa1 16:9](../kjv/sa1016.htm#009), marg..md).

<span id="001">**Shimeah**</span> (1.) One of David's brothers ([Sa2
13:3](../kjv/sa2013.htm#003)); same as Shimea (2..md) A Benjamite, a
descendant of Gibeon ([Ch1 8:32](../kjv/ch1008.htm#032).md); called also
Shimeam ([Ch1 9:38](../kjv/ch1009.htm#038).md).

<span id="002">**Shimei**</span> Famous. (1.) A son of Gershon, and
grandson of Levi ([Num 3:18](../kjv/num003.htm#018.md); [Ch1
6:17](../kjv/ch1006.htm#017), [Ch1 6:29](../kjv/ch1006.htm#029).md); called
Shimi in [Exo 6:17](../kjv/exo006.htm#017). (2..md) A Benjamite of the
house of Saul, who stoned and cursed David when he reached Bahurim in
his flight from Jerusalem on the occasion of the rebellion of Absalom
([Sa2 16:5](../kjv/sa2016.htm#005).md). After the defeat of Absalom he
"came cringing to the king, humbly suing for pardon, bringing with him a
thousand of his Benjamite tribesmen, and representing that he was
heartily sorry for his crime, and ha hurried the first of all the house
of Israel to offer homage to the king" ([Sa2
19:16](../kjv/sa2019.htm#016).md). David forgave him; but on his death-bed
he gave Solomon special instructions regarding Shimei, of whose fidelity
he seems to have been in doubt ([Kg1 2:8](../kjv/kg1002.htm#008.md), [Kg1
2:9](../kjv/kg1002.htm#009).md). He was put to death at the command of
Solomon, because he had violated his word by leaving Jerusalem and going
to Gath to recover two of his servants who had escaped ([Kg1
2:36](../kjv/kg1002.htm#036)). (3..md) One of David's mighty men who
refused to acknowledge Adonijah as David's successor ([Kg1
1:8](../kjv/kg1001.htm#008).md). He is probably the same person who is

(4.) A son of Pedaiah, the brother of Zerubbabel ([Ch1
3:19](../kjv/ch1003.htm#019)). (5..md) A Simeonite ([Ch1

Reubenite ([Ch1 5:4](../kjv/ch1005.htm#004)). (7..md) A Levite of the
family of Gershon ([Ch1 6:42](../kjv/ch1006.htm#042)). (8..md) A Ramathite
who was "over the vineyards" of David ([Ch1
27:27](../kjv/ch1027.htm#027)). (9..md) One of the sons of Heman, who
assisted in the purification of the temple ([Ch2
29:14](../kjv/ch2029.htm#014)). (10..md) A Levite ([Ch2
31:12](../kjv/ch2031.htm#012), [Ch2 31:13](../kjv/ch2031.htm#013).md).
(11.) Another Levite ([Ezr 10:23](../kjv/ezr010.htm#023).md). "The family
of Shimei" ([Zac 12:13](../kjv/zac012.htm#013.md); R.V., "the family of the
Shimeites") were the descendants of Shimei.

([Gen 46:13](../kjv/gen046.htm#013); [Ch1 7:1](../kjv/ch1007.htm#001.md);
R.V., correctly, "Shimron").

<span id="008">**Shimron**</span> Watch-post, an ancient city of the
Canaanites; with its villages, allotted to Zebulun ([Jos
19:15](../kjv/jos019.htm#015).md); now probably Semunieh, on the northern
edge of the plain of Esdraelon, 5 miles west of Nazareth.
