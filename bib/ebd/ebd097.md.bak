<span id="000">**Dance**</span> Found in [Jdg
21:21](../kjv/jdg021.htm#021), [Jdg 21:23](../kjv/jdg021.htm#023.md); [Psa
30:11](../kjv/psa030.htm#011); [Psa 149:3](../kjv/psa149.htm#003.md); [Psa
150:4](../kjv/psa150.htm#004); [Jer 31:4](../kjv/jer031.htm#004.md), [Jer
31:13](../kjv/jer031.htm#013.md), etc., as the translation of hul, which
points to the whirling motion of Oriental sacred dances. It is the
rendering of a word (rakad) which means to skip or leap for joy, in [Ecc
3:4](../kjv/ecc003.htm#004); [Job 21:11](../kjv/job021.htm#011.md); [Isa
13:21](../kjv/isa013.htm#021.md), etc. In the New Testament it is in like
manner the translation of different Greek words, circular motion ([Luk
15:25](../kjv/luk015.htm#025).md); leaping up and down in concert ([Mat
11:17](../kjv/mat011.htm#017).md), and by a single person ([Mat
14:6](../kjv/mat014.htm#006).md). It is spoken of as symbolical of
rejoicing ([Ecc 3:4](../kjv/ecc003.htm#004.md). Compare [Psa
30:11](../kjv/psa030.htm#011); [Mat 11:17](../kjv/mat011.htm#017).md). The
Hebrews had their sacred dances expressive of joy and thanksgiving, when
the performers were usually females ([Exo 15:20](../kjv/exo015.htm#020.md);
[Sa1 18:6](../kjv/sa1018.htm#006).md). The ancient dance was very different
from that common among Western nations. It was usually the part of the
women only ([Exo 15:20](../kjv/exo015.htm#020.md); [Jdg
11:34](../kjv/jdg011.htm#034.md); compare [Exo
5:1](../kjv/exo005.htm#001).md). Hence the peculiarity of David's conduct
in dancing before the ark of the Lord ([Sa2
6:14](../kjv/sa2006.htm#014).md). The women took part in it with their
timbrels. Michal should, in accordance with the example of Miriam and
others, have herself led the female choir, instead of keeping aloof on
the occasion and "looking through the window." David led the choir
"uncovered", i.e., wearing only the ephod or linen tunic. He thought
only of the honour of God, and forgot himself. From being reserved for
occasions of religious worship and festivity, it came gradually to be
practiced in common life on occasions of rejoicing ([Jer
31:4](../kjv/jer031.htm#004).md). The sexes among the Jews always danced
separately. The daughter of Herodias danced alone ([Mat
14:6](../kjv/mat014.htm#006).md).

<span id="001">**Daniel**</span> God is my judge, or judge of God. (1.)
David's second son, "born unto him in Hebron, of Abigail the
Carmelitess" ([Ch1 3:1](../kjv/ch1003.htm#001).md). He is called also
Chileab ([Sa2 3:3](../kjv/sa2003.htm#003)). (2..md) One of the four great
prophets, although he is not once spoken of in the Old Testament as a
prophet. His life and prophecies are recorded in the Book of Daniel. He
was descended from one of the noble families of Judah ([Dan
1:3](../kjv/dan001.htm#003).md), and was probably born in Jerusalem about
623 B.C., during the reign of Josiah. At the first deportation of the
Jews by Nebuchadnezzar (the kingdom of Israel had come to an end nearly
a century before), or immediately after his victory over the Egyptians
at the second battle of Carchemish, in the fourth year of the reign of
Jehoiakim (606 B.C.), Daniel and other three noble youths were carried
off to Babylon, along with part of the vessels of the temple. There he
was obliged to enter into the service of the king of Babylon, and in
accordance with the custom of the age received the Chaldean name of
Belteshazzar, i.e., "prince of Bel," or "Bel protect the king!" His
residence in Babylon was very probably in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar,
now identified with a mass of shapeless mounds called the Kasr, on the
right bank of the river. His training in the schools of the wise men in
Babylon ([Dan 1:4](../kjv/dan001.htm#004).md) was to fit him for service to
the empire. He was distinguished during this period for his piety and
his strict observance of the Mosaic law ([Dan
1:8](../kjv/dan001.htm#008).md), and gained the confidence and esteem of
those who were over him. His habit of attention gained during his
education in Jerusalem enabled him soon to master the wisdom and
learning of the Chaldeans, and even to excel his compeers. At the close
of his three years of discipline and training in the royal schools,
Daniel was distinguished for his proficiency in the "wisdom" of his day,
and was brought out into public life. He soon became known for his skill
in the interpretation of dreams ([Dan 1:17](../kjv/dan001.htm#017.md); [Dan
2:14](../kjv/dan002.htm#014).md), and rose to the rank of governor of the
province of Babylon, and became "chief of the governors" (Chald.
Rab-signin) over all the wise men of Babylon. He made known and also
interpreted Nebuchadnezzar's dream; and many years afterwards, when he
was now an old man, amid the alarm and consternation of the terrible
night of Belshazzar's impious feast, he was called in at the instance of
the queen-mother (perhaps Nitocris, the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar) to
interpret the mysterious handwriting on the wall. He was rewarded with a
purple robe and elevation to the rank of "third ruler." The place of
"second ruler" was held by Belshazzar as associated with his father,
Nabonidus, on the throne ([Dan 5:16](../kjv/dan005.htm#016).md). Daniel
interpreted the handwriting, and "in that night was Belshazzar the king
of the Chaldeans slain." After the taking of Babylon, Cyrus, who was now
master of all Asia from India to the Dardanelles, placed Darius (q.v.),
a Median prince, on the throne, during the two years of whose reign
Daniel held the office of first of the "three presidents" of the empire,
and was thus practically at the head of affairs, no doubt interesting
himself in the prospects of the captive Jews (Dan. 9), whom he had at
last the happiness of seeing restored to their own land, although he did
not return with them, but remained still in Babylon. His fidelity to God
exposed him to persecution, and he was cast into a den of lions, but was
miraculously delivered; after which Darius issued a decree enjoining
reverence for "the God of Daniel" ([Dan 6:26](../kjv/dan006.htm#026).md).
He "prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the
Persian," whom he probably greatly influenced in the matter of the
decree which put an end to the Captivity (536 B.C.). He had a series of
prophetic visions vouchsafed to him which opened up the prospect of a
glorious future for the people of God, and must have imparted peace and
gladness to his spirit in his old age as he waited on at his post till
the "end of the days." The time and circumstances of his death are not
recorded. He probably died at Susa, about eighty-five years of age.
Ezekiel, with whom he was contemporary, mentions him as a pattern of
righteousness ([Eze 14:14](../kjv/eze014.htm#014.md), [Eze
14:20](../kjv/eze014.htm#020).md) and wisdom ([Eze
28:3](../kjv/eze028.htm#003)). (See NEBUCHADNEZZAR..md)

<span id="002">**Daniel, Book of**</span> Is ranked by the Jews in that
division of their Bible called the Hagiographa (Heb. Khethubim ). (See
BIBLE.) It consists of two distinct parts. The first part, consisting of
the first six chapters, is chiefly historical; and the second part,
consisting of the remaining six chapters, is chiefly prophetical. The
historical part of the book treats of the period of the Captivity.
Daniel is "the historian of the Captivity, the writer who alone
furnishes any series of events for that dark and dismal period during
which the harp of Israel hung on the trees that grew by the Euphrates.
His narrative may be said in general to intervene between Kings and
Chronicles on the one hand and Ezra on the other, or (more strictly) to
fill out the sketch which the author of the Chronicles gives in a single
verse in his last chapter: 'And them that had escaped from the sword
carried he \[i.e., Nebuchadnezzar\] away to Babylon; where they were
servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia'"
([Ch2 36:20](../kjv/ch2036.htm#020).md). The prophetical part consists of
three visions and one lengthened prophetical communication. The
genuineness of this book has been much disputed, but the arguments in
its favour fully establish its claims. (1.)We have the testimony of
Christ ([Mat 24:15](../kjv/mat024.htm#015.md); [Mat
25:31](../kjv/mat025.htm#031); [Mat 26:64](../kjv/mat026.htm#064).md) and
his apostles ([Co1 6:2](../kjv/co1006.htm#002.md); [Th2
2:3](../kjv/th2002.htm#003)) for its authority; and (2..md) the important
testimony of Ezekiel ([Eze 14:14](../kjv/eze014.htm#014.md), [Eze
14:20](../kjv/eze014.htm#020); [Eze 28:3](../kjv/eze028.htm#003)). (3..md)
The character and records of the book are also entirely in harmony with
the times and circumstances in which the author lived. (4.) The
linguistic character of the book is, moreover, just such as might be
expected. Certain portions ([Dan 2:4](../kjv/dan002.htm#004); 7.md) are
written in the Chaldee language; and the portions written in Hebrew are
in a style and form having a close affinity with the later books of the
Old Testament, especially with that of Ezra. The writer is familiar both
with the Hebrew and the Chaldee, passing from the one to the other just
as his subject required. This is in strict accordance with the position
of the author and of the people for whom his book was written. That
Daniel is the writer of this book is also testified to in the book
itself ([Dan 7:1](../kjv/dan007.htm#001.md), [Dan
7:28](../kjv/dan007.htm#028); [Dan 8:2](../kjv/dan008.htm#002.md); [Dan
9:2](../kjv/dan009.htm#002); [Dan 10:1](../kjv/dan010.htm#001.md), [Dan
10:2](../kjv/dan010.htm#002); [Dan 12:4](../kjv/dan012.htm#004.md), [Dan
12:5](../kjv/dan012.htm#005)). (See BELSHAZZAR..md)

<span id="003">**Dan-jaan**</span> Woodland Dan, a place probably
somewhere in the direction of Dan, near the sources of the Jordan ([Sa2
24:6](../kjv/sa2024.htm#006).md). The LXX. and the Vulgate read "Dan-jaar",
i.e., "Dan in the forest."

<span id="004">**Dannah**</span> Murmuring, a city ([Jos
15:49](../kjv/jos015.htm#049).md) in the mountains of Judah about 8 miles
south-west of Hebron.

<span id="005">**Darda**</span> Pearl of wisdom, one of the four who
were noted for their wisdom, but whom Solomon excelled ([Kg1
4:31](../kjv/kg1004.htm#031).md).

<span id="006">**Daric**</span> In the Revised Version of [Ch1
29:7](../kjv/ch1029.htm#007); [Ezr 2:69](../kjv/ezr002.htm#069.md); [Ezr
8:27](../kjv/ezr008.htm#027); [Neh 7:70](../kjv/neh007.htm#070.md), where
the Authorized Version has "dram." It is the rendering of the Hebrew
darkemon and the Greek dareikos . It was a gold coin, bearing the figure
of a Persian King with his crown and armed with bow and arrow. It was
current among the Jews after their return from Babylon, i.e., while
under the Persian domination. It weighed about 128 grains troy, and was
of the value of about one guinea or rather more of our money. It is the
first coin mentioned in Scripture, and is the oldest that history makes
known to us.

<span id="007">**Darius**</span> The holder or supporter, the name of
several Persian kings. (1.) Darius the Mede ([Dan
11:1](../kjv/dan011.htm#001).md), "the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the
Medes" ([Dan 9:1](../kjv/dan009.htm#001).md). On the death of Belshazzar
the Chaldean he "received the kingdom" of Babylon as viceroy from Cyrus.
During his brief reign (538-536 B.C.) Daniel was promoted to the highest
dignity ([Dan 6:1](../kjv/dan006.htm#001.md), [Dan
6:2](../kjv/dan006.htm#002).md); but on account of the malice of his
enemies he was cast into the den of lions. After his miraculous escape,
a decree was issued by Darius enjoining "reverence for the God of
Daniel" ([Dan 6:26](../kjv/dan006.htm#026).md). This king was probably the
"Astyages" of the Greek historians. Nothing can, however, be with
certainty affirmed regarding him. Some are of opinion that the name
"Darius" is simply a name of office, equivalent to "governor," and that
the "Gobryas" of the inscriptions was the person intended by the name.
(2.) Darius, king of Persia, was the son of Hystaspes, of the royal
family of the Achaemenidae. He did not immediately succeed Cyrus on the
throne. There were two intermediate kings, viz., Cambyses (the Ahasuerus
of Ezra), the son of Cyrus, who reigned from 529-522 B.C., and was
succeeded by a usurper named Smerdis, who occupied the throne only ten
months, and was succeeded by this Darius (521-486 B.C.). Smerdis was a
Margian, and therefore had no sympathy with Cyrus and Cambyses in the
manner in which they had treated the Jews. He issued a decree
prohibiting the restoration of the temple and of Jerusalem ([Ezr
4:17](../kjv/ezr004.htm#017).md). But soon after his death and the
accession of Darius, the Jews resumed their work, thinking that the
edict of Smerdis would be now null and void, as Darius was in known
harmony with the religious policy of Cyrus. The enemies of the Jews lost
no time in bringing the matter under the notice of Darius, who caused
search to be made for the decree of Cyrus (q.v.). It was not found at
Babylon, but at Achmetha ([Ezr 6:2](../kjv/ezr006.htm#002).md); and Darius
forthwith issued a new decree, giving the Jews full liberty to prosecute
their work, at the same time requiring the Syrian satrap and his
subordinates to give them all needed help. It was with the army of this
king that the Greeks fought the famous battle of Marathon (490 B.C.).
During his reign the Jews enjoyed much peace and prosperity. He was
succeeded by Ahasuerus, known to the Greeks as Xerxes, who reigned for
twenty-one years. (3.) Darius the Persian ([Neh
12:22](../kjv/neh012.htm#022).md) was probably the Darius II. (Ochus or
Nothus) of profane history, the son of Artaxerxes Longimanus, who was
the son and successor of Ahasuerus (Xerxes). There are some, however,
who think that the king here meant was Darius III. (Codomannus), the
antagonist of Alexander the Great (336-331 B.C.).

<span id="008">**Darkness**</span> The plague (the ninth) of darkness in
Egypt ([Exo 10:21](../kjv/exo010.htm#021).md) is described as darkness
"which may be felt." It covered "all the land of Egypt," so that "they
saw not one another." It did not extend to the land of Goshen ([Exo
10:23](../kjv/exo010.htm#023).md). When Jesus hung upon the cross ([Mat
27:45](../kjv/mat027.htm#045); [Luk 23:44](../kjv/luk023.htm#044).md), from
the "sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth
hour." On Mount Sinai, Moses ([Exo 20:21](../kjv/exo020.htm#021).md) "drew
near unto the thick darkness where God was." This was the "thick cloud
upon the mount" in which Jehovah was when he spake unto Moses there. The
Lord dwelt in the cloud upon the mercy-seat ([Kg1
8:12](../kjv/kg1008.htm#012).md), the cloud of glory. When the psalmist
([Psa 97:2](../kjv/psa097.htm#002).md) describes the inscrutable nature of
God's workings among the sons of men, he says, "Clouds and darkness are
round about him." God dwells in thick darkness. Darkness ([Isa
13:9](../kjv/isa013.htm#009), [Isa 13:10](../kjv/isa013.htm#010.md); [Mat
24:29](../kjv/mat024.htm#029).md) also is a symbol of the judgments that
attend on the coming of the Lord. It is a symbol of misery and adversity
([Job 18:6](../kjv/job018.htm#006); [Psa 107:10](../kjv/psa107.htm#010.md);
[Isa 8:22](../kjv/isa008.htm#022); [Eze 30:18](../kjv/eze030.htm#018).md).
The "day of darkness" in [Joe 2:2](../kjv/joe002.htm#002.md), caused by
clouds of locusts, is a symbol of the obscurity which overhangs all
divine proceedings. "Works of darkness" are impure actions ([Eph
5:11](../kjv/eph005.htm#011).md). "Outer darkness" refers to the darkness
of the streets in the East, which are never lighted up by any public or
private lamps after nightfall, in contrast with the blaze of cheerful
light in the house. It is also a symbol of ignorance ([Isa
9:2](../kjv/isa009.htm#002); [Isa 60:2](../kjv/isa060.htm#002.md); [Mat
6:23](../kjv/mat006.htm#023).md) and of death ([Job
10:21](../kjv/job010.htm#021); [Job 17:13](../kjv/job017.htm#013).md).

<span id="009">**Dart**</span> An instrument of war; a light spear.
"Fiery darts" ([Eph 6:16](../kjv/eph006.htm#016).md) are so called in
allusion to the habit of discharging darts from the bow while they are
on fire or armed with some combustible material. Arrows are compared to
lightning ([Deu 32:23](../kjv/deu032.htm#023.md), [Deu
32:42](../kjv/deu032.htm#042); [Psa 7:13](../kjv/psa007.htm#013.md); [Psa
120:4](../kjv/psa120.htm#004).md).
