<span id="000">**Rosin**</span> Found only in Authorized Version,
margin, [Eze 27:17](../kjv/eze027.htm#017.md), Heb. tsori , uniformly
rendered elsewhere "balm" (q.v.), as here in the text. The Vulgate has
resinam, rendered "rosin" in the Douay Version. As used, however, by
Jerome, the Lat. resina denotes some odoriferous gum or oil.

<span id="001">**Ruby**</span> (Heb. peninim ), only in plural ([Lam
4:7](../kjv/lam004.htm#007).md). The ruby was one of the stones in the high
priest's breastplate ([Exo 28:17](../kjv/exo028.htm#017).md). A comparison
is made between the value of wisdom and rubies ([Job
28:18](../kjv/job028.htm#018); [Pro 3:15](../kjv/pro003.htm#015.md); [Pro
8:11](../kjv/pro008.htm#011).md). The price of a virtuous woman is said to
be "far above rubies" ([Pro 31:10](../kjv/pro031.htm#010).md). The exact
meaning of the Hebrew word is uncertain. Some render it "red coral;"
others, "pearl" or "mother-of-pearl."

<span id="002">**Rudder Bands**</span> Ancient ships had two great
broad-bladed oars for rudders. These, when not in use, were lifted out
of the water and bound or tied up. When required for use, these bands
were unloosed and the rudders allowed to drop into the water ([Act
27:40](../kjv/act027.htm#040).md).

<span id="003">**Rue**</span> A garden herb (Ruta graveolens) which the
Pharisees were careful to tithe ([Luk 11:42](../kjv/luk011.htm#042).md),
neglecting weightier matters. It is omitted in the parallel passage of
[Mat 23:23](../kjv/mat023.htm#023.md). There are several species growing
wild in Palestine. It is used for medicinal and culinary purposes. It
has a powerful scent, and is a stimulant. (See MINT.)

<span id="004">**Rufus**</span> Red, the son of Simon the Cyrenian ([Mar
15:21](../kjv/mar015.htm#021).md), whom the Roman soldiers compelled to
carry the cross on which our Lord was crucified. Probably it is the same
person who is again mentioned in [Rom 16:13](../kjv/rom016.htm#013.md) as a
disciple at Rome, whose mother also was a Christian held in esteem by
the apostle. Mark mentions him along with his brother Alexander as
persons well known to his readers ([Mar 15:21](../kjv/mar015.htm#021).md).

<span id="005">**Ruhamah**</span> Having obtained mercy, a symbolical
name given to the daughter of Hosea ([Hos 2:1](../kjv/hos002.htm#001).md).

<span id="006">**Rumah**</span> Elevation, probably the same as Arumah
([Jdg 9:41](../kjv/jdg009.htm#041); [Kg2 23:36](../kjv/kg2023.htm#036).md),
near Shechem. Others identify it with Tell Rumeh, in Galilee, about 6
miles north of Nazareth.

<span id="007">**Rush**</span> The papyrus ([Job
8:11](../kjv/job008.htm#011)). (See BULRUSH..md) The expression "branch and
rush" in [Isa 9:14](../kjv/isa009.htm#014.md); [Isa
19:15](../kjv/isa019.htm#015.md) means "utterly."

<span id="008">**Ruth**</span> A friend, a Moabitess, the wife of
Mahlon, whose father, Elimelech, had settled in the land of Moab. On the
death of Elimelech and Mahlon, Naomi came with Ruth, her
daughter-in-law, who refused to leave her, to Bethlehem, the old home
from which Elimelech had migrated. There she had a rich relative, Boaz,
to whom Ruth was eventually married. She became the mother of Obed, the
grandfather of David. Thus Ruth, a Gentile, is among the maternal
progenitors of our Lord ([Mat 1:5](../kjv/mat001.htm#005).md). The story of
"the gleaner Ruth illustrates the friendly relations between the good
Boaz and his reapers, the Jewish land system, the method of transferring
property from one person to another, the working of the Mosaic law for
the relief of distressed and ruined families; but, above all, handing
down the unselfishness, the brave love, the unshaken trustfulness of her
who, though not of the chosen race, was, like the Canaanitess Tamar
([Gen 38:29](../kjv/gen038.htm#029); [Mat 1:3](../kjv/mat001.htm#003).md)
and the Canaanitess Rahab ([Mat 1:5](../kjv/mat001.htm#005).md), privileged
to become the ancestress of David, and so of 'great David's greater
Son'" ([Rut 4:18](../kjv/rut004.htm#018).md).

<span id="009">**Ruth, The Book of**</span> Was originally a part of the
Book of Judges, but it now forms one of the twenty-four separate books
of the Hebrew Bible. The history it contains refers to a period perhaps
about one hundred and twenty-six years before the birth of David. It
gives (1.) an account of Naomi's going to Moab with her husband,
Elimelech, and of her subsequent return to Bethlehem with her
daughter-in-law; (2.) the marriage of Boaz and Ruth; and (3.) the birth
of Obed, of whom David sprang. The author of this book was probably
Samuel, according to Jewish tradition. "Brief as this book is, and
simple as is its story, it is remarkably rich in examples of faith,
patience, industry, and kindness, nor less so in indications of the care
which God takes of those who put their trust in him."
