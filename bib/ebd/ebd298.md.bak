<span id="000">**Pomegranate**</span> I.e., "grained apple" (pomum
granatum), Heb. rimmon . Common in Egypt ([Num
20:5](../kjv/num020.htm#005).md) and Palestine ([Num
13:23](../kjv/num013.htm#023); [Deu 8:8](../kjv/deu008.htm#008).md). The
Romans called it Punicum malum, i.e., Carthaginian apple, because they
received it from Carthage. It belongs to the myrtle family of trees. The
withering of the pomegranate tree is mentioned among the judgments of
God ([Joe 1:12](../kjv/joe001.htm#012).md). It is frequently mentioned in
the Song of Solomon ([Sol 4:3](../kjv/sol004.htm#003.md), [Sol
4:13](../kjv/sol004.htm#013), etc..md). The skirt of the high priest's blue
robe and ephod was adorned with the representation of pomegranates,
alternating with golden bells ([Exo 28:33](../kjv/exo028.htm#033.md), [Exo
28:34](../kjv/exo028.htm#034).md), as also were the "chapiters upon the two
pillars" ([Kg1 7:20](../kjv/kg1007.htm#020).md) which "stood before the
house."

<span id="001">**Pommels**</span> ([Ch2 4:12](../kjv/ch2004.htm#012.md),
[Ch2 4:13](../kjv/ch2004.htm#013).md), or bowls ([Kg1
7:41](../kjv/kg1007.htm#041).md), were balls or "rounded knobs" on the top
of the chapiters (q.v.).

<span id="002">**Pontius Pilate**</span> See PILATE.

<span id="003">**Pontus**</span> A province of Asia Minor, stretching
along the southern coast of the Euxine Sea, corresponding nearly to the
modern province of Trebizond. In the time of the apostles it was a Roman
province. Strangers from this province were at Jerusalem at Pentecost
([Act 2:9](../kjv/act002.htm#009).md), and to "strangers scattered
throughout Pontus," among others, Peter addresses his first epistle
([Pe1 1:1](../kjv/pe1001.htm#001).md). It was evidently the resort of many
Jews of the Dispersion. Aquila was a native of Pontus ([Act
18:2](../kjv/act018.htm#002).md).

<span id="004">**Pool**</span> A pond, or reservoir, for holding water
(Heb. berekhah ; modern Arabic, birket ), an artificial cistern or tank.
Mention is made of the pool of Gibeon ([Sa2
2:13](../kjv/sa2002.htm#013).md); the pool of Hebron ([Sa2
4:12](../kjv/sa2004.htm#012).md); the upper pool at Jerusalem ([Kg2
18:17](../kjv/kg2018.htm#017); [Kg2 20:20](../kjv/kg2020.htm#020).md); the
pool of Samaria ([Kg1 22:38](../kjv/kg1022.htm#038).md); the king's pool
([Neh 2:14](../kjv/neh002.htm#014).md); the pool of Siloah ([Neh
3:15](../kjv/neh003.htm#015); [Ecc 2:6](../kjv/ecc002.htm#006).md); the
fishpools of Heshbon ([Sol 7:4](../kjv/sol007.htm#004).md); the "lower
pool," and the "old pool" ([Isa 22:9](../kjv/isa022.htm#009.md), [Isa
22:11](../kjv/isa022.htm#011).md). The "pool of Bethesda" ([Joh
5:2](../kjv/joh005.htm#002), [Joh 5:4](../kjv/joh005.htm#004.md), [Joh
5:7](../kjv/joh005.htm#007).md) and the "pool of Siloam" ([Joh
9:7](../kjv/joh009.htm#007), [Joh 9:11](../kjv/joh009.htm#011).md) are also
mentioned. Isaiah ([Isa 35:7](../kjv/isa035.htm#007).md) says, "The parched
ground shall become a pool." This is rendered in the Revised Version
"glowing sand," etc. (marg., "the mirage," etc.). The Arabs call the
mirage "serab," plainly the same as the Hebrew word sarab, here rendered
"parched ground." "The mirage shall become a pool", i.e., the mock-lake
of the burning desert shall become a real lake, "the pledge of
refreshment and joy." The "pools" spoken of in [Isa
14:23](../kjv/isa014.htm#023.md) are the marshes caused by the ruin of the
canals of the Euphrates in the neighbourhood of Babylon. The cisterns or
pools of the Holy City are for the most part excavations beneath the
surface. Such are the vast cisterns in the temple hill that have
recently been discovered by the engineers of the Palestine Exploration
Fund. These underground caverns are about thirty-five in number, and are
capable of storing about ten million gallons of water. They are
connected with one another by passages and tunnels.

<span id="005">**Pools of Solomon**</span> The name given to three large
open cisterns at Etam, at the head of the Wady Urtas, having an average
length of 400 feet by 220 in breadth, and 20 to 30 in depth. These pools
derive their chief supply of water from a spring called "the sealed
fountain," about 200 yards to the north-west of the upper pool, to which
it is conveyed by a large subterranean passage. They are 150 feet
distant from each other, and each pool is 20 feet lower than that above
it, the conduits being so arranged that the lowest, which is the largest
and finest of the three, is filled first, and then in succession the
others. It has been estimated that these pools cover in all a space of
about 7 acres, and are capable of containing three million gallons of
water. They were, as is generally supposed, constructed in the days of
Solomon. They are probably referred to in [Ecc
2:6](../kjv/ecc002.htm#006.md). On the fourth day after his victory over
the Ammonites, etc., in the wilderness of Tekoa, Jehoshaphat assembled
his army in the valley of Berachah ("blessing"), and there blessed the
Lord. Berachah has been identified with the modern Bereikut, some 5
miles south of Wady Urtas, and hence the "valley of Berachah" may be
this valley of pools, for the word means both "blessing" and "pools;"
and it has been supposed, therefore, that this victory was celebrated
beside Solomon's pools ([Ch2 20:26](../kjv/ch2020.htm#026).md). These pools
were primarily designed to supply Jerusalem with water. From the lower
pool an aqueduct has been traced conveying the water through Bethlehem
and across the valley of Gihon, and along the west slope of the
Tyropoeon valley, till it finds its way into the great cisterns
underneath the temple hill. The water, however, from the pools reaches
now only to Bethlehem. The aqueduct beyond this has been destroyed.

<span id="006">**Poor**</span> The Mosaic legislation regarding the poor
is specially important. (1.) They had the right of gleaning the fields
([Lev 19:9](../kjv/lev019.htm#009), [Lev 19:10](../kjv/lev019.htm#010.md);
[Deu 24:19](../kjv/deu024.htm#019), [Deu 24:21](../kjv/deu024.htm#021).md).
(2.) In the sabbatical year they were to have their share of the produce
of the fields and the vineyards ([Exo 23:11](../kjv/exo023.htm#011.md);
[Lev 25:6](../kjv/lev025.htm#006)). (3..md) In the year of jubilee they
recovered their property ([Lev 25:25](../kjv/lev025.htm#025)). (4..md)
Usury was forbidden, and the pledged raiment was to be returned before
the sun went down ([Exo 22:25](../kjv/exo022.htm#025.md); [Deu
24:10](../kjv/deu024.htm#010).md). The rich were to be generous to the poor
([Deu 15:7](../kjv/deu015.htm#007)). (5..md) In the sabbatical and jubilee
years the bond-servant was to go free ([Deu
15:12](../kjv/deu015.htm#012); [Lev 25:39](../kjv/lev025.htm#039.md), [Lev
25:47](../kjv/lev025.htm#047)). (6..md) Certain portions from the tithes
were assigned to the poor ([Deu 14:28](../kjv/deu014.htm#028.md), [Deu
14:29](../kjv/deu014.htm#029); [Deu 26:12](../kjv/deu026.htm#012.md), [Deu
26:13](../kjv/deu026.htm#013)). (7..md) They shared in the feasts ([Deu
16:11](../kjv/deu016.htm#011), [Deu 16:14](../kjv/deu016.htm#014.md); [Neh
8:10](../kjv/neh008.htm#010)). (8..md) Wages were to be paid at the close
of each day ([Lev 19:13](../kjv/lev019.htm#013).md). In the New Testament
([Luk 3:11](../kjv/luk003.htm#011); [Luk 14:13](../kjv/luk014.htm#013.md);
[Act 6:1](../kjv/act006.htm#001); [Gal 2:10](../kjv/gal002.htm#010.md);
[Jam 2:15](../kjv/jam002.htm#015), [Jam 2:16](../kjv/jam002.htm#016).md) we
have similar injunctions given with reference to the poor. Begging was
not common under the Old Testament, while it was so in the New Testament
times ([Luk 16:20](../kjv/luk016.htm#020.md), [Luk
16:21](../kjv/luk016.htm#021), etc..md). But begging in the case of those
who are able to work is forbidden, and all such are enjoined to "work
with their own hands" as a Christian duty ([Th1
4:11](../kjv/th1004.htm#011); [Th2 3:7](../kjv/th2003.htm#007.md); [Eph
4:28](../kjv/eph004.htm#028).md). This word is used figuratively in [Mat
5:3](../kjv/mat005.htm#003); [Luk 6:20](../kjv/luk006.htm#020.md); [Co2
8:9](../kjv/co2008.htm#009); [Rev 3:17](../kjv/rev003.htm#017.md).

<span id="007">**Poplar**</span> Heb. libneh , "white", ([Gen
30:37](../kjv/gen030.htm#037); [Hos 4:13](../kjv/hos004.htm#013).md), in
all probability the storax tree (Styrax officinalis) or white poplar,
distinguished by its white blossoms and pale leaves. It is common in the
Anti-Libanus. Other species of the poplar are found in Palestine, such
as the white poplar (P. alba) of our own country, the black poplar (P.
nigra), and the aspen (P. tremula). (See WILLOW.)

<span id="008">**Porch, Solomon's**</span> A colonnade on the east of
the temple, so called from a tradition that it was a relic of Solomon's
temple left standing after the destruction of Jerusalem by the
Babylonians. (Compare [Kg1 7:6](../kjv/kg1007.htm#006)..md) The word
"porch" is in the New Testament the rendering of three different Greek
words: (1.) Stoa , meaning a portico or veranda ([Joh
5:2](../kjv/joh005.htm#002); [Joh 10:23](../kjv/joh010.htm#023.md); [Act
3:11](../kjv/act003.htm#011); [Act 5:12](../kjv/act005.htm#012)). (2..md)
Pulon , a gateway ([Mat 26:71](../kjv/mat026.htm#071)). (3..md) Proaulion ,
the entrance to the inner court ([Mar 14:68](../kjv/mar014.htm#068).md).
