<span id="000">**Gath-hepher**</span> Wine-press of the well a town of
Lower Galilee, about 5 miles from Nazareth; the birthplace of Jonah
([Kg2 14:25](../kjv/kg2014.htm#025)); the same as Gittah-hepher ([Jos
19:13](../kjv/jos019.htm#013)). It has been identified with the modern
el-Meshed, a village on the top of a rocky hill. Here the supposed tomb
of Jonah, Neby Yunas, is still pointed out.

<span id="001">**Gath-rimmon**</span> Press of the pomegranate. (1.) A
Levitical city in the tribe of Dan ([Jos 19:45](../kjv/jos019.htm#045);
[Jos 21:24](../kjv/jos021.htm#024); [Ch1 6:69](../kjv/ch1006.htm#069)).
(2.) Another city of the same name in Manasseh, west of the Jordan ([Jos
21:25](../kjv/jos021.htm#025)), called also Bileam ([Ch1
6:70](../kjv/ch1006.htm#070)).

<span id="002">**Gaulanitis**</span> A name derived from "Golan" (q.v.),
one of the cities of refuge in the territory of Manasseh ([Jos
20:8](../kjv/jos020.htm#008); [Jos 21:27](../kjv/jos021.htm#027); [Deu
4:43](../kjv/deu004.htm#043)). This was one of the provinces ruled by
Herod Antipas. It lay to the east of the Lake of Galilee, and included
among its towns Bethsaida-Julias ([Mar 8:22](../kjv/mar008.htm#022)) and
Seleucia.

<span id="003">**Gaza**</span> Called also Azzah, which is its Hebrew
name ([Deu 2:23](../kjv/deu002.htm#023); [Kg1
4:24](../kjv/kg1004.htm#024); [Jer 25:20](../kjv/jer025.htm#020))
strong, a city on the Mediterranean shore, remarkable for its early
importance as the chief centre of a great commercial traffic with Egypt.
It is one of the oldest cities of the world ([Gen
10:19](../kjv/gen010.htm#019); [Jos 15:47](../kjv/jos015.htm#047)). Its
earliest inhabitants were the Avims, who were conquered and displaced by
the Caphtorims ([Deu 2:23](../kjv/deu002.htm#023); [Jos
13:2](../kjv/jos013.htm#002), [Jos 13:3](../kjv/jos013.htm#003)), a
Philistine tribe. In the division of the land it fell to the lot of
Judah ([Jos 15:47](../kjv/jos015.htm#047); [Jdg
1:18](../kjv/jdg001.htm#018)). It was the southernmost of the five great
Philistine cities which gave each a golden emerod as a trespass-offering
unto the Lord ([Sa1 6:17](../kjv/sa1006.htm#017)). Its gates were
carried away by Samson ([Jdg 16:1](../kjv/jdg016.htm#001)). Here he was
afterwards a prisoner, and "did grind in the prison house." Here he also
pulled down the temple of Dagon, and slew "all the lords of the
Philistines," himself also perishing in the ruin ([Jdg
16:21](../kjv/jdg016.htm#021)). The prophets denounce the judgments of
God against it ([Jer 25:20](../kjv/jer025.htm#020); [Jer
47:5](../kjv/jer047.htm#005); [Amo 1:6](../kjv/amo001.htm#006), [Amo
1:7](../kjv/amo001.htm#007); [Zep 2:4](../kjv/zep002.htm#004)). It is
referred to in [Act 8:26](../kjv/act008.htm#026). Philip is here told to
take the road from Jerusalem to Gaza (about 6 miles south-west of
Jerusalem), "which is desert", i.e., the "desert road," probably by
Hebron, through the desert hills of Southern Judea. (See SAMSON.) It is
noticed on monuments as early as 1600 B.C.. Its small port is now called
el-Mineh.

<span id="004">**Geba**</span> The hill, ([Sa2
5:25](../kjv/sa2005.htm#025) \[[Ch1 14:16](../kjv/ch1014.htm#016),
"Gibeon"\]; [Kg2 23:8](../kjv/kg2023.htm#008); [Neh
11:31](../kjv/neh011.htm#031)), a Levitical city of Benjamin ([Kg1
15:22](../kjv/kg1015.htm#022); [Sa1 13:16](../kjv/sa1013.htm#016); [Sa1
14:5](../kjv/sa1014.htm#005), wrongly "Gibeah" in the A.V.), on the
north border of Judah near Gibeah ([Isa 10:29](../kjv/isa010.htm#029);
[Jos 18:24](../kjv/jos018.htm#024), [Jos 18:28](../kjv/jos018.htm#028)).
"From Geba to Beersheba" expressed the whole extent of the kingdom of
Judah, just as "from Dan to Beersheba" described the whole length of
Palestine ([Kg2 23:8](../kjv/kg2023.htm#008)). It has been identified
with Gaba ([Jos 18:24](../kjv/jos018.htm#024); [Ezr
2:26](../kjv/ezr002.htm#026); [Neh 7:30](../kjv/neh007.htm#030)), now
Jeb'a , about 5 1/2 miles north of Jerusalem.

<span id="005">**Gebal**</span> A line (or natural boundary, as a
mountain range). (1.) A tract in the land of Edom south of the Dead Sea
([Psa 83:7](../kjv/psa083.htm#007)); now called Djebal. (2.) A
Phoenician city, not far from the sea coast, to the north of Beirut
([Eze 27:9](../kjv/eze027.htm#009)); called by the Greeks Byblos. Now
Jibeil. Mentioned in the Amarna tablets. An important Phoenician text,
referring to the temple of Baalath, on a monument of Yehu-melek, its
king (probably 600 B.C.), has been discovered.

<span id="006">**Gebalites**</span> [Kg1 5:18](../kjv/kg1005.htm#018)
R.V., in A.V. incorrectly rendered, after the Targum, "stone-squarers,"
but marg. "Giblites"), the inhabitants of Gebal (2).

<span id="007">**Geber**</span> A valiant man, ([Kg1
4:19](../kjv/kg1004.htm#019)), one of Solomon's purveyors, having
jurisdiction over a part of Gilead, comprising all the kingdom of Sihon
and part of the kingdom of Og ([Deu 2:31](../kjv/deu002.htm#031)).

<span id="008">**Gebim**</span> Cisterns, (rendered "pits," [Jer
14:3](../kjv/jer014.htm#003); "locusts," [Isa
33:4](../kjv/isa033.htm#004)), a small place north of Jerusalem, whose
inhabitants fled at the approach of the Assyrian army ([Isa
10:31](../kjv/isa010.htm#031)). It is probably the modern el-Isawiyeh.

<span id="009">**Gedaliah**</span> Made great by Jehovah. (1.) The son
of Jeduthum ([Ch1 25:3](../kjv/ch1025.htm#003), [Ch1
25:9](../kjv/ch1025.htm#009)). (2.) The grandfather of the prophet
Zephaniah, and the father of Cushi ([Zep 1:1](../kjv/zep001.htm#001)).
(3.) One of the Jewish nobles who conspired against Jeremiah ([Jer
38:1](../kjv/jer038.htm#001)). (4.) The son of Ahikam, and grandson of
Shaphan, secretary of king Josiah ([Jer 26:24](../kjv/jer026.htm#024)).
After the destruction of Jerusalem (see ZEDEKIAH), Nebuchadnezzar left
him to govern the country as tributary to him ([Kg2
25:22](../kjv/kg2025.htm#022); [Jer 40:5](../kjv/jer040.htm#005); [Jer
52:16](../kjv/jer052.htm#016)). Ishmael, however, at the head of a party
of the royal family, "Jewish irreconcilable", rose against him, and slew
him and "all the Jews that were with him" ([Jer
41:2](../kjv/jer041.htm#002), [Jer 41:3](../kjv/jer041.htm#003)) at
Mizpah about three months after the destruction of Jerusalem. He and his
band also plundered the town of Mizpah, and carried off many captives.
He was, however, overtaken by Johanan and routed. He fled with such of
his followers as escaped to the Ammonites ([Jer
41:15](../kjv/jer041.htm#015)). The little remnant of the Jews now fled
to Egypt.
