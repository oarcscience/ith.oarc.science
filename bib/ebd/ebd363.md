<span id="000">**Tetrarch**</span> Strictly the ruler over the fourth
part of a province; but the word denotes a ruler of a province generally
([Mat 14:1](../kjv/mat014.htm#001); [Luk 3:1](../kjv/luk003.htm#001.md),
[Luk 3:19](../kjv/luk003.htm#019); [Luk 9:7](../kjv/luk009.htm#007.md);
[Act 13:1](../kjv/act013.htm#001).md). Herod and Phasael, the sons of
Antipater, were the first tetrarchs in Palestine. Herod the tetrarch had
the title of king ([Mat 14:9](../kjv/mat014.htm#009).md).

<span id="001">**Thaddaeus**</span> Breast, the name of one of the
apostles ([Mar 3:18](../kjv/mar003.htm#018).md), called "Lebbaeus" in [Mat
10:3](../kjv/mat010.htm#003), and in [Luk 6:16](../kjv/luk006.htm#016.md),
"Judas the brother of James;" while John ([Joh
14:22](../kjv/joh014.htm#022).md), probably referring to the same person,
speaks of "Judas, not Iscariot." These different names all designate the
same person, viz., Jude or Judas, the author of the epistle.

<span id="002">**Thahash**</span> A badger, a son of Nahor, Abraham's
brother ([Gen 22:24](../kjv/gen022.htm#024).md).

<span id="003">**Tharshish**</span> ([Kg1 10:22](../kjv/kg1010.htm#022.md);
[Kg1 22:48](../kjv/kg1022.htm#048).md). See TARSHISH.

<span id="004">**Theatre**</span> Only mentioned in [Act
19:29](../kjv/act019.htm#029), [Act 19:31](../kjv/act019.htm#031.md). The
ruins of this theatre at Ephesus still exist, and they show that it was
a magnificent structure, capable of accommodating some 56,700 persons.
It was the largest structure of the kind that ever existed. Theatres, as
places of amusement, were unknown to the Jews.

<span id="005">**Thebez**</span> Brightness, a place some 11 miles
north-east of Shechem, on the road to Scythopolis, the modern Tabas.
Abimelech led his army against this place, because of its participation
in the conspiracy of the men of Shechem; but as he drew near to the
strong tower to which its inhabitants had fled for safety, and was about
to set fire to it, a woman cast a fragment of millstone at him, and "all
to brake his skull" i.e., "altogether brake," etc. His armourbearer
thereupon "thrust him through, and he died" ([Jdg
9:50](../kjv/jdg009.htm#050).md).

<span id="006">**Theft**</span> Punished by restitution, the proportions
of which are noted in [Sa2 12:6](../kjv/sa2012.htm#006.md). If the thief
could not pay the fine, he was to be sold to a Hebrew master till he
could pay ([Exo 22:1](../kjv/exo022.htm#001).md). A night-thief might be
smitten till he died, and there would be no blood-guiltiness for him
([Exo 22:2](../kjv/exo022.htm#002).md). A man-stealer was to be put to
death ([Exo 21:16](../kjv/exo021.htm#016).md). All theft is forbidden ([Exo
20:15](../kjv/exo020.htm#015); [Exo 21:16](../kjv/exo021.htm#016.md); [Lev
19:11](../kjv/lev019.htm#011); [Deu 5:19](../kjv/deu005.htm#019.md); [Deu
24:7](../kjv/deu024.htm#007); [Psa 50:18](../kjv/psa050.htm#018.md); [Zac
5:3](../kjv/zac005.htm#003); [Mat 19:18](../kjv/mat019.htm#018.md); [Rom
13:9](../kjv/rom013.htm#009); [Eph 4:28](../kjv/eph004.htm#028.md); [Pe1
4:15](../kjv/pe1004.htm#015).md).

<span id="007">**Theocracy**</span> A word first used by Josephus to
denote that the Jews were under the direct government of God himself.
The nation was in all things subject to the will of their invisible
King. All the people were the servants of Jehovah, who ruled over their
public and private affairs, communicating to them his will through the
medium of the prophets. They were the subjects of a heavenly, not of an
earthly, king. They were Jehovah's own subjects, ruled directly by him
(compare [Sa1 8:6](../kjv/sa1008.htm#006).md).

<span id="008">**Theophilus**</span> Lover of God, a Christian, probably
a Roman, to whom Luke dedicated both his Gospel ([Luk
1:3](../kjv/luk001.htm#003).md) and the Acts of the Apostles ([Act
1:1](../kjv/act001.htm#001).md). Nothing beyond this is known of him. From
the fact that Luke applies to him the title "most excellent", the same
title Paul uses in addressing Felix ([Act 23:26](../kjv/act023.htm#026.md);
[Act 24:3](../kjv/act024.htm#003).md) and Festus ([Act
26:25](../kjv/act026.htm#025).md), it has been concluded that Theophilus
was a person of rank, perhaps a Roman officer.

<span id="009">**Thessalonians, Epistles to the**</span> The first
epistle to the Thessalonians was the first of all Paul's epistles. It
was in all probability written from Corinth, where he abode a "long
time" ([Act 18:11](../kjv/act018.htm#011.md), [Act
18:18](../kjv/act018.htm#018).md), early in the period of his residence
there, about the end of A.D. 52. The occasion of its being written was
the return of Timotheus from Macedonia, bearing tidings from
Thessalonica regarding the state of the church there ([Act
18:1](../kjv/act018.htm#001); [Th1 3:6](../kjv/th1003.htm#006).md). While,
on the whole, the report of Timothy was encouraging, it also showed that
divers errors and misunderstandings regarding the tenor of Paul's
teaching had crept in amongst them. He addresses them in this letter
with the view of correcting these errors, and especially for the purpose
of exhorting them to purity of life, reminding them that their
sanctification was the great end desired by God regarding them. The
subscription erroneously states that this epistle was written from
Athens. The second epistle to the Thessalonians was probably also
written from Corinth, and not many months after the first. The occasion
of the writing of this epistle was the arrival of tidings that the tenor
of the first epistle had been misunderstood, especially with reference
to the second advent of Christ. The Thessalonians had embraced the idea
that Paul had taught that "the day of Christ was at hand", that Christ's
coming was just about to happen. This error is corrected ([Th2
2:1](../kjv/th2002.htm#001).md), and the apostle prophetically announces
what first must take place. "The apostasy" was first to arise. Various
explanations of this expression have been given, but that which is most
satisfactory refers it to the Church of Rome.
