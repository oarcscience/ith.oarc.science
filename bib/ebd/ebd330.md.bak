<span id="000">**Shabbethai**</span> Sabbath-born, a Levite who assisted
in expounding the law and investigating into the illegal marriages of
the Jews ([Ezr 10:15](../kjv/ezr010.htm#015.md); [Neh
8:7](../kjv/neh008.htm#007); [Neh 11:16](../kjv/neh011.htm#016).md).

<span id="001">**Shaddai**</span> The Omnipotent, the name of God in
frequent use in the Hebrew Scriptures, generally translated "the
Almighty."

<span id="002">**Shadow**</span> Used in [Col
2:17](../kjv/col002.htm#017); [Heb 8:5](../kjv/heb008.htm#005.md); [Heb
10:1](../kjv/heb010.htm#001.md) to denote the typical relation of the
Jewish to the Christian dispensation.

<span id="003">**Shadrach**</span> Aku's command, the Chaldean name
given to Hananiah, one of the Hebrew youths whom Nebuchadnezzar carried
captive to Babylon ([Dan 1:6](../kjv/dan001.htm#006.md), [Dan
1:7](../kjv/dan001.htm#007); 3:12-30.md). He and his two companions refused
to bow down before the image which Nebuchadnezzar had set up on the
plains of Dura. Their conduct filled the king with the greatest fury,
and he commanded them to be cast into the burning fiery furnace. Here,
amid the fiery flames, they were miraculously preserved from harm. Over
them the fire had no power, "neither was a hair of their head signed,
neither had the smell of fire passed on them." Thus Nebuchadnezzar
learned the greatness of the God of Israel. (See ABEDNEGO.)

<span id="004">**Shalem**</span> Perfect, a place (probably the village
of Salim) some 2 miles east of Jacob's well. There is an abundant supply
of water, which may have been the reason for Jacob's settling at this
place ([Gen 33:18](../kjv/gen033.htm#018).md). The Revised Version
translates this word, and reads, "Jacob came in peace to the city of
Shechem," thus not regarding it as a proper name at all.

<span id="005">**Shalim, Land of**</span> Land of foxes, a place
apparently to the north-west of Jerusalem ([Sa1
9:4](../kjv/sa1009.htm#004).md), perhaps in the neighbourhood of Shaalabbin
in Dan ([Jos 19:42](../kjv/jos019.htm#042).md).

<span id="006">**Shalisha, Land of**</span> Probably the district of
Baal-shalisha ([Kg2 4:42](../kjv/kg2004.htm#042).md), lying about 12 miles
north of Lydda ([Sa1 9:4](../kjv/sa1009.htm#004).md).

<span id="007">**Shallecheth, The Gate of**</span> I.e., "the gate of
casting out," hence supposed to be the refuse gate; one of the gates of
the house of the Lord, "by the causeway of the going up" i.e., the
causeway rising up from the Tyropoeon valley = valley of the
cheesemakers ([Ch1 26:16](../kjv/ch1026.htm#016).md).

<span id="008">**Shallum**</span> Retribution. (1.) The son of Jabesh,
otherwise unknown. He "conspired against Zachariah, and smote him before
the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead" ([Kg2
15:10](../kjv/kg2015.htm#010).md). He reigned only "a month of days in
Samaria" ([Kg2 15:13](../kjv/kg2015.htm#013), marg..md). Menahem rose up
against Shallum and put him to death ([Kg2
15:14](../kjv/kg2015.htm#014), [Kg2 15:15](../kjv/kg2015.htm#015.md), [Kg2
15:17](../kjv/kg2015.htm#017)), and became king in his stead. (2..md)
Keeper of the temple vestments in the reign of Josiah ([Kg2
22:14](../kjv/kg2022.htm#014)). (3..md) One of the posterity of Judah ([Ch1
2:40](../kjv/ch1002.htm#040), [Ch1 2:41](../kjv/ch1002.htm#041)). (4..md) A
descendant of Simeon ([Ch1 4:25](../kjv/ch1004.htm#025)). (5..md) One of
the line of the high priests ([Ch1 6:13](../kjv/ch1006.htm#013)). (6..md)
[Ch1 7:13](../kjv/ch1007.htm#013). (7..md) A keeper of the gate in the
reign of David ([Ch1 9:17](../kjv/ch1009.htm#017)). (8..md) A Levite porter
([Ch1 9:19](../kjv/ch1009.htm#019), [Ch1 9:31](../kjv/ch1009.htm#031.md);
[Jer 35:4](../kjv/jer035.htm#004)). (9..md) An Ephraimite chief ([Ch2
28:12](../kjv/ch2028.htm#012)). (10..md) The uncle of the prophet Jeremiah
([Jer 32:7](../kjv/jer032.htm#007)). (11..md) A son of king Josiah ([Ch1
3:15](../kjv/ch1003.htm#015); [Jer 22:11](../kjv/jer022.htm#011).md), who
was elected to succeed his father on the throne, although he was two
years younger than his brother Eliakim. He assumed the crown under the
name of Jehoahaz (q.v.). He did not imitate the example of his father
([Kg2 23:32](../kjv/kg2023.htm#032).md), but was "a young lion, and it
learned to catch the prey; it devoured men" ([Eze
19:3](../kjv/eze019.htm#003).md). His policy was anti-Egyptian therefore.
Necho, at that time at Riblah, sent an army against Jerusalem, which at
once yielded, and Jehoahaz was carried captive to the Egyptian camp,
Eliakim being appointed king in his stead. He remained a captive in
Egypt till his death, and was the first king of Judah that died in
exile.

<span id="009">**Shalman**</span> An Assyrian king ([Hos
10:14](../kjv/hos010.htm#014)), identified with Shalmaneser II. (Sayce.md)
or IV. (Lenormant), the successor of Pul on the throne of Assyria (728
B.C.). He made war against Hoshea, the king of Israel, whom he subdued
and compelled to pay an annual tribute. Hoshea, however, soon after
rebelled against his Assyrian conqueror. Shalmaneser again marched
against Samaria, which, after a siege of three years, was taken ([Kg2
17:3](../kjv/kg2017.htm#003); [Kg2 18:9](../kjv/kg2018.htm#009).md) by
Sargon (q.v.). A revolution meantime had broken out in Assyria, and
Shalmaneser was deposed. Sargon usurped the vacant throne. Schrader
thinks that this is probably the name of a king of Moab mentioned on an
inscription of Tiglath-pileser as Salamanu.
