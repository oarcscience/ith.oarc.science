[Ch2 9:16](../kjv/ch2009.htm#016).md); by others it is identified with
Baal-gad (q.v.). It was a city of Coele-Syria, on the lowest declivity
of Anti-Libanus, about 42 miles north-west of Damascus. It was one of
the most splendid of Syrian cities, existing from a remote antiquity.

extent.

<span id="009">**Baal-berith**</span> Covenant lord, the name of the god
worshipped in Shechem after the death of Gideon ([Jdg

9:46](../kjv/jdg009.htm#046.md) he is called simply "the god Berith." The
name denotes the god of the covenant into which the Israelites entered
with the Canaanites, contrary to the command of Jehovah ([Exo
34:12](../kjv/exo034.htm#012).md), when they began to fall away to the
worship of idols.
