<span id="000">**Firmament**</span> From the Vulgate firmamentum, which
is used as the translation of the Hebrew raki a. This word means simply
"expansion." It denotes the space or expanse like an arch appearing
immediately above us. They who rendered raki a by firmamentum regarded
it as a solid body. The language of Scripture is not scientific but
popular, and hence we read of the sun rising and setting, and also here
the use of this particular word. It is plain that it was used to denote
solidity as well as expansion. It formed a division between the waters
above and the waters below ([Gen 1:7](../kjv/gen001.htm#007)). The raki
a supported the upper reservoir ([Psa 148:4](../kjv/psa148.htm#004)). It
was the support also of the heavenly bodies ([Gen
1:14](../kjv/gen001.htm#014)), and is spoken of as having "windows" and
"doors" ([Gen 7:11](../kjv/gen007.htm#011); [Isa
24:18](../kjv/isa024.htm#018); [Mal 3:10](../kjv/mal003.htm#010))
through which the rain and snow might descend.

<span id="001">**First-born**</span> Sons enjoyed certain special
privileges ([Deu 21:17](../kjv/deu021.htm#017); [Gen
25:23](../kjv/gen025.htm#023), [Gen 25:31](../kjv/gen025.htm#031), [Gen
25:34](../kjv/gen025.htm#034); [Gen 49:3](../kjv/gen049.htm#003); [Ch1
5:1](../kjv/ch1005.htm#001); [Heb 12:16](../kjv/heb012.htm#016); [Psa
89:27](../kjv/psa089.htm#027)). (See BIRTHRIGHT.) The "first-born of the
poor" signifies the most miserable of the poor ([Isa
14:30](../kjv/isa014.htm#030)). The "church of the first-born" signifies
the church of the redeemed. The destruction of the first-born was the
last of the ten plagues inflicted on the Egyptians ([Exo
11:1](../kjv/exo011.htm#001); [Exo 12:29](../kjv/exo012.htm#029), [Exo
12:30](../kjv/exo012.htm#030)). Menephtah is probably the Pharaoh whose
first-born was slain. His son did not succeed or survive his father, but
died early. The son's tomb has been found at Thebes unfinished, showing
it was needed earlier than was expected. Some of the records on the tomb
are as follows: "The son whom Menephtah loves; who draws towards him his
father's heart, the singer, the prince of archers, who governed Egypt on
behalf of his father. Dead."

<span id="002">**First-born, Sanctification of the**</span> A peculiar
sanctity was attached to the first-born both of man and of cattle. God
claimed that the first-born males of man and of animals should be
consecrated to him, the one as a priest ([Exo
19:22](../kjv/exo019.htm#022), [Exo 19:24](../kjv/exo019.htm#024)),
representing the family to which he belonged, and the other to be
offered up in sacrifice ([Gen 4:4](../kjv/gen004.htm#004)).

<span id="003">**First-born, Redemption of**</span> From the beginning
the office of the priesthood in each family belonged to the eldest son.
But when the extensive plan of sacrificial worship was introduced,
requiring a company of men to be exclusively devoted to this ministry,
the primitive office of the first-born was superseded by that of the
Levites ([Num 3:11](../kjv/num003.htm#011)), and it was ordained that
the first-born of man and of unclean animals should henceforth be
redeemed ([Num 18:15](../kjv/num018.htm#015)). The laws concerning this
redemption of the first-born of man are recorded in [Exo
13:12](../kjv/exo013.htm#012); [Exo 22:29](../kjv/exo022.htm#029); [Exo
34:20](../kjv/exo034.htm#020); [Num 3:45](../kjv/num003.htm#045); [Num
8:17](../kjv/num008.htm#017); [Num 18:16](../kjv/num018.htm#016); [Lev
12:2](../kjv/lev012.htm#002), [Lev 12:4](../kjv/lev012.htm#004). The
first-born male of every clean animal was to be given up to the priest
for sacrifice ([Deu 12:6](../kjv/deu012.htm#006); [Exo
13:12](../kjv/exo013.htm#012); [Exo 34:20](../kjv/exo034.htm#020); [Num
18:15](../kjv/num018.htm#015)). But the first-born of unclean animals
was either to be redeemed or sold and the price given to the priest
([Lev 27:11](../kjv/lev027.htm#011), [Lev
27:27](../kjv/lev027.htm#027)). The first-born of an ass, if not
redeemed, was to be put to death ([Exo 13:13](../kjv/exo013.htm#013);
[Exo 34:20](../kjv/exo034.htm#020)).

<span id="004">**First-fruits**</span> The first-fruits of the ground
were offered unto God just as the first-born of man and animals. The law
required, (1.) That on the morrow after the Passover Sabbath a sheaf of
new corn should be waved by the priest before the altar ([Lev
23:5](../kjv/lev023.htm#005), [Lev 23:6](../kjv/lev023.htm#006), [Lev
23:10](../kjv/lev023.htm#010), [Lev 23:12](../kjv/lev023.htm#012); [Lev
2:12](../kjv/lev002.htm#012)). (2.) That at the feast of Pentecost two
loaves of leavened bread, made from the new flour, were to be waved in
like manner ([Lev 23:15](../kjv/lev023.htm#015), [Lev
23:17](../kjv/lev023.htm#017); [Num 28:26](../kjv/num028.htm#026)). (3.)
The feast of Tabernacles was an acknowledgment that the fruits of the
harvest were from the Lord ([Exo 23:16](../kjv/exo023.htm#016); [Exo
34:22](../kjv/exo034.htm#022)). (4.) Every individual, besides, was
required to consecrate to God a portion of the first-fruits of the land
([Exo 22:29](../kjv/exo022.htm#029); [Exo 23:19](../kjv/exo023.htm#019);
[Exo 34:26](../kjv/exo034.htm#026); [Num 15:20](../kjv/num015.htm#020),
[Num 15:21](../kjv/num015.htm#021)). (5.) The law enjoined that no fruit
was to be gathered from newly-planted fruit-trees for the first three
years, and that the first-fruits of the fourth year were to be
consecrated to the Lord ([Lev 19:23](../kjv/lev019.htm#023)). Jeremiah
([Jer 2:3](../kjv/jer002.htm#003)) alludes to the ordinance of
"first-fruits," and hence he must have been acquainted with the books of
Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, where the laws regarding it are
recorded.

<span id="005">**Fish**</span> Called dag by the Hebrews, a word
denoting great fecundity ([Gen 9:2](../kjv/gen009.htm#002); [Num
11:22](../kjv/num011.htm#022); [Jon 2:1](../kjv/jon002.htm#001), [Jon
2:10](../kjv/jon002.htm#010)). No fish is mentioned by name either in
the Old or in the New Testament. Fish abounded in the Mediterranean and
in the lakes of the Jordan, so that the Hebrews were no doubt acquainted
with many species. Two of the villages on the shores of the Sea of
Galilee derived their names from their fisheries, Bethsaida (the "house
of fish") on the east and on the west. There is probably no other sheet
of water in the world of equal dimensions that contains such a variety
and profusion of fish. About thirty-seven different kinds have been
found. Some of the fishes are of a European type, such as the roach, the
barbel, and the blenny; others are markedly African and tropical, such
as the eel-like silurus. There was a regular fish-market apparently in
Jerusalem ([Ch2 33:14](../kjv/ch2033.htm#014); [Neh
3:3](../kjv/neh003.htm#003); [Neh 12:39](../kjv/neh012.htm#039); [Zep
1:10](../kjv/zep001.htm#010)), as there was a fish-gate which was
probably contiguous to it. Sidon is the oldest fishing establishment
known in history.

<span id="006">**Fisher**</span> Besides its literal sense ([Luk
5:2](../kjv/luk005.htm#002)), this word is also applied by our Lord to
his disciples in a figurative sense ([Mat 4:19](../kjv/mat004.htm#019);
[Mar 1:17](../kjv/mar001.htm#017)).

<span id="007">**Fish-hooks**</span> Were used for catching fish ([Amo
4:2](../kjv/amo004.htm#002); compare [Isa 37:29](../kjv/isa037.htm#029);
[Jer 16:16](../kjv/jer016.htm#016); [Eze 29:4](../kjv/eze029.htm#004);
[Job 41:1](../kjv/job041.htm#001), [Job 41:2](../kjv/job041.htm#002);
[Mat 17:27](../kjv/mat017.htm#027)).

<span id="008">**Fish-pools**</span> ([Sol 7:4](../kjv/sol007.htm#004))
should be simply "pools," as in the Revised Version. The reservoirs near
Heshbon (q.v.) were probably stocked with fish ([Sa2
2:13](../kjv/sa2002.htm#013); [Sa2 4:12](../kjv/sa2004.htm#012); [Isa
7:3](../kjv/isa007.htm#003); [Isa 22:9](../kjv/isa022.htm#009), [Isa
22:11](../kjv/isa022.htm#011)).

<span id="009">**Fishing, The Art of**</span> Was prosecuted with great
industry in the waters of Palestine. It was from the fishing-nets that
Jesus called his disciples ([Mar 1:16](../kjv/mar001.htm#016)), and it
was in a fishing-boat he rebuked the winds and the waves ([Mat
8:26](../kjv/mat008.htm#026)) and delivered that remarkable series of
prophecies recorded in Matt. 13. He twice miraculously fed multitudes
with fish and bread ([Mat 14:19](../kjv/mat014.htm#019); [Mat
15:36](../kjv/mat015.htm#036)). It was in the mouth of a fish that the
tribute-money was found ([Mat 17:27](../kjv/mat017.htm#027)). And he
"ate a piece of broiled fish" with his disciples after his resurrection
([Luk 24:42](../kjv/luk024.htm#042), [Luk 24:43](../kjv/luk024.htm#043);
compare [Act 1:3](../kjv/act001.htm#003)). At the Sea of Tiberias ([Joh
21:1](../kjv/joh021.htm#001)), in obedience to his direction, the
disciples cast their net "on the right side of the ship," and enclosed
so many that "they were not able to draw it for the multitude of
fishes." Two kinds of fishing-nets are mentioned in the New Testament:
(1.) The casting-net ([Mat 4:18](../kjv/mat004.htm#018); [Mar
1:16](../kjv/mar001.htm#016)). (2.) The drag-net or seine ([Mat
13:48](../kjv/mat013.htm#048)). Fish were also caught by the
fishing-hook ([Mat 17:27](../kjv/mat017.htm#027)). (See NET.)
