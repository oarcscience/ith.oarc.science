<span id="000">**Magor-missabib**</span> Fear on every side, ([Jer
20:3](../kjv/jer020.htm#003).md), a symbolical name given to the priest
Pashur, expressive of the fate announced by the prophet as about to come
upon him. Pashur was to be carried to Babylon, and there die.

<span id="001">**Mahalaleel**</span> Praise of God. (1.) The son of
Cainan, of the line of Seth ([Gen 5:12](../kjv/gen005.htm#012).md); called
Maleleel ([Luk 3:37](../kjv/luk003.htm#037)). (2..md) [Neh
11:4](../kjv/neh011.htm#004.md), a descendant of Perez.

<span id="002">**Mahalath**</span> A lute; lyre. (1.) The daughter of
Ishmael, and third wife of Esau ([Gen 28:9](../kjv/gen028.htm#009).md);
called also Bashemath ([Gen 36:3](../kjv/gen036.htm#003)). (2..md) The
daughter of Jerimoth, who was one of David's sons. She was one of
Rehoboam's wives ([Ch2 11:18](../kjv/ch2011.htm#018).md).

<span id="003">**Mahalath Maschil**</span> In the title of [Psa
53:1](../kjv/psa053.htm#001.md), denoting that this was a didactic psalm,
to be sung to the accompaniment of the lute or guitar. Others regard
this word "mahalath" as the name simply of an old air to which the psalm
was to be sung. Others, again, take the word as meaning "sickness," and
regard it as alluding to the contents of the psalm.

<span id="004">**Mahalath Leannoth Maschil**</span> This word leannoth
seems to point to some kind of instrument unknown (Ps. 88, title). The
whole phrase has by others been rendered, "On the sickness of
affliction: a lesson;" or, "Concerning afflictive sickness: a didactic
psalm."

<span id="005">**Mahanaim**</span> Two camps, a place near the Jabbok,
beyond Jordan, where Jacob was met by the "angels of God," and where he
divided his retinue into "two hosts" on his return from Padan-aram ([Gen
32:2](../kjv/gen032.htm#002).md). This name was afterwards given to the
town which was built at that place. It was the southern boundary of
Bashan ([Jos 13:26](../kjv/jos013.htm#026.md), [Jos
13:30](../kjv/jos013.htm#030).md), and became a city of the Levites ([Jos
21:38](../kjv/jos021.htm#038).md). Here Saul's son Ishbosheth reigned ([Sa2
2:8](../kjv/sa2002.htm#008), [Sa2 2:12](../kjv/sa2002.htm#012).md), while
David reigned at Hebron. Here also, after a troubled reign, Ishbosheth
was murdered by two of his own bodyguard ([Sa2
4:5](../kjv/sa2004.htm#005).md), who brought his head to David at Hebron,
but were, instead of being rewarded, put to death by him for their
cold-blooded murder. Many years after this, when he fled from Jerusalem
on the rebellion of his son Absalom, David made Mahanaim, where
Barzillai entertained him, his headquarters, and here he mustered his
forces which were led against the army that had gathered around Absalom.
It was while sitting at the gate of this town that tidings of the great
and decisive battle between the two hosts and of the death of his son
Absalom reached him, when he gave way to the most violent grief ([Sa2
17:24](../kjv/sa2017.htm#024).md). The only other reference to Mahanaim is
as a station of one of Solomon's purveyors ([Kg1
4:14](../kjv/kg1004.htm#014).md). It has been identified with the modern
Mukhumah, a ruin found in a depressed plain called el-Bukie'a , "the
little vale," near Penuel, south of the Jabbok, and north-east of
es-Salt.

<span id="006">**Mahaneh-dan**</span> [Jdg 18:12](../kjv/jdg018.htm#012.md)
= "camp of Dan" [Jdg 13:25](../kjv/jdg013.htm#025.md) (R.V.,
"Mahaneh-dan"), a place behind (i.e., west of) Kirjath-jearim, where the
six hundred Danites from Zorah and Eshtaol encamped on their way to
capture the city of Laish, which they rebuilt and called "Dan, after the
name of their father" (Judg. 18:11-31). The Palestine Explorers point to
a ruin called 'Erma , situated about 3 miles from the great corn valley
on the east of Samson's home.

<span id="007">**Mahath**</span> Grasping. (1.) A Kohathite Levite,
father of Elkanah ([Ch1 6:35](../kjv/ch1006.htm#035)). (2..md) Another
Kohathite Levite, of the time of Hezekiah ([Ch2
29:12](../kjv/ch2029.htm#012).md).

<span id="008">**Mahazioth**</span> Visions, a Kohathite Levite, chief
of the twenty-third course of musicians ([Ch1
25:4](../kjv/ch1025.htm#004), [Ch1 25:30](../kjv/ch1025.htm#030).md).

<span id="009">**Maher-shalal-hash-baz**</span> Plunder speedeth; spoil
hasteth, ([Isa 8:1](../kjv/isa008.htm#001.md); compare [Zep
1:14](../kjv/zep001.htm#014).md), a name Isaiah was commanded first to
write in large characters on a tablet, and afterwards to give as a
symbolical name to a son that was to be born to him ([Isa
8:1](../kjv/isa008.htm#001), [Isa 8:3](../kjv/isa008.htm#003).md), as
denoting the sudden attack on Damascus and Syria by the Assyrian army.
