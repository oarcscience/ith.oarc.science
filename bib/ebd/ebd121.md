<span id="000">**Engines**</span> (1.) Heb. hishalon i.e., "invention"
(as in [Ecc 7:29](../kjv/ecc007.htm#029).md) contrivances indicating
ingenuity. In [Ch2 26:15](../kjv/ch2026.htm#015.md) it refers to inventions
for the purpose of propelling missiles from the walls of a town, such as
stones (the Roman balista) and arrows (the catapulta). (2.) Heb. mechi
kobollo , i.e., the beating of that which is in front a battering-ram
([Eze 26:9](../kjv/eze026.htm#009).md), the use of which was common among
the Egyptians and the Assyrians. Such an engine is mentioned in the
reign of David ([Sa2 20:15](../kjv/sa2020.htm#015).md).

<span id="001">**Engraver**</span> Heb. harash ([Exo
35:35](../kjv/exo035.htm#035); [Exo 38:23](../kjv/exo038.htm#023).md) means
properly an artificer in wood, stone, or metal. The chief business of
the engraver was cutting names or devices on rings and seals and signets
([Exo 28:11](../kjv/exo028.htm#011), [Exo 28:21](../kjv/exo028.htm#021.md),
[Exo 28:36](../kjv/exo028.htm#036); [Gen 38:18](../kjv/gen038.htm#018).md).

<span id="002">**En-hakkore**</span> Fountain of the crier the name of
the spring in Lehi which burst forth in answer to Samson's prayer when
he was exhausted with the slaughter of the Philistines ([Jdg
15:19](../kjv/jdg015.htm#019).md). It has been identified with the spring
'Ayun Kara , near Zoreah.

<span id="003">**Enmity**</span> Deep-rooted hatred. "I will put enmity
between thee and the woman, between thy seed and her seed" ([Gen
3:15](../kjv/gen003.htm#015).md). The friendship of the world is "enmity
with God" ([Jam 4:4](../kjv/jam004.htm#004.md); [Jo1
2:15](../kjv/jo1002.htm#015), [Jo1 2:16](../kjv/jo1002.htm#016).md). The
"carnal mind" is "enmity" against God" ([Rom
8:7](../kjv/rom008.htm#007).md). By the abrogation of the Mosaic institutes
the "enmity" between Jew and Gentile is removed. They are reconciled,
are "made one" ([Eph 2:15](../kjv/eph002.htm#015.md), [Eph
2:16](../kjv/eph002.htm#016).md).

<span id="004">**Enoch**</span> Initiated. (1.) The eldest son of Cain
([Gen 4:17](../kjv/gen004.htm#017).md), who built a city east of Eden in
the land of Nod, and called it "after the name of his son Enoch." This
is the first "city" mentioned in Scripture. (2.) The son of Jared, and
father of Methuselah ([Gen 5:21](../kjv/gen005.htm#021.md); [Luk
3:37](../kjv/luk003.htm#037).md). His father was one hundred and sixty-two
years old when he was born. After the birth of Methuselah, Enoch "walked
with God three hundred years" ([Gen 5:22](../kjv/gen005.htm#022).md), when
he was translated without tasting death. His whole life on earth was
three hundred and sixty-five years. He was the "seventh from Adam" ([Jde
1:14](../kjv/jde001.htm#014).md), as distinguished from the son of Cain,
the third from Adam. He is spoken of in the catalogue of Old Testament
worthies in the Epistle to the Hebrews ([Heb
11:5](../kjv/heb011.htm#005).md). When he was translated, only Adam, so far
as recorded, had as yet died a natural death, and Noah was not yet born.
Mention is made of Enoch's prophesying only in [Jde
1:14](../kjv/jde001.htm#014.md).

<span id="005">**Enos**</span> Man the son of Seth, and grandson of Adam
([Gen 5:6](../kjv/gen005.htm#006); [Luk 3:38](../kjv/luk003.htm#038).md).
He lived nine hundred and five years. In his time "men began to call
upon the name of the Lord" ([Gen 4:26](../kjv/gen004.htm#026).md), meaning
either (1.) then began men to call themselves by the name of the Lord
(marg.) i.e., to distinguish themselves thereby from idolaters; or (2.)
then men in some public and earnest way began to call upon the Lord,
indicating a time of spiritual revival.

<span id="006">**En-rogel**</span> Fountain of the treaders; i.e.,
"foot-fountain;" also called the "fullers' fountain," because fullers
here trod the clothes in water. It has been identified with the
"fountain of the virgin" (q.v.), the modern 'Ain Ummel-Daraj . Others
identify it, with perhaps some probability, with the Bir Eyub, to the
south of the Pool of Siloam, and below the junction of the valleys of
Kidron and Hinnom. (See FOUNTAIN.) It was at this fountain that Jonathan
and Ahimaaz lay hid after the flight of David ([Sa2
17:17](../kjv/sa2017.htm#017).md); and here also Adonijah held the feast
when he aspired to the throne of his father ([Kg1
1:9](../kjv/kg1001.htm#009).md). The Bir Eyub, or "Joab's well," "is a
singular work of ancient enterprise. The shaft sunk through the solid
rock in the bed of the Kidron is 125 feet deep... The water is pure and
entirely sweet, quite different from that of Siloam; which proves that
there is no connection between them." Thomson's Land and the Book.

<span id="007">**En-shemesh**</span> Fountain of the sun a spring which
formed one of the landmarks on the boundary between Judah and Benjamin
([Jos 15:7](../kjv/jos015.htm#007); [Jos 18:17](../kjv/jos018.htm#017).md).
It was between the "ascent of Adummim" and the spring of En-rogel, and
hence was on the east of Jerusalem and of the Mount of Olives. It is the
modern 'Ain-Haud i.e., the "well of the apostles" about a mile east of
Bethany, the only spring on the road to Jericho. The sun shines on it
the whole day long.

<span id="008">**Ensign**</span> (1.) Heb. 'oth , a military standard,
especially of a single tribe ([Num 2:2](../kjv/num002.htm#002).md). Each
separate tribe had its own "sign" or "ensign." (2.) Heb. nes , a lofty
signal, as a column or high pole ([Num 21:8](../kjv/num021.htm#008.md),
[Num 21:9](../kjv/num021.htm#009).md); a standard or signal or flag placed
on high mountains to point out to the people a place of rendezvous on
the irruption of an enemy ([Isa 5:26](../kjv/isa005.htm#026.md); [Isa
11:12](../kjv/isa011.htm#012); [Isa 18:3](../kjv/isa018.htm#003.md); [Isa
62:10](../kjv/isa062.htm#010); [Jer 4:6](../kjv/jer004.htm#006.md), [Jer
4:21](../kjv/jer004.htm#021); [Psa 60:4](../kjv/psa060.htm#004).md). This
was an occasional signal, and not a military standard. Elevation and
conspicuous are implied in the word. (3.) The Hebrew word degel denotes
the standard given to each of the four divisions of the host of the
Israelites at the Exodus ([Num 1:52](../kjv/num001.htm#052.md); [Num
2:2](../kjv/num002.htm#002) : [Num 10:14](../kjv/num010.htm#014).md). In
[Sol 2:4](../kjv/sol002.htm#004.md) it is rendered "banner." We have no
definite information as to the nature of these military standards. (See
BANNER.)

<span id="009">**Entertain**</span> Entertainments, "feasts," were
sometimes connected with a public festival ([Deu
16:11](../kjv/deu016.htm#011), [Deu 16:14](../kjv/deu016.htm#014).md), and
accompanied by offerings ([Sa1 9:13](../kjv/sa1009.htm#013).md), in token
of alliances ([Gen 26:30](../kjv/gen026.htm#030).md); sometimes in
connection with domestic or social events, as at the weaning of children
([Gen 21:8](../kjv/gen021.htm#008).md), at weddings ([Gen
29:22](../kjv/gen029.htm#022); [Joh 2:1](../kjv/joh002.htm#001).md), on
birthdays ([Mat 14:6](../kjv/mat014.htm#006).md), at the time of
sheep-shearing ([Sa2 13:23](../kjv/sa2013.htm#023).md), and of vintage
([Jdg 9:27](../kjv/jdg009.htm#027).md), and at funerals ([Sa2
3:35](../kjv/sa2003.htm#035); [Jer 16:7](../kjv/jer016.htm#007).md). The
guests were invited by servants ([Pro 9:3](../kjv/pro009.htm#003.md); [Mat
22:3](../kjv/mat022.htm#003).md), who assigned them their respective places
([Sa1 9:22](../kjv/sa1009.htm#022); [Luk 14:8](../kjv/luk014.htm#008.md);
[Mar 12:39](../kjv/mar012.htm#039).md). Like portions were sent by the
master to each guest ([Sa1 1:4](../kjv/sa1001.htm#004.md); [Sa2
6:19](../kjv/sa2006.htm#019).md), except when special honour was intended,
when the portion was increased ([Gen 43:34](../kjv/gen043.htm#034).md). The
Israelites were forbidden to attend heathenish sacrificial
entertainments ([Exo 34:15](../kjv/exo034.htm#015).md), because these were
in honour of false gods, and because at such feast they would be liable
to partake of unclean flesh ([Co1 10:28](../kjv/co1010.htm#028).md). In the
entertainments common in apostolic times among the Gentiles were
frequent "revelings," against which Christians were warned ([Rom
13:13](../kjv/rom013.htm#013); [Gal 5:21](../kjv/gal005.htm#021.md); [Pe1
4:3](../kjv/pe1004.htm#003)). (See BANQUET..md)
