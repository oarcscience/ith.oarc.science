<span id="000">**Arnon**</span> Swift, the southern boundary of the
territory of Israel beyond Jordan, separating it from the land of Moab
([Deu 3:8](../kjv/deu003.htm#008), [Deu 3:16](../kjv/deu003.htm#016).md).
This river (referred to twenty-four times in the Bible) rises in the
mountains of Gilead, and after a circuitous course of about 80 miles
through a deep ravine it falls into the Dead Sea nearly opposite Engedi.
The stream is almost dry in summer. It is now called el-Mujeb. The
territory of the Amorites extended from the Arnon to the Jabbok.

<span id="001">**Aroer**</span> Ruins. (1.) A town on the north bank of
the Arnon ([Deu 4:48](../kjv/deu004.htm#048.md); [Jdg
11:26](../kjv/jdg011.htm#026); [Kg2 10:33](../kjv/kg2010.htm#033).md), the
southern boundary of the kingdom of Sihon ([Jos
12:2](../kjv/jos012.htm#002).md). It is now called Arair, 13 miles west of
the Dead Sea. (2.) One of the towns built by the tribe of Gad ([Num
32:34](../kjv/num032.htm#034).md) "before Rabbah" ([Jos
13:25](../kjv/jos013.htm#025).md), the Ammonite capital. It was famous in
the history of Jephthah ([Jdg 11:33](../kjv/jdg011.htm#033).md) and of
David ([Sa2 24:5](../kjv/sa2024.htm#005).md). (Compare [Isa
17:2](../kjv/isa017.htm#002); [Kg2 15:29](../kjv/kg2015.htm#029).) (3..md)
A city in the south of Judah, 12 miles south-east of Beersheba, to which
David sent presents after recovering the spoil from the Amalekites at
Ziklag ([Sa1 30:26](../kjv/sa1030.htm#026.md), [Sa1
30:28](../kjv/sa1030.htm#028).md). It was the native city of two of David's
warriors ([Ch1 11:44](../kjv/ch1011.htm#044).md). It is now called Ararah.

<span id="002">**Arpad**</span> ([Isa 10:9](../kjv/isa010.htm#009.md); [Isa
36:19](../kjv/isa036.htm#019); [Isa 37:13](../kjv/isa037.htm#013).md), also
Arphad.

<span id="003">**Arphad**</span> Support, a Syrian city near Hamath,
along with which it is invariably mentioned ([Kg2
19:13](../kjv/kg2019.htm#013); [Kg2 18:34](../kjv/kg2018.htm#034.md); [Isa
10:9](../kjv/isa010.htm#009).md), and Damascus ([Jer
49:23](../kjv/jer049.htm#023).md). After a siege of three years it fell
(742 B.C.) before the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser II. Now Tell Erfud.

<span id="004">**Arphaxad**</span> Son of Shem, born the year after the
Deluge. He died at the age of 438 years ([Gen
11:10](../kjv/gen011.htm#010); [Ch1 1:17](../kjv/ch1001.htm#017.md), [Ch1
1:18](../kjv/ch1001.htm#018); [Luk 3:36](../kjv/luk003.htm#036).md). He
dwelt in Mesopotamia, and became, according to the Jewish historian
Josephus, the progenitor of the Chaldeans. The tendency is to recognize
in the word the name of the country nearest the ancient domain of the
Chaldeans. Some regard the word as an Egypticized form of the
territorial name of Ur Kasdim, or Ur of the Chaldees.

<span id="005">**Arrows**</span> At first made of reeds, and then of
wood tipped with iron. Arrows are sometimes figuratively put for
lightning ([Deu 32:23](../kjv/deu032.htm#023.md), [Deu
32:42](../kjv/deu032.htm#042); [Psa 7:13](../kjv/psa007.htm#013.md); [Psa
18:14](../kjv/psa018.htm#014); [Psa 144:6](../kjv/psa144.htm#006.md); [Zac
9:14](../kjv/zac009.htm#014).md). They were used in war as well as in the
chase ([Gen 27:3](../kjv/gen027.htm#003.md); [Gen
49:23](../kjv/gen049.htm#023).md). They were also used in divination ([Eze
21:21](../kjv/eze021.htm#021).md). The word is frequently employed as a
symbol of calamity or disease inflicted by God ([Job
6:4](../kjv/job006.htm#004); [Job 34:6](../kjv/job034.htm#006.md); [Psa
38:2](../kjv/psa038.htm#002); [Deu 32:23](../kjv/deu032.htm#023.md).
Compare [Eze 5:16](../kjv/eze005.htm#016).md), or of some sudden danger
([Psa 91:5](../kjv/psa091.htm#005).md), or bitter words ([Psa
64:3](../kjv/psa064.htm#003).md), or false testimony ([Pro
25:18](../kjv/pro025.htm#018).md).

<span id="006">**Artaxerxes**</span> The Greek form of the name of
several Persian kings. (1.) The king who obstructed the rebuilding of
the temple ([Ezr 4:7](../kjv/ezr004.htm#007).md). He was probably the
Smerdis of profane history. (2.) The king mentioned in [Ezr
7:1](../kjv/ezr007.htm#001), in the seventh year (458 B.C..md) of whose
reign Ezra led a second colony of Jews back to Jerusalem, was probably
Longimanus, who reigned for forty years (464-425 B.C.); the grandson of
Darius, who, fourteen years later, permitted Nehemiah to return and
rebuild Jerusalem.

<span id="007">**Artificer**</span> A person engaged in any kind of
manual occupation ([Gen 4:22](../kjv/gen004.htm#022.md); [Isa
3:3](../kjv/isa003.htm#003).md).

<span id="008">**Artillery**</span> [Sa1 20:40](../kjv/sa1020.htm#040.md),
(Heb. keli , meaning "apparatus;" here meaning collectively any missile
weapons, as arrows and lances. In Revised Version, "weapons"). This word
is derived from the Latin artillaria = equipment of war.

<span id="009">**Arvad**</span> Wandering, ([Eze
27:8](../kjv/eze027.htm#008).md), a small island and city on the coast of
Syria, mentioned as furnishing mariners and soldiers for Tyre. The
inhabitants were called Arvadites. The name is written Aruada or Arada
in the Tell-el-Amarna tablets.
