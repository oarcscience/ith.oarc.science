<span id="000">**Abiezer**</span> Father of help; i.e., "helpful." (1.)
The second of the three sons of Hammoleketh, the sister of Gilead. He
was the grandson of Manasseh ([Ch1 7:18](../kjv/ch1007.htm#018).md). From
his family Gideon sprang ([Jos 17:2](../kjv/jos017.htm#002.md); compare
[Jdg 6:34](../kjv/jdg006.htm#034); [Jdg 8:2](../kjv/jdg008.htm#002).md). He
was also called Jeezer ([Num 26:30](../kjv/num026.htm#030)). (2..md) One of
David's thirty warriors ([Sa2 23:27](../kjv/sa2023.htm#027.md); compare
[Ch1 27:12](../kjv/ch1027.htm#012)). (3..md) The prince of the tribe of Dan
at the Exodus ([Num 1:12](../kjv/num001.htm#012).md).

<span id="001">**Abiezrite**</span> Father of help, a descendant of
Abiezer ([Jdg 6:11](../kjv/jdg006.htm#011.md), [Jdg
6:24](../kjv/jdg006.htm#024); [Jdg 8:32](../kjv/jdg008.htm#032).md).

<span id="002">**Abigail**</span> Father (i.e., "leader") of the dance,
or "of joy." (1.) The sister of David, and wife of Jether an Ishmaelite
([Ch1 2:16](../kjv/ch1002.htm#016), [Ch1 2:17](../kjv/ch1002.htm#017).md).
She was the mother of Amasa ([Sa2 17:25](../kjv/sa2017.htm#025)). (2..md)
The wife of the churlish Nabal, who dwelt in the district of Carmel
([Sa1 25:3](../kjv/sa1025.htm#003).md). She showed great prudence and
delicate management at a critical period of her husband's life. She was
"a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance." After
Nabal's death she became the wife of David (1 Sam. 25:14-42), and was
his companion in all his future fortunes ([Sa1
27:3](../kjv/sa1027.htm#003); [Sa1 30:5](../kjv/sa1030.htm#005.md); [Sa2
2:2](../kjv/sa2002.htm#002).md). By her David had a son called Chileab
([Sa2 3:3](../kjv/sa2003.htm#003).md), elsewhere called Daniel ([Ch1
3:1](../kjv/ch1003.htm#001).md).

<span id="003">**Abihail**</span> Father of might. (1.) [Num
3:35](../kjv/num003.htm#035). (2.) [Ch1 2:29](../kjv/ch1002.htm#029.md).
(3.) [Ch1 5:14](../kjv/ch1005.htm#014). (4..md) The second wife of King
Rehoboam ([Ch2 11:18](../kjv/ch2011.htm#018).md), a descendant of Eliab,
David's eldest brother. (5.) The father of Esther and uncle of Mordecai
([Est 2:15](../kjv/est002.htm#015).md).

<span id="004">**Abihu**</span> Father of Him; i.e., "worshipper of
God", the second of the sons of Aaron ([Exo
6:23](../kjv/exo006.htm#023); [Num 3:2](../kjv/num003.htm#002.md); [Num
26:60](../kjv/num026.htm#060); [Ch1 6:3](../kjv/ch1006.htm#003).md). Along
with his three brothers he was consecrated to the priest's office ([Exo
28:1](../kjv/exo028.htm#001).md). With his father and elder brother he
accompanied the seventy elders part of the way up the mount with Moses
([Exo 24:1](../kjv/exo024.htm#001), [Exo 24:9](../kjv/exo024.htm#009).md).
On one occasion he and Nadab his brother offered incense in their
censers filled with "strange" (i.e., common) fire, i.e., not with fire
taken from the great brazen altar ([Lev 6:9](../kjv/lev006.htm#009.md),
etc.), and for this offense they were struck dead, and were taken out
and buried without the camp ([Lev 10:1](../kjv/lev010.htm#001.md); compare
[Num 3:4](../kjv/num003.htm#004); [Num 26:61](../kjv/num026.htm#061.md);
[Ch1 24:2](../kjv/ch1024.htm#002).md). It is probable that when they
committed this offense they were intoxicated, for immediately after is
given the law prohibiting the use of wine or strong drink to the
priests.

<span id="005">**Abihud**</span> Father (i.e., "possessor") of renown.
(1.) One of the sons of Bela, the son of Benjamin ([Ch1
8:3](../kjv/ch1008.htm#003).md); called also Ahihud ([Ch1
8:7](../kjv/ch1008.htm#007)). (2..md) A descendant of Zerubbabel and father
of Eliakim ([Mat 1:13](../kjv/mat001.htm#013), "Abiud".md); called also
Juda ([Luk 3:26](../kjv/luk003.htm#026).md), and Obadiah ([Ch1
3:21](../kjv/ch1003.htm#021).md).

<span id="006">**Abijah**</span> Father (i.e., "possessor or
worshipper") of Jehovah. (1.) [Ch1 7:8](../kjv/ch1007.htm#008). (2..md)
[Ch1 2:24](../kjv/ch1002.htm#024). (3..md) The second son of Samuel ([Sa1
8:2](../kjv/sa1008.htm#002); [Ch1 6:28](../kjv/ch1006.htm#028).md). His
conduct, along with that of his brother, as a judge in Beer-sheba, to
which office his father had appointed him, led to popular discontent,
and ultimately provoked the people to demand a royal form of government.
(4.) A descendant of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, a chief of one of the
twenty-four orders into which the priesthood was divided by David ([Ch1
24:10](../kjv/ch1024.htm#010).md). The order of Abijah was one of those
which did not return from the Captivity ([Ezr
2:36](../kjv/ezr002.htm#036); [Neh 7:39](../kjv/neh007.htm#039.md); [Neh
12:1](../kjv/neh012.htm#001)). (5..md) The son of Rehoboam, whom he
succeeded on the throne of Judah ([Ch1 3:10](../kjv/ch1003.htm#010).md). He
is also called Abijam ([Kg1 14:31](../kjv/kg1014.htm#031.md); [Kg1
15:1](../kjv/kg1015.htm#001).md). He began his three years' reign ([Ch2
12:16](../kjv/ch2012.htm#016); [Ch2 13:1](../kjv/ch2013.htm#001.md), [Ch2
13:2](../kjv/ch2013.htm#002).md) with a strenuous but unsuccessful effort
to bring back the ten tribes to their allegiance. His address to
"Jeroboam and all Israel," before encountering them in battle, is worthy
of being specially noticed ([Ch2 13:5](../kjv/ch2013.htm#005).md). It was a
very bloody battle, no fewer than 500,000 of the army of Israel having
perished on the field. He is described as having walked "in all the sins
of his father" ([Kg1 15:3](../kjv/kg1015.htm#003.md); [Ch2
11:20](../kjv/ch2011.htm#020).md). It is said in [Kg1
15:2](../kjv/kg1015.htm#002.md) that "his mother's name was Maachah, the
daughter of Abishalom;" but in [Ch2 13:2](../kjv/ch2013.htm#002.md) we
read, "his mother's name was Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah."
The explanation is that Maachah is just a variation of the name
Michaiah, and that Abishalom is probably the same as Absalom, the son of
David. It is probable that "Uriel of Gibeah" married Tamar, the daughter
of Absalom ([Sa2 14:27](../kjv/sa2014.htm#027).md), and by her had Maachah.
The word "daughter" in [Kg1 15:2](../kjv/kg1015.htm#002.md) will thus, as
it frequently elsewhere does, mean grand-daughter. (6.) A son of
Jeroboam, the first king of Israel. On account of his severe illness
when a youth, his father sent his wife to consult the prophet Ahijah
regarding his recovery. The prophet, though blind with old age, knew the
wife of Jeroboam as soon as she approached, and under a divine impulse
he announced to her that inasmuch as in Abijah alone of all the house of
Jeroboam there was found "some good thing toward the Lord," he only
would come to his grave in peace. As his mother crossed the threshold of
the door on her return, the youth died, and "all Israel mourned for him"
(1 Kings 14:1-18). (7.) The daughter of Zechariah ([Ch2
29:1](../kjv/ch2029.htm#001); compare [Isa 8:2](../kjv/isa008.htm#002).md),
and afterwards the wife of Ahaz. She is also called Abi ([Kg2
18:2](../kjv/kg2018.htm#002)). (8..md) One of the sons of Becher, the son
of Benjamin ([Ch1 7:8](../kjv/ch1007.htm#008).md). "Abiah," A.V.

<span id="007">**Abijam**</span> Father of the sea; i.e., "seaman" the
name always used in Kings of the king of Judah, the son of Rehoboam,
elsewhere called Abijah ([Kg1 15:1](../kjv/kg1015.htm#001.md), [Kg1
15:7](../kjv/kg1015.htm#007), [Kg1 15:8](../kjv/kg1015.htm#008).md). (See
ABIJAH, 5.)

<span id="008">**Abilene**</span> A plain, a district lying on the east
slope of the Anti-Lebanon range; so called from its chief town, Abila
([Luk 3:1](../kjv/luk003.htm#001).md), which stood in the Suk Wady Barada,
between Heliopolis (Baalbec) and Damascus, 38 miles from the former and
18 from the latter. Lysanias was governor or tetrarch of this province.

<span id="009">**Abimael**</span> Father of Mael, one of the sons or
descendants of Joktan, in Northern Arabia ([Gen
10:28](../kjv/gen010.htm#028); [Ch1 1:22](../kjv/ch1001.htm#022).md).
