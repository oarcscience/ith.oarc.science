<span id="000">**Elon**</span> Oak. (1.) A city of Dan ([Jos
19:43](../kjv/jos019.htm#043)). (2..md) A Hittite, father of Bashemath,
Esau's wife ([Gen 26:34](../kjv/gen026.htm#034)). (3..md) One of the sons
of Zebulun ([Gen 46:14](../kjv/gen046.htm#014)). (4..md) The eleventh of
the Hebrew judges. He held office for ten years ([Jdg
12:11](../kjv/jdg012.htm#011), [Jdg 12:12](../kjv/jdg012.htm#012).md). He
is called the Zebulonite.

<span id="001">**Elparan**</span> Oak of Paran, a place on the edge of
the wilderness bordering the territory of the Horites ([Gen
14:6](../kjv/gen014.htm#006).md). This was the farthest point to which
Chedorlaomer's expedition extended. It is identified with the modern
desert of et-Tih. (See PARAN.)

<span id="002">**Eltekeh**</span> God is its fear, a city in the tribe
of Dan. It was a city of refuge and a Levitical city ([Jos
21:23](../kjv/jos021.htm#023).md). It has been identified with Beit-Likia,
north-east of latrum.

<span id="003">**Elul**</span> ([Neh 6:15](../kjv/neh006.htm#015).md), the
name of the sixth month of the ecclesiastical year, and the twelfth of
the civil year. It began with the new moon of our August and September,
and consisted of twenty-nine days.

<span id="004">**Elymas**</span> Magician or sorcerer, the Arabic name
of the Jew Bar-jesus, who withstood Paul and Barnabas in Cyprus. He was
miraculously struck with blindness ([Act 13:11](../kjv/act013.htm#011).md).

<span id="005">**Embalming**</span> The process of preserving a body by
means of aromatics ([Gen 50:2](../kjv/gen050.htm#002.md), [Gen
50:3](../kjv/gen050.htm#003), [Gen 50:26](../kjv/gen050.htm#026).md). This
art was practiced by the Egyptians from the earliest times, and there
brought to great perfection. This custom probably originated in the
belief in the future reunion of the soul with the body. The process
became more and more complicated, and to such perfection was it carried
that bodies embalmed thousands of years ago are preserved to the present
day in the numberless mummies that have been discovered in Egypt. The
embalming of Jacob and Joseph was according to the Egyptian custom,
which was partially followed by the Jews ([Ch2
16:14](../kjv/ch2016.htm#014).md), as in the case of king Asa, and of our
Lord ([Joh 19:39](../kjv/joh019.htm#039.md), [Joh
19:40](../kjv/joh019.htm#040); [Luk 23:56](../kjv/luk023.htm#056.md); [Luk
24:1](../kjv/luk024.htm#001)). (See PHARAOH..md)

<span id="006">**Embroider**</span> The art of embroidery was known to
the Jews ([Exo 26:36](../kjv/exo026.htm#036.md); [Exo
35:35](../kjv/exo035.htm#035); [Exo 38:23](../kjv/exo038.htm#023.md); [Jdg
5:30](../kjv/jdg005.htm#030); [Psa 45:14](../kjv/psa045.htm#014).md). The
skill of the women in this art was seen in the preparation of the
sacerdotal robes of the high priest (Ex. 28). It seems that the art
became hereditary in certain families ([Ch1
4:21](../kjv/ch1004.htm#021).md). The Assyrians were also noted for their
embroidered robes ([Eze 27:24](../kjv/eze027.htm#024).md).

<span id="007">**Emerald**</span> Heb. nophek ([Exo
28:18](../kjv/exo028.htm#018); [Exo 39:11](../kjv/exo039.htm#011).md);
i.e., the "glowing stone", probably the carbuncle, a precious stone in
the breastplate of the high priest. It is mentioned ([Rev
21:19](../kjv/rev021.htm#019).md) as one of the foundations of the New
Jerusalem. The name given to this stone in the New Testament Greek is
smaragdos , which means "live coal."

<span id="008">**Emerod**</span> See HAEMORRHOIDS.

<span id="009">**Emims**</span> Terrors, a warlike tribe of giants who
were defeated by Chedorlaomer and his allies in the plain of Kiriathaim.
In the time of Abraham they occupied the country east of Jordan,
afterwards the land of the Moabites ([Gen 14:5](../kjv/gen014.htm#005.md);
[Deu 2:10](../kjv/deu002.htm#010).md). They were, like the Anakim, reckoned
among the Rephaim, and were conquered by the Moabites, who gave them the
name of Emims, i.e., "terrible men" ([Deu 2:11](../kjv/deu002.htm#011).md).
The Ammonites called them Zamzummims ([Deu
2:20](../kjv/deu002.htm#020).md).
