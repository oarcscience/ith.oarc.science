<span id="000">**Fruit**</span> A word as used in Scripture denoting
produce in general, whether vegetable or animal. The Hebrews divided the
fruits of the land into three classes: (1.) The fruit of the field,
"corn-fruit" (Heb. dagan ); all kinds of grain and pulse. (2.) The fruit
of the vine, "vintage-fruit" (Heb. tirosh ); grapes, whether moist or
dried. (3.) "Orchard-fruits" (Heb. yitshar ), as dates, figs, citrons,
etc. Injunctions concerning offerings and tithes were expressed by these
Hebrew terms alone ([Num 18:12](../kjv/num018.htm#012.md); [Deu
14:23](../kjv/deu014.htm#023).md). This word "fruit" is also used of
children or offspring ([Gen 30:2](../kjv/gen030.htm#002.md); [Deu
7:13](../kjv/deu007.htm#013); [Luk 1:42](../kjv/luk001.htm#042.md); [Psa
21:10](../kjv/psa021.htm#010); [Psa 132:11](../kjv/psa132.htm#011).md);
also of the progeny of beasts ([Deu 28:51](../kjv/deu028.htm#051.md); [Isa
14:29](../kjv/isa014.htm#029).md). It is used metaphorically in a variety
of forms ([Psa 104:13](../kjv/psa104.htm#013.md); [Pro
1:31](../kjv/pro001.htm#031); [Pro 11:30](../kjv/pro011.htm#030.md); [Pro
31:16](../kjv/pro031.htm#016); [Isa 3:10](../kjv/isa003.htm#010.md); [Isa
10:12](../kjv/isa010.htm#012); [Mat 3:8](../kjv/mat003.htm#008.md); [Mat
21:41](../kjv/mat021.htm#041); [Mat 26:29](../kjv/mat026.htm#029.md); [Heb
13:15](../kjv/heb013.htm#015); [Rom 7:4](../kjv/rom007.htm#004.md), [Rom
7:5](../kjv/rom007.htm#005); [Rom 15:28](../kjv/rom015.htm#028).md). The
fruits of the Spirit ([Gal 5:22](../kjv/gal005.htm#022.md), [Gal
5:23](../kjv/gal005.htm#023); [Eph 5:9](../kjv/eph005.htm#009.md); [Jam
3:17](../kjv/jam003.htm#017), [Jam 3:18](../kjv/jam003.htm#018).md) are
those gracious dispositions and habits which the Spirit produces in
those in whom he dwells and works.

<span id="001">**Frying-pan**</span> (Heb. marhesheth , a "boiler"), a
pot for boiling meat ([Lev 2:7](../kjv/lev002.htm#007.md); [Lev
7:9](../kjv/lev007.htm#009).md).

<span id="002">**Fuel**</span> Almost every kind of combustible matter
was used for fuel, such as the withered stalks of herbs ([Mat
6:30](../kjv/mat006.htm#030).md), thorns ([Psa
58:9](../kjv/psa058.htm#009); [Ecc 7:6](../kjv/ecc007.htm#006).md), animal
excrements ([Eze 4:12](../kjv/eze004.htm#012.md); [Eze
15:4](../kjv/eze015.htm#004), [Eze 15:6](../kjv/eze015.htm#006.md); [Eze
21:32](../kjv/eze021.htm#032).md). Wood or charcoal is much used still in
all the towns of Syria and Egypt. It is largely brought from the region
of Hebron to Jerusalem. (See COAL.)

<span id="003">**Fugitive**</span> [Gen 4:12](../kjv/gen004.htm#012.md),
[Gen 4:14](../kjv/gen004.htm#014), a rover or wanderer (Heb. n'a .md); [Jdg
12:4](../kjv/jdg012.htm#004.md), a refugee, one who has escaped (Heb. palit
); [Kg2 25:11](../kjv/kg2025.htm#011.md), a deserter, one who has fallen
away to the enemy (Heb. nophel ); [Eze 17:21](../kjv/eze017.htm#021.md),
one who has broken away in flight (Heb. mibrah ); [Isa
15:5](../kjv/isa015.htm#005); [Isa 43:14](../kjv/isa043.htm#014.md), a
breaker away, a fugitive (Heb. beriah ), one who flees away.

<span id="004">**Fuller**</span> The word "full" is from the Anglo-Saxon
fullian, meaning "to whiten." To full is to press or scour cloth in a
mill. This art is one of great antiquity. Mention is made of "fuller's
soap" ([Mal 3:2](../kjv/mal003.htm#002).md), and of "the fuller's field"
([Kg2 18:17](../kjv/kg2018.htm#017).md). At his transfiguration our Lord's
raiment is said to have been white "so as no fuller on earth could white
them" ([Mar 9:3](../kjv/mar009.htm#003)). En-rogel (q.v..md), meaning
literally "foot-fountain," has been interpreted as the "fuller's
fountain," because there the fullers trod the cloth with their feet.

<span id="005">**Fuller's Soap**</span> (Heb. borith mekabbeshim i.e.,
"alkali of those treading cloth"). Mention is made ([Pro
25:20](../kjv/pro025.htm#020); [Jer 2:22](../kjv/jer002.htm#022).md) of
nitre and also ([Mal 3:2](../kjv/mal003.htm#002)) of soap (Heb. borith .md)
used by the fuller in his operations. Nitre is found in Syria, and
vegetable alkali was obtained from the ashes of certain plants. (See
SOAP.)

<span id="006">**Fuller's Field**</span> A spot near Jerusalem ([Kg2
18:17](../kjv/kg2018.htm#017); [Isa 36:2](../kjv/isa036.htm#002.md); [Isa
7:3](../kjv/isa007.htm#003).md), on the side of the highway west of the
city, not far distant from the "upper pool" at the head of the valley of
Hinnom. Here the fullers pursued their occupation.

<span id="007">**Fulness**</span> (1.) Of time ([Gal
4:4](../kjv/gal004.htm#004).md), the time appointed by God, and foretold by
the prophets, when Messiah should appear. (2.) Of Christ ([Joh
1:16](../kjv/joh001.htm#016).md), the superabundance of grace with which he
was filled. (3.) Of the Godhead bodily dwelling in Christ ([Col
2:9](../kjv/col002.htm#009).md), i.e., the whole nature and attributes of
God are in Christ. (4.) [Eph 1:23](../kjv/eph001.htm#023.md), the church as
the fulness of Christ, i.e., the church makes Christ a complete and
perfect head.

<span id="008">**Funeral**</span> Burying was among the Jews the only
mode of disposing of corpses ([Gen 23:19](../kjv/gen023.htm#019.md); [Gen
25:9](../kjv/gen025.htm#009); [Gen 35:8](../kjv/gen035.htm#008.md), [Gen
35:9](../kjv/gen035.htm#009), etc..md). The first traces of burning the
dead are found in [Sa1 31:12](../kjv/sa1031.htm#012.md). The burning of the
body was affixed by the law of Moses as a penalty to certain crimes
([Lev 20:14](../kjv/lev020.htm#014); [Lev 21:9](../kjv/lev021.htm#009).md).
To leave the dead unburied was regarded with horror ([Kg1
13:22](../kjv/kg1013.htm#022); [Kg1 14:11](../kjv/kg1014.htm#011.md); [Kg1
16:4](../kjv/kg1016.htm#004); [Kg1 21:24](../kjv/kg1021.htm#024), etc..md).
In the earliest times of which we have record kinsmen carried their dead
to the grave ([Gen 25:9](../kjv/gen025.htm#009.md); [Gen
35:29](../kjv/gen035.htm#029); [Jdg 16:31](../kjv/jdg016.htm#031).md), but
in later times this was done by others ([Amo
6:10](../kjv/amo006.htm#010).md). Immediately after decease the body was
washed, and then wrapped in a large cloth ([Act
9:37](../kjv/act009.htm#037); [Mat 27:59](../kjv/mat027.htm#059.md); [Mar
15:46](../kjv/mar015.htm#046).md). In the case of persons of distinction,
aromatics were laid on the folds of the cloth ([Joh
19:39](../kjv/joh019.htm#039.md); compare [Joh
12:7](../kjv/joh012.htm#007)). As a rule the burial (q.v..md) took place on
the very day of the death ([Act 5:6](../kjv/act005.htm#006.md), [Act
5:10](../kjv/act005.htm#010).md), and the body was removed to the grave in
an open coffin or on a bier ([Luk 7:14](../kjv/luk007.htm#014).md). After
the burial a funeral meal was usually given ([Sa2
3:35](../kjv/sa2003.htm#035); [Jer 16:5](../kjv/jer016.htm#005.md), [Jer
16:7](../kjv/jer016.htm#007); [Hos 9:4](../kjv/hos009.htm#004).md).

<span id="009">**Furlong**</span> A stadium, a Greek measure of distance
equal to 606 feet and 9 inches ([Luk 24:13](../kjv/luk024.htm#013.md); [Joh
6:19](../kjv/joh006.htm#019); [Joh 11:18](../kjv/joh011.htm#018.md); [Rev
14:20](../kjv/rev014.htm#020); [Rev 21:16](../kjv/rev021.htm#016).md).
