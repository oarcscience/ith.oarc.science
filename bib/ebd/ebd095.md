<span id="000">**Cutting**</span> The flesh in various ways was an
idolatrous practice - a part of idol worship ([Deu
14:1](../kjv/deu014.htm#001); [Kg1 18:28](../kjv/kg1018.htm#028).md). The
Israelites were commanded not to imitate this practice ([Lev
19:28](../kjv/lev019.htm#028); [Lev 21:5](../kjv/lev021.htm#005.md); [Deu
14:1](../kjv/deu014.htm#001).md). The tearing of the flesh from grief and
anguish of spirit in mourning for the dead was regarded as a mark of
affection ([Jer 16:6](../kjv/jer016.htm#006.md); [Jer
41:5](../kjv/jer041.htm#005); [Jer 48:37](../kjv/jer048.htm#037).md).
Allusions are made in Revelation ([Rev 13:16](../kjv/rev013.htm#016.md);
[Rev 17:5](../kjv/rev017.htm#005); [Rev 19:20](../kjv/rev019.htm#020).md)
to the practice of printing marks on the body, to indicate allegiance to
a deity. We find also references to it, through in a different
direction, by Paul (Gal. 6; 7) and by Ezekiel ([Eze
9:4](../kjv/eze009.htm#004)). (See HAIR..md)

<span id="001">**Cymbals**</span> (Heb. tzeltzelim , from a root meaning
to "tinkle"), musical instruments, consisting of two convex pieces of
brass one held in each hand, which were clashed together to produce a
loud clanging sound; castanets; "loud cymbals." "High-sounding cymbals"
consisted of two larger plates, one held also in each hand ([Sa2
6:5](../kjv/sa2006.htm#005); [Psa 150:5](../kjv/psa150.htm#005.md); [Ch1
13:8](../kjv/ch1013.htm#008); [Ch1 15:16](../kjv/ch1015.htm#016.md), [Ch1
15:19](../kjv/ch1015.htm#019), [Ch1 15:28](../kjv/ch1015.htm#028.md); [Co1
13:1](../kjv/co1013.htm#001).md).

<span id="002">**Cypress**</span> (Heb. tirzah , "hardness"), mentioned
only in [Isa 44:14](../kjv/isa044.htm#014) (R.V., "holm tree".md). The
oldest Latin version translates this word by ilex - i.e., the evergreen
oak - which may possibly have been the tree intended; but there is great
probability that our Authorized Version is correct in rendering it
"cypress." This tree grows abundantly on the mountains of Hermon. Its
wood is hard and fragrant, and very durable. Its foliage is dark and
gloomy. It is an evergreen (Cupressus sempervirens). "Throughout the
East it is used as a funereal tree; and its dark, tall, waving plumes
render it peculiarly appropriate among the tombs."

<span id="003">**Cyprus**</span> One of the largest islands of the
Mediterranean - about 148 miles long and 40 broad. It is distant about
60 miles from the Syrian coast. It was the "Chittim" of the Old
Testament ([Num 24:24](../kjv/num024.htm#024).md). The Greek colonists gave
it the name of Kypros , from the cyprus - i.e., the henna (see CAMPHIRE)
- which grew on this island. It was originally inhabited by Phoenicians.
In 477 B.C. it fell under the dominion of the Greeks; and became a Roman
province 58 B.C.. In ancient times it was a centre of great commercial
activity. Corn and wine and oil were produced here in the greatest
perfection. It was rich also in timber and in mineral wealth. It is
first mentioned in the New Testament ([Act 4:36](../kjv/act004.htm#036).md)
as the native place of Barnabas. It was the scene of Paul's first
missionary labours ([Act 13:4](../kjv/act013.htm#004).md), when he and
Barnabas and John Mark were sent forth by the church of Antioch. It was
afterwards visited by Barnabas and Mark alone ([Act
15:39](../kjv/act015.htm#039).md). Mnason, an "old disciple," probaly one
of the converts of the day of Pentecost belonging to this island, is
mentioned ([Act 21:16](../kjv/act021.htm#016).md). It is also mentioned in
connection with the voyages of Paul ([Act 21:3](../kjv/act021.htm#003.md);
[Act 27:4](../kjv/act027.htm#004).md). After being under the Turks for
three hundred years, it was given up to the British Government in 1878.

<span id="004">**Cyrene**</span> A city (now Tripoli) in Upper Libya,
North Africa, founded by a colony of Greeks (630 B.C.). It contained
latterly a large number of Jews, who were introduced into the city by
Ptolemy, the son of Lagus, because he thought they would contribute to
the security of the place. They increased in number and influence; and
we are thus prepared for the frequent references to them in connection
with the early history of Christianity. Simon, who bore our Lord's
cross, was a native of this place ([Mat 27:32](../kjv/mat027.htm#032.md);
[Mar 15:21](../kjv/mar015.htm#021).md). Jews from Cyrene were in Jerusalem
at Pentecost ([Act 2:10](../kjv/act002.htm#010).md); and Cyrenian Jews had
a synagogue at Jerusalem ([Act 6:9](../kjv/act006.htm#009).md). Converts
belonging to Cyrene contributed to the formation of the first Gentile
church at Antioch ([Act 11:20](../kjv/act011.htm#020).md). Among "the
prophets and teachers" who "ministered to the Lord at Antioch" was
Lucius of Cyrene ([Act 13:1](../kjv/act013.htm#001).md).

<span id="005">**Cyrenius**</span> The Grecized form of Quirinus. His
full name was Publius Sulpicius Quirinus. Recent historical
investigation has proved that Quirinus was governor of Cilicia, which
was annexed to Syria at the time of our Lord's birth. Cilicia, which he
ruled, being a province of Syria, he is called the governor, which he
was dejure, of Syria. Some ten years afterwards he was appointed
governor of Syria for the second time. During his tenure of office, at
the time of our Lord's birth ([Luk 2:2](../kjv/luk002.htm#002).md), a
"taxing" (R.V., "enrollment;" i.e., a registration) of the people was
"first made;" i.e., was made for the first time under his government.
(See TAXING.)

<span id="006">**Cyrus**</span> (Heb. Koresh ), the celebrated "King of
Persia" (Elam) who was conqueror of Babylon, and issued the decree of
liberation to the Jews ([Ezr 1:1](../kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md), [Ezr
1:2](../kjv/ezr001.htm#002).md). He was the son of Cambyses, the prince of
Persia, and was born about 599 B.C.. In the year 559 B.C. he became king
of Persia, the kingdom of Media being added to it partly by conquest.
Cyrus was a great military leader, bent on universal conquest. Babylon
fell before his army (538 B.C.) on the night of Belshazzar's feast ([Dan
5:30](../kjv/dan005.htm#030).md), and then the ancient dominion of Assyria
was also added to his empire (cf., "Go up, O Elam" - [Isa
21:2](../kjv/isa021.htm#002).md). Hitherto the great kings of the earth had
only oppressed the Jews. Cyrus was to them as a "shepherd" ([Isa
44:28](../kjv/isa044.htm#028); [Isa 45:1](../kjv/isa045.htm#001).md). God
employed him in doing service to his ancient people. He may possibly
have gained, through contact with the Jews, some knowledge of their
religion. The "first year of Cyrus" ([Ezr 1:1](../kjv/ezr001.htm#001).md)
is not the year of his elevation to power over the Medes, nor over the
Persians, nor the year of the fall of Babylon, but the year succeeding
the two years during which "Darius the Mede" was viceroy in Babylon
after its fall. At this time only (536 B.C.) Cyrus became actual king
over Palestine, which became a part of his Babylonian empire. The edict
of Cyrus for the rebuilding of Jerusalem marked a great epoch in the
history of the Jewish people ([Ch2 36:22](../kjv/ch2036.htm#022.md), [Ch2
36:23](../kjv/ch2036.htm#023); [Ezr 1:1](../kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md); [Ezr
4:3](../kjv/ezr004.htm#003); [Ezr 5:13](../kjv/ezr005.htm#013.md); [Ezr
6:3](../kjv/ezr006.htm#003).md). This decree was discovered "at Achmetha
\[R.V. marg., "Ecbatana"\], in the palace that is in the province of the
Medes" ([Ezr 6:2](../kjv/ezr006.htm#002).md). A chronicle drawn up just
after the conquest of Babylonia by Cyrus, gives the history of the reign
of Nabonidus (Nabunahid), the last king of Babylon, and of the fall of
the Babylonian empire. In 538 B.C. there was a revolt in Southern
Babylonia, while the army of Cyrus entered the country from the north.
In June the Babylonian army was completely defeated at Opis, and
immediately afterwards Sippara opened its gates to the conqueror.
Gobryas (Ugbaru), the governor of Kurdistan, was then sent to Babylon,
which surrendered "without fighting," and the daily services in the
temples continued without a break. In October, Cyrus himself arrived,
and proclaimed a general amnesty, which was communicated by Gobryas to
"all the province of Babylon," of which he had been made governor.
Meanwhile, Nabonidus, who had concealed himself, was captured, but
treated honourably; and when his wife died, Cambyses, the son of Cyrus,
conducted the funeral. Cyrus now assumed the title of "king of Babylon,"
claimed to be the descendant of the ancient kings, and made rich
offerings to the temples. At the same time he allowed the foreign
populations who had been deported to Babylonia to return to their old
homes, carrying with them the images of their gods. Among these
populations were the Jews, who, as they had no images, took with them
the sacred vessels of the temple.

<span id="007">**Daberath**</span> Pasture - a Levitical town of
Issachar ([Jos 19:12](../kjv/jos019.htm#012.md); [Jos
21:28](../kjv/jos021.htm#028).md), near the border of Zebulum. It is the
modern small village of Deburich, at the base of Mount Tabor. Tradition
has incorrectly made it the scene of the miracle of the cure of the
lunatic child ([Mat 17:14](../kjv/mat017.htm#014).md).

<span id="008">**Daemon**</span> The Greek form, rendered "devil" in the
Authorized Version of the New Testament. Daemons are spoken of as
spiritual beings ([Mat 8:16](../kjv/mat008.htm#016.md); [Mat
10:1](../kjv/mat010.htm#001); [Mat 12:43](../kjv/mat012.htm#043).md) at
enmity with God, and as having a certain power over man ([Jam
2:19](../kjv/jam002.htm#019); [Rev 16:14](../kjv/rev016.htm#014).md). They
recognize our Lord as the Son of God ([Mat 8:20](../kjv/mat008.htm#020.md);
[Luk 4:41](../kjv/luk004.htm#041).md). They belong to the number of those
angels that "kept not their first estate, "unclean spirits," "fallen
angels," the angels of the devil ([Mat 25:41](../kjv/mat025.htm#041.md);
[Rev 12:7](../kjv/rev012.htm#007).md). They are the "principalities and
powers" against which we must "wrestle" ([Eph
6:12](../kjv/eph006.htm#012).md).

<span id="009">**Daemoniac**</span> One "possessed with a devil." In the
days of our Lord and his apostles evil spirits, "daemons," were
mysteriously permitted by God to exercise an influence both over the
souls and bodies of men, inflicting dumbness ([Mat
9:32](../kjv/mat009.htm#032).md), blindness ([Mat
12:22](../kjv/mat012.htm#022).md), epilepsy ([Mar
9:17](../kjv/mar009.htm#017).md), insanity ([Mat
8:28](../kjv/mat008.htm#028); [Mar 5:1](../kjv/mar005.htm#001).md).
Daemoniacs are frequently distinguished from those who are afflicted
with ordinary bodily maladies ([Mar 1:32](../kjv/mar001.htm#032.md); [Mar
16:17](../kjv/mar016.htm#017), [Mar 16:18](../kjv/mar016.htm#018.md); [Luk
6:17](../kjv/luk006.htm#017), [Luk 6:18](../kjv/luk006.htm#018).md). The
daemons speak in their own persons ([Mat 8:29](../kjv/mat008.htm#029.md);
[Mar 1:23](../kjv/mar001.htm#023), [Mar 1:24](../kjv/mar001.htm#024.md);
[Mar 5:7](../kjv/mar005.htm#007).md). This influence is clearly
distinguished from the ordinary power of corruption and of temptation
over men. In the daemoniac his personality seems to be destroyed, and
his actions, words, and even thoughts to be overborne by the evil spirit
(Mark, l.c.; [Act 19:15](../kjv/act019.htm#015).md).
