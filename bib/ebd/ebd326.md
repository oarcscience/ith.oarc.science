<span id="000">**Seer**</span> A name sometimes applied to the prophets
because of the visions granted to them. It is first found in [Sa1
9:9](../kjv/sa1009.htm#009.md). It is afterwards applied to Zadok, Gad,
etc. ([Sa2 15:27](../kjv/sa2015.htm#027.md); [Sa2
24:11](../kjv/sa2024.htm#011); [Ch1 9:22](../kjv/ch1009.htm#022.md); [Ch1
25:5](../kjv/ch1025.htm#005); [Ch2 9:29](../kjv/ch2009.htm#029.md); [Amo
7:12](../kjv/amo007.htm#012); [Mic 3:7](../kjv/mic003.htm#007).md). The
"sayings of the seers" ([Ch2 33:18](../kjv/ch2033.htm#018.md), [Ch2
33:19](../kjv/ch2033.htm#019).md) is rendered in the Revised Version "the
history of Hozai" (marg., the seers; so the LXX.), of whom, however,
nothing is known. (See PROPHET.)

16:23](../kjv/exo016.htm#023).md).

in ([Job 41:20](../kjv/job041.htm#020.md); [Jer
1:13](../kjv/jer001.htm#013).md).

<span id="003">**Segub**</span> Elevated. (1.) The youngest son of Hiel
the Bethelite. His death is recorded in [Kg1
16:34](../kjv/kg1016.htm#034.md) (compare [Jos
6:26](../kjv/jos006.htm#026)). (2..md) A descendant of Judah ([Ch1
2:21](../kjv/ch1002.htm#021), [Ch1 2:22](../kjv/ch1002.htm#022).md).

<span id="004">**Seir**</span> Rough; hairy. (1.) A Horite; one of the
"dukes" of Edom ([Gen 36:20](../kjv/gen036.htm#020)). (2..md) The name of a
mountainous region occupied by the Edomites, extending along the eastern
side of the Arabah from the south-eastern extremity of the Dead Sea to
near the Akabah, or the eastern branch of the Red Sea. It was originally
occupied by the Horites ([Gen 14:6](../kjv/gen014.htm#006).md), who were
afterwards driven out by the Edomites ([Gen
32:3](../kjv/gen032.htm#003); [Gen 33:14](../kjv/gen033.htm#014.md), [Gen
33:16](../kjv/gen033.htm#016).md). It was allotted to the descendants of
Esau ([Deu 2:4](../kjv/deu002.htm#004.md), [Deu
2:22](../kjv/deu002.htm#022); [Jos 24:4](../kjv/jos024.htm#004.md); [Ch2
20:10](../kjv/ch2020.htm#010); [Isa 21:11](../kjv/isa021.htm#011.md); [Eze
25:8](../kjv/eze025.htm#008)). (3..md) A mountain range (not the Edomite
range, [Gen 32:3](../kjv/gen032.htm#003).md) lying between the Wady Aly and
the Wady Ghurab ([Jos 15:10](../kjv/jos015.htm#010).md).

<span id="005">**Seirath**</span> Woody district; shaggy, a place among
the mountains of Ephraim, bordering on Benjamin, to which Ehud fled
after he had assassinated Eglon at Jericho ([Jdg
3:26](../kjv/jdg003.htm#026), [Jdg 3:27](../kjv/jdg003.htm#027).md).

<span id="006">**Sela**</span> =Selah, rock, the capital of Edom,
situated in the great valley extending from the Dead Sea to the Red Sea
([Kg2 14:7](../kjv/kg2014.htm#007).md). It was near Mount Hor, close by the
desert of Zin. It is called "the rock" ([Jdg
1:36](../kjv/jdg001.htm#036).md). When Amaziah took it he called it
Joktheel (q.v.) It is mentioned by the prophets ([Isa
16:1](../kjv/isa016.htm#001); [Oba 1:3](../kjv/oba001.htm#003).md) as
doomed to destruction. It appears in later history and in the Vulgate
Version under the name of Petra. "The caravans from all ages, from the
interior of Arabia and from the Gulf of Persia, from Hadramaut on the
ocean, and even from Sabea or Yemen, appear to have pointed to Petra as
a common centre; and from Petra the tide seems again to have branched
out in every direction, to Egypt, Palestine, and Syria, through Arsinoe,
Gaza, Tyre, Jerusalem, and Damascus, and by other routes, terminating at
the Mediterranean." (See EDOM \[2\].)

<span id="007">**Sela-hammahlekoth**</span> Cliff of divisions the name
of the great gorge which lies between Hachilah and Maon, south-east of
Hebron. This gorge is now called the Wady Malaky. This was the scene of
the interview between David and Saul mentioned in [Sa1
26:13](../kjv/sa1026.htm#013.md). Each stood on an opposing cliff, with
this deep chasm between.

<span id="008">**Selah**</span> A word frequently found in the Book of
Psalms, and also in [Hab 3:9](../kjv/hab003.htm#009.md), [Hab
3:13](../kjv/hab003.htm#013.md), about seventy-four times in all in
Scripture. Its meaning is doubtful. Some interpret it as meaning
"silence" or "pause;" others, "end," "a louder strain," "piano," etc.
The LXX. render the word by daplasma i.e., "a division."

<span id="009">**Seleucia**</span> The sea-port of Antioch, near the
mouth of the Orontes. Paul and his companions sailed from this port on
their first missionary journey ([Act 13:4](../kjv/act013.htm#004).md). This
city was built by Seleucus Nicator, the "king of Syria." It is said of
him that "few princes have ever lived with so great a passion for the
building of cities. He is reputed to have built in all nine Seleucias,
sixteen Antiochs, and six Laodiceas." Seleucia became a city of great
importance, and was made a "free city" by Pompey. It is now a small
village, called el-Kalusi.
