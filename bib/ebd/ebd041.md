<span id="000">**Babel, Tower of**</span> The name given to the tower
which the primitive fathers of our race built in the land of Shinar
after the Deluge ([Gen 11:1](../kjv/gen011.htm#001).md). Their object in
building this tower was probably that it might be seen as a
rallying-point in the extensive plain of Shinar, to which they had
emigrated from the uplands of Armenia, and so prevent their being
scattered abroad. But God interposed and defeated their design by
confounding their language, and hence the name Babel, meaning
"confusion." In the Babylonian tablets there is an account of this
event, and also of the creation and the deluge. (See CHALDEA.) The
Temple of Belus, which is supposed to occupy its site, is described by
the Greek historian Herodotus as a temple of great extent and
magnificence, erected by the Babylonians for their god Belus. The
treasures Nebuchadnezzar brought from Jerusalem were laid up in this
temple ([Ch2 36:7](../kjv/ch2036.htm#007).md). The Birs Nimrud, at ancient
Borsippa, about 7 miles south-west of Hillah, the modern town which
occupies a part of the site of ancient Babylon, and 6 miles from the
Euphrates, is an immense mass of broken and fire-blasted fragments, of
about 2,300 feet in circumference, rising suddenly to the height of 235
feet above the desert-plain, and is with probability regarded as the
ruins of the tower of Babel. This is "one of the most imposing ruins in
the country." Others think it to be the ruins of the Temple of Belus.

<span id="001">**Babylon**</span> The Greek form of BABEL; Semitic form
Babilu, meaning "The Gate of God." In the Assyrian tablets it means "The
city of the dispersion of the tribes." The monumental list of its kings
reaches back to 2300 B.C., and includes Khammu-rabi, or Amraphel(q.v.),
the contemporary of Abraham. See map, of Babylonia It stood on the
Euphrates, about 200 miles above its junction with the Tigris, which
flowed through its midst and divided it into two almost equal parts. The
Elamites invaded Chaldea (i.e., Lower Mesopotamia, or Shinar, and Upper
Mesopotamia, or Accad, now combined into one) and held it in subjection.
At length Khammu-rabi delivered it from the foreign yoke, and founded
the new empire of Chaldea (q.v.), making Babylon the capital of the
united kingdom. This city gradually grew in extent and grandeur, but in
process of time it became subject to Assyria. On the fall of Nineveh
(606 B.C.) it threw off the Assyrian yoke, and became the capital of the
growing Babylonian empire. Under Nebuchadnezzar it became one of the
most splendid cities of the ancient world. After passing through various
vicissitudes the city was occupied by Cyrus, "king of Elam," 538 B.C.,
who issued a decree permitting the Jews to return to their own land
([Ezr 1:1](../kjv/ezr001.htm#001).md). It then ceased to be the capital of
an empire. It was again and again visited by hostile armies, till its
inhabitants were all driven from their homes, and the city became a
complete desolation, its very site being forgotten from among men. On
the west bank of the Euphrates, about 50 miles south of Bagdad, there is
found a series of artificial mounds of vast extent. These are the ruins
of this once famous proud city. These ruins are principally (1.) the
great mound called Babil by the Arabs. This was probably the noted
Temple of Belus, which was a pyramid about 480 feet high. (2.) The Kasr
(i.e., "the palace"). This was the great palace of Nebuchadnezzar. It is
almost a square, each side of which is about 700 feet long. The little
town of Hillah, near the site of Babylon, is built almost wholly of
bricks taken from this single mound. (3.) A lofty mound, on the summit
of which stands a modern tomb called Amran ibn-Ali. This is probably the
most ancient portion of the remains of the city, and represents the
ruins of the famous hanging-gardens, or perhaps of some royal palace.
The utter desolation of the city once called "The glory of kingdoms"
([Isa 13:19](../kjv/isa013.htm#019).md) was foretold by the prophets (Isa.
13:4-22; [Jer 25:12](../kjv/jer025.htm#012.md); [Jer
50:2](../kjv/jer050.htm#002), [Jer 50:3](../kjv/jer050.htm#003.md); [Dan
2:31](../kjv/dan002.htm#031).md). The Babylon mentioned in [Pe1
5:13](../kjv/pe1005.htm#013.md) was not Rome, as some have thought, but the
literal city of Babylon, which was inhabited by many Jews at the time
Peter wrote. In [Rev 14:8](../kjv/rev014.htm#008.md); [Rev
16:19](../kjv/rev016.htm#019); [Rev 17:5](../kjv/rev017.htm#005.md); [Rev
18:2](../kjv/rev018.htm#002.md), "Babylon" is supposed to mean Rome, not
considered as pagan, but as the prolongation of the ancient power in the
papal form. Rome, pagan and papal, is regarded as one power. "The
literal Babylon was the beginner and supporter of tyranny and
idolatry... This city and its whole empire were taken by the Persians
under Cyrus; the Persians were subdued by the Macedonians, and the
Macedonians by the Romans; so that Rome succeeded to the power of old
Babylon. And it was her method to adopt the worship of the false deities
she had conquered; so that by her own act she became the heiress and
successor of all the Babylonian idolatry, and of all that was introduced
into it by the immediate successors of Babylon, and consequently of all
the idolatry of the earth." Rome, or "mystical Babylon," is "that great
city which reigneth over the kings of the earth" ([Rev
17:18](../kjv/rev017.htm#018).md).

<span id="002">**Babylon, Kingdom of**</span> Called "the land of the
Chaldeans" ([Jer 24:5](../kjv/jer024.htm#005.md); Ezek, [Eze
12:13](../kjv/eze012.htm#013).md), was an extensive province in Central
Asia along the valley of the Tigris from the Persian Gulf northward for
some 300 miles. It was famed for its fertility and its riches. Its
capital was the city of Babylon, a great commercial centre ([Eze
17:4](../kjv/eze017.htm#004); [Isa 43:14](../kjv/isa043.htm#014).md).
Babylonia was divided into the two districts of Accad in the north, and
Summer (probably the Shinar of the Old Testament) in the south. Among
its chief cities may be mentioned Ur (now Mugheir or Mugayyar), on the
western bank of the Euphrates; Uruk, or Erech ([Gen
10:10](../kjv/gen010.htm#010)) (now Warka.md), between Ur and Babylon;
Larsa (now Senkereh), the Ellasar of [Gen 14:1](../kjv/gen014.htm#001.md),
a little to the east of Erech; Nipur (now Niffer), south-east of
Babylon; Sepharvaim ([Kg2 17:24](../kjv/kg2017.htm#024).md), "the two
Sipparas" (now Abu-Habba), considerably to the north of Babylon; and
Eridu, "the good city" (now Abu-Shahrein), which lay originally on the
shore of the Persian Gulf, but is now, owing to the silting up of the
sand, about 100 miles distant from it. Another city was Kulunu, or
Calneh ([Gen 10:10](../kjv/gen010.htm#010).md). The salt-marshes at the
mouths of the Euphrates and Tigris were called Marratu, "the bitter" or
"salt", the Merathaim of [Jer 50:21](../kjv/jer050.htm#021.md). They were
the original home of the Kalda, or Chaldeans. The most famous of the
early kings of Babylonia were Sargon of Accad (B.C.3800) and his son,
Naram-Sin, who conquered a large part of Western Asia, establishing
their power in Palestine, and even carrying their arms to the Sinaitic
peninsula. A great Babylonian library was founded in the reign of
Sargon. Babylonia was subsequently again broken up into more than one
state, and at one time fell under the domination of Elam. This was put
an end to by Khammu-rabi (Amraphel), who drove the Elamites out of the
country, and over-came Arioch, the son of an Elamite prince. From this
time forward Babylonia was a united monarchy. About B.C.1750 it was
conquered by the Kassi, or Kosseans, from the mountains of Elam, and a
Kassite dynasty ruled over it for 576 years and 9 months. In the time of
Khammu-rabi, Syria and Palestine were subject to Babylonia and its
Elamite suzerain; and after the overthrow of the Elamite supremacy, the
Babylonian kings continued to exercise their influence and power in what
was called "the land of the Amorites." In the epoch of the Kassite
dynasty, however, Canaan passed into the hands of Egypt. In 729 B.C.,
Babylonia was conquered by the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III.; but
on the death of Shalmaneser IV. it was seized by the Kalda or "Chaldean"
prince Merodach-baladan ([Kg2 20:12](../kjv/kg2020.htm#012).md), who held
it till 709 B.C., when he was driven out by Sargon. Under Sennacherib,
Babylonia revolted from Assyria several times, with the help of the
Elamites, and after one of these revolts Babylon was destroyed by
Sennacherib, 689 B.C.. It was rebuilt by Esarhaddon, who made it his
residence during part of the year, and it was to Babylon that Manasseh
was brought a prisoner ([Ch2 33:11](../kjv/ch2033.htm#011).md). After the
death of Esarhaddon, Saul-sum yukin, the viceroy of Babylonia, revolted
against his brother the Assyrian king, and the revolt was suppressed
with difficulty. When Nineveh was destroyed, 606 B.C., Nabopolassar, the
viceroy of Babylonia, who seems to have been of Chaldean descent, made
himself independent. His son Nebuchadrezzar (Nabu-kudur-uzur), after
defeating the Egyptians at Carchemish, succeeded him as king, 604 B.C.,
and founded the Babylonian empire. He strongly fortified Babylon, and
adorned it with palaces and other buildings. His son, Evil-merodach, who
succeeded him in 561 B.C., was murdered after a reign of two years. The
last monarch of the Babylonian empire was Nabonidus (Nabu-nahid),
B.C.555-538, whose eldest son, Belshazzar (Bilu-sar-uzur), is mentioned
in several inscriptions. Babylon was captured by Cyrus, 538 B.C., and
though it revolted more than once in later years, it never succeeded in
maintaining its independence.

<span id="003">**Babylonish Garment**</span> A robe of rich colours
fabricated at Babylon, and hence of great value ([Jos
7:21](../kjv/jos007.htm#021).md).

<span id="004">**Baca, Valley of**</span> ([Psa
84:6](../kjv/psa084.htm#006.md); R.V., "valley of weeping," marg., "or
balsam trees"), probably a valley in some part of Palestine, or
generally some one of the valleys through which pilgrims had to pass on
their way to the sanctuary of Jehovah on Zion; or it may be figuratively
"a valley of weeping."

<span id="005">**Backbite**</span> In [Psa 15:3](../kjv/psa015.htm#003.md),
the rendering of a word which means to run about tattling, calumniating;
in [Pro 25:23](../kjv/pro025.htm#023.md), secret tale bearing or
slandering; in [Rom 1:30](../kjv/rom001.htm#030.md) and [Co2
12:20](../kjv/co2012.htm#020.md), evil-speaking, maliciously defaming the
absent.

<span id="006">**Backslide**</span> To draw back or apostatize in
matters of religion ([Act 21:21](../kjv/act021.htm#021.md); [Th2
2:3](../kjv/th2002.htm#003); [Ti1 4:1](../kjv/ti1004.htm#001).md). This may
be either partial ([Pro 14:14](../kjv/pro014.htm#014).md) or complete ([Heb
6:4](../kjv/heb006.htm#004); [Heb 10:38](../kjv/heb010.htm#038.md), [Heb
10:39](../kjv/heb010.htm#039).md). The apostasy may be both doctrinal and
moral.

<span id="007">**Badger**</span> This word is found in [Exo
25:5](../kjv/exo025.htm#005); [Exo 26:14](../kjv/exo026.htm#014.md); [Exo
35:7](../kjv/exo035.htm#007), [Exo 35:23](../kjv/exo035.htm#023.md); [Exo
36:19](../kjv/exo036.htm#019); [Exo 39:34](../kjv/exo039.htm#034.md); [Num
4:6](../kjv/num004.htm#006.md), etc. The tabernacle was covered with
badgers' skins; the shoes of women were also made of them ([Eze
16:10](../kjv/eze016.htm#010).md). Our translators seem to have been misled
by the similarity in sound of the Hebrew tachash and the Latin taxus ,
"a badger." The revisers have correctly substituted "seal skins." The
Arabs of the Sinaitic peninsula apply the name tucash to the seals and
dugongs which are common in the Red Sea, and the skins of which are
largely used as leather and for sandals. Though the badger is common in
Palestine, and might occur in the wilderness, its small hide would have
been useless as a tent covering. The dugong, very plentiful in the
shallow waters on the shores of the Red Sea, is a marine animal from 12
to 30 feet long, something between a whale and a seal, never leaving the
water, but very easily caught. It grazes on seaweed, and is known by
naturalists as Halicore tabernaculi.

<span id="008">**Bag**</span> (1.) A pocket of a cone-like shape in
which Naaman bound two pieces of silver for Gehazi ([Kg2
5:23](../kjv/kg2005.htm#023).md). The same Hebrew word occurs elsewhere
only in [Isa 3:22](../kjv/isa003.htm#022.md), where it is rendered
"crisping-pins," but denotes the reticules (or as R.V., "satchels")
carried by Hebrew women. (2.) Another word (kees) so rendered means a
bag for carrying weights ([Deu 25:13](../kjv/deu025.htm#013.md); [Pro
16:11](../kjv/pro016.htm#011); [Mic 6:11](../kjv/mic006.htm#011).md). It
also denotes a purse ([Pro 1:14](../kjv/pro001.htm#014).md) and a cup ([Pro
23:31](../kjv/pro023.htm#031)). (3..md) Another word rendered "bag" in [Sa1
17:40](../kjv/sa1017.htm#040.md) is rendered "sack" in [Gen
42:25](../kjv/gen042.htm#025); and in [Sa1 9:7](../kjv/sa1009.htm#007.md);
[Sa1 21:5](../kjv/sa1021.htm#005.md) "vessel," or wallet for carrying food.
(4.) The word rendered in the Authorized Version "bags," in which the
priests bound up the money contributed for the restoration of the temple
([Kg2 12:10](../kjv/kg2012.htm#010).md), is also rendered "bundle" ([Gen
42:35](../kjv/gen042.htm#035); [Sa1 25:29](../kjv/sa1025.htm#029).md). It
denotes bags used by travelers for carrying money during a journey ([Pro
7:20](../kjv/pro007.htm#020); [Hag 1:6](../kjv/hag001.htm#006)). (5..md)
The "bag" of Judas was a small box ([Joh 12:6](../kjv/joh012.htm#006.md);
[Joh 13:29](../kjv/joh013.htm#029).md).

<span id="009">**Bahurim**</span> Young men, a place east of Jerusalem
([Sa2 3:16](../kjv/sa2003.htm#016); [Sa2 19:16](../kjv/sa2019.htm#016).md),
on the road to the Jordan valley. Here Shimei resided, who poured forth
vile abuse against David, and flung dust and stones at him and his party
when they were making their way down the eastern slopes of Olivet toward
Jordan ([Sa2 16:5](../kjv/sa2016.htm#005).md); and here Jonathan and
Ahimaaz hid themselves ([Sa2 17:18](../kjv/sa2017.htm#018).md). With the
exception of Shimei, Azmaveth, one of David's heroes, is the only other
native of the place who is mentioned ([Sa2
23:31](../kjv/sa2023.htm#031); [Ch1 11:33](../kjv/ch1011.htm#033).md).
