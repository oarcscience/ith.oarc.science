<span id="000">**Asp**</span> (Heb. pethen ), [Deu
32:33](../kjv/deu032.htm#033); [Job 20:14](../kjv/job020.htm#014), [Job
20:16](../kjv/job020.htm#016); [Isa 11:8](../kjv/isa011.htm#008). It was
probably the Egyptian cobra (Naja haje), which was very poisonous ([Rom
3:13](../kjv/rom003.htm#013); Gr. aspis ). The Egyptians worshipped it
as the uraeus, and it was found in the desert and in the fields. The
peace and security of Messiah's reign is represented by the figure of a
child playing on the hole of the asp. (See ADDER.)

<span id="001">**Ass**</span> Frequently mentioned throughout Scripture.
Of the domesticated species we read of, (1.) The she ass (Heb. 'athon ),
so named from its slowness ([Gen 12:16](../kjv/gen012.htm#016); [Gen
45:23](../kjv/gen045.htm#023); [Num 22:23](../kjv/num022.htm#023); [Sa1
9:3](../kjv/sa1009.htm#003)). (2.) The male ass (Heb. hamor ), the
common working ass of Western Asia, so called from its red colour.
Issachar is compared to a strong ass ([Gen
49:14](../kjv/gen049.htm#014)). It was forbidden to yoke together an ass
and an ox in the plough ([Deu 22:10](../kjv/deu022.htm#010)). (3.) The
ass's colt (Heb. 'air ), mentioned [Jdg 10:4](../kjv/jdg010.htm#004);
[Jdg 12:14](../kjv/jdg012.htm#014). It is rendered "foal" in [Gen
32:15](../kjv/gen032.htm#015); [Gen 49:11](../kjv/gen049.htm#011).
(Compare [Job 11:12](../kjv/job011.htm#012); [Isa
30:6](../kjv/isa030.htm#006).) The ass is an unclean animal, because it
does not chew the cud ([Lev 11:26](../kjv/lev011.htm#026). Compare [Kg2
6:25](../kjv/kg2006.htm#025)). Asses constituted a considerable portion
of wealth in ancient times ([Gen 12:16](../kjv/gen012.htm#016); [Gen
30:43](../kjv/gen030.htm#043); [Ch1 27:30](../kjv/ch1027.htm#030); [Job
1:3](../kjv/job001.htm#003); [Job 42:12](../kjv/job042.htm#012)). They
were noted for their spirit and their attachment to their master ([Isa
1:3](../kjv/isa001.htm#003)). They are frequently spoken of as having
been ridden upon, as by Abraham ([Gen 22:3](../kjv/gen022.htm#003)),
Balaam ([Num 22:21](../kjv/num022.htm#021)), the disobedient prophet
([Kg1 13:23](../kjv/kg1013.htm#023)), the family of Abdon the judge,
seventy in number ([Jdg 12:14](../kjv/jdg012.htm#014)), Zipporah ([Exo
4:20](../kjv/exo004.htm#020)), the Shunammite ([Sa1
25:30](../kjv/sa1025.htm#030)), etc. Zechariah ([Zac
9:9](../kjv/zac009.htm#009)) predicted our Lord's triumphal entrance
into Jerusalem, "riding upon an ass, and upon a colt," etc. ([Mat
21:5](../kjv/mat021.htm#005), R.V.). Of wild asses two species are
noticed, (1.) that called in Hebrew 'arod , mentioned [Job
39:5](../kjv/job039.htm#005) and [Dan 5:21](../kjv/dan005.htm#021),
noted for its swiftness; and (2.) that called pe're , the wild ass of
Asia ([Job 39:6](../kjv/job039.htm#006); [Job
6:5](../kjv/job006.htm#005); [Job 11:12](../kjv/job011.htm#012); [Isa
32:14](../kjv/isa032.htm#014); [Jer 2:24](../kjv/jer002.htm#024); [Jer
14:6](../kjv/jer014.htm#006), etc.). The wild ass was distinguished for
its fleetness and its extreme shyness. In allusion to his mode of life,
Ishmael is likened to a wild ass ([Gen 16:12](../kjv/gen016.htm#012).
Here the word is simply rendered "wild" in the Authorized Version, but
in the Revised Version, "wild-ass among men").

<span id="002">**Asshur**</span> Second son of Shem ([Gen
10:22](../kjv/gen010.htm#022); [Ch1 1:17](../kjv/ch1001.htm#017)). He
went from the land of Shinar and built Nineveh, etc. ([Gen
10:11](../kjv/gen010.htm#011), [Gen 10:12](../kjv/gen010.htm#012)). He
probably gave his name to Assyria, which is the usual translation of the
word, although the form Asshur is sometimes retained ([Num
24:22](../kjv/num024.htm#022), [Num 24:24](../kjv/num024.htm#024); [Eze
27:23](../kjv/eze027.htm#023), etc.). In [Gen
2:14](../kjv/gen002.htm#014) "Assyria" ought to be "Asshur," which was
the original capital of Assyria, a city represented by the mounds of
Kalah Sherghat, on the west bank of the Tigris. This city was founded by
Bel-kap-kapu about 1700 B.C.. At a later date the capital was shifted to
Ninua, or Nineveh, now Koyunjik, on the eastern bank of the river. (See
CALAH; NINEVEH.)

<span id="003">**Assos**</span> A sea-port town of Proconsular Asia, in
the district of Mysia, on the north shore of the Gulf of Adramyttium.
Paul came hither on foot along the Roman road from Troas ([Act
20:13](../kjv/act020.htm#013), [Act 20:14](../kjv/act020.htm#014)), a
distance of 20 miles. It was about 30 miles distant from Troas by sea.
The island of Lesbos lay opposite it, about 7 miles distant.

<span id="004">**Assurance**</span> The resurrection of Jesus ([Act
17:31](../kjv/act017.htm#031)) is the "assurance" (Gr. pistis ,
generally rendered "faith") or pledge God has given that his revelation
is true and worthy of acceptance. The "full assurance \[Gr. plerophoria
, 'full bearing'\] of faith" ([Heb 10:22](../kjv/heb010.htm#022)) is a
fulness of faith in God which leaves no room for doubt. The "full
assurance of understanding" ([Col 2:2](../kjv/col002.htm#002)) is an
entire unwavering conviction of the truth of the declarations of
Scripture, a joyful steadfastness on the part of any one of conviction
that he has grasped the very truth. The "full assurance of hope" ([Heb
6:11](../kjv/heb006.htm#011)) is a sure and well-grounded expectation of
eternal glory ([Ti2 4:7](../kjv/ti2004.htm#007), [Ti2
4:8](../kjv/ti2004.htm#008)). This assurance of hope is the assurance of
a man's own particular salvation. This infallible assurance, which
believers may attain unto as to their own personal salvation, is founded
on the truth of the promises ([Heb 6:18](../kjv/heb006.htm#018)), on the
inward evidence of Christian graces, and on the testimony of the Spirit
of adoption ([Rom 8:16](../kjv/rom008.htm#016)). That such a certainty
may be attained appears from the testimony of Scripture ([Rom
8:16](../kjv/rom008.htm#016); [Jo1 2:3](../kjv/jo1002.htm#003); [Jo1
3:14](../kjv/jo1003.htm#014)), from the command to seek after it ([Heb
6:11](../kjv/heb006.htm#011); [Pe2 1:10](../kjv/pe2001.htm#010)), and
from the fact that it has been attained ([Ti2
1:12](../kjv/ti2001.htm#012); [Ti2 4:7](../kjv/ti2004.htm#007), [Ti2
4:8](../kjv/ti2004.htm#008); [Jo1 2:3](../kjv/jo1002.htm#003); [Jo1
4:16](../kjv/jo1004.htm#016)). This full assurance is not of the essence
of saving faith. It is the result of faith, and posterior to it in the
order of nature, and so frequently also in the order of time. True
believers may be destitute of it. Trust itself is something different
from the evidence that we do trust. Believers, moreover, are exhorted to
go on to something beyond what they at present have when they are
exhorted to seek the grace of full assurance ([Heb
10:22](../kjv/heb010.htm#022); [Pe2 1:5](../kjv/pe2001.htm#005)). The
attainment of this grace is a duty, and is to be diligently sought.
"Genuine assurance naturally leads to a legitimate and abiding peace and
joy, and to love and thankfulness to God; and these from the very laws
of our being to greater buoyancy, strength, and cheerfulness in the
practice of obedience in every department of duty." This assurance may
in various ways be shaken, diminished, and intermitted, but the
principle out of which it springs can never be lost. (See FAITH.)

<span id="005">**Assyria**</span> The name derived from the city Asshur
on the Tigris, the original capital of the country, was originally a
colony from Babylonia, and was ruled by viceroys from that kingdom. It
was a mountainous region lying to the north of Babylonia, extending
along the Tigris as far as to the high mountain range of Armenia, the
Gordiaean or Carduchian mountains. It was founded in 1700 B.C. under
Bel-kap-kapu, and became an independent and a conquering power, and
shook off the yoke of its Babylonian masters. It subdued the whole of
Northern Asia. The Assyrians were Semites ([Gen
10:22](../kjv/gen010.htm#022)), but in process of time non-Semite tribes
mingled with the inhabitants. They were a military people, the "Romans
of the East." See map, of Assyria Of the early history of the kingdom of
Assyria little is positively known. In 1120 B.C. Tiglath-pileser I., the
greatest of the Assyrian kings, "crossed the Euphrates, defeated the
kings of the Hittites, captured the city of Carchemish, and advanced as
far as the shores of the Mediterranean." He may be regarded as the
founder of the first Assyrian empire. After this the Assyrians gradually
extended their power, subjugating the states of Northern Syria. In the
reign of Ahab, king of Israel, Shalmaneser II. marched an army against
the Syrian states, whose allied army he encountered and vanquished at
Karkar. This led to Ahab's casting off the yoke of Damascus and allying
himself with Judah. Some years after this the Assyrian king marched an
army against Hazael, king of Damascus. He besieged and took that city.
He also brought under tribute Jehu, and the cities of Tyre and Sidon.
About a hundred years after this (745 B.C. the crown was seized by a
military adventurer called Pul, who assumed the name of Tiglath-pileser
III. He directed his armies into Syria, which had by this time regained
its independence, and took (740 B.C.) Arpad, near Aleppo, after a siege
of three years, and reduced Hamath. Azariah (Uzziah) was an ally of the
king of Hamath, and thus was compelled by Tiglath-pileser to do him
homage and pay a yearly tribute. In 738 B.C., in the reign of Menahem,
king of Israel, Pul invaded Israel, and imposed on it a heavy tribute
([Kg2 15:19](../kjv/kg2015.htm#019)). Ahaz, the king of Judah, when
engaged in a war against Israel and Syria, appealed for help to this
Assyrian king by means of a present of gold and silver ([Kg2
16:8](../kjv/kg2016.htm#008)); who accordingly "marched against
Damascus, defeated and put Rezin to death, and besieged the city
itself." Leaving a portion of his army to continue the siege, "he
advanced through the province east of Jordan, spreading fire and sword,"
and became master of Philistia, and took Samaria and Damascus. He died
727 B.C., and was succeeded by Shalmanezer IV., who ruled till 722 B.C..
He also invaded Syria ([Kg2 17:5](../kjv/kg2017.htm#005)), but was
deposed in favour of Sargon (q.v.) the Tartan, or commander-in-chief of
the army, who took Samaria (q.v.) after a siege of three years, and so
put an end to the kingdom of Israel, carrying the people away into
captivity, 722 B.C. ([Kg2 17:1](../kjv/kg2017.htm#001), [Kg2
17:24](../kjv/kg2017.htm#024); [Kg2 18:7](../kjv/kg2018.htm#007), [Kg2
18:9](../kjv/kg2018.htm#009)). He also overran the land of Judah, and
took the city of Jerusalem ([Isa 10:6](../kjv/isa010.htm#006), [Isa
10:12](../kjv/isa010.htm#012), [Isa 10:22](../kjv/isa010.htm#022), [Isa
10:24](../kjv/isa010.htm#024), [Isa 10:34](../kjv/isa010.htm#034)).
Mention is next made of Sennacherib (705 B.C.), the son and successor of
Sargon ([Kg2 18:13](../kjv/kg2018.htm#013); [Kg2
19:37](../kjv/kg2019.htm#037); [Isa 7:17](../kjv/isa007.htm#017), [Isa
7:18](../kjv/isa007.htm#018)); and then of Esar-haddon, his son and
successor, who took Manasseh, king of Judah, captive, and kept him for
some time a prisoner at Babylon, which he alone of all the Assyrian
kings made the seat of his government ([Kg2
19:37](../kjv/kg2019.htm#037); [Isa 37:38](../kjv/isa037.htm#038)).
Assur-bani-pal, the son of Esarhaddon, became king, and in [Ezr
4:10](../kjv/ezr004.htm#010) is referred to as Asnapper. From an early
period Assyria had entered on a conquering career, and having absorbed
Babylon, the kingdoms of Hamath, Damascus, and Samaria, it conquered
Phoenicia, and made Judea feudatory, and subjected Philistia and Idumea.
At length, however, its power declined. In 727 B.C. the Babylonians
threw off the rule of the Assyrians, under the leadership of the
powerful Chaldean prince Merodach-baladan ([Kg2
20:12](../kjv/kg2020.htm#012)), who, after twelve years, was subdued by
Sargon, who now reunited the kingdom, and ruled over a vast empire. But
on his death the smouldering flames of rebellion again burst forth, and
the Babylonians and Medes successfully asserted their independence (625
B.C.), and Assyria fell according to the prophecies of Isaiah ([Isa
10:5](../kjv/isa010.htm#005)), Nahum ([Nah
3:19](../kjv/nah003.htm#019)), and Zephaniah ([Zep
3:13](../kjv/zep003.htm#013)), and the many separate kingdoms of which
it was composed ceased to recognize the "great king" ([Kg2
18:19](../kjv/kg2018.htm#019); [Isa 36:4](../kjv/isa036.htm#004)).
Ezekiel (Ezek. 31) attests (about 586 B.C.) how completely Assyria was
overthrown. NINEVEH, BABYLON.)

<span id="006">**Astrologer**</span> ([Dan 1:20](../kjv/dan001.htm#020);
[Dan 2:2](../kjv/dan002.htm#002), [Dan 2:10](../kjv/dan002.htm#010),
[Dan 2:27](../kjv/dan002.htm#027), etc.) Heb. 'ashshaph' , an enchanter,
one who professes to divine future events by the appearance of the
stars. This science flourished among the Chaldeans. It was positively
forbidden to the Jews ([Deu 4:19](../kjv/deu004.htm#019); [Deu
18:10](../kjv/deu018.htm#010); [Isa 47:13](../kjv/isa047.htm#013)).

<span id="007">**Astronomy**</span> The Hebrews were devout students of
the wonders of the starry firmament ([Amo 5:8](../kjv/amo005.htm#008);
[Psa 19:1](../kjv/psa019.htm#001)). In the Book of Job, which is the
oldest book of the Bible in all probability, the constellations are
distinguished and named. Mention is made of the "morning star" ([Rev
2:28](../kjv/rev002.htm#028); compare [Isa
14:12](../kjv/isa014.htm#012)), the "seven stars" and "Pleiades,"
"Orion," "Arcturus," the "Great Bear" ([Amo 5:8](../kjv/amo005.htm#008);
[Job 9:9](../kjv/job009.htm#009); [Job 38:31](../kjv/job038.htm#031)),
"the crooked serpent," Draco ([Job 26:13](../kjv/job026.htm#013)), the
Dioscuri, or Gemini, "Castor and Pollux" ([Act
28:11](../kjv/act028.htm#011)). The stars were called "the host of
heaven" ([Isa 40:26](../kjv/isa040.htm#026); [Jer
33:22](../kjv/jer033.htm#022)). The oldest divisions of time were mainly
based on the observation of the movements of the heavenly bodies, the
"ordinances of heaven" ([Gen 1:14](../kjv/gen001.htm#014); [Job
38:33](../kjv/job038.htm#033); [Jer 31:35](../kjv/jer031.htm#035); [Jer
33:25](../kjv/jer033.htm#025)). Such observations led to the division of
the year into months and the mapping out of the appearances of the stars
into twelve portions, which received from into twelve portions, which
received from the Greeks the name of the "zodiac." The word "Mazzaroth"
([Job 38:32](../kjv/job038.htm#032)) means, as the margin notes, "the
twelve signs" of the zodiac. Astronomical observations were also
necessary among the Jews in order to the fixing of the proper time for
sacred ceremonies, the "new moons," the "passover," etc. Many allusions
are found to the display of God's wisdom and power as seen in the starry
heavens ([Psa 8:1](../kjv/psa008.htm#001); [Psa
19:1](../kjv/psa019.htm#001); [Isa 51:6](../kjv/isa051.htm#006), etc.)

<span id="008">**Asuppim**</span> ([Ch1 26:15](../kjv/ch1026.htm#015),
[Ch1 26:17](../kjv/ch1026.htm#017), Authorized Version; but in Revised
Version, "storehouse"), properly the house of stores for the priests. In
[Neh 12:25](../kjv/neh012.htm#025) the Authorized Version has
"thresholds," marg. "treasuries" or "assemblies;" Revised Version,
"storehouses."

<span id="009">**Atad**</span> Buckthorn, a place where Joseph and his
brethren, when on their way from Egypt to Hebron with the remains of
their father Jacob, made for seven days a "great and very sore
lamentation." On this account the Canaanites called it "Abel-mizraim"
([Gen 50:10](../kjv/gen050.htm#010), [Gen
50:11](../kjv/gen050.htm#011)). It was probably near Hebron. The word is
rendered "bramble" in [Jdg 9:14](../kjv/jdg009.htm#014), [Jdg
9:15](../kjv/jdg009.htm#015), and "thorns" in [Psa
58:9](../kjv/psa058.htm#009).
