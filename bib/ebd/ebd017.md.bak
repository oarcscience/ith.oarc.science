<span id="000">**Alexander the Great**</span> The king of Macedonia, the
great conqueror; probably represented in Daniel by the "belly of brass"
([Dan 2:32](../kjv/dan002.htm#032).md), and the leopard and the he-goat
([Dan 7:6](../kjv/dan007.htm#006); [Dan 11:3](../kjv/dan011.htm#003.md),
[Dan 11:4](../kjv/dan011.htm#004).md). He succeeded his father Philip, and
died at the age of thirty-two from the effects of intemperance, 323
B.C.. His empire was divided among his four generals.

<span id="001">**Alexandria**</span> The ancient metropolis of Lower
Egypt, so called from its founder, Alexander the Great (about 333 B.C.).
It was for a long period the greatest of existing cities, for both
Nineveh and Babylon had been destroyed, and Rome had not yet risen to
greatness. It was the residence of the kings of Egypt for 200 years. It
is not mentioned in the Old Testament, and only incidentally in the New.
Apollos, eloquent and mighty in the Scriptures, was a native of this
city ([Act 18:24](../kjv/act018.htm#024).md). See Map, Ancient Alexandria.
Many Jews from Alexandria were in Jerusalem, where they had a synagogue
([Act 6:9](../kjv/act006.htm#009).md), at the time of Stephen's martyrdom.
At one time it is said that as many as 10,000 Jews resided in this city.
It possessed a famous library of 700,000 volumes, which was burned by
the Saracens (A.D. 642). It was here that the Hebrew Bible was
translated into Greek. This is called the Septuagint version, from the
tradition that seventy learned men were engaged in executing it. It was,
however, not all translated at one time. It was begun 280 B.C., and
finished about 200 or 150 B.C.. (See VERSION.)

<span id="002">**Algum**</span> ([Ch2 2:8](../kjv/ch2002.htm#008.md); [Ch2
9:10](../kjv/ch2009.htm#010), [Ch2 9:11](../kjv/ch2009.htm#011).md), the
same as almug ([Kg1 10:11](../kjv/kg1010.htm#011).md).

<span id="003">**Alien**</span> A foreigner, or person born in another
country, and therefore not entitled to the rights and privileges of the
country where he resides. Among the Hebrews there were two classes of
aliens. (1.) Those who were strangers generally, and who owned no landed
property. (2.) Strangers dwelling in another country without being
naturalized ([Lev 22:10](../kjv/lev022.htm#010.md); [Psa
39:12](../kjv/psa039.htm#012).md). Both of these classes were to enjoy,
under certain conditions, the same rights as other citizens ([Lev
19:33](../kjv/lev019.htm#033), [Lev 19:34](../kjv/lev019.htm#034.md); [Deu
10:19](../kjv/deu010.htm#019).md). They might be naturalized and permitted
to enter into the congregation of the Lord by submitting to circumcision
and abandoning idolatry ([Deu 23:3](../kjv/deu023.htm#003).md). This term
is used ([Eph 2:12](../kjv/eph002.htm#012).md) to denote persons who have
no interest in Christ.

<span id="004">**Allegory**</span> Used only in [Gal
4:24](../kjv/gal004.htm#024.md), where the apostle refers to the history of
Isaac the free-born, and Ishmael the slave-born, and makes use of it
allegorically. Every parable is an allegory. Nathan ([Sa2
12:1](../kjv/sa2012.htm#001).md) addresses David in an allegorical
narrative. In the eightieth Psalm there is a beautiful allegory: "Thou
broughtest a vine out of Egypt," etc. In [Ecc
12:2](../kjv/ecc012.htm#002.md), there is a striking allegorical
description of old age.

<span id="005">**Alleluia**</span> The Greek form ([Rev
19:1](../kjv/rev019.htm#001), [Rev 19:3](../kjv/rev019.htm#003.md), [Rev
19:4](../kjv/rev019.htm#004), [Rev 19:6](../kjv/rev019.htm#006).md) of the
Hebrew Hallelujah = Praise ye Jehovah, which begins or ends several of
the psalms (Ps. 106, [Psa 111:1](../kjv/psa111.htm#001.md), [Psa
112:1](../kjv/psa112.htm#001), [Psa 113:1](../kjv/psa113.htm#001.md),
etc.).

<span id="006">**Alliance**</span> A treaty between nations, or between
individuals, for their mutual advantage. Abraham formed an alliance with
some of the Canaanitish princes ([Gen 14:13](../kjv/gen014.htm#013).md),
also with Abimelech ([Gen 21:22](../kjv/gen021.htm#022).md). Joshua and the
elders of Israel entered into an alliance with the Gibeonites (Josh.
9:3-27). When the Israelites entered Palestine they were forbidden to
enter into alliances with the inhabitants of the country ([Lev
18:3](../kjv/lev018.htm#003), [Lev 18:4](../kjv/lev018.htm#004.md); [Lev
20:22](../kjv/lev020.htm#022), [Lev 20:23](../kjv/lev020.htm#023).md).
Solomon formed a league with Hiram ([Kg1 5:12](../kjv/kg1005.htm#012).md).
This "brotherly covenant" is referred to 250 years afterwards ([Amo
1:9](../kjv/amo001.htm#009).md). He also appears to have entered into an
alliance with Pharaoh ([Kg1 10:28](../kjv/kg1010.htm#028.md), [Kg1
10:29](../kjv/kg1010.htm#029).md). In the subsequent history of the
kingdoms of Judah and Israel various alliances were formed between them
and also with neighboring nations at different times. From patriarchal
times a covenant of alliance was sealed by the blood of some sacrificial
victim. The animal sacrificed was cut in two (except birds), and between
these two parts the persons contracting the alliance passed ([Gen
15:10](../kjv/gen015.htm#010).md). There are frequent allusions to this
practice ([Jer 34:18](../kjv/jer034.htm#018).md). Such alliances were
called "covenants of salt" ([Num 18:19](../kjv/num018.htm#019.md); [Ch2
13:5](../kjv/ch2013.htm#005).md), salt being the symbol of perpetuity. A
pillar was set up as a memorial of the alliance between Laban and Jacob
([Gen 31:52](../kjv/gen031.htm#052).md). The Jews throughout their whole
history attached great importance to fidelity to their engagements.
Divine wrath fell upon the violators of them ([Jos
9:18](../kjv/jos009.htm#018); [Sa2 21:1](../kjv/sa2021.htm#001.md), [Sa2
21:2](../kjv/sa2021.htm#002); [Eze 17:16](../kjv/eze017.htm#016).md).

<span id="007">**Allon**</span> Oak. (1.) The expression in the
Authorized Version of [Jos 19:33](../kjv/jos019.htm#033.md), "from Allon to
Zaanannim," is more correctly rendered in the Revised Version, "from the
oak in Zaanannim." The word denotes some remarkable tree which stood
near Zaanannim, and which served as a landmark. (2.) The son of Jedaiah,
of the family of the Simeonites, who expelled the Hamites from the
valley of Gedor ([Ch1 4:37](../kjv/ch1004.htm#037).md).

<span id="008">**Allon-bachuth**</span> Oak of weeping a tree near
Bethel, at the spot where Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, was buried ([Gen
35:8](../kjv/gen035.htm#008).md). Large trees, from their rarity in the
plains of Palestine, were frequently designated as landmarks. This
particular tree was probably the same as the "palm tree of Deborah"
([Jdg 4:5](../kjv/jdg004.htm#005).md).

<span id="009">**Almodad**</span> Immeasurable the first named of the
sons of Joktan ([Gen 10:26](../kjv/gen010.htm#026).md), the founder of an
Arabian tribe.
