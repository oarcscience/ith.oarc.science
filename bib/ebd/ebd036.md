<span id="000">**Ataroth**</span> Crowns. (1.) A city east of Jordan,
not far from Gilead ([Num 32:3](../kjv/num032.htm#003)). (2..md) A town on
the border of Ephraim and Benjamin ([Jos 16:2](../kjv/jos016.htm#002.md),
[Jos 16:7](../kjv/jos016.htm#007).md), called also Ataroth-adar ([Jos
16:5](../kjv/jos016.htm#005)). Now ed-Da'rieh . (3..md) "Ataroth, the house
of Joab" ([Ch1 2:54](../kjv/ch1002.htm#054).md), a town of Judah inhabited
by the descendants of Caleb.

<span id="001">**Ater**</span> Shut; lame. (1.) [Ezr
2:16](../kjv/ezr002.htm#016). (2.) [Neh 10:17](../kjv/neh010.htm#017.md).
(3.) [Ezr 2:42](../kjv/ezr002.htm#042.md).

<span id="002">**Athaliah**</span> Whom God afflicts. (1.) The daughter
of Ahab and Jezebel, and the wife of Jehoram, king of Judah ([Kg2
8:18](../kjv/kg2008.htm#018).md), who "walked in the ways of the house of
Ahab" ([Ch2 21:6](../kjv/ch2021.htm#006).md), called "daughter" of Omri
([Kg2 8:26](../kjv/kg2008.htm#026).md). On the death of her husband and of
her son Ahaziah, she resolved to seat herself on the vacant throne. She
slew all Ahaziah's children except Joash, the youngest ([Kg2
11:1](../kjv/kg2011.htm#001), [Kg2 11:2](../kjv/kg2011.htm#002).md). After
a reign of six years she was put to death in an insurrection ([Kg2
11:20](../kjv/kg2011.htm#020); [Ch2 21:6](../kjv/ch2021.htm#006.md); [Ch2
22:10](../kjv/ch2022.htm#010); [Ch2 23:15](../kjv/ch2023.htm#015).md),
stirred up among the people in connection with Josiah's being crowned as
king. (2.) [Ezr 8:7](../kjv/ezr008.htm#007). (3..md) [Ch1
8:26](../kjv/ch1008.htm#026.md).

<span id="003">**Athens**</span> The capital of Attica, the most
celebrated city of the ancient world, the seat of Greek literature and
art during the golden period of Grecian history. Its inhabitants were
fond of novelty ([Act 17:21](../kjv/act017.htm#021).md), and were
remarkable for their zeal in the worship of the gods. It was a sarcastic
saying of the Roman satirist that it was "easier to find a god at Athens
than a man." On his second missionary journey Paul visited this city
([Act 17:15](../kjv/act017.htm#015.md); compare [Th1
3:1](../kjv/th1003.htm#001).md), and delivered in the Areopagus his famous
speech ([Act 17:22](../kjv/act017.htm#022).md). The altar of which Paul
there speaks as dedicated "to the \[properly an\] unknown God" ([Act
17:23](../kjv/act017.htm#023).md) was probably one of several which bore
the same inscription. It is supposed that they originated in the
practice of letting loose a flock of sheep and goats in the streets of
Athens on the occasion of a plague, and of offering them up in
sacrifice, at the spot where they lay down, "to the god concerned."

<span id="004">**Atonement**</span> This word does not occur in the
Authorized Version of the New Testament except in [Rom
5:11](../kjv/rom005.htm#011.md), where in the Revised Version the word
"reconciliation" is used. In the Old Testament it is of frequent
occurrence. The meaning of the word is simply at-one-ment, i.e., the
state of being at one or being reconciled, so that atonement is
reconciliation. Thus it is used to denote the effect which flows from
the death of Christ. But the word is also used to denote that by which
this reconciliation is brought about, viz., the death of Christ itself;
and when so used it means satisfaction, and in this sense to make an
atonement for one is to make satisfaction for his offenses ([Exo
32:30](../kjv/exo032.htm#030); [Lev 4:26](../kjv/lev004.htm#026.md); [Lev
5:16](../kjv/lev005.htm#016); [Num 6:11](../kjv/num006.htm#011).md), and,
as regards the person, to reconcile, to propitiate God in his behalf. By
the atonement of Christ we generally mean his work by which he expiated
our sins. But in Scripture usage the word denotes the reconciliation
itself, and not the means by which it is effected. When speaking of
Christ's saving work, the word "satisfaction," the word used by the
theologians of the Reformation, is to be preferred to the word
"atonement." Christ's satisfaction is all he did in the room and in
behalf of sinners to satisfy the demands of the law and justice of God.
Christ's work consisted of suffering and obedience, and these were
vicarious, i.e., were not merely for our benefit, but were in our stead,
as the suffering and obedience of our vicar, or substitute. Our guilt is
expiated by the punishment which our vicar bore, and thus God is
rendered propitious, i.e., it is now consistent with his justice to
manifest his love to transgressors. Expiation has been made for sin,
i.e., it is covered. The means by which it is covered is vicarious
satisfaction, and the result of its being covered is atonement or
reconciliation. To make atonement is to do that by virtue of which
alienation ceases and reconciliation is brought about. Christ's
mediatorial work and sufferings are the ground or efficient cause of
reconciliation with God. They rectify the disturbed relations between
God and man, taking away the obstacles interposed by sin to their
fellowship and concord. The reconciliation is mutual, i.e., it is not
only that of sinners toward God, but also and pre-eminently that of God
toward sinners, effected by the sin-offering he himself provided, so
that consistently with the other attributes of his character his love
might flow forth in all its fulness of blessing to men. The primary idea
presented to us in different forms throughout the Scripture is that the
death of Christ is a satisfaction of infinite worth rendered to the law
and justice of God (q.v.), and accepted by him in room of the very
penalty man had incurred. It must also be constantly kept in mind that
the atonement is not the cause but the consequence of God's love to
guilty men ([Joh 3:16](../kjv/joh003.htm#016.md); [Rom
3:24](../kjv/rom003.htm#024), [Rom 3:25](../kjv/rom003.htm#025.md); [Eph
1:7](../kjv/eph001.htm#007); [Jo1 1:9](../kjv/jo1001.htm#009.md); [Jo1
4:9](../kjv/jo1004.htm#009).md). The atonement may also be regarded as
necessary, not in an absolute but in a relative sense, i.e., if man is
to be saved, there is no other way than this which God has devised and
carried out ([Exo 34:7](../kjv/exo034.htm#007.md); [Jos
24:19](../kjv/jos024.htm#019); [Psa 5:4](../kjv/psa005.htm#004.md); [Psa
7:11](../kjv/psa007.htm#011); [Nah 1:2](../kjv/nah001.htm#002.md), [Nah
1:6](../kjv/nah001.htm#006); [Rom 3:5](../kjv/rom003.htm#005).md). This is
God's plan, clearly revealed; and f that is enough for us to know.

<span id="005">**Atonement, Day of**</span> The great annual day of
humiliation and expiation for the sins of the nation, "the fast" ([Act
27:9](../kjv/act027.htm#009).md), and the only one commanded in the law of
Moses. The mode of its observance is described in [Lev
16:3](../kjv/lev016.htm#003); [Lev 23:26](../kjv/lev023.htm#026.md); and
[Num 29:7](../kjv/num029.htm#007.md). It was kept on the tenth day of the
month Tisri, i.e., five days before the feast of Tabernacles, and lasted
from sunset to sunset. (See AZAZEL.)

<span id="006">**Augustus**</span> The cognomen of the first Roman
emperor, C. Julius Caesar Octavianus, during whose reign Christ was born
([Luk 2:1](../kjv/luk002.htm#001).md). His decree that "all the world
should be taxed" was the divinely ordered occasion of Jesus' being born,
according to prophecy ([Mic 5:2](../kjv/mic005.htm#002).md), in Bethlehem.
This name being simply a title meaning "majesty" or "venerable," first
given to him by the senate (27 B.C.), was borne by succeeding emperors.
Before his death (A.D. 14) he associated Tiberius with him in the empire
([Luk 3:1](../kjv/luk003.htm#001).md), by whom he was succeeded.

<span id="007">**Augustus' Band**</span> ([Act
27:1](../kjv/act027.htm#001.md).: literally, of Sebaste, the Greek form of
Augusta, the name given to Caesarea in honour of Augustus Caesar).
Probably this "band" or cohort consisted of Samaritan soldiers belonging
to Caesarea.

<span id="008">**Ava**</span> A place in Assyria from which colonies
were brought to Samaria ([Kg2 17:24](../kjv/kg2017.htm#024).md). It is
probably the same with Ivah ([Kg2 18:34](../kjv/kg2018.htm#034.md); [Kg2
19:13](../kjv/kg2019.htm#013); [Isa 37:13](../kjv/isa037.htm#013).md). It
has been identified with Hit on the Euphrates.

<span id="009">**Aven**</span> Nothingness; vanity. (1.) Hosea speaks of
the "high places of Aven" ([Hos 10:8](../kjv/hos010.htm#008).md), by which
he means Bethel. He also calls in Beth-aven, i.e., "the house of vanity"
([Hos 4:15](../kjv/hos004.htm#015).md), on account of the golden calves
Jeroboam had set up there ([Kg1 12:28](../kjv/kg1012.htm#028).md).
(2.)Translated by the LXX. "On" in [Eze 30:17](../kjv/eze030.htm#017.md).
The Egyptian Heliopolis or city of On (q.v.). (3.)In [Amo
1:5](../kjv/amo001.htm#005.md) it denotes the Syrian Heliopolis, the modern
Baalbec.
