<span id="006">**Shepherd**</span> A word naturally of frequent
occurrence in Scripture. Sometimes the word "pastor" is used instead
([Jer 2:8](../kjv/jer002.htm#008); [Jer 3:15](../kjv/jer003.htm#015);
[Jer 10:21](../kjv/jer010.htm#021); [Jer 12:10](../kjv/jer012.htm#010);
[Jer 17:16](../kjv/jer017.htm#016)). This word is used figuratively to
represent the relation of rulers to their subjects and of God to his
people ([Psa 23:1](../kjv/psa023.htm#001); [Psa
80:1](../kjv/psa080.htm#001); [Isa 40:11](../kjv/isa040.htm#011); [Isa
44:28](../kjv/isa044.htm#028); [Jer 25:34](../kjv/jer025.htm#034), [Jer
25:35](../kjv/jer025.htm#035); [Nah 3:18](../kjv/nah003.htm#018); [Joh

5:4](../kjv/pe1005.htm#004)). The duties of a shepherd in an unenclosed
country like Palestine were very onerous. "In early morning he led forth
the flock from the fold, marching at its head to the spot where they
were to be pastured. Here he watched them all day, taking care that none
of the sheep strayed, and if any for a time eluded his watch and
wandered away from the rest, seeking diligently till he found and
brought it back. In those lands sheep require to be supplied regularly
with water, and the shepherd for this purpose has to guide them either
to some running stream or to wells dug in the wilderness and furnished
with troughs. At night he brought the flock home to the fold, counting
them as they passed under the rod at the door to assure himself that
none were missing. Nor did his labours always end with sunset. Often he
had to guard the fold through the dark hours from the attack of wild
beasts, or the wily attempts of the prowling thief (see [Sa1
17:34](../kjv/sa1017.htm#034))." Deane's David.
