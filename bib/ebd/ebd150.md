<span id="000">**Gittith**</span> A stringed instrument of music. This
word is found in the titles of [Psa 8:1](../kjv/psa008.htm#001), 81,
[Psa 84:1](../kjv/psa084.htm#001). In these places the LXX. render the
word by "on the wine-fats." The Targum explains by "on the harp which
David brought from Gath." It is the only stringed instrument named in
the titles of the Psalms.

<span id="001">**Gizonite**</span> A name given to Hashem, an inhabitant
of Gizoh, a place somewhere in the mountains of Judah ([Ch1
11:34](../kjv/ch1011.htm#034); [Sa2 23:32](../kjv/sa2023.htm#032), [Sa2
23:34](../kjv/sa2023.htm#034)).

<span id="002">**Glass**</span> Was known to the Egyptians at a very
early period of their national history, at least 1500 B.C.. Various
articles both useful and ornamental were made of it, as bottles, vases,
etc. A glass bottle with the name of Sargon on it was found among the
ruins of the north-west palace of Nimroud. The Hebrew word zekukith
([Job 28:17](../kjv/job028.htm#017)), rendered in the Authorized Version
"crystal," is rightly rendered in the Revised Version "glass." This is
the only allusion to glass found in the Old Testament. It is referred to
in the New Testament in [Rev 4:6](../kjv/rev004.htm#006); [Rev
15:2](../kjv/rev015.htm#002); [Rev 21:18](../kjv/rev021.htm#018), [Rev
21:21](../kjv/rev021.htm#021). In [Job 37:18](../kjv/job037.htm#018),
the word rendered "looking-glass" is in the Revised Version properly
rendered "mirror," formed, i.e., of some metal. (Compare [Exo
38:8](../kjv/exo038.htm#008) : "looking-glasses" are brazen
mirrors,R.V.). A mirror is referred to also in [Jam
1:23](../kjv/jam001.htm#023).

<span id="003">**Glean**</span> The corners of fields were not to be
reaped, and the sheaf accidentally left behind was not to be fetched
away, according to the law of Moses ([Lev 19:9](../kjv/lev019.htm#009);
[Lev 23:22](../kjv/lev023.htm#022); [Deu 24:21](../kjv/deu024.htm#021)).
They were to be left for the poor to glean. Similar laws were given
regarding vineyards and oliveyards. (Compare [Rut
2:2](../kjv/rut002.htm#002).)

<span id="004">**Glede**</span> An Old English name for the common kite,
mentioned only in [Deu 14:13](../kjv/deu014.htm#013) (Heb. ra'ah ), the
Milvus ater or black kite. The Hebrew word does not occur in the
parallel passage in Leviticus ([Lev 11:14](../kjv/lev011.htm#014), da'ah
, rendered "vulture;" in R.V., "kite"). It was an unclean bird. The
Hebrew name is from a root meaning "to see," "to look," thus designating
a bird with a keen sight. The bird intended is probably the buzzard, of
which there are three species found in Palestine. (See VULTURE.)

<span id="005">**Glorify**</span> (1.) To make glorious, or cause so to
appear ([Joh 12:28](../kjv/joh012.htm#028); [Joh
13:31](../kjv/joh013.htm#031), [Joh 13:32](../kjv/joh013.htm#032); [Joh
17:4](../kjv/joh017.htm#004), [Joh 17:5](../kjv/joh017.htm#005)). (2.)
Spoken of God to "shew forth his praise" ([Co1
6:20](../kjv/co1006.htm#020); [Co1 10:31](../kjv/co1010.htm#031)).

<span id="006">**Glory**</span> (Heb. kabhod ; Gr. doxa ). (1.)
Abundance, wealth, treasure, and hence honour ([Psa
49:12](../kjv/psa049.htm#012)); glory ([Gen
31:1](../kjv/gen031.htm#001); [Mat 4:8](../kjv/mat004.htm#008); [Rev
21:24](../kjv/rev021.htm#024), [Rev 21:26](../kjv/rev021.htm#026)). (2.)
Honour, dignity ([Kg1 3:13](../kjv/kg1003.htm#013); [Heb
2:7](../kjv/heb002.htm#007) [Pe1 1:24](../kjv/pe1001.htm#024)); of God
([Psa 19:1](../kjv/psa019.htm#001); [Psa 29:1](../kjv/psa029.htm#001));
of the mind or heart ([Gen 49:6](../kjv/gen049.htm#006); [Psa
7:5](../kjv/psa007.htm#005); [Act 2:46](../kjv/act002.htm#046)). (3.)
Splendour, brightness, majesty ([Gen 45:13](../kjv/gen045.htm#013); [Isa
4:5](../kjv/isa004.htm#005); [Act 22:11](../kjv/act022.htm#011); [Co2
3:7](../kjv/co2003.htm#007)); of Jehovah ([Isa
59:19](../kjv/isa059.htm#019); [Isa 60:1](../kjv/isa060.htm#001); [Th2
1:9](../kjv/th2001.htm#009)). (4.) The glorious moral attributes, the
infinite perfections of God ([Isa 40:5](../kjv/isa040.htm#005); [Act
7:2](../kjv/act007.htm#002); [Rom 1:23](../kjv/rom001.htm#023); [Rom
9:23](../kjv/rom009.htm#023); [Eph 1:12](../kjv/eph001.htm#012)). Jesus
is the "brightness of the Father's glory" ([Heb
1:3](../kjv/heb001.htm#003); [Joh 1:14](../kjv/joh001.htm#014); [Joh
2:11](../kjv/joh002.htm#011)). (5.) The bliss of heaven ([Rom
2:7](../kjv/rom002.htm#007), [Rom 2:10](../kjv/rom002.htm#010); [Rom
5:2](../kjv/rom005.htm#002); [Rom 8:18](../kjv/rom008.htm#018); [Heb
2:10](../kjv/heb002.htm#010); [Pe1 5:1](../kjv/pe1005.htm#001), [Pe1
5:10](../kjv/pe1005.htm#010)). (6.) The phrase "Give glory to God" ([Jos
7:19](../kjv/jos007.htm#019); [Jer 13:16](../kjv/jer013.htm#016)) is a
Hebrew idiom meaning, "Confess your sins." The words of the Jews to the
blind man, "Give God the praise" ([Joh 9:24](../kjv/joh009.htm#024)),
are an adjuration to confess. They are equivalent to, "Confess that you
are an impostor," "Give God the glory by speaking the truth;" for they
denied that a miracle had been wrought.

<span id="007">**Glutton**</span> ([Deu 21:20](../kjv/deu021.htm#020)),
Heb. zolel , from a word meaning "to shake out," "to squander;" and
hence one who is prodigal, who wastes his means by indulgence. In [Pro
23:21](../kjv/pro023.htm#021), the word means debauchers or wasters of
their own body. In [Pro 28:7](../kjv/pro028.htm#007), the word (pl.) is
rendered Authorized Version "riotous men;" Revised Version,
"gluttonous." [Mat 11:19](../kjv/mat011.htm#019), [Luk
7:34](../kjv/luk007.htm#034), Greek phagos , given to eating,
gluttonous.

<span id="008">**Gnash**</span> Heb. harak , meaning "to grate the
teeth", ([Job 16:9](../kjv/job016.htm#009); [Psa
112:10](../kjv/psa112.htm#010); [Lam 2:16](../kjv/lam002.htm#016)),
denotes rage or sorrow. (See also [Act 7:54](../kjv/act007.htm#054);
[Mar 9:18](../kjv/mar009.htm#018).)

<span id="009">**Gnat**</span> Only in [Mat
23:24](../kjv/mat023.htm#024), a small two-winged stinging fly of the
genus Culex, which includes mosquitoes. Our Lord alludes here to the
gnat in a proverbial expression probably in common use, "who strain out
the gnat;" the words in the Authorized Version, "strain at a gnat,"
being a mere typographical error, which has been corrected in the
Revised Version. The custom of filtering wine for this purpose was
common among the Jews. It was founded on [Lev
11:23](../kjv/lev011.htm#023). It is supposed that the "lice," [Exo
8:16](../kjv/exo008.htm#016) (marg. R.V., "sand-flies"), were a species
of gnat.
