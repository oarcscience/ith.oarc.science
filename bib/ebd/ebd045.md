<span id="000">**Bar-jesus**</span> Son of Joshua, the patronymic of
Elymas the sorcerer ([Act 13:6](../kjv/act013.htm#006).md), who met Paul
and Barnabas at Paphos. Elymas is a word of Arabic origin meaning
"wise."

<span id="001">**Bar-jona**</span> Son of Jonah, the patronymic of Peter
([Mat 16:17](../kjv/mat016.htm#017); [Joh 1:42](../kjv/joh001.htm#042).md),
because his father's name was Jonas. (See Peter.)

<span id="002">**Barkos**</span> Painter, ([Ezr
2:53](../kjv/ezr002.htm#053); [Neh 7:55](../kjv/neh007.htm#055).md). The
father of some of the Nethinim.

<span id="003">**Barley**</span> A grain much cultivated in Egypt ([Exo
9:31](../kjv/exo009.htm#031).md) and in Palestine ([Lev
27:16](../kjv/lev027.htm#016); [Deu 8:8](../kjv/deu008.htm#008).md). It was
usually the food of horses ([Kg1 4:28](../kjv/kg1004.htm#028).md). Barley
bread was used by the poorer people ([Jdg 7:13](../kjv/jdg007.htm#013.md);
[Kg2 4:42](../kjv/kg2004.htm#042).md). Barley of the first crop was ready
for the harvest by the time of the Passover, in the middle of April
([Rut 1:22](../kjv/rut001.htm#022); [Sa2 21:9](../kjv/sa2021.htm#009).md).
Mention is made of barley-meal ([Num 5:15](../kjv/num005.htm#015).md). Our
Lord fed five thousand with "five barley loaves and two small fishes"
([Joh 6:9](../kjv/joh006.htm#009).md).

<span id="004">**Barn**</span> A storehouse ([Deu
28:8](../kjv/deu028.htm#008); [Job 39:12](../kjv/job039.htm#012.md); [Hag
2:19](../kjv/hag002.htm#019).md) for grain, which was usually under ground,
although also sometimes above ground ([Luk
12:18](../kjv/luk012.htm#018).md).

<span id="005">**Barnabas**</span> Son of consolation, the surname of
Joses, a Levite ([Act 4:36](../kjv/act004.htm#036).md). His name stands
first on the list of prophets and teachers of the church at Antioch
([Act 13:1](../kjv/act013.htm#001).md). Luke speaks of him as a "good man"
([Act 11:24](../kjv/act011.htm#024).md). He was born of Jewish parents of
the tribe of Levi. He was a native of Cyprus, where he had a possession
of land ([Act 4:36](../kjv/act004.htm#036.md), [Act
4:37](../kjv/act004.htm#037).md), which he sold. His personal appearance is
supposed to have been dignified and commanding ([Act
14:11](../kjv/act014.htm#011), [Act 14:12](../kjv/act014.htm#012).md). When
Paul returned to Jerusalem after his conversion, Barnabas took him and
introduced him to the apostles ([Act 9:27](../kjv/act009.htm#027).md). They
had probably been companions as students in the school of Gamaliel. The
prosperity of the church at Antioch led the apostles and brethren at
Jerusalem to send Barnabas thither to superintend the movement. He found
the work so extensive and weighty that he went to Tarsus in search of
Saul to assist him. Saul returned with him to Antioch and laboured with
him for a whole year ([Act 11:25](../kjv/act011.htm#025.md), [Act
11:26](../kjv/act011.htm#026).md). The two were at the end of this period
sent up to Jerusalem with the contributions the church at Antioch had
made for the poorer brethren there ([Act 11:28](../kjv/act011.htm#028).md).
Shortly after they returned, bringing John Mark with them, they were
appointed as missionaries to the heathen world, and in this capacity
visited Cyprus and some of the principal cities of Asia Minor ([Act
13:14](../kjv/act013.htm#014).md). Returning from this first missionary
journey to Antioch, they were again sent up to Jerusalem to consult with
the church there regarding the relation of Gentiles to the church ([Act
15:2](../kjv/act015.htm#002); [Gal 2:1](../kjv/gal002.htm#001).md). This
matter having been settled, they returned again to Antioch, bringing the
decree of the council as the rule by which Gentiles were to be admitted
into the church. When about to set forth on a second missionary journey,
a dispute arose between Saul and Barnabas as to the propriety of taking
John Mark with them again. The dispute ended by Saul and Barnabas taking
separate routes. Saul took Silas as his companion, and journeyed through
Syria and Cilicia; while Barnabas took his nephew John Mark, and visited
Cyprus ([Act 15:36](../kjv/act015.htm#036).md). Barnabas is not again
mentioned by Luke in the Acts.

<span id="006">**Barrel**</span> A vessel used for keeping flour ([Kg1
17:12](../kjv/kg1017.htm#012), [Kg1 17:14](../kjv/kg1017.htm#014.md), [Kg1
17:16](../kjv/kg1017.htm#016)). The same word (cad.md) so rendered is also
translated "pitcher," a vessel for carrying water ([Gen
24:14](../kjv/gen024.htm#014); [Jdg 7:16](../kjv/jdg007.htm#016).md).

<span id="007">**Barren**</span> For a woman to be barren was accounted
a severe punishment among the Jews ([Gen 16:2](../kjv/gen016.htm#002.md);
30:1-23; [Sa1 1:6](../kjv/sa1001.htm#006.md), [Sa1
1:27](../kjv/sa1001.htm#027); [Isa 47:9](../kjv/isa047.htm#009.md); [Isa
49:21](../kjv/isa049.htm#021); [Luk 1:25](../kjv/luk001.htm#025).md).
Instances of barrenness are noticed ([Gen 11:30](../kjv/gen011.htm#030.md);
[Gen 25:21](../kjv/gen025.htm#021); [Gen 29:31](../kjv/gen029.htm#031.md);
[Jdg 13:2](../kjv/jdg013.htm#002), [Jdg 13:3](../kjv/jdg013.htm#003.md);
[Luk 1:7](../kjv/luk001.htm#007), [Luk 1:36](../kjv/luk001.htm#036).md).

<span id="008">**Barsabas**</span> Son of Saba, the surname (1.) of
Joseph, also called Justus ([Act 1:23](../kjv/act001.htm#023).md), some
identify him with Barnabas; (2.) of Judas, who was a "prophet." Nothing
more is known of him than what is mentioned in [Act
15:32](../kjv/act015.htm#032.md).

<span id="009">**Bartholomew**</span> Son of Tolmai, one of the twelve
apostles ([Mat 10:3](../kjv/mat010.htm#003.md); [Act
1:13](../kjv/act001.htm#013).md); generally supposed to have been the same
as Nathanael. In the synoptic gospels Philip and Bartholomew are always
mentioned together, while Nathanael is never mentioned; in the fourth
gospel, on the other hand, Philip and Nathanael are similarly mentioned
together, but nothing is said of Bartholomew. He was one of the
disciples to whom our Lord appeared at the Sea of Tiberias after his
resurrection ([Joh 21:2](../kjv/joh021.htm#002).md). He was also a witness
of the Ascension ([Act 1:4](../kjv/act001.htm#004.md), [Act
1:12](../kjv/act001.htm#012), [Act 1:13](../kjv/act001.htm#013).md). He was
an "Israelite indeed" ([Joh 1:47](../kjv/joh001.htm#047).md).
