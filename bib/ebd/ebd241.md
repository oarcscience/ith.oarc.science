<span id="000">**Maoch**</span> Compressed, the father of Achish, king
of Gath ([Sa1 27:2](../kjv/sa1027.htm#002)). Called also Maachah ([Kg1
2:39](../kjv/kg1002.htm#039)).

<span id="001">**Maon**</span> Habitation, a town in the tribe of Judah,
about 7 miles south of Hebron, which gave its name to the wilderness,
the district round the conical hill on which the town stood. Here David
hid from Saul, and here Nabal had his possessions and his home ([Sa1
23:24](../kjv/sa1023.htm#024), [Sa1 23:25](../kjv/sa1023.htm#025); [Sa1
25:2](../kjv/sa1025.htm#002)). "Only some small foundations of hewn
stone, a square enclosure, and several cisterns are now to be seen at
Maon. Are they the remains of Nabal's great establishment?" The hill is
now called Tell M'ain .

<span id="002">**Mara**</span> Bitter; sad, a symbolical name which
Naomi gave to herself because of her misfortunes ([Rut
1:20](../kjv/rut001.htm#020)).

<span id="003">**Marah**</span> Bitterness, a fountain at the sixth
station of the Israelites ([Exo 15:23](../kjv/exo015.htm#023), [Exo
15:24](../kjv/exo015.htm#024); [Num 33:8](../kjv/num033.htm#008)) whose
waters were so bitter that they could not drink them. On this account
they murmured against Moses, who, under divine direction, cast into the
fountain "a certain tree" which took away its bitterness, so that the
people drank of it. This was probably the 'Ain Hawarah , where there are
still several springs of water that are very "bitter," distant some 47
miles from 'Ayun Mousa .

<span id="004">**Maralah**</span> Trembling, a place on the southern
boundary of Zebulun ([Jos 19:11](../kjv/jos019.htm#011)). It has been
identified with the modern M'alul , about 4 miles south-west of
Nazareth.

<span id="005">**Maranatha**</span> ([Co1 16:22](../kjv/co1016.htm#022))
consists of two Aramean words, Maran'athah , meaning, "our Lord comes,"
or is "coming." If the latter interpretation is adopted, the meaning of
the phrase is, "Our Lord is coming, and he will judge those who have set
him at naught." (Compare [Phi 4:5](../kjv/phi004.htm#005); [Jam
5:8](../kjv/jam005.htm#008), [Jam 5:9](../kjv/jam005.htm#009).)

<span id="006">**Marble**</span> As a mineral, consists of carbonate of
lime, its texture varying from the highly crystalline to the compact. In
[Est 1:6](../kjv/est001.htm#006) there are four Hebrew words which are
rendered marble: (1.) Shesh, "pillars of marble." But this word probably
designates dark-blue limestone rather than marble. (2.) Dar some regard
as Parian marble. It is here rendered "white marble." But nothing is
certainly known of it. (3.) Bahat, "red marble," probably the
verd-antique or half-porphyry of Egypt. (4.) Sohareth, "black marble,"
probably some spotted variety of marble. "The marble pillars and
tesserae of various colours of the palace at Susa came doubtless from
Persia itself, where marble of various colours is found, especially in
the province of Hamadan Susiana." The marble of Solomon's architectural
works may have been limestone from near Jerusalem, or from Lebanon, or
possibly white marble from Arabia. Herod employed Parian marble in the
temple, and marble columns still exist in great abundance at Jerusalem.

<span id="007">**Marcheshvan**</span> The post-biblical name of the
month which was the eighth of the sacred and the second of the civil
year of the Jews. It began with the new moon of our November. It is once
called Bul ([Kg1 6:38](../kjv/kg1006.htm#038)). Assyrian, Arah Samna,
"eighth month,"

<span id="008">**Marcus**</span> [Col 4:10](../kjv/col004.htm#010); [Plm
1:24](../kjv/plm001.htm#024); [Pe1 5:13](../kjv/pe1005.htm#013); R.V.,
"Mark" (q.v.).

<span id="009">**Mareshah**</span> Possession, a city in the plain of
Judah ([Jos 15:44](../kjv/jos015.htm#044)). Here Asa defeated Zerah the
Ethiopian ([Ch2 14:9](../kjv/ch2014.htm#009), [Ch2
14:10](../kjv/ch2014.htm#010)). It is identified with the ruin
el-Mer'ash , about 11/2 mile south of Beit Jibrin.
