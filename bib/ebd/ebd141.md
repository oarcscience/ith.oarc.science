([Num 13:11](../kjv/num013.htm#011).md).

<span id="001">**Gaddiel**</span> Fortune (i.e., sent) of God, the

<span id="002">**Gahar**</span> Lurking-place, one of the chief of the
Nethinim, whose descendants returned to Jerusalem under Zerubbabel ([Ezr

<span id="003">**Gaius**</span> (1.) A Macedonian, Paul's
fellow-traveler, and his host at Corinth when he wrote his Epistle to
the Romans ([Rom 16:23](../kjv/rom016.htm#023).md). He with his household
were baptized by Paul ([Co1 1:14](../kjv/co1001.htm#014).md). During a
heathen outbreak against Paul at Ephesus the mob seized Gaius and
Aristarchus because they could not find Paul, and rushed with them into
the theatre. Some have identified this Gaius with No. (2). (2.) A man of
Derbe who accompanied Paul into Asia on his last journey to Jerusalem
(3.) A Christian of Asia Minor to whom John addressed his third epistle
([Jo3 1:1](../kjv/jo3001.htm#001).md).

<span id="004">**Galatia**</span> Has been called the "Gallia" of the
East, Roman writers calling its inhabitants Galli. They were an
intermixture of Gauls and Greeks, and hence were called Gallo-Graeci,
and the country Gallo-Graecia. The Galatians were in their origin a part
of that great Celtic migration which invaded Macedonia about 280 B.C..
They were invited by the king of Bithynia to cross over into Asia Minor
to assist him in his wars. There they ultimately settled, and being
strengthened by fresh accessions of the same clan from Europe, they
overran Bithynia, and supported themselves by plundering neighbouring
countries. They were great warriors, and hired themselves out as
mercenary soldiers, sometimes fighting on both sides in the great
battles of the times. They were at length brought under the power of
Rome in 189 B.C., and Galatia became a Roman province B.C. 25. This
province of Galatia, within the limits of which these Celtic tribes were
confined, was the central region of Asia Minor. During his second
missionary journey Paul, accompanied by Silas and Timothy ([Act
16:6](../kjv/act016.htm#006).md), visited the "region of Galatia," where he
was detained by sickness ([Gal 4:13](../kjv/gal004.htm#013).md), and had
thus the longer opportunity of preaching to them the gospel. On his
third journey he went over "all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in
order" ([Act 18:23](../kjv/act018.htm#023).md). Crescens was sent thither
by Paul toward the close of his life ([Ti2
4:10](../kjv/ti2004.htm#010).md).

<span id="005">**Galatians, Epistle to**</span> The genuineness of this
epistle is not called in question. Its Pauline origin is universally
acknowledged. Occasion of. The churches of Galatia were founded by Paul
himself ([Act 16:6](../kjv/act016.htm#006.md); [Gal
1:8](../kjv/gal001.htm#008); [Gal 4:13](../kjv/gal004.htm#013.md), [Gal
4:19](../kjv/gal004.htm#019).md). They seem to have been composed mainly of
converts from heathenism ([Gal 4:8](../kjv/gal004.htm#008).md), but partly
also of Jewish converts, who probably, under the influence of Judaizing
teachers, sought to incorporate the rites of Judaism with Christianity,
and by their active zeal had succeeded in inducing the majority of the
churches to adopt their views ([Gal 1:6](../kjv/gal001.htm#006.md); [Gal
3:1](../kjv/gal003.htm#001).md). This epistle was written for the purpose
of counteracting this Judaizing tendency, and of recalling the Galatians
to the simplicity of the gospel, and at the same time also of
vindicating Paul's claim to be a divinely-commissioned apostle. Time and
place of writing. The epistle was probably written very soon after
Paul's second visit to Galatia ([Act 18:23](../kjv/act018.htm#023).md). The
references of the epistle appear to agree with this conclusion. The
visit to Jerusalem, mentioned in [Gal 2:1](../kjv/gal002.htm#001.md), was
identical with that of Acts 15, and it is spoken of as a thing of the
past, and consequently the epistle was written subsequently to the
council of Jerusalem. The similarity between this epistle and that to
the Romans has led to the conclusion that they were both written at the
same time, namely, in the winter of A.D. 57-8, during Paul's stay in
Corinth ([Act 20:2](../kjv/act020.htm#002.md), [Act
20:3](../kjv/act020.htm#003).md). This to the Galatians is written on the
urgency of the occasion, tidings having reached him of the state of
matters; and that to the Romans in a more deliberate and systematic way,
in exposition of the same great doctrines of the gospel. Contents of.
The great question discussed is, Was the Jewish law binding on
Christians? The epistle is designed to prove against the Jews that men
are justified by faith without the works of the law of Moses. After an
introductory address ([Gal 1:1](../kjv/gal001.htm#001).md) the apostle
discusses the subjects which had occasioned the epistle. (1.) He defends
his apostolic authority ([Gal 1:11](../kjv/gal001.htm#011.md); [Gal
2:1](../kjv/gal002.htm#001)); (2..md) shows the evil influence of the
Judaizers in destroying the very essence of the gospel (Gal. 3 and 4);
(3.) exhorts the Galatian believers to stand fast in the faith as it is
in Jesus, and to abound in the fruits of the Spirit, and in a right use
of their Christian freedom (Gal. 5:1 - 6:10); (4.) and then concludes
with a summary of the topics discussed, and with the benediction. The
Epistle to the Galatians and that to the Romans taken together "form a
complete proof that justification is not to be obtained meritoriously
either by works of morality or by rites and ceremonies, though of divine
appointment; but that it is a free gift, proceeding entirely from the
mercy of God, to those who receive it by faith in Jesus our Lord." In
the conclusion of the epistle ([Gal 6:11](../kjv/gal006.htm#011).md) Paul
says, "Ye see how large a letter I have written with mine own hand." It
is implied that this was different from his ordinary usage, which was
simply to write the concluding salutation with his own hand, indicating
that the rest of the epistle was written by another hand. Regarding this
conclusion, Lightfoot, in his Commentary on the epistle, says: "At this
point the apostle takes the pen from his amanuensis, and the concluding
paragraph is written with his own hand. From the time when letters began
to be forged in his name ([Th2 2:2](../kjv/th2002.htm#002.md); [Th2
3:17](../kjv/th2003.htm#017).md) it seems to have been his practice to
close with a few words in his own handwriting, as a precaution against
such forgeries... In the present case he writes a whole paragraph,
summing up the main lessons of the epistle in terse, eager, disjointed
sentences. He writes it, too, in large, bold characters (Gr. pelikois
grammasin ), that his hand-writing may reflect the energy and
determination of his soul." (See JUSTIFICATION.)

<span id="006">**Galbanum**</span> Heb. helbenah , ([Exo
30:34](../kjv/exo030.htm#034).md), one of the ingredients in the holy
incense. It is a gum, probably from the Galbanum officinale.

<span id="007">**Galilean**</span> An inhabitant or native of Galilee.
This word was used as a name of contempt as applied to our Lord's
disciples ([Luk 22:59](../kjv/luk022.htm#059.md); [Act
2:7](../kjv/act002.htm#007).md). All the apostles, with the exception of
Judas Iscariot ([Act 1:11](../kjv/act001.htm#011).md), were Galileans.
Peter was detected by his Galilean accent ([Mat
26:69](../kjv/mat026.htm#069); [Mar 14:70](../kjv/mar014.htm#070).md). This
was also one of the names of reproach given to the early Christians.
Julian the Apostate, as he is called, not only used the epithet himself
when referring to Christ and his apostles, but he made it a law that no
one should ever call the Christians by any other name.

<span id="008">**Galilee**</span> Circuit. Solomon rewarded Hiram for
certain services rendered him by the gift of an upland plain among the
mountains of Naphtali. Hiram was dissatisfied with the gift, and called
it "the land of Cabul" (q.v.). The Jews called it Galil. It continued
long to be occupied by the original inhabitants, and hence came to be
called "Galilee of the Gentiles" ([Mat 4:15](../kjv/mat004.htm#015).md),
and also "Upper Galilee," to distinguish it from the extensive addition
afterwards made to it toward the south, which was usually called "Lower
Galilee." In the time of our Lord, Galilee embraced more than one-third
of Western Palestine, extending "from Dan on the north, at the base of
Mount Hermon, to the ridges of Carmel and Gilboa on the south, and from
the Jordan valley on the east away across the splendid plains of Jezreel
and Acre to the shores of the Mediterranean on the west." Palestine was
divided into three provinces, Judea, Samaria, and Galilee, which
comprehended the whole northern section of the country ([Act
9:31](../kjv/act009.htm#031).md), and was the largest of the three. It was
the scene of some of the most memorable events of Jewish history.
Galilee also was the home of our Lord during at least thirty years of
his life. The first three Gospels are chiefly taken up with our Lord's
public ministry in this province. "The entire province is encircled with
a halo of holy associations connected with the life, works, and
teachings of Jesus of Nazareth." "It is noteworthy that of his
thirty-two beautiful parables, no less than nineteen were spoken in
Galilee. And it is no less remarkable that of his entire thirty-three
great miracles, twenty-five were wrought in this province. His first
miracle was wrought at the wedding in Cana of Galilee, and his last,
after his resurrection, on the shore of Galilee's sea. In Galilee our
Lord delivered the Sermon on The Mount, and the discourses on 'The Bread
of Life,' on 'Purity,' on 'Forgiveness,' and on 'Humility.' In Galilee
he called his first disciples; and there occurred the sublime scene of
the Transfiguration" (Porter's Through Samaria). When the Sanhedrin were
about to proceed with some plan for the condemnation of our Lord ([Joh
7:45](../kjv/joh007.htm#045).md), Nicodemus interposed in his behalf.
(Compare [Deu 1:16](../kjv/deu001.htm#016.md), [Deu
1:17](../kjv/deu001.htm#017); [Deu 17:8](../kjv/deu017.htm#008)..md) They
replied, "Art thou also of Galilee?... Out of Galilee ariseth no
prophet." This saying of theirs was "not historically true, for two
prophets at least had arisen from Galilee, Jonah of Gath-hepher, and the
greatest of all the prophets, Elijah of Thisbe, and perhaps also Nahum
and Hosea. Their contempt for Galilee made them lose sight of historical
accuracy" (Alford, Com.). The Galilean accent differed from that of
Jerusalem in being broader and more guttural ([Mar
14:70](../kjv/mar014.htm#070).md).

<span id="009">**Galilee, Sea of**</span> [Mat
4:18](../kjv/mat004.htm#018); [Mat 15:29](../kjv/mat015.htm#029).md), is
mentioned in the Bible under three other names. (1.) In the Old
Testament it is called the "sea of Chinnereth" ([Num
34:11](../kjv/num034.htm#011); [Jos 12:3](../kjv/jos012.htm#003.md); [Jos
13:27](../kjv/jos013.htm#027).md), as is supposed from its harp-like shape.
(2.). The "lake of Gennesareth" once by Luke ([Luk
5:1](../kjv/luk005.htm#001).md), from the flat district lying on its west
coast. (3.) John ([Joh 6:1](../kjv/joh006.htm#001.md); [Joh
21:1](../kjv/joh021.htm#001)) calls it the "sea of Tiberias" (q.v..md). The
modern Arabs retain this name, Bahr Tabariyeh. See map, of the Sea of
Galilee This lake is 12 1/2 miles long, and from 4 to 7 1/2 broad. It
surface is 682 feet below the level of the Mediterranean. Its depth is
from 80 to 160 feet. The Jordan enters it 10 1/2 miles below the
southern extremity of the Huleh Lake, or about 26 1/2 miles there is a
fall in the river of 1,682 feet, or of more than 60 feet to the mile. It
is 27 miles east of the Mediterranean, and about 60 miles north-east of
Jerusalem. It is of an oval shape, and abounds in fish. Its present
appearance is thus described: "The utter loneliness and absolute
stillness of the scene are exceedingly impressive. It seems as if all
nature had gone to rest, languishing under the scorching heat. How
different it was in the days of our Lord! Then all was life and bustle
along the shores; the cities and villages that thickly studded them
resounded with the hum of a busy population; while from hill-side and
corn-field came the cheerful cry of shepherd and ploughman. The lake,
too, was dotted with dark fishing-boats and spangled with white sails.
Now a mournful, solitary silence reigns over sea and shore. The cities
are in ruins!" This sea is chiefly of interest as associated with the
public ministry of our Lord. Capernaum, "his own city" ([Mat
9:1](../kjv/mat009.htm#001).md), stood on its shores. From among the
fishermen who plied their calling on its waters he chose Peter and his
brother Andrew, and James and John, to be disciples, and sent them forth
to be "fishers of men" ([Mat 4:18](../kjv/mat004.htm#018.md), [Mat
4:22](../kjv/mat004.htm#022); [Mar 1:16](../kjv/mar001.htm#016.md); [Luk
5:1](../kjv/luk005.htm#001).md). He stilled its tempest, saying to the
storm that swept over it, "Peace, be still" ([Mat
8:23](../kjv/mat008.htm#023); [Mar 7:31](../kjv/mar007.htm#031).md); and
here also he showed himself after his resurrection to his disciples
(John 21). "The Sea of Galilee is indeed the cradle of the gospel. The
subterranean fires of nature prepared a lake basin, through which a
river afterwards ran, keeping its waters always fresh. In this basin a
vast quantity of shell-fish swarmed, and multiplied to such an extent
that they formed the food of an extraordinary profusion of fish. The
great variety and abundance of the fish in the lake attracted to its
shores a larger and more varied population than existed elsewhere in
Palestine, whereby this secluded district was brought into contact with
all parts of the world. And this large and varied population, with
access to all nations and countries, attracted the Lord Jesus, and
induced him to make this spot the centre of his public ministry."
