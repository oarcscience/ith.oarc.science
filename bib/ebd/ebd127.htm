<P><A NAME="000"><B>Euodias</B></A>     A good journey, a female member of the church at Philippi. She was one who laboured much with Paul in the gospel. He exhorts her to be of one mind with Syntyche (<A HREF="../kjv/phi004.htm#002">Phi 4:2</A>). From this it seems they had been at variance with each other.

<P><A NAME="001"><B>Euphrates</B></A>     Hebrew,  Perath ; Assyrian,  Purat ; Persian  cuneiform ,  Ufratush , whence Greek  Euphrates , meaning &quot;sweet water.&quot; The Assyrian name means &quot;the stream,&quot; or &quot;the great stream.&quot; It is generally called in the Bible simply &quot;the river&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/exo023.htm#031">Exo 23:31</A>), or &quot;the great river&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/deu001.htm#007">Deu 1:7</A>). The Euphrates is first mentioned in <A HREF="../kjv/gen002.htm#014">Gen 2:14</A> as one of the rivers of Paradise.       See map, Showing Course of Euphrates     It is next mentioned in connection with the covenant which God entered into with Abraham (<A HREF="../kjv/gen015.htm#018">Gen 15:18</A>), when he promised to his descendants the land from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates (compare <A HREF="../kjv/deu011.htm#024">Deu 11:24</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jos001.htm#004">Jos 1:4</A>), a covenant promise afterwards fulfilled in the extended conquests of David (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2008.htm#002">Sa2 8:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch1018.htm#003">Ch1 18:3</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/kg1004.htm#024">Kg1 4:24</A>). It was then the boundary of the kingdom to the north-east. In the ancient history of Assyria, and Babylon, and Egypt many events are recorded in which mention is made of the &quot;great river.&quot; Just as the Nile represented in prophecy the power of Egypt, so the Euphrates represented the Assyrian power (<A HREF="../kjv/isa008.htm#007">Isa 8:7</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer002.htm#018">Jer 2:18</A>).    It is by far the largest and most important of all the rivers of Western Asia. From its source in the Armenian mountains to the Persian Gulf, into which it empties itself, it has a course of about 1,700 miles. It has two sources,     (1.) the Frat or Kara-su (i.e., &quot;the black river&quot;), which rises 25 miles north-east of Erzeroum; and (2.) the Muradchai (i.e., &quot;the river of desire&quot;), which rises near Ararat, on the northern slope of Ala-tagh. At Kebban Maden, 400 miles from the source of the former, and 270 from that of the latter, they meet and form the majestic stream, which is at length joined by the Tigris at Koornah, after which it is called Shat-el-Arab, which runs in a deep and broad stream for above 140 miles to the sea. It is estimated that the alluvium brought down by these rivers encroaches on the sea at the rate of about one mile in thirty years.

<P><A NAME="002"><B>Euroclydon</B></A>     South-east billow, the name of the wind which blew in the Adriatic Gulf, and which struck the ship in which Paul was wrecked on the coast of Malta (<A HREF="../kjv/act027.htm#014">Act 27:14</A>; R.V., &quot;Euraquilo,&quot; i.e., north-east wind). It is called a &quot;tempestuous wind,&quot; i.e., as literally rendered, a &quot;typhonic wind,&quot; or a typhoon. It is the modern Gregalia or Levanter. (Compare <A HREF="../kjv/jon001.htm#004">Jon 1:4</A>.) 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Eutychus</B></A>     Fortunate, (<A HREF="../kjv/act020.htm#009">Act 20:9</A>), a young man of Troas who fell through drowsiness from the open window of the third floor of the house where Paul was preaching, and was &quot;taken up dead.&quot; The lattice-work of the window being open to admit the air, the lad fell out and down to the court below. Paul restored him to life again. (Compare <A HREF="../kjv/kg1017.htm#021">Kg1 17:21</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/kg2004.htm#034">Kg2 4:34</A>.) 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Evangelist</B></A>     A &quot;publisher of glad tidings;&quot; a missionary preacher of the gospel (<A HREF="../kjv/eph004.htm#011">Eph 4:11</A>). This title is applied to Philip (<A HREF="../kjv/act021.htm#008">Act 21:8</A>), who appears to have gone from city to city preaching the word (<A HREF="../kjv/act008.htm#004">Act 8:4</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/act008.htm#040">Act 8:40</A>). Judging from the case of Philip, evangelists had neither the authority of an apostle, nor the gift of prophecy, nor the responsibility of pastoral supervision over a portion of the flock. They were itinerant preachers, having it as their special function to carry the gospel to places where it was previously unknown. The writers of the four Gospels are known as the Evangelists.

<P><A NAME="005"><B>Eve</B></A>     Life; living, the name given by Adam to his wife (<A HREF="../kjv/gen003.htm#020">Gen 3:20</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gen004.htm#001">Gen 4:1</A>). The account of her creation is given in <A HREF="../kjv/gen002.htm#021">Gen 2:21</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gen002.htm#022">Gen 2:22</A>. The Creator, by declaring that it was not good for man to be alone, and by creating for him a suitable companion, gave sanction to monogamy. The commentator Matthew Henry says: &quot;This companion was taken from his side to signify that she was to be dear unto him as his own flesh. Not from his head, lest she should rule over him; nor from his feet, lest he should tyrannize over her; but from his side, to denote that species of equality which is to subsist in the marriage state.&quot; And again, &quot;That wife that is of God's making by special grace, and of God's bringing by special providence, is likely to prove a help-meet to her husband.&quot; Through the subtle temptation of the serpent she violated the commandment of God by taking of the forbidden fruit, which she gave also unto her husband (<A HREF="../kjv/ti1002.htm#013">Ti1 2:13</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/co2011.htm#003">Co2 11:3</A>). When she gave birth to her first son, she said, &quot;I have gotten a man from the Lord&quot; (R.V., &quot;I have gotten a man with the help of the Lord,&quot; <A HREF="../kjv/gen004.htm#001">Gen 4:1</A>). Thus she welcomed Cain, as some think, as if he had been the Promised One the &quot;Seed of the woman.&quot; 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Evening</B></A>     The period following sunset with which the Jewish day began (<A HREF="../kjv/gen001.htm#005">Gen 1:5</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mar013.htm#035">Mar 13:35</A>). The Hebrews reckoned two evenings of each day, as appears from <A HREF="../kjv/exo016.htm#012">Exo 16:12</A> : <A HREF="../kjv/exo030.htm#008">Exo 30:8</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/exo012.htm#006">Exo 12:6</A> (marg.); <A HREF="../kjv/lev023.htm#005">Lev 23:5</A> (marg. R.V., &quot;between the two evenings&quot;). The &quot;first evening&quot; was that period when the sun was verging towards setting, and the &quot;second evening&quot; the moment of actual sunset. The word &quot;evenings&quot; in <A HREF="../kjv/jer005.htm#006">Jer 5:6</A> should be &quot;deserts&quot; (marg. R.V.). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Everlasting</B></A>     Eternal, applied to God (<A HREF="../kjv/gen021.htm#033">Gen 21:33</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/deu033.htm#027">Deu 33:27</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa041.htm#013">Psa 41:13</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa090.htm#002">Psa 90:2</A>). We also read of the &quot;everlasting hills&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/gen049.htm#026">Gen 49:26</A>); an &quot;everlasting priesthood&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/exo040.htm#015">Exo 40:15</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/num025.htm#013">Num 25:13</A>). (See ETERNAL.) 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Evil eye</B></A>     (<A HREF="../kjv/pro023.htm#006">Pro 23:6</A>), figuratively, the envious or covetous. (Compare <A HREF="../kjv/deu015.htm#009">Deu 15:9</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat020.htm#015">Mat 20:15</A>.) 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Evil-merodach</B></A>     Merodach's man, the son and successor of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2025.htm#027">Kg2 25:27</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer052.htm#031">Jer 52:31</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/jer052.htm#034">Jer 52:34</A>). He seems to have reigned but two years (562-560 B.C.). Influenced probably by Daniel, he showed kindness to Jehoiachin, who had been a prisoner in Babylon for thirty-seven years. He released him, and &quot;spoke kindly to him.&quot; He was murdered by Nergal-sharezer = Neriglissar, his brother-in-law, who succeeded him (<A HREF="../kjv/jer039.htm#003">Jer 39:3</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/jer039.htm#013">Jer 39:13</A>).
