<span id="000">**Jokim**</span> Whom Jehovah has set up, one of the
descendants of Shelah ([Ch1 4:22](../kjv/ch1004.htm#022)).

<span id="001">**Jokmeam**</span> Gathering of the people, a city of
Ephraim, which was given with its suburbs to the Levites ([Ch1
6:68](../kjv/ch1006.htm#068)). It lay somewhere in the Jordan valley
([Kg1 4:12](../kjv/kg1004.htm#012), R.V.; but in A.V. incorrectly
"Jokneam").

<span id="002">**Jokneam**</span> Gathered by the people, ([Jos
19:11](../kjv/jos019.htm#011); [Jos 21:34](../kjv/jos021.htm#034)), a
city "of Carmel" ([Jos 12:22](../kjv/jos012.htm#022)), i.e., on Carmel,
allotted with its suburbs to the Merarite Levites. It is the modern Tell
Kaimon, about 12 miles south-west of Nazareth, on the south of the river
Kishon.

<span id="003">**Jokshan**</span> Snarer, the second son of Abraham and
Keturah ([Gen 25:2](../kjv/gen025.htm#002), [Gen
25:3](../kjv/gen025.htm#003); [Ch1 1:32](../kjv/ch1001.htm#032)).

<span id="004">**Joktan**</span> Little, the second of the two sons of
Eber ([Gen 10:25](../kjv/gen010.htm#025); [Ch1
1:19](../kjv/ch1001.htm#019)). There is an Arab tradition that Joktan
(Arab. Kahtan ) was the progenitor of all the purest tribes of Central
and Southern Arabia.

<span id="005">**Joktheel**</span> Subdued by God. (1.) A city of Judah
near Lachish (Josh. 15, 38). Perhaps the ruin Kutlaneh, south of Gezer.
(2.) Amaziah, king of Judah, undertook a great expedition against Edom
([Ch2 25:5](../kjv/ch2025.htm#005)), which was completely successful. He
routed the Edomites and slew vast numbers of them. So wonderful did this
victory appear to him that he acknowledged that it could have been
achieved only by the special help of God, and therefore he called Selah
(q.v.), their great fortress city, by the name of Joktheel ([Kg2
14:7](../kjv/kg2014.htm#007)).

<span id="006">**Jonadab**</span> =Jehonadab (1.) The son of Rechab, and
founder of the Rechabites (q.v.), [Kg2 10:15](../kjv/kg2010.htm#015);
[Jer 35:6](../kjv/jer035.htm#006), [Jer 35:10](../kjv/jer035.htm#010).
(2.) The son of Shimeah, David's brother ([Sa2
13:3](../kjv/sa2013.htm#003)). He was "a very subtle man."

<span id="007">**Jonah**</span> A dove, the son of Amittai of
Gath-hepher. He was a prophet of Israel, and predicted the restoration
of the ancient boundaries ([Kg2 14:25](../kjv/kg2014.htm#025)) of the
kingdom. He exercised his ministry very early in the reign of Jeroboam
II., and thus was contemporary with Hosea and Amos; or possibly he
preceded them, and consequently may have been the very oldest of all the
prophets whose writings we possess. His personal history is mainly to be
gathered from the book which bears his name. It is chiefly interesting
from the two-fold character in which he appears, (1.) as a missionary to
heathen Nineveh, and (2.) as a type of the "Son of man."

<span id="008">**Jonah, Book of**</span> This book professes to give an
account of what actually took place in the experience of the prophet.
Some critics have sought to interpret the book as a parable or allegory,
and not as a history. They have done so for various reasons. Thus (1.)
some reject it on the ground that the miraculous element enters so
largely into it, and that it is not prophetical but narrative in its
form; (2.) others, denying the possibility of miracles altogether, hold
that therefore it cannot be true history. Jonah and his story is
referred to by our Lord ([Mat 12:39](../kjv/mat012.htm#039), [Mat
12:40](../kjv/mat012.htm#040); [Luk 11:29](../kjv/luk011.htm#029)), a
fact to which the greatest weight must be attached. It is impossible to
interpret this reference on any other theory. This one argument is of
sufficient importance to settle the whole question. No theories devised
for the purpose of getting rid of difficulties can stand against such a
proof that the book is a veritable history. There is every reason to
believe that this book was written by Jonah himself. It gives an account
of (1.) his divine commission to go to Nineveh, his disobedience, and
the punishment following (Jonah 1:1-17); (2.) his prayer and miraculous
deliverance (Jonah 1:17-2:10); (3.) the second commission given to him,
and his prompt obedience in delivering the message from God, and its
results in the repentance of the Ninevites, and God's long-sparing mercy
toward them ([Jon 3:1](../kjv/jon003.htm#001)); (4.) Jonah's displeasure
at God's merciful decision, and the rebuke tendered to the impatient
prophet ([Jon 4:1](../kjv/jon004.htm#001)). Nineveh was spared after
Jonah's mission for more than a century. The history of Jonah may well
be regarded "as a part of that great onward movement which was before
the Law and under the Law; which gained strength and volume as the
fulness of the times drew near." Perowne's Jonah.

<span id="009">**Jonas**</span> (1.) Greek form of Jonah ([Mat
12:39](../kjv/mat012.htm#039), [Mat 12:40](../kjv/mat012.htm#040), [Mat
12:41](../kjv/mat012.htm#041), etc.). (2.) The father of the apostles
Peter ([Joh 21:15](../kjv/joh021.htm#015)) and Andrew; but the reading
should be (also in [Joh 1:42](../kjv/joh001.htm#042)), as in the Revised
Version, "John," instead of Jonas.
