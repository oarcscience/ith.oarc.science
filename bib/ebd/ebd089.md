------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Contentment**</span> A state of mind in which one's
desires are confined to his lot whatever it may be ([Ti1
6:6](../kjv/ti1006.htm#006); [Co2 9:8](../kjv/co2009.htm#008).md). It is
opposed to envy ([Jam 3:16](../kjv/jam003.htm#016).md), avarice ([Heb
13:5](../kjv/heb013.htm#005).md), ambition ([Pro
13:10](../kjv/pro013.htm#010).md), anxiety ([Mat
6:25](../kjv/mat006.htm#025), [Mat 6:34](../kjv/mat006.htm#034).md), and
repining ([Co1 10:10](../kjv/co1010.htm#010).md). It arises from the inward
disposition, and is the offspring of humility, and of an intelligent
consideration of the rectitude and benignity of divine providence ([Psa
96:1](../kjv/psa096.htm#001), [Psa 96:2](../kjv/psa096.htm#002); 145.md),
the greatness of the divine promises ([Pe2 1:4](../kjv/pe2001.htm#004).md),
and our own unworthiness ([Gen 32:10](../kjv/gen032.htm#010).md); as well
as from the view the gospel opens up to us of rest and peace hereafter
([Rom 5:2](../kjv/rom005.htm#002).md).

<span id="001">**Conversation**</span> Generally the goings out and in
of social intercourse ([Eph 2:3](../kjv/eph002.htm#003.md); [Eph
4:22](../kjv/eph004.htm#022); R.V., "manner of life".md); one's deportment
or course of life. This word is never used in Scripture in the sense of
verbal communication from one to another ([Psa
50:23](../kjv/psa050.htm#023); [Heb 13:5](../kjv/heb013.htm#005).md). In
[Phi 1:27](../kjv/phi001.htm#027); [Phi 3:20](../kjv/phi003.htm#020.md), a
different Greek word is used. It there means one's relations to a
community as a citizen, i.e., citizenship.

<span id="002">**Conversion**</span> The turning of a sinner to God
([Act 15:3](../kjv/act015.htm#003).md). In a general sense the heathen are
said to be "converted" when they abandon heathenism and embrace the
Christian faith; and in a more special sense men are converted when, by
the influence of divine grace in their souls, their whole life is
changed, old things pass away, and all things become new ([Act
26:18](../kjv/act026.htm#018).md). Thus we speak of the conversion of the
Philippian jailer (Acts 16:19-34), of Paul (Acts 9:1-22), of the
Ethiopian treasurer ([Act 8:26](../kjv/act008.htm#026).md), of Cornelius
(Acts 10), of Lydia ([Act 16:13](../kjv/act016.htm#013).md), and others.
(See REGENERATION.)

<span id="003">**Convocation**</span> A meeting of a religious character
as distinguished from congregation, which was more general, dealing with
political and legal matters. Hence it is called an "holy convocation."
Such convocations were the Sabbaths ([Lev 23:2](../kjv/lev023.htm#002.md),
[Lev 23:3](../kjv/lev023.htm#003).md), the Passover ([Exo
12:16](../kjv/exo012.htm#016); [Lev 23:7](../kjv/lev023.htm#007.md), [Lev
23:8](../kjv/lev023.htm#008); [Num 28:25](../kjv/num028.htm#025).md),
Pentecost ([Lev 23:21](../kjv/lev023.htm#021).md), the feast of Trumpets
([Lev 23:24](../kjv/lev023.htm#024); [Num 29:1](../kjv/num029.htm#001).md),
the feast of Weeks ([Num 28:26](../kjv/num028.htm#026).md), and the feast
of Tabernacles ([Lev 23:35](../kjv/lev023.htm#035.md), [Lev
23:36](../kjv/lev023.htm#036).md). The great fast, the annual day of
atonement, was "the holy convocation" ([Lev
23:27](../kjv/lev023.htm#027); [Num 29:7](../kjv/num029.htm#007).md).

<span id="004">**Cook**</span> A person employed to perform culinary
service. In early times among the Hebrews cooking was performed by the
mistress of the household ([Gen 18:2](../kjv/gen018.htm#002.md); [Jdg
6:19](../kjv/jdg006.htm#019).md), and the process was very expeditiously
performed ([Gen 27:3](../kjv/gen027.htm#003.md), [Gen
27:4](../kjv/gen027.htm#004), [Gen 27:9](../kjv/gen027.htm#009.md), [Gen
27:10](../kjv/gen027.htm#010).md). Professional cooks were afterwards
employed ([Sa1 8:13](../kjv/sa1008.htm#013.md); [Sa1
9:23](../kjv/sa1009.htm#023).md). Few animals, as a rule, were slaughtered
(other than sacrifices), except for purposes of hospitality ([Gen
18:7](../kjv/gen018.htm#007); [Luk 15:23](../kjv/luk015.htm#023).md). The
paschal lamb was roasted over a fire ([Exo 12:8](../kjv/exo012.htm#008.md),
[Exo 12:9](../kjv/exo012.htm#009); [Ch2 35:13](../kjv/ch2035.htm#013).md).
Cooking by boiling was the usual method adopted ([Lev
8:31](../kjv/lev008.htm#031); [Exo 16:23](../kjv/exo016.htm#023).md). No
cooking took place on the Sabbath day ([Exo
35:3](../kjv/exo035.htm#003).md).

<span id="005">**Coos**</span> (Written Cos in the R.V.) A small island,
one of the Sporades in the Aegean Sea, in the north-west of Rhodes, off
the coast of Caria. Paul on his return from his third missionary
journey, passed the night here after sailing from Miletus ([Act
21:1](../kjv/act021.htm#001).md). It is now called Stanchio.

<span id="006">**Copper**</span> Derived from the Greek kupros (the
island of Cyprus), called "Cyprian brass," occurs only in the Authorized
Version in [Ezr 8:27](../kjv/ezr008.htm#027.md). Elsewhere the Hebrew word
(nehosheth) is improperly rendered "brass," and sometimes "steel" ([Sa2
22:35](../kjv/sa2022.htm#035); [Jer 15:12](../kjv/jer015.htm#012).md). The
"bow of steel" ([Job 20:24](../kjv/job020.htm#024.md); [Psa
18:34](../kjv/psa018.htm#034)\].md)should have been "bow of copper" (or
"brass," as in the R.V.). The vessels of "fine copper" of [Ezr
8:27](../kjv/ezr008.htm#027.md) were probably similar to those of "bright
brass" mentioned in [Kg1 7:45](../kjv/kg1007.htm#045.md); [Dan
10:6](../kjv/dan010.htm#006.md). Tubal-cain was the first artificer in
brass and iron ([Gen 4:22](../kjv/gen004.htm#022).md). Hiram was noted as a
worker in brass ([Kg1 7:14](../kjv/kg1007.htm#014).md). Copper abounded in
Palestine ([Deu 8:9](../kjv/deu008.htm#009.md); [Isa
60:17](../kjv/isa060.htm#017); [Ch1 22:3](../kjv/ch1022.htm#003.md), [Ch1
22:14](../kjv/ch1022.htm#014).md). All sorts of vessels in the tabernacle
and the temple were made of it ([Lev 6:28](../kjv/lev006.htm#028.md); [Num
16:39](../kjv/num016.htm#039); [Ch2 4:16](../kjv/ch2004.htm#016.md); [Ezr
8:27](../kjv/ezr008.htm#027).md); also weapons of war ([Sa1
17:5](../kjv/sa1017.htm#005), [Sa1 17:6](../kjv/sa1017.htm#006.md), [Sa1
17:38](../kjv/sa1017.htm#038); [Sa2 21:16](../kjv/sa2021.htm#016).md). Iron
is mentioned only four times ([Gen 4:22](../kjv/gen004.htm#022.md); [Lev
26:19](../kjv/lev026.htm#019); [Num 31:22](../kjv/num031.htm#022.md); [Num
35:16](../kjv/num035.htm#016).md) in the first four books of Moses, while
copper (rendered "brass") is mentioned forty times. (See BRASS.) We find
mention of Alexander (q.v.), a "coppersmith" of Ephesus ([Ti2
4:14](../kjv/ti2004.htm#014).md).

<span id="007">**Cor**</span> This Hebrew word, untranslated, denotes a
round vessel used as a measure both for liquids and solids. It was equal
to one homer, and contained ten ephahs in dry and ten baths in liquid
measure ([Eze 45:14](../kjv/eze045.htm#014).md). The Rabbins estimated the
cor at forty-five gallons, while Josephus estimated it at about
eighty-seven. In [Kg1 4:22](../kjv/kg1004.htm#022.md); [Kg1
5:11](../kjv/kg1005.htm#011); [Ch2 2:10](../kjv/ch2002.htm#010.md); [Ch2
27:5](../kjv/ch2027.htm#005.md), the original word is rendered "measure."

<span id="008">**Coral**</span> Heb. ramoth , meaning "heights;" i.e.,
"high-priced" or valuable things, or, as some suppose, "that which grows
high," like a tree ([Job 28:18](../kjv/job028.htm#018.md); [Eze
27:16](../kjv/eze027.htm#016).md), according to the Rabbins, red coral,
which was in use for ornaments. The coral is a cretaceous marine
product, the deposit by minute polypous animals of calcareous matter in
cells in which the animal lives. It is of numberless shapes as it grows,
but usually is branched like a tree. Great coral reefs +and coral
islands abound in the Red Sea, whence probably the Hebrews derived their
knowledge of it. It is found of different colours, white, black, and
red. The red, being esteemed the most precious, was used, as noticed
above, for ornamental purposes.

<span id="009">**Corban**</span> A Hebrew word adopted into the Greek of
the New Testament and left untranslated. It occurs only once ([Mar
7:11](../kjv/mar007.htm#011).md). It means a gift or offering consecrated
to God. Anything over which this word was once pronounced was
irrevocably dedicated to the temple. Land, however, so dedicated might
be redeemed before the year of jubilee ([Lev
27:16](../kjv/lev027.htm#016).md). Our Lord condemns the Pharisees for
their false doctrine, inasmuch as by their traditions they had destroyed
the commandment which requires children to honour their father and
mother, teaching them to find excuse from helping their parents by the
device of pronouncing "Corban" over their goods, thus reserving them to
their own selfish use.
