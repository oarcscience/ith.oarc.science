<span id="000">**Fable**</span> Applied in the New Testament to the
traditions and speculations, "cunningly devised fables", of the Jews on
religious questions ([Ti1 1:4](../kjv/ti1001.htm#004.md); [Ti1
4:7](../kjv/ti1004.htm#007); [Ti2 4:4](../kjv/ti2004.htm#004.md); [Tit
1:14](../kjv/tit001.htm#014); [Pe2 1:16](../kjv/pe2001.htm#016).md). In
such passages the word means anything false and unreal. But the word is
used as almost equivalent to parable. Thus we have (1.) the fable of
Jotham, in which the trees are spoken of as choosing a king ([Jdg
9:8](../kjv/jdg009.htm#008)); and (2..md) that of the cedars of Lebanon and
the thistle as Jehoash's answer to Amaziah ([Kg2
14:9](../kjv/kg2014.htm#009).md).

<span id="001">**Face**</span> Means simply presence, as when it is
recorded that Adam and Eve hid themselves from the "face \[R.V.,
'presence'\] of the Lord God" ([Gen 3:8](../kjv/gen003.htm#008.md); compare
[Exo 33:14](../kjv/exo033.htm#014), [Exo 33:15](../kjv/exo033.htm#015.md),
where the same Hebrew word is rendered "presence"). The "light of God's
countenance" is his favour ([Psa 44:3](../kjv/psa044.htm#003.md); [Dan
9:17](../kjv/dan009.htm#017).md). "Face" signifies also anger, justice,
severity ([Gen 16:6](../kjv/gen016.htm#006.md), [Gen
16:8](../kjv/gen016.htm#008); [Exo 2:15](../kjv/exo002.htm#015.md); [Psa
68:1](../kjv/psa068.htm#001); [Rev 6:16](../kjv/rev006.htm#016).md). To
"provoke God to his face" ([Isa 65:3](../kjv/isa065.htm#003).md) is to sin
against him openly. The Jews prayed with their faces toward the temple
and Jerusalem ([Kg1 8:38](../kjv/kg1008.htm#038.md), [Kg1
8:44](../kjv/kg1008.htm#044), [Kg1 8:48](../kjv/kg1008.htm#048.md); [Dan
6:10](../kjv/dan006.htm#010).md). To "see God's face" is to have access to
him and to enjoy his favour ([Psa 17:15](../kjv/psa017.htm#015.md); [Psa
27:8](../kjv/psa027.htm#008).md). This is the privilege of holy angels
([Mat 18:10](../kjv/mat018.htm#010); [Luk 1:19](../kjv/luk001.htm#019).md).
The "face of Jesus Christ" ([Co2 4:6](../kjv/co2004.htm#006).md) is the
office and person of Christ, the revealer of the glory of God ([Joh
1:14](../kjv/joh001.htm#014), [Joh 1:18](../kjv/joh001.htm#018).md).

<span id="002">**Fair Heavens**</span> A harbour in the south of Crete,
some 5 miles to the east of which was the town of Lasea ([Act
27:8](../kjv/act027.htm#008).md). Here the ship of Alexandria in which Paul
and his companions sailed was detained a considerable time waiting for a
favourable wind. Contrary to Paul's advice, the master of the ship
determined to prosecute the voyage, as the harbour was deemed
incommodious for wintering in ([Act 27:9](../kjv/act027.htm#009).md). The
result was that, after a stormy voyage, the vessel was finally wrecked
on the coast of Malta ([Act 27:40](../kjv/act027.htm#040).md).

<span id="003">**Fairs**</span> (Heb. 'izabhonim ), found seven times in
Ezek. 27, and nowhere else. The Authorized Version renders the word thus
in all these instances, except in [Eze 27:33](../kjv/eze027.htm#033.md),
where "wares" is used. The Revised Version uniformly renders by "wares,"
which is the correct rendering of the Hebrew word. It never means
"fairs" in the modern sense of the word.

<span id="004">**Faith**</span> Faith is in general the persuasion of
the mind that a certain statement is true ([Phi
1:27](../kjv/phi001.htm#027); [Th2 2:13](../kjv/th2002.htm#013).md). Its
primary idea is trust. A thing is true, and therefore worthy of trust.
It admits of many degrees up to full assurance of faith, in accordance
with the evidence on which it rests. Faith is the result of teaching
([Rom 10:14](../kjv/rom010.htm#014).md). Knowledge is an essential element
in all faith, and is sometimes spoken of as an equivalent to faith ([Joh
10:38](../kjv/joh010.htm#038); [Jo1 2:3](../kjv/jo1002.htm#003).md). Yet
the two are distinguished in this respect, that faith includes in it
assent, which is an act of the will in addition to the act of the
understanding Assent to the truth is of the essence of faith, and the
ultimate ground on which our assent to any revealed truth rests is the
veracity of God. Historical faith is the apprehension of and assent to
certain statements which are regarded as mere facts of history.
Temporary faith is that state of mind which is awakened in men (e.g.,
Felix) by the exhibition of the truth and by the influence of religious
sympathy, or by what is sometimes styled the common operation of the
Holy Spirit. Saving faith is so called because it has eternal life
inseparably connected with it. It cannot be better defined than in the
words of the Assembly's Shorter Catechism: "Faith in Jesus Christ is a
saving grace, whereby we receive and rest upon him alone for salvation,
as he is offered to us in the gospel." The object of saving faith is the
whole revealed Word of God. Faith accepts and believes it as the very
truth most sure. But the special act of faith which unites to Christ has
as its object the person and the work of the Lord Jesus Christ ([Joh
7:38](../kjv/joh007.htm#038); [Act 16:31](../kjv/act016.htm#031).md). This
is the specific act of faith by which a sinner is justified before God
([Rom 3:22](../kjv/rom003.htm#022), [Rom 3:25](../kjv/rom003.htm#025.md);
[Gal 2:16](../kjv/gal002.htm#016); [Phi 3:9](../kjv/phi003.htm#009.md);
John 3:16-36; [Act 10:43](../kjv/act010.htm#043.md); [Act
16:31](../kjv/act016.htm#031).md). In this act of faith the believer
appropriates and rests on Christ alone as Mediator in all his offices.
This assent to or belief in the truth received upon the divine testimony
has always associated with it a deep sense of sin, a distinct view of
Christ, a consenting will, and a loving heart, together with a reliance
on, a trusting in, or resting in Christ. It is that state of mind in
which a poor sinner, conscious of his sin, flees from his guilty self to
Christ his Saviour, and rolls over the burden of all his sins on him. It
consists chiefly, not in the assent given to the testimony of God in his
Word, but in embracing with fiducial reliance and trust the one and only
Saviour whom God reveals. This trust and reliance is of the essence of
faith. By faith the believer directly and immediately appropriates
Christ as his own. Faith in its direct act makes Christ ours. It is not
a work which God graciously accepts instead of perfect obedience, but is
only the hand by which we take hold of the person and work of our
Redeemer as the only ground of our salvation. Saving faith is a moral
act, as it proceeds from a renewed will, and a renewed will is necessary
to believing assent to the truth of God ([Co1
2:14](../kjv/co1002.htm#014); [Co2 4:4](../kjv/co2004.htm#004).md). Faith,
therefore, has its seat in the moral part of our nature fully as much as
in the intellectual. The mind must first be enlightened by divine
teaching ([Joh 6:44](../kjv/joh006.htm#044.md); [Act
13:48](../kjv/act013.htm#048); [Co2 4:6](../kjv/co2004.htm#006.md); [Eph
1:17](../kjv/eph001.htm#017), [Eph 1:18](../kjv/eph001.htm#018).md) before
it can discern the things of the Spirit. Faith is necessary to our
salvation ([Mar 16:16](../kjv/mar016.htm#016).md), not because there is any
merit in it, but simply because it is the sinner's taking the place
assigned him by God, his falling in with what God is doing. The warrant
or ground of faith is the divine testimony, not the reasonableness of
what God says, but the simple fact that he says it. Faith rests
immediately on, "Thus saith the Lord." But in order to this faith the
veracity, sincerity, and truth of God must be owned and appreciated,
together with his unchangeableness. God's word encourages and emboldens
the sinner personally to transact with Christ as God's gift, to close
with him, embrace him, give himself to Christ, and take Christ as his.
That word comes with power, for it is the word of God who has revealed
himself in his works, and especially in the cross. God is to be believed
for his word's sake, but also for his name's sake. Faith in Christ
secures for the believer freedom from condemnation, or justification
before God; a participation in the life that is in Christ, the divine
life ([Joh 14:19](../kjv/joh014.htm#019.md); [Rom
6:4](../kjv/rom006.htm#004); [Eph 4:15](../kjv/eph004.htm#015.md), [Eph
4:16](../kjv/eph004.htm#016), etc..md); "peace with God" ([Rom
5:1](../kjv/rom005.htm#001).md); and sanctification ([Act
26:18](../kjv/act026.htm#018); [Gal 5:6](../kjv/gal005.htm#006.md); [Act
15:9](../kjv/act015.htm#009).md). All who thus believe in Christ will
certainly be saved ([Joh 6:37](../kjv/joh006.htm#037.md), [Joh
6:40](../kjv/joh006.htm#040); [Joh 10:27](../kjv/joh010.htm#027.md), [Joh
10:28](../kjv/joh010.htm#028); [Rom 8:1](../kjv/rom008.htm#001).md). The
faith = the gospel ([Act 6:7](../kjv/act006.htm#007.md); [Rom
1:5](../kjv/rom001.htm#005); [Gal 1:23](../kjv/gal001.htm#023.md); [Ti1
3:9](../kjv/ti1003.htm#009); [Jde 1:3](../kjv/jde001.htm#003).md).

<span id="005">**Faithful**</span> As a designation of Christians, means
full of faith, trustful, and not simply trustworthy ([Act
10:45](../kjv/act010.htm#045); [Act 16:1](../kjv/act016.htm#001.md); [Co2
6:15](../kjv/co2006.htm#015); [Col 1:2](../kjv/col001.htm#002.md); [Ti1
4:3](../kjv/ti1004.htm#003), [Ti1 4:12](../kjv/ti1004.htm#012.md); [Ti1
5:16](../kjv/ti1005.htm#016); [Ti1 6:2](../kjv/ti1006.htm#002.md); [Tit
1:6](../kjv/tit001.htm#006); [Eph 1:1](../kjv/eph001.htm#001.md); [Co1
4:17](../kjv/co1004.htm#017), etc..md). It is used also of God's word or
covenant as true and to be trusted ([Psa 119:86](../kjv/psa119.htm#086.md),
[Psa 119:138](../kjv/psa119.htm#138); [Isa 25:1](../kjv/isa025.htm#001.md);
[Ti1 1:15](../kjv/ti1001.htm#015); [Rev 21:5](../kjv/rev021.htm#005.md);
[Rev 22:6](../kjv/rev022.htm#006), etc..md).

<span id="006">**Fall of Man**</span> An expression probably borrowed
from the Apocryphal Book of Wisdom, to express the fact of the revolt of
our first parents from God, and the consequent sin and misery in which
they and all their posterity were involved. The history of the Fall is
recorded in Gen. 2 and 3. That history is to be literally interpreted.
It records facts which underlie the whole system of revealed truth. It
is referred to by our Lord and his apostles not only as being true, but
as furnishing the ground of all God's subsequent dispensations and
dealings with the children of men. The record of Adam's temptation and
fall must be taken as a true historical account, if we are to understand
the Bible at all as a revelation of God's purpose of mercy. The effects
of this first sin upon our first parents themselves were (1.) "shame, a
sense of degradation and pollution; (2.) dread of the displeasure of
God, or a sense of guilt, and the consequent desire to hide from his
presence. These effects were unavoidable. They prove the loss not only
of innocence but of original righteousness, and, with it, of the favour
and fellowship of God. The state therefore to which Adam was reduced by
his disobedience, so far as his subjective condition is concerned, was
analogous to that of the fallen angels. He was entirely and absolutely
ruined" (Hodge's Theology). But the unbelief and disobedience of our
first parents brought not only on themselves this misery and ruin, it
entailed also the same sad consequences on all their descendants. (1.)
The guilt, i.e., liability to punishment, of that sin comes by
imputation upon all men, because all were represented by Adam in the
covenant of works (q.v.). (See IMPUTATION.) (2.) Hence, also, all his
descendants inherit a corrupt nature. In all by nature there is an
inherent and prevailing tendency to sin. This universal depravity is
taught by universal experience. All men sin as soon as they are capable
of moral actions. The testimony of the Scriptures to the same effects is
most abundant (Rom. 1; 2; 3:1-19, etc.). (3.) This innate depravity is
total: we are by nature "dead in trespasses and sins," and must be "born
again" before we can enter into the kingdom ([Joh
3:7](../kjv/joh003.htm#007), etc.). (4..md) Resulting from this "corruption
of our whole nature" is our absolute moral inability to change our
nature or to obey the law of God. Commenting on [Joh
9:3](../kjv/joh009.htm#003.md), Ryle well remarks: "A deep and instructive
principle lies in these words. They surely throw some light on that
great question, the origin of evil. God has thought fit to allow evil to
exist in order that he may have a platform for showing his mercy, grace,
and compassion. If man had never fallen there would have been no
opportunity of showing divine mercy. But by permitting evil, mysterious
as it seems, God's works of grace, mercy, and wisdom in saving sinners
have been wonderfully manifested to all his creatures. The redeeming of
the church of elect sinners is the means of 'showing to principalities
and powers the manifold wisdom of God' ([Eph
3:10](../kjv/eph003.htm#010).md). Without the Fall we should have known
nothing of the Cross and the Gospel." On the monuments of Egypt are
found representations of a deity in human form, piercing with a spear
the head of a serpent. This is regarded as an illustration of the wide
dissemination of the tradition of the Fall. The story of the "golden
age," which gives place to the "iron age", the age of purity and
innocence, which is followed by a time when man becomes a prey to sin
and misery, as represented in the mythology of Greece and Rome, has also
been regarded as a tradition of the Fall.

<span id="007">**Fallow-deer**</span> [Deu 14:5](../kjv/deu014.htm#005.md)
(R.V., "Wild goat"); [Kg1 4:23](../kjv/kg1004.htm#023.md) (R.V.,
"roebucks"). This animal, called in Hebrew yahmur, from a word meaning
"to be red," is regarded by some as the common fallow-deer, the Cervus
dama, which is said to be found very generally over Western and Southern
Asia. It is called "fallow" from its pale-red or yellow colour. Some
interpreters, however, regard the name as designating the bubale,
Antelope bubale, the "wild cow" of North Africa, which is about the size
of a stag, like the hartebeest of South Africa. A species of deer has
been found at Mount Carmel which is called yahmur by the Arabs. It is
said to be similar to the European roebuck.

<span id="008">**Fallow-ground**</span> The expression, "Break up your
fallow ground" ([Hos 10:12](../kjv/hos010.htm#012.md); [Jer
4:3](../kjv/jer004.htm#003).md) means, "Do not sow your seed among thorns",
i.e., break off all your evil habits; clear your hearts of weeds, in
order that they may be prepared for the seed of righteousness. Land was
allowed to lie fallow that it might become more fruitful; but when in
this condition, it soon became overgrown with thorns and weeds. The
cultivator of the soil was careful to "break up" his fallow ground,
i.e., to clear the field of weeds, before sowing seed in it. So says the
prophet, "Break off your evil ways, repent of your sins, cease to do
evil, and then the good seed of the word will have room to grow and bear
fruit."

<span id="009">**Familiar Spirit**</span> Sorcerers or necormancers, who
professed to call up the dead to answer questions, were said to have a
"familiar spirit" ([Deu 18:11](../kjv/deu018.htm#011.md); [Kg2
21:6](../kjv/kg2021.htm#006); [Ch2 33:6](../kjv/ch2033.htm#006.md); [Lev
19:31](../kjv/lev019.htm#031); [Lev 20:6](../kjv/lev020.htm#006.md); [Isa
8:19](../kjv/isa008.htm#019); [Isa 29:4](../kjv/isa029.htm#004).md). Such a
person was called by the Hebrews an 'ob , which properly means a leather
bottle; for sorcerers were regarded as vessels containing the inspiring
demon. This Hebrew word was equivalent to the pytho of the Greeks, and
was used to denote both the person and the spirit which possessed him
([Lev 20:27](../kjv/lev020.htm#027); [Sa1 28:8](../kjv/sa1028.htm#008.md);
compare [Act 16:16](../kjv/act016.htm#016).md). The word "familiar" is from
the Latin familiaris , meaning a "household servant," and was intended
to express the idea that sorcerers had spirits as their servants ready
to obey their commands.
