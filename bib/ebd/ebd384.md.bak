<span id="000">**Worm**</span> (1.) Heb. sas ([Isa
51:8](../kjv/isa051.htm#008).md), denotes the caterpillar of the
clothes-moth. (2.) The manna bred worms ( tola'im ), but on the Sabbath
there was not any worm ( rimmah ) therein ([Exo
16:20](../kjv/exo016.htm#020), [Exo 16:24](../kjv/exo016.htm#024).md). Here
these words refer to caterpillars or larvae, which feed on corrupting
matter. These two Hebrew words appear to be interchangeable ([Job
25:6](../kjv/job025.htm#006); [Isa 14:11](../kjv/isa014.htm#011).md).
Tola'im in some places denotes the caterpillar ([Deu
28:39](../kjv/deu028.htm#039); [Jon 4:7](../kjv/jon004.htm#007).md), and
rimmah , the larvae, as bred from putridity ([Job
17:14](../kjv/job017.htm#014); [Job 21:26](../kjv/job021.htm#026.md); [Job
24:20](../kjv/job024.htm#020)). In [Mic 7:17](../kjv/mic007.htm#017.md),
where it is said, "They shall move out of their holes like worms,"
perhaps serpents or "creeping things," or as in the Revised Version,
"crawling things," are meant. The word is used figuratively in [Job
25:6](../kjv/job025.htm#006); [Psa 22:6](../kjv/psa022.htm#006.md); [Isa
41:14](../kjv/isa041.htm#014); [Mar 9:44](../kjv/mar009.htm#044.md), [Mar
9:46](../kjv/mar009.htm#046), [Mar 9:48](../kjv/mar009.htm#048.md); [Isa
66:24](../kjv/isa066.htm#024.md).

<span id="001">**Wormwood**</span> Heb. la'anah , the Artemisia
absinthium of botanists. It is noted for its intense bitterness ([Deu
29:18](../kjv/deu029.htm#018); [Pro 5:4](../kjv/pro005.htm#004.md); [Jer
9:15](../kjv/jer009.htm#015); [Amo 5:7](../kjv/amo005.htm#007).md). It is a
type of bitterness, affliction, remorse, punitive suffering. In [Amo
6:12](../kjv/amo006.htm#012.md) this Hebrew word is rendered "hemlock"
(R.V., "wormwood"). In the symbolical language of the Apocalypse ([Rev
8:10](../kjv/rev008.htm#010), [Rev 8:11](../kjv/rev008.htm#011).md) a star
is represented as falling on the waters of the earth, causing the third
part of the water to turn wormwood. The name by which the Greeks
designated it, absinthion , means "undrinkable." The absinthe of France
is distilled from a species of this plant. The "southernwood" or "old
man," cultivated in cottage gardens on account of its fragrance, is
another species of it.

<span id="002">**Worship**</span> Homage rendered to God which it is
sinful (idolatry) to render to any created being ([Exo
34:14](../kjv/exo034.htm#014); [Isa 2:8](../kjv/isa002.htm#008).md). Such
worship was refused by Peter ([Act 10:25](../kjv/act010.htm#025.md), [Act
10:26](../kjv/act010.htm#026).md) and by an angel ([Rev
22:8](../kjv/rev022.htm#008), [Rev 22:9](../kjv/rev022.htm#009).md).

<span id="003">**Worshipper**</span> (Gr. neocoros = temple sweeper
\[[Act 19:35](../kjv/act019.htm#035)\] of the great goddess Diana.md). This
name neocoros appears on most of the extant Ephesian coins

<span id="004">**Wrestle**</span> ([Eph 6:12](../kjv/eph006.htm#012).md).
See GAMES.

<span id="005">**Writing**</span> The art of writing must have been
known in the time of the early Pharaohs. Moses is commanded "to write
for a memorial in a book" ([Exo 17:14](../kjv/exo017.htm#014).md) a record
of the attack of Amalek. Frequent mention is afterwards made of writing
([Exo 28:11](../kjv/exo028.htm#011), [Exo 28:21](../kjv/exo028.htm#021.md),
[Exo 28:29](../kjv/exo028.htm#029), [Exo 28:36](../kjv/exo028.htm#036.md);
[Exo 31:18](../kjv/exo031.htm#018); [Exo 32:15](../kjv/exo032.htm#015.md),
[Exo 32:16](../kjv/exo032.htm#016); [Exo 34:1](../kjv/exo034.htm#001.md),
[Exo 34:28](../kjv/exo034.htm#028); [Exo 39:6](../kjv/exo039.htm#006.md),
[Exo 39:14](../kjv/exo039.htm#014), [Exo 39:30](../kjv/exo039.htm#030).md).
The origin of this art is unknown, but there is reason to conclude that
in the age of Moses it was well known. The inspired books of Moses are
the most ancient extant writings, although there are written monuments
as old as about B.C.2000. The words expressive of "writing," "book," and
"ink," are common to all the branches or dialects of the Semitic
language, and hence it has been concluded that this art must have been
known to the earliest Semites before they separated into their various
tribes, and nations, and families. "The Old Testament and the
discoveries of Oriental archaeology alike tell us that the age of the
Exodus was throughout the world of Western Asia an age of literature and
books, of readers and writers, and that the cities of Palestine were
stored with the contemporaneous records of past events inscribed on
imperishable clay. They further tell us that the kinsfolk and neighbours
of the Israelites were already acquainted with alphabetic writing, that
the wanderers in the desert and the tribes of Edom were in contact with
the cultured scribes and traders of Ma'in \[Southern Arabia\], and that
the 'house of bondage' from which Israel had escaped was a land where
the art of writing was blazoned not only on the temples of the gods, but
also on the dwellings of the rich and powerful." Sayce. (See DEBIR;
PHOENICIA.) The "Book of the Dead" was a collection of prayers and
formulae, by the use of which the souls of the dead were supposed to
attain to rest and peace in the next world. It was composed at various
periods from the earliest time to the Persian conquest. It affords an
interesting glimpse into the religious life and system of belief among
the ancient Egyptians. We learn from it that they believed in the
existence of one Supreme Being, the immortality of the soul, judgment
after death, and the resurrection of the body. It shows, too, a high
state of literary activity in Egypt in the time of Moses. It refers to
extensive libraries then existing. That of Ramessium, in Thebes, e.g.,
built by Rameses II., contained 20,000 books. When the Hebrews entered
Canaan it is evident that the art of writing was known to the original
inhabitants, as appears, e.g., from the name of the city Debir having
been at first Kirjath-sepher, i.e., the "city of the book," or the "book
town" ([Jos 10:38](../kjv/jos010.htm#038.md); [Jos
15:15](../kjv/jos015.htm#015); [Jdg 1:11](../kjv/jdg001.htm#011).md). The
first mention of letter-writing is in the time of David ([Sa2
11:14](../kjv/sa2011.htm#014), [Sa2 11:15](../kjv/sa2011.htm#015).md).
Letters are afterwards frequently spoken of ([Kg1
21:8](../kjv/kg1021.htm#008), [Kg1 21:9](../kjv/kg1021.htm#009.md), [Kg1
21:11](../kjv/kg1021.htm#011); [Kg2 10:1](../kjv/kg2010.htm#001.md), [Kg2
10:3](../kjv/kg2010.htm#003), [Kg2 10:6](../kjv/kg2010.htm#006.md), [Kg2
10:7](../kjv/kg2010.htm#007); [Kg2 19:14](../kjv/kg2019.htm#014.md); [Ch2
21:12](../kjv/ch2021.htm#012); [Ch2 30:1](../kjv/ch2030.htm#001.md), [Ch2
30:6](../kjv/ch2030.htm#006), etc..md).

<span id="006">**Yarn**</span> Found only in [Kg1
10:28](../kjv/kg1010.htm#028), [Ch2 1:16](../kjv/ch2001.htm#016.md). The
Heb. word mikveh , i.e., "a stringing together," so rendered, rather
signifies a host, or company, or a string of horses. The Authorized
Version has: "And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen
yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price;" but the
Revised Version correctly renders: "And the horses which Solomon had
were brought out of Egypt; the king's merchants received them in droves,
each drove at a price."

<span id="007">**Year**</span> Heb. shanah , meaning "repetition" or
"revolution" ([Gen 1:14](../kjv/gen001.htm#014.md); [Gen
5:3](../kjv/gen005.htm#003).md). Among the ancient Egyptians the year
consisted of twelve months of thirty days each, with five days added to
make it a complete revolution of the earth round the sun. The Jews
reckoned the year in two ways, (1.) according to a sacred calendar, in
which the year began about the time of the vernal equinox, with the
month Abib; and (2.) according to a civil calendar, in which the year
began about the time of the autumnal equinox, with the month Nisan. The
month Tisri is now the beginning of the Jewish year.

<span id="008">**Yeshebi**</span> The Hebrew word rendered "inhabitants"
in [Jos 17:7](../kjv/jos017.htm#007.md), but probably rather the name of
the village Yeshepheh, probably Yassuf, 8 miles south of Shechem.

<span id="009">**Yoke**</span> (1.) Fitted on the neck of oxen for the
purpose of binding to them the traces by which they might draw the
plough, etc. ([Num 19:2](../kjv/num019.htm#002.md); [Deu
21:3](../kjv/deu021.htm#003).md). It was a curved piece of wood called 'ol
. (2.) In [Jer 27:2](../kjv/jer027.htm#002.md); [Jer
28:10](../kjv/jer028.htm#010), [Jer 28:12](../kjv/jer028.htm#012.md) the
word in the Authorized Version rendered "yoke" is motah , which properly
means a "staff," or as in the Revised Version, "bar." These words in the
Hebrew are both used figuratively of severe bondage, or affliction, or
subjection ([Lev 26:13](../kjv/lev026.htm#013.md); [Kg1
12:4](../kjv/kg1012.htm#004); [Isa 47:6](../kjv/isa047.htm#006.md); [Lam
1:14](../kjv/lam001.htm#014); [Lam 3:27](../kjv/lam003.htm#027).md). In the
New Testament the word "yoke" is also used to denote servitude ([Mat
11:29](../kjv/mat011.htm#029), [Mat 11:30](../kjv/mat011.htm#030.md); [Act
15:10](../kjv/act015.htm#010); [Gal 5:1](../kjv/gal005.htm#001)). (3..md)
In [Sa1 11:7](../kjv/sa1011.htm#007.md), [Kg1
19:21](../kjv/kg1019.htm#021), [Job 1:3](../kjv/job001.htm#003.md) the word
thus translated is tzemed , which signifies a pair, two oxen yoked or
coupled together, and hence in [Sa1 14:14](../kjv/sa1014.htm#014.md) it
represents as much land as a yoke of oxen could plough in a day, like
the Latin jugum . In [Isa 5:10](../kjv/isa005.htm#010.md) this word in the
plural is translated "acres."
