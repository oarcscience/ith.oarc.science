<span id="000">**Sidon**</span> Fishing; fishery, [Gen
10:15](../kjv/gen010.htm#015), [Gen 10:19](../kjv/gen010.htm#019.md) (A.V.
marg., Tzidon; R.V., Zidon); [Mat 11:21](../kjv/mat011.htm#021.md), [Mat
11:22](../kjv/mat011.htm#022); [Luk 6:17](../kjv/luk006.htm#017.md). (See
ZIDON.)

<span id="001">**Signet**</span> A seal used to attest documents ([Dan
6:8](../kjv/dan006.htm#008), [Dan 6:12](../kjv/dan006.htm#012).md). In [Dan
6:17](../kjv/dan006.htm#017.md), this word properly denotes a ring. The
impression of a signet ring on fine clay has recently been discovered
among the ruins at Nineveh. It bears the name and title of an Egyptian
king. Two actual signet rings of ancient Egyptian monarchs (Cheops and
Horus) have also been discovered. When digging a shaft close to the
south wall of the temple area, the engineers of the Palestine
Exploration Fund, at a depth of 12 feet below the surface, came upon a
pavement of polished stones, formerly one of the streets of the city.
Under this pavement they found a stratum of 16 feet of concrete, and
among this concrete, 10 feet down, they found a signet stone bearing the
inscription, in Old Hebrew characters, "Haggai, son of Shebaniah." It
has been asked, Might not this be the actual seal of Haggai the prophet?
We know that he was in Jerusalem after the Captivity; and it is somewhat
singular that he alone of all the minor prophets makes mention of a
signet ([Hag 2:23](../kjv/hag002.htm#023)). (See SEAL..md)

<span id="002">**Sihon**</span> Striking down. The whole country on the
east of Jordan, from the Arnon to the Jabbok, was possessed by the
Amorites, whose king, Sihon, refused to permit the Israelites to pass
through his territory, and put his army in array against them. The
Israelites went forth against him to battle, and gained a complete
victory. The Amorites were defeated; Sihon, his sons, and all his people
were smitten with the sword, his walled towns were captured, and the
entire country of the Amorites was taken possession of by the Israelites
([Num 21:21](../kjv/num021.htm#021); [Deu 2:24](../kjv/deu002.htm#024).md).
The country from the Jabbok to Hermon was at this time ruled by Og, the
last of the Rephaim. He also tried to prevent the progress of the
Israelites, but was utterly routed, and all his cities and territory
fell into the hands of the Israelites (compare [Num
21:33](../kjv/num021.htm#033); [Deu 3:1](../kjv/deu003.htm#001.md); [Psa
135:10](../kjv/psa135.htm#010); [Psa 136:17](../kjv/psa136.htm#017).md).
These two victories gave the Israelites possession of the country on the
east of Jordan, from the Arnon to the foot of Hermon. The kingdom of
Sihon embraced about 1,500 square miles, while that of Og was more than
3,000 square miles.

<span id="003">**Sihor**</span> (Correctly Shihor) Black; dark the name
given to the river Nile in [Isa 23:3](../kjv/isa023.htm#003.md); [Jer
2:18](../kjv/jer002.htm#018). In [Jos 13:3](../kjv/jos013.htm#003.md) it is
probably "the river of Egypt", i.e., the Wady el-Arish ([Ch1
13:5](../kjv/ch1013.htm#005).md), which flows "before Egypt", i.e., in a
north-easterly direction from Egypt, and enters the sea about 50 miles
south-west of Gaza.

<span id="004">**Silas**</span> Wood, a prominent member of the church
at Jerusalem; also called Silvanus. He and Judas, surnamed Barsabas,
were chosen by the church there to accompany Paul and Barnabas on their
return to Antioch from the council of the apostles and elders ([Act
15:22](../kjv/act015.htm#022).md), as bearers of the decree adopted by the
council. He assisted Paul there in his evangelistic labours, and was
also chosen by him to be his companion on his second missionary tour
([Act 16:19](../kjv/act016.htm#019).md). He is referred to in the epistles
under the name of Silvanus ([Co2 1:19](../kjv/co2001.htm#019.md); [Th1
1:1](../kjv/th1001.htm#001); [Th2 1:1](../kjv/th2001.htm#001.md); [Pe1
5:12](../kjv/pe1005.htm#012).md). There is no record of the time or place
of his death.

<span id="005">**Silk**</span> Heb. demeshek , "damask," silk cloth
manufactured at Damascus, [Amo 3:12](../kjv/amo003.htm#012.md). A.V., "in
the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch;" R.V., "in the corner
of a couch, and on the silken cushions of a bed" (marg., "in Damascus on
a bed"). Heb. meshi , ([Eze 16:10](../kjv/eze016.htm#010.md), [Eze
16:13](../kjv/eze016.htm#013), rendered "silk".md). In [Gen
41:42](../kjv/gen041.htm#042) (marg. A.V..md), [Pro
31:22](../kjv/pro031.htm#022) (R.V., "fine linen".md), the word "silk"
ought to be "fine linen." Silk was common in New Testament times ([Rev
18:12](../kjv/rev018.htm#012).md).

<span id="006">**Silla**</span> A highway; a twig, only in [Kg2
12:20](../kjv/kg2012.htm#020.md). If taken as a proper name (as in the LXX.
and other versions), the locality is unknown.

<span id="007">**Siloah, The pool of**</span> Heb. shelah ; i.e., "the
dart", [Neh 3:15](../kjv/neh003.htm#015.md); with the art. shiloah,
"sending," [Isa 8:6](../kjv/isa008.htm#006.md) (compare [Isa
7:3](../kjv/isa007.htm#003)) =Siloam (q.v..md).

<span id="008">**Siloam, Pool of**</span> Sent or sending. Here a
notable miracle was wrought by our Lord in giving sight to the blind
([Joh 9:7](../kjv/joh009.htm#007).md). It has been identified with the
Birket Silwan in the lower Tyropoeon valley, to the south-east of the
hill of Zion. The water which flows into this pool intermittently by a
subterranean channel springs from the "Fountain of the Virgin" (q.v.).
The length of this channel, which has several windings, is 1,750 feet,
though the direct distance is only 1,100 feet. The pool is 53 feet in
length from north to south, 18 feet wide, and 19 deep. The water passes
from it by a channel cut in the rock into the gardens below. (See
EN-ROGEL.) Many years ago (1880) a youth, while wading up the conduit by
which the water enters the pool, accidentally discovered an inscription
cut in the rock, on the eastern side, about 19 feet from the pool. This
is the oldest extant Hebrew record of the kind. It has with great care
been deciphered by scholars, and has been found to be an account of the
manner in which the tunnel was constructed. Its whole length is said to
be "twelve hundred cubits;" and the inscription further notes that the
workmen, like the excavators of the Mont Cenis Tunnel, excavated from
both ends, meeting in the middle. Some have argued that the inscription
was cut in the time of Solomon; others, with more probability, refer it
to the reign of Hezekiah. A more ancient tunnel was discovered in 1889
some 20 feet below the ground. It is of smaller dimensions, but more
direct in its course. It is to this tunnel that Isaiah ([Isa
8:6](../kjv/isa008.htm#006).md) probably refers. The Siloam inscription
above referred to was surreptitiously cut from the wall of the tunnel in
1891 and broken into fragments. These were, however, recovered by the
efforts of the British Consul at Jerusalem, and have been restored to
their original place.

<span id="009">**Siloam, Tower of**</span> Mentioned only [Luk
13:4](../kjv/luk013.htm#004.md). The place here spoken of is the village
now called Silwan, or Kefr Silwan, on the east of the valley of Kidron,
and to the north-east of the pool. It stands on the west slope of the
Mount of Olives. As illustrative of the movement of small bands of
Canaanites from place to place, and the intermingling of Canaanites and
Israelites even in small towns in earlier times, M.C. Ganneau records
the following curious fact: "Among the inhabitants of the village (of
Siloam) there are a hundred or so domiciled for the most part in the
lower quarter, and forming a group apart from the rest, called Dhiabrye,
i.e., men of Dhiban. It appears that at some remote period a colony from
the capital of king Mesha (Dibon-Moab) crossed the Jordan and fixed
itself at the gates of Jerusalem at Silwan. The memory of this migration
is still preserved; and I am assured by the people themselves that many
of their number are installed in other villages round Jerusalem" (quoted
by Henderson, Palestine).
