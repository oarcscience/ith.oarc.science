<span id="000">**Lo-ruhamah**</span> Not pitied, the name of the prophet
Hosea's first daughter, a type of Jehovah's temporary rejection of his
people ([Hos 1:6](../kjv/hos001.htm#006); [Hos
2:23](../kjv/hos002.htm#023)).

<span id="001">**Lot**</span> (1.) (Heb. goral , a "pebble"), a small
stone used in casting lots ([Num 33:54](../kjv/num033.htm#054); [Jon
1:7](../kjv/jon001.htm#007)). The lot was always resorted to by the
Hebrews with strictest reference to the interposition of God, and as a
method of ascertaining the divine will ([Pro
16:33](../kjv/pro016.htm#033)), and in serious cases of doubt ([Est
3:7](../kjv/est003.htm#007)). Thus the lot was used at the division of
the land of Canaan among the several tribes ([Num
26:55](../kjv/num026.htm#055); [Num 34:13](../kjv/num034.htm#013)), at
the detection of Achan ([Jos 7:14](../kjv/jos007.htm#014), [Jos
7:18](../kjv/jos007.htm#018)), the election of Saul to be king ([Sa1
10:20](../kjv/sa1010.htm#020), [Sa1 10:21](../kjv/sa1010.htm#021)), the
distribution of the priestly offices of the temple service ([Ch1
24:3](../kjv/ch1024.htm#003), [Ch1 24:5](../kjv/ch1024.htm#005), [Ch1
24:19](../kjv/ch1024.htm#019); [Luk 1:9](../kjv/luk001.htm#009)), and
over the two goats at the feast of Atonement ([Lev
16:8](../kjv/lev016.htm#008)). Matthias, who was "numbered with the
eleven" ([Act 1:24](../kjv/act001.htm#024)), was chosen by lot. This
word also denotes a portion or an inheritance ([Jos
15:1](../kjv/jos015.htm#001); [Psa 125:3](../kjv/psa125.htm#003); [Isa
17:4](../kjv/isa017.htm#004)), and a destiny, as assigned by God ([Psa
16:5](../kjv/psa016.htm#005); [Dan 12:13](../kjv/dan012.htm#013)). (2.)
(Heb. lot ), a covering; veil, the son of Haran, and nephew of Abraham
([Gen 11:27](../kjv/gen011.htm#027)). On the death of his father, he was
left in charge of his grandfather Terah ([Gen
11:31](../kjv/gen011.htm#031)), after whose death he accompanied his
uncle Abraham into Canaan ([Gen 12:5](../kjv/gen012.htm#005)), thence
into Egypt ([Gen 12:10](../kjv/gen012.htm#010)), and back again to
Canaan ([Gen 13:1](../kjv/gen013.htm#001)). After this he separated from
him and settled in Sodom ([Gen 13:5](../kjv/gen013.htm#005)). There his
righteous soul was "vexed" from day to day ([Pe2
2:7](../kjv/pe2002.htm#007)), and he had great cause to regret this act.
Not many years after the separation he was taken captive by
Chedorlaomer, and was rescued by Abraham (Gen. 14). At length, when the
judgment of God descended on the guilty cities of the plain (Gen.
19:1-20), Lot was miraculously delivered. When fleeing from the doomed
city his wife "looked back from behind him, and became a pillar of
salt." There is to this day a peculiar crag at the south end of the Dead
Sea, near Kumran, which the Arabs call Bint Sheik Lot, i.e., Lot's wife.
It is "a tall, isolated needle of rock, which really does bear a curious
resemblance to an Arab woman with a child upon her shoulder." From the
words of warning in [Luk 17:32](../kjv/luk017.htm#032), "Remember Lot's
wife," it would seem as if she had gone back, or tarried so long behind
in the desire to save some of her goods, that she became involved in the
destruction which fell on the city, and became a stiffened corpse, fixed
for a time in the saline encrustation's. She became "a pillar of salt",
i.e., as some think, of asphalt. (See SALT.) Lot and his daughters
sought refuge first in Zoar, and then, fearing to remain there longer,
retired to a cave in the neighbouring mountains ([Gen
19:30](../kjv/gen019.htm#030)). Lot has recently been connected with the
people called on the Egyptian monuments Rotanu or Lotanu, who is
supposed to have been the hero of the Edomite tribe Lotan.

<span id="002">**Love**</span> This word seems to require explanation
only in the case of its use by our Lord in his interview with "Simon,
the son of Jonas," after his resurrection ([Joh
21:16](../kjv/joh021.htm#016), [Joh 21:17](../kjv/joh021.htm#017)). When
our Lord says, "Lovest thou me?" he uses the Greek word agapas ; and
when Simon answers, he uses the Greek word philo , i.e., "I love." This
is the usage in the first and second questions put by our Lord; but in
the third our Lord uses Simon's word. The distinction between these two
Greek words is thus fitfully described by Trench: "Agapan has more of
judgment and deliberate choice; philein has more of attachment and
peculiar personal affection. Thus the 'Lovest thou' (Gr. agapas ) on the
lips of the Lord seems to Peter at this moment too cold a word, as
though his Lord were keeping him at a distance, or at least not inviting
him to draw near, as in the passionate yearning of his heart he desired
now to do. Therefore he puts by the word and substitutes his own
stronger 'I love' (Gr. philo ) in its room. A second time he does the
same. And now he has conquered; for when the Lord demands a third time
whether he loves him, he does it in the word which alone will satisfy
Peter ('Lovest thou,' Gr. phileis ), which alone claims from him that
personal attachment and affection with which indeed he knows that his
heart is full." In [Co1 13:1](../kjv/co1013.htm#001) the apostle sets
forth the excellency of love, as the word "charity" there is rendered in
the Revised Version.

<span id="003">**Lotan**</span> Coverer, one of the sons of Seir, the
Horite ([Gen 36:20](../kjv/gen036.htm#020), [Gen
36:29](../kjv/gen036.htm#029)).

<span id="004">**Lubims**</span> The inhabitants of a thirsty or
scorched land; the Lybians, an African nation under tribute to Egypt
([Ch2 12:3](../kjv/ch2012.htm#003); [Ch2 16:8](../kjv/ch2016.htm#008)).
Their territory was apparently near Egypt. They were probably the
Mizraite Lehabim.

<span id="005">**Lucas**</span> A friend and companion of Paul during
his imprisonment at Rome; Luke (q.v.), the beloved physician ([Plm
1:24](../kjv/plm001.htm#024); [Col 4:14](../kjv/col004.htm#014)).

<span id="006">**Lucifer**</span> Brilliant star, a title given to the
king of Babylon ([Isa 14:12](../kjv/isa014.htm#012)) to denote his
glory.

<span id="007">**Lucius**</span> Of Cyrene, a Christian teacher at
Antioch ([Act 13:1](../kjv/act013.htm#001)), and Paul's kinsman ([Rom
16:21](../kjv/rom016.htm#021)). His name is Latin, but his birthplace
seems to indicate that he was one of the Jews of Cyrene, in North
Africa.

<span id="008">**Lucre**</span> From the Lat. lucrum , "gain." [Ti1
3:3](../kjv/ti1003.htm#003), "not given to filthy lucre." Some MSS. have
not the word so rendered, and the expression has been omitted in the
Revised Version.

<span id="009">**Lud**</span> (1.) The fourth son of Shem ([Gen
10:22](../kjv/gen010.htm#022); [Ch1 1:17](../kjv/ch1001.htm#017)),
ancestor of the Lydians probably. (2.) One of the Hamitic tribes
descended from Mizraim ([Gen 10:13](../kjv/gen010.htm#013)), a people of
Africa ([Eze 27:10](../kjv/eze027.htm#010); [Eze
30:5](../kjv/eze030.htm#005)), on the west of Egypt. The people called
Lud were noted archers ([Isa 66:19](../kjv/isa066.htm#019); compare [Jer
46:9](../kjv/jer046.htm#009)).
