<span id="000">**Law**</span> A rule of action. (1.) The Law of Nature
is the will of God as to human conduct, founded on the moral difference
of things, and discoverable by natural light ([Rom
1:20](../kjv/rom001.htm#020); [Rom 2:14](../kjv/rom002.htm#014.md), [Rom
2:15](../kjv/rom002.htm#015).md). This law binds all men at all times. It
is generally designated by the term conscience, or the capacity of being
influenced by the moral relations of things. (2.) The Ceremonial Law
prescribes under the Old Testament the rites and ceremonies of worship.
This law was obligatory only till Christ, of whom these rites were
typical, had finished his work ([Heb 7:9](../kjv/heb007.htm#009.md), [Heb
7:11](../kjv/heb007.htm#011); [Heb 10:1](../kjv/heb010.htm#001.md); [Eph
2:16](../kjv/eph002.htm#016).md). It was fulfilled rather than abrogated by
the gospel. (3.) The Judicial Law, the law which directed the civil
policy of the Hebrew nation. (4.) The Moral Law is the revealed will of
God as to human conduct, binding on all men to the end of time. It was
promulgated at Sinai. It is perfect ([Psa 19:7](../kjv/psa019.htm#007).md),
perpetual ([Mat 5:17](../kjv/mat005.htm#017.md), [Mat
5:18](../kjv/mat005.htm#018)), holy ([Rom 7:12](../kjv/rom007.htm#012).md),
good, spiritual ([Rom 7:14](../kjv/rom007.htm#014).md), and exceeding broad
([Psa 119:96](../kjv/psa119.htm#096).md). Although binding on all, we are
not under it as a covenant of works ([Gal 3:17](../kjv/gal003.htm#017).md).
(See COMMANDMENTS.) (5.) Positive Laws are precepts founded only on the
will of God. They are right because God commands them. (6.) Moral
positive laws are commanded by God because they are right.

<span id="001">**Law of Moses**</span> Is the whole body of the Mosaic
legislation ([Kg1 2:3](../kjv/kg1002.htm#003.md); [Kg2
23:25](../kjv/kg2023.htm#025); [Ezr 3:2](../kjv/ezr003.htm#002).md). It is
called by way of eminence simply "the Law" (Heb. Torah , [Deu
1:5](../kjv/deu001.htm#005); [Deu 4:8](../kjv/deu004.htm#008.md), [Deu
4:44](../kjv/deu004.htm#044); [Deu 17:18](../kjv/deu017.htm#018.md), [Deu
17:19](../kjv/deu017.htm#019); [Deu 27:3](../kjv/deu027.htm#003.md), [Deu
27:8](../kjv/deu027.htm#008).md). As a written code it is called the "book
of the law of Moses" ([Kg2 14:6](../kjv/kg2014.htm#006.md); [Isa
8:20](../kjv/isa008.htm#020).md), the "book of the law of God" ([Jos
24:26](../kjv/jos024.htm#026).md). The great leading principle of the
Mosaic law is that it is essentially theocratic; i.e., it refers at once
to the commandment of God as the foundation of all human duty.

<span id="002">**Lawyer**</span> Among the Jews, was one versed in the
laws of Moses, which he expounded in the schools and synagogues ([Mat
22:35](../kjv/mat022.htm#035); [Luk 10:25](../kjv/luk010.htm#025).md). The
functions of the "lawyer" and "scribe" were identical. (See DOCTOR.)

<span id="003">**Lazarus**</span> An abbreviation of Eleazar, whom God
helps. (1.) The brother of Mary and Martha of Bethany. He was raised
from the dead after he had lain four days in the tomb (John 11:1-44).
This miracle so excited the wrath of the Jews that they sought to put
both Jesus and Lazarus to death. (2.) A beggar named in the parable
recorded [Luk 16:19](../kjv/luk016.htm#019.md).

<span id="004">**Leaf**</span> Of a tree. The olive-leaf mentioned [Gen
8:11](../kjv/gen008.htm#011.md). The barren fig-tree had nothing but leaves
([Mat 21:19](../kjv/mat021.htm#019.md); [Mar
11:13](../kjv/mar011.htm#013).md). The oak-leaf is mentioned [Isa
1:30](../kjv/isa001.htm#030); [Isa 6:13](../kjv/isa006.htm#013.md). There
are numerous allusions to leaves, their flourishing, their decay, and
their restoration ([Lev 26:36](../kjv/lev026.htm#036.md); [Isa
34:4](../kjv/isa034.htm#004); [Jer 8:13](../kjv/jer008.htm#013.md); [Dan
4:12](../kjv/dan004.htm#012), [Dan 4:14](../kjv/dan004.htm#014.md), [Dan
4:21](../kjv/dan004.htm#021); [Mar 11:13](../kjv/mar011.htm#013.md); [Mar
13:28](../kjv/mar013.htm#028).md). The fresh leaf is a symbol of prosperity
([Psa 1:3](../kjv/psa001.htm#003); [Jer 17:8](../kjv/jer017.htm#008.md);
[Eze 47:12](../kjv/eze047.htm#012).md); the faded, of decay ([Job
13:25](../kjv/job013.htm#025); [Isa 1:30](../kjv/isa001.htm#030.md); [Isa
64:6](../kjv/isa064.htm#006); [Jer 8:13](../kjv/jer008.htm#013).md). Leaf
of a door ([Kg1 6:34](../kjv/kg1006.htm#034).md), the valve of a folding
door. Leaf of a book ([Jer 36:23](../kjv/jer036.htm#023).md), perhaps a
fold of a roll.

<span id="005">**League**</span> A treaty or confederacy. The Jews were
forbidden to enter into an alliance of any kind (1.) with the Canaanites
([Exo 23:32](../kjv/exo023.htm#032), [Exo 23:33](../kjv/exo023.htm#033.md);
[Exo 34:12](../kjv/exo034.htm#012)); (2..md) with the Amalekites ([Exo
17:8](../kjv/exo017.htm#008), [Exo 17:14](../kjv/exo017.htm#014.md); [Deu
25:17](../kjv/deu025.htm#017)); (3..md) with the Moabites and Ammonites
([Deu 2:9](../kjv/deu002.htm#009), [Deu 2:19](../kjv/deu002.htm#019).md).
Treaties were permitted to be entered into with all other nations. Thus
David maintained friendly intercourse with the kings of Tyre and Hamath,
and Solomon with the kings of Tyre and Egypt.

<span id="006">**Leah**</span> Weary, the eldest daughter of Laban, and
sister of Rachel ([Gen 29:16](../kjv/gen029.htm#016).md). Jacob took her to
wife through a deceit of her father ([Gen
29:23](../kjv/gen029.htm#023).md). She was "tender-eyed" ([Gen
29:17](../kjv/gen029.htm#017).md). She bore to Jacob six sons ([Gen
29:32](../kjv/gen029.htm#032).md), also one daughter, Dinah ([Gen
30:21](../kjv/gen030.htm#021).md). She accompanied Jacob into Canaan, and
died there before the time of the going down into Egypt (Gen. 31), and
was buried in the cave of Machpelah ([Gen
49:31](../kjv/gen049.htm#031).md).

<span id="007">**Leannoth**</span> For answering; i.e., in singing,
occurs in the title to Ps. 88. The title "Mahalath (q.v.) Leannoth" may
be rendered "concerning sickness, to be sung" i.e., perhaps, to be sung
in sickness.

<span id="008">**Leasing**</span> ([Psa 4:2](../kjv/psa004.htm#002.md);
[Psa 5:6](../kjv/psa005.htm#006).md) an Old English word meaning lies, or
lying, as the Hebrew word kazabh is generally rendered.

<span id="009">**Leather**</span> A girdle of, worn by Elijah ([Kg2
1:8](../kjv/kg2001.htm#008).md) and John the Baptist ([Mat
3:4](../kjv/mat003.htm#004).md). Leather was employed both for clothing
([Num 31:20](../kjv/num031.htm#020); [Heb 11:37](../kjv/heb011.htm#037).md)
and for writing upon. The trade of a tanner is mentioned ([Act
9:43](../kjv/act009.htm#043); [Act 10:6](../kjv/act010.htm#006.md), [Act
10:32](../kjv/act010.htm#032).md). It was probably learned in Egypt.
