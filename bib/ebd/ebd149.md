<span id="000">**Gilead, Balm of**</span> The region of Gilead abounded
in spices and aromatic gums, which were exported to Egypt and Tyre ([Gen
37:25](../kjv/gen037.htm#025); [Jer 8:22](../kjv/jer008.htm#022); [Jer
46:11](../kjv/jer046.htm#011); [Eze 27:17](../kjv/eze027.htm#017)). The
word "balm" is a contracted form of "balsam," a word derived from the
Greek balsamon , which was adopted as the representative of the Hebrew
words baal shemen , meaning "lord" or "chief of oils." The Hebrew name
of this balm was tsori . The tree yielding this medicinal oil was
probably the Balsamodendron opobalsamum of botanists, and the Amyris
opobalsamum of Linnaeus. It is an evergreen, rising to the height of
about 14 feet. The oil or resin, exuding through an orifice made in its
bark in very small quantities, is esteemed of great value for its
supposed medicinal qualities. (See BALM.) It may be noted that
Coverdale's version reads in [Jer 8:22](../kjv/jer008.htm#022), "There
is no triacle in Galaad." The word "triacle" = "treacle" is used in the
sense of ointment.

<span id="001">**Gilgal**</span> Rolling. (1.) From the solemn
transaction of the reading of the law in the valley of Shechem between
Ebal and Gerizim the Israelites moved forward to Gilgal, and there made
a permanent camp ([Jos 9:6](../kjv/jos009.htm#006); [Jos
10:6](../kjv/jos010.htm#006)). It was "beside the oaks of Moreh," near
which Abraham erected his first altar ([Gen
12:6](../kjv/gen012.htm#006), [Gen 12:7](../kjv/gen012.htm#007)). This
was one of the three towns to which Samuel resorted for the
administration of justice ([Sa1 7:16](../kjv/sa1007.htm#016)), and here
also he offered sacrifices when the ark was no longer in the tabernacle
at Shiloh ([Sa1 10:8](../kjv/sa1010.htm#008); [Sa1
13:7](../kjv/sa1013.htm#007)). To this place, as to a central sanctuary,
all Israel gathered to renew their allegiance to Saul ([Sa1
11:14](../kjv/sa1011.htm#014)). At a later period it became the scene of
idolatrous worship ([Hos 4:15](../kjv/hos004.htm#015); [Hos
9:15](../kjv/hos009.htm#015)). It has been identified with the ruins of
Jiljilieh, about 5 miles south-west of Shiloh and about the same
distance from Bethel. (2.) The place in "the plains of Jericho," "in the
east border of Jericho," where the Israelites first encamped after
crossing the Jordan ([Jos 4:19](../kjv/jos004.htm#019), [Jos
4:20](../kjv/jos004.htm#020)). Here they kept their first Passover in
the land of Canaan ([Jos 5:10](../kjv/jos005.htm#010)) and renewed the
rite of circumcision, and so "rolled away the reproach" of their
Egyptian slavery. Here the twelve memorial stones, taken from the bed of
the Jordan, were set up; and here also the tabernacle remained till it
was removed to Shiloh ([Jos 18:1](../kjv/jos018.htm#001)). It has been
identified with Tell Jiljulieh, about 5 miles from Jordan. (3.) A place,
probably in the hill country of Ephraim, where there was a school of the
prophets ([Kg2 4:38](../kjv/kg2004.htm#038)), and whence Elijah and
Elisha, who resided here, "went down" to Bethel ([Kg2
2:1](../kjv/kg2002.htm#001), [Kg2 2:2](../kjv/kg2002.htm#002)). It is
mentioned also in [Deu 11:30](../kjv/deu011.htm#030). It is now known as
Jiljilia, a place 8 miles north of Bethel.

<span id="002">**Giloh**</span> Exile, a city in the south-west part of
the hill-country of Judah ([Jos 15:51](../kjv/jos015.htm#051)). It was
the native place or residence of the traitor Ahithophel "the Gilonite"
([Jos 15:51](../kjv/jos015.htm#051); [Sa2
15:12](../kjv/sa2015.htm#012)), and where he committed suicide ([Sa2
17:23](../kjv/sa2017.htm#023)). It has been identified with Kurbet Jala,
about 7 miles north of Hebron.

<span id="003">**Gimzo**</span> A place fertile in sycamores, a city in
the plain of Judah, the villages of which were seized by the Philistines
([Ch2 28:18](../kjv/ch2028.htm#018)). It is now called Jimzu, about 3
miles south-east of Ludd, i.e., Lydda.

<span id="004">**Gin**</span> A trap. (1.) [Psa
140:5](../kjv/psa140.htm#005), [Psa 141:9](../kjv/psa141.htm#009), [Amo
3:5](../kjv/amo003.htm#005), the Hebrew word used, mokesh, means a noose
or "snare," as it is elsewhere rendered ([Psa
18:5](../kjv/psa018.htm#005); [Pro 13:14](../kjv/pro013.htm#014), etc.).
(2.) [Job 18:9](../kjv/job018.htm#009), [Isa
8:14](../kjv/isa008.htm#014), Heb. pah , a plate or thin layer; and
hence a net, a snare, trap, especially of a fowler ([Psa
69:22](../kjv/psa069.htm#022), "Let their table before them become a
net;" [Amo 3:5](../kjv/amo003.htm#005), "Doth a bird fall into a net
\[pah\] upon the ground where there is no trap-stick \[mokesh\] for her?
doth the net \[pah\] spring up from the ground and take nothing at all?"
(Gesenius.)

<span id="005">**Girdle**</span> (1.) Heb. hagor , a girdle of any kind
worn by soldiers ([Sa1 18:4](../kjv/sa1018.htm#004); [Sa2
20:8](../kjv/sa2020.htm#008); [Kg1 2:5](../kjv/kg1002.htm#005); [Kg2
3:21](../kjv/kg2003.htm#021)) or women ([Isa
3:24](../kjv/isa003.htm#024)). (2.) Heb. 'ezor , something "bound," worn
by prophets ([Kg2 1:8](../kjv/kg2001.htm#008); [Jer
13:1](../kjv/jer013.htm#001)), soldiers ([Isa
5:27](../kjv/isa005.htm#027); [Sa2 20:8](../kjv/sa2020.htm#008); [Eze
23:15](../kjv/eze023.htm#015)), Kings ([Job
12:18](../kjv/job012.htm#018)). (3.) Heb. mezah , a "band," a girdle
worn by men alone ([Psa 109:19](../kjv/psa109.htm#019); [Isa
22:21](../kjv/isa022.htm#021)). (4.) Heb. 'abnet , the girdle of
sacerdotal and state officers ([Exo 28:4](../kjv/exo028.htm#004), [Exo
28:39](../kjv/exo028.htm#039), [Exo 28:40](../kjv/exo028.htm#040); [Exo
29:9](../kjv/exo029.htm#009); [Exo 39:29](../kjv/exo039.htm#029)). (5.)
Heb. hesheb , the "curious girdle" ([Exo 28:8](../kjv/exo028.htm#008);
R.V., "cunningly woven band") was attached to the ephod, and was made of
the same material. The common girdle was made of leather ([Kg2
1:8](../kjv/kg2001.htm#008); [Mat 3:4](../kjv/mat003.htm#004)); a finer
sort of linen ([Jer 13:1](../kjv/jer013.htm#001); [Eze
16:10](../kjv/eze016.htm#010); [Dan 10:5](../kjv/dan010.htm#005)).
Girdles of sackcloth were worn in token of sorrow ([Isa
3:24](../kjv/isa003.htm#024); [Isa 22:12](../kjv/isa022.htm#012)). They
were variously fastened to the wearer ([Mar 1:6](../kjv/mar001.htm#006);
[Jer 13:1](../kjv/jer013.htm#001); [Eze 16:10](../kjv/eze016.htm#010)).
The girdle was a symbol of strength and power ([Job
12:18](../kjv/job012.htm#018), [Job 12:21](../kjv/job012.htm#021); [Job
30:11](../kjv/job030.htm#011); [Isa 22:21](../kjv/isa022.htm#021); [Isa
45:5](../kjv/isa045.htm#005)). "Righteousness and faithfulness" are the
girdle of the Messiah ([Isa 11:5](../kjv/isa011.htm#005)). Girdles were
used as purses or pockets ([Mat 10:9](../kjv/mat010.htm#009). A. V.,
"purses;" R.V., marg., "girdles." Also [Mar
6:8](../kjv/mar006.htm#008)).

<span id="006">**Girgashite**</span> Dwelling in clayey soil, the
descendants of the fifth son of Canaan ([Gen
10:16](../kjv/gen010.htm#016)), one of the original tribes inhabiting
the land of Canaan before the time of the Israelites ([Gen
15:21](../kjv/gen015.htm#021); [Deu 7:1](../kjv/deu007.htm#001)). They
were a branch of the great family of the Hivites. Of their geographical
position nothing is certainly known. Probably they lived somewhere in
the central part of Western Palestine.

<span id="007">**Gittah-hepher**</span> ([Jos
19:13](../kjv/jos019.htm#013)). See GATH-HEPHER

<span id="008">**Gittaim**</span> Two wine-presses, ([Sa2
4:3](../kjv/sa2004.htm#003); [Neh 11:33](../kjv/neh011.htm#033)), a town
probably in Benjamin to which the Beerothites fled.

<span id="009">**Gittite**</span> A native of the Philistine city of
Gath ([Jos 13:3](../kjv/jos013.htm#003)). Obed-edom, in whose house the
ark was placed, is so designated ([Sa2 6:10](../kjv/sa2006.htm#010)).
Six hundred Gittites came with David from Gath into Israel ([Sa2
15:18](../kjv/sa2015.htm#018), [Sa2 15:19](../kjv/sa2015.htm#019)).
