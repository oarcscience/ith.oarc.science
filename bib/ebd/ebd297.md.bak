<span id="000">**Pithom**</span> Egyptian, Pa-Tum, "house of Tum," the
sun-god, one of the "treasure" cities built for Pharaoh Rameses II. by
the Israelites ([Exo 1:11](../kjv/exo001.htm#011).md). It was probably the
Patumos of the Greek historian Herodotus. It has now been satisfactorily
identified with Tell-el-Maskhuta, about 12 miles west of Ismailia, and
20 east of Tel-el-Kebir, on the southern bank of the present Suez Canal.
Here have recently (1883) been discovered the ruins of supposed
grain-chambers, and other evidences to show that this was a great "store
city." Its immense ruin-heaps show that it was built of bricks, and
partly also of bricks without straw. Succoth ([Exo
12:37](../kjv/exo012.htm#037).md) is supposed by some to be the secular
name of this city, Pithom being its sacred name. This was the first
halting-place of the Israelites in their exodus. It has been argued (Dr.
Lansing) that these "store" cities "were residence cities, royal
dwellings, such as the Pharaohs of old, the Kings of Israel, and our
modern Khedives have ever loved to build, thus giving employment to the
superabundant muscle of their enslaved peoples, and making a name for
themselves."

<span id="001">**Plague**</span> A "stroke" of affliction, or disease.
Sent as a divine chastisement ([Num 11:33](../kjv/num011.htm#033.md); [Num
14:37](../kjv/num014.htm#037); [Num 16:46](../kjv/num016.htm#046.md); [Sa2
24:21](../kjv/sa2024.htm#021).md). Painful afflictions or diseases, ([Lev
13:3](../kjv/lev013.htm#003), [Lev 13:5](../kjv/lev013.htm#005.md), [Lev
13:30](../kjv/lev013.htm#030); [Kg1 8:37](../kjv/kg1008.htm#037).md), or
severe calamity ([Mar 5:29](../kjv/mar005.htm#029.md); [Luk
7:21](../kjv/luk007.htm#021).md), or the judgment of God, so called ([Exo
9:14](../kjv/exo009.htm#014)). Plagues of Egypt were ten in number. (1..md)
The river Nile was turned into blood, and the fish died, and the river
stank, so that the Egyptians loathed to drink of the river ([Exo
7:14](../kjv/exo007.htm#014)). (2..md) The plague of frogs ([Exo
8:1](../kjv/exo008.htm#001)). (3..md) The plague of lice (Heb. kinnim ,
properly gnats or mosquitoes; compare [Psa
78:45](../kjv/psa078.htm#045); [Psa 105:31](../kjv/psa105.htm#031).md),
"out of the dust of the land" ([Exo 8:16](../kjv/exo008.htm#016)). (4..md)
The plague of flies (Heb. arob , rendered by the LXX. dog-fly), [Exo
8:21](../kjv/exo008.htm#021). (5..md) The murrain ([Exo
9:1](../kjv/exo009.htm#001).md), or epidemic pestilence which carried off
vast numbers of cattle in the field. Warning was given of its coming.
(6.) The sixth plague, of "boils and blains," like the third, was sent
without warning ([Exo 9:8](../kjv/exo009.htm#008).md). It is called ([Deu
28:27](../kjv/deu028.htm#027).md) "the botch of Egypt," A.V.; but in R.V.,
"the boil of Egypt." "The magicians could not stand before Moses"
because of it. (7.) The plague of hail, with fire and thunder (Ex.
9:13-33). Warning was given of its coming. (Compare [Psa
18:13](../kjv/psa018.htm#013); [Psa 105:32](../kjv/psa105.htm#032.md), [Psa
105:33](../kjv/psa105.htm#033)). (8..md) The plague of locusts, which
covered the whole face of the earth, so that the land was darkened with
them ([Exo 10:12](../kjv/exo010.htm#012).md). The Hebrew name of this
insect, arbeh, points to the "multitudinous" character of this
visitation. Warning was given before this plague came. (9.) After a
short interval the plague of darkness succeeded that of the locusts; and
it came without any special warning ([Exo
10:21](../kjv/exo010.htm#021).md). The darkness covered "all the land of
Egypt" to such an extent that "they saw not one another." It did not,
however, extend to the land of Goshen. (10.) The last and most fearful
of these plagues was the death of the first-born of man and of beast
([Exo 11:4](../kjv/exo011.htm#004), [Exo 11:5](../kjv/exo011.htm#005.md);
[Exo 12:29](../kjv/exo012.htm#029), [Exo 12:30](../kjv/exo012.htm#030).md).
The exact time of the visitation was announced, "about midnight", which
would add to the horror of the infliction. Its extent also is specified,
from the first-born of the king to the first-born of the humblest slave,
and all the first-born of beasts. But from this plague the Hebrews were
completely exempted. The Lord "put a difference" between them and the
Egyptians. (See PASSOVER.)

<span id="002">**Plain**</span> (1.) Heb. 'abel ([Jdg
11:33](../kjv/jdg011.htm#033).md), a "grassy plain" or "meadow." Instead of
"plains of the vineyards," as in the Authorized Version, the Revised
Version has "Abel-cheramim" (q.v.), compare [Jdg
11:22](../kjv/jdg011.htm#022); [Ch2 16:4](../kjv/ch2016.htm#004). (2..md)
Heb. 'elon ([Gen 12:6](../kjv/gen012.htm#006.md); [Gen
13:18](../kjv/gen013.htm#018); [Gen 14:13](../kjv/gen014.htm#013.md); [Gen
18:1](../kjv/gen018.htm#001); [Deu 11:30](../kjv/deu011.htm#030.md); [Jdg
9:6](../kjv/jdg009.htm#006).md), more correctly "oak," as in the Revised
Version; margin, "terebinth." (3.) Heb. bik'ah ([Gen
11:2](../kjv/gen011.htm#002); [Neh 6:2](../kjv/neh006.htm#002.md); [Eze
3:23](../kjv/eze003.htm#023); [Dan 3:1](../kjv/dan003.htm#001).md),
properly a valley, as rendered in [Isa 40:4](../kjv/isa040.htm#004.md), a
broad plain between mountains. In [Amo 1:5](../kjv/amo001.htm#005.md) the
margin of Authorized Version has "Bikathaven." (4.) Heb. kikar , "the
circle," used only of the Ghor, or the low ground along the Jordan ([Gen
13:10](../kjv/gen013.htm#010); [Gen 19:17](../kjv/gen019.htm#017.md), [Gen
19:25](../kjv/gen019.htm#025), [Gen 19:28](../kjv/gen019.htm#028.md), [Gen
19:29](../kjv/gen019.htm#029); [Deu 34:3](../kjv/deu034.htm#003.md); [Sa2
18:23](../kjv/sa2018.htm#023); [Kg1 7:46](../kjv/kg1007.htm#046.md); [Ch2
4:17](../kjv/ch2004.htm#017); [Neh 3:22](../kjv/neh003.htm#022.md); [Neh
12:28](../kjv/neh012.htm#028).md), the floor of the valley through which it
flows. This name is applied to the Jordan valley as far north as
Succoth. (5.) Heb. mishor , "level ground," smooth, grassy table-land
([Deu 3:10](../kjv/deu003.htm#010); [Deu 4:43](../kjv/deu004.htm#043.md);
[Jos 13:9](../kjv/jos013.htm#009), [Jos 13:16](../kjv/jos013.htm#016.md),
[Jos 13:17](../kjv/jos013.htm#017), [Jos 13:21](../kjv/jos013.htm#021.md);
[Jos 20:8](../kjv/jos020.htm#008); [Jer 48:21](../kjv/jer048.htm#021).md),
an expanse of rolling downs without rock or stone. In these passages,
with the article prefixed, it denotes the plain in the tribe of Reuben.
In [Ch2 26:10](../kjv/ch2026.htm#010.md) the plain of Judah is meant.
Jerusalem is called "the rock of the plain" in [Jer
21:13](../kjv/jer021.htm#013.md), because the hills on which it is built
rise high above the plain. (6.) Heb. 'arabah , the valley from the Sea
of Galilee southward to the Dead Sea (the "sea of the plain," [Kg2
14:25](../kjv/kg2014.htm#025); [Deu 1:1](../kjv/deu001.htm#001.md); [Deu
2:8](../kjv/deu002.htm#008).md), a distance of about 70 miles. It is called
by the modern Arabs the Ghor. This Hebrew name is found in Authorized
Version ([Jos 18:18](../kjv/jos018.htm#018).md), and is uniformly used in
the Revised Version. Down through the centre of this plain is a ravine,
from 200 to 300 yards wide, and from 50 to 100 feet deep, through which
the Jordan flows in a winding course. This ravine is called the "lower
plain." The name Arabah is also applied to the whole Jordan valley from
Mount Hermon to the eastern branch of the Red Sea, a distance of about
200 miles, as well as to that portion of the valley which stretches from
the Sea of Galilee to the same branch of the Red Sea, i.e., to the Gulf
of Akabah about 100 miles in all. (7.) Heb. shephelah , "low ground,"
"low hill-land," rendered "vale" or "valley" in Authorized Version ([Jos
9:1](../kjv/jos009.htm#001); [Jos 10:40](../kjv/jos010.htm#040.md); [Jos
11:2](../kjv/jos011.htm#002); [Jos 12:8](../kjv/jos012.htm#008.md); [Jdg
1:9](../kjv/jdg001.htm#009); [Kg1 10:27](../kjv/kg1010.htm#027).md). In
Authorized Version ([Ch1 27:28](../kjv/ch1027.htm#028.md); [Ch2
26:10](../kjv/ch2026.htm#010).md) it is also rendered "low country." In
[Jer 17:26](../kjv/jer017.htm#026), [Oba 1:19](../kjv/oba001.htm#019.md),
[Zac 7:7](../kjv/zac007.htm#007.md), "plain." The Revised Version renders
it uniformly "low land." When it is preceded by the article, as in [Deu
1:7](../kjv/deu001.htm#007), [Jos 11:16](../kjv/jos011.htm#016.md); [Jos
15:33](../kjv/jos015.htm#033); [Jer 32:44](../kjv/jer032.htm#044.md); [Jer
33:13](../kjv/jer033.htm#013); [Zac 7:7](../kjv/zac007.htm#007.md), "the
shephelah," it denotes the plain along the Mediterranean from Joppa to
Gaza, "the plain of the Philistines." (See VALLEY.)

<span id="003">**Plain of Mamre**</span> ([Gen
13:18](../kjv/gen013.htm#018); [Gen 14:13](../kjv/gen014.htm#013.md); R.V.,
"oaks of Mamre;" marg., "terebinths"). (See MAMRE; TEIL-TREE.)

<span id="004">**Plane Tree**</span> Heb. 'armon ([Gen
30:37](../kjv/gen030.htm#037); [Eze 31:8](../kjv/eze031.htm#008).md),
rendered "chestnut" in the Authorized Version, but correctly "plane
tree" in the Revised Version and the LXX. This tree is frequently found
in Palestine, both on the coast and in the north. It usually sheds its
outer bark, and hence its Hebrew name, which means "naked." (See
CHESTNUT.)

<span id="005">**Pledge**</span> SEE LOAN.

<span id="006">**Pleiades**</span> Heb. kimah , "a cluster" ([Job
9:9](../kjv/job009.htm#009); [Job 38:31](../kjv/job038.htm#031.md); [Amo
5:8](../kjv/amo005.htm#008), A.V., "seven stars;" R.V., "Pleiades".md), a
name given to the cluster of stars seen in the shoulder of the
constellation Taurus.

<span id="007">**Plough**</span> First referred to in [Gen
45:6](../kjv/gen045.htm#006.md), where the Authorized Version has "earing,"
but the Revised Version "ploughing;" next in [Exo
34:21](../kjv/exo034.htm#021) and [Deu 21:4](../kjv/deu021.htm#004.md). The
plough was originally drawn by oxen, but sometimes also by asses and by
men. (See AGRICULTURE.)

<span id="008">**Poetry**</span> Has been well defined as "the measured
language of emotion." Hebrew poetry deals almost exclusively with the
great question of man's relation to God. "Guilt, condemnation,
punishment, pardon, redemption, repentance are the awful themes of this
heaven-born poetry." In the Hebrew scriptures there are found three
distinct kinds of poetry, (1.) that of the Book of Job and the Song of
Solomon, which is dramatic; (2.) that of the Book of Psalms, which is
lyrical; and (3.) that of the Book of Ecclesiastes, which is didactic
and sententious. Hebrew poetry has nothing akin to that of Western
nations. It has neither metre nor rhyme. Its great peculiarity consists
in the mutual correspondence of sentences or clauses, called
parallelism, or "thought-rhyme." Various kinds of this parallelism have
been pointed out: (1.) Synonymous or cognate parallelism, where the same
idea is repeated in the same words ([Psa 93:3](../kjv/psa093.htm#003.md);
[Psa 94:1](../kjv/psa094.htm#001); [Pro 6:2](../kjv/pro006.htm#002).md), or
in different words (Ps. 22, [Psa 23:1](../kjv/psa023.htm#001.md), [Psa
28:1](../kjv/psa028.htm#001), [Psa 114:1](../kjv/psa114.htm#001), etc..md);
or where it is expressed in a positive form in the one clause and in a
negative in the other ([Psa 40:12](../kjv/psa040.htm#012.md); [Pro
6:26](../kjv/pro006.htm#026).md); or where the same idea is expressed in
three successive clauses ([Psa 40:15](../kjv/psa040.htm#015.md), [Psa
40:16](../kjv/psa040.htm#016).md); or in a double parallelism, the first
and second clauses corresponding to the third and fourth ([Isa
9:1](../kjv/isa009.htm#001); [Isa 61:10](../kjv/isa061.htm#010.md), [Isa
61:11](../kjv/isa061.htm#011)). (2..md) Anthithetic parallelism, where the
idea of the second clause is the converse of that of the first ([Psa
20:8](../kjv/psa020.htm#008); [Psa 27:6](../kjv/psa027.htm#006.md), [Psa
27:7](../kjv/psa027.htm#007); [Psa 34:11](../kjv/psa034.htm#011.md); [Psa
37:9](../kjv/psa037.htm#009), [Psa 37:17](../kjv/psa037.htm#017.md), [Psa
37:21](../kjv/psa037.htm#021), [Psa 37:22](../kjv/psa037.htm#022).md). This
is the common form of gnomic or proverbial poetry. (See Prov. 10 - 15.)
(3.) Synthetic or constructive or compound parallelism, where each
clause or sentence contains some accessory idea enforcing the main idea
([Psa 19:7](../kjv/psa019.htm#007); [Psa 85:12](../kjv/psa085.htm#012.md);
[Job 3:3](../kjv/job003.htm#003); [Isa 1:5](../kjv/isa001.htm#005).md).
(4.) Introverted parallelism, in which of four clauses the first answers
to the fourth and the second to the third ([Psa
135:15](../kjv/psa135.htm#015); [Pro 23:15](../kjv/pro023.htm#015.md), [Pro
23:16](../kjv/pro023.htm#016).md), or where the second line reverses the
order of words in the first ([Psa 86:2](../kjv/psa086.htm#002).md). Hebrew
poetry sometimes assumes other forms than these. (1.) An alphabetical
arrangement is sometimes adopted for the purpose of connecting clauses
or sentences. Thus in the following the initial words of the respective
verses begin with the letters of the alphabet in regular succession:
Prov. 31:10-31; Lam. 1, 2, 3, 4; Ps. 25, 34, 37, 145. Ps. 119 has a
letter of the alphabet in regular order beginning every eighth verse.
(2.) The repetition of the same verse or of some emphatic expression at
intervals ([Psa 42:1](../kjv/psa042.htm#001.md), 107, where the refrain is
in verses, [Psa 8:1](../kjv/psa008.htm#001.md), [Psa
15:1](../kjv/psa015.htm#001), [Psa 21:1](../kjv/psa021.htm#001), 31.md).
(Compare also Isa. 9:8-10:4; [Amo 1:3](../kjv/amo001.htm#003.md), [Amo
1:6](../kjv/amo001.htm#006), [Amo 1:9](../kjv/amo001.htm#009.md), [Amo
1:11](../kjv/amo001.htm#011), [Amo 1:13](../kjv/amo001.htm#013.md); [Amo
2:1](../kjv/amo002.htm#001), [Amo 2:4](../kjv/amo002.htm#004.md), [Amo
2:6](../kjv/amo002.htm#006).) (3..md) Gradation, in which the thought of
one verse is resumed in another ([Psa 121:1](../kjv/psa121.htm#001).md).
Several odes of great poetical beauty are found in the historical books
of the Old Testament, such as the song of Moses (Ex. 15), the song of
Deborah (Judg. 5), of Hannah (1 Sam. 2), of Hezekiah ([Isa
38:9](../kjv/isa038.htm#009)), of Habakkuk (Hab. 3.md), and David's "song
of the bow" ([Sa2 1:19](../kjv/sa2001.htm#019).md).

<span id="009">**Poison**</span> (1.) Heb. hemah , "heat," the poison of
certain venomous reptiles ([Deu 32:24](../kjv/deu032.htm#024.md), [Deu
32:33](../kjv/deu032.htm#033); [Job 6:4](../kjv/job006.htm#004.md); [Psa
58:4](../kjv/psa058.htm#004)), causing inflammation. (2..md) Heb. rosh , "a
head," a poisonous plant ([Deu 29:18](../kjv/deu029.htm#018).md), growing
luxuriantly ([Hos 10:4](../kjv/hos010.htm#004).md), of a bitter taste ([Psa
69:21](../kjv/psa069.htm#021); [Lam 3:5](../kjv/lam003.htm#005).md), and
coupled with wormwood; probably the poppy. This word is rendered "gall",
q.v., ([Deu 29:18](../kjv/deu029.htm#018.md); [Deu
32:33](../kjv/deu032.htm#033); [Psa 69:21](../kjv/psa069.htm#021.md); [Jer
8:14](../kjv/jer008.htm#014), etc..md), "hemlock" ([Hos
10:4](../kjv/hos010.htm#004); [Amo 6:12](../kjv/amo006.htm#012).md), and
"poison" ([Job 20:16](../kjv/job020.htm#016).md), "the poison of asps,"
showing that the rosh was not exclusively a vegetable poison. (3.) In
[Rom 3:13](../kjv/rom003.htm#013.md) (Compare [Job
20:16](../kjv/job020.htm#016); [Psa 140:3](../kjv/psa140.htm#003).md), [Jam
3:8](../kjv/jam003.htm#008.md), as the rendering of the Greek ios .
