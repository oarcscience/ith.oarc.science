<span id="000">**Septuagint**</span> See VERSIONS.

<span id="001">**Sepulchre**</span> First mentioned as purchased by
Abraham for Sarah from Ephron the Hittite ([Gen
23:20](../kjv/gen023.htm#020).md). This was the "cave of the field of
Machpelah," where also Abraham and Rebekah and Jacob and Leah were
buried ([Gen 49:29](../kjv/gen049.htm#029).md). In [Act
7:16](../kjv/act007.htm#016.md) it is said that Jacob was "laid in the
sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor
the father of Sychem." It has been proposed, as a mode of reconciling
the apparent discrepancy between this verse an [Gen
23:20](../kjv/gen023.htm#020), to read [Act 7:16](../kjv/act007.htm#016.md)
thus: "And they \[i.e., our fathers\] were carried over into Sychem, and
laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons
of Emmor \[the son\] of Sychem." In this way the purchase made by
Abraham is not to be confounded with the purchase made by Jacob
subsequently in the same district. Of this purchase by Abraham there is
not direct record in the Old Testament. (See TOMB.)

<span id="002">**Serah**</span> Abundance; princess, the daughter of
Asher and grand-daughter of Jacob ([Gen 46:17](../kjv/gen046.htm#017).md);
called also Sarah ([Num 26:46](../kjv/num026.htm#046); R.V., "Serah".md).

<span id="003">**Seraiah**</span> Soldier of Jehovah. (1.) The father of
Joab ([Ch1 4:13](../kjv/ch1004.htm#013.md), [Ch1
4:14](../kjv/ch1004.htm#014)). (2..md) The grandfather of Jehu ([Ch1
4:35](../kjv/ch1004.htm#035)). (3..md) One of David's scribes or
secretaries ([Sa2 8:17](../kjv/sa2008.htm#017)). (4..md) A Netophathite
([Jer 40:8](../kjv/jer040.htm#008).md), a chief priest of the time of
Zedekiah. He was carried captive by Nebuchadnezzar to Babylon, and there
put to death ([Kg2 25:18](../kjv/kg2025.htm#018.md), [Kg2
25:23](../kjv/kg2025.htm#023)). (5.) [Ezr 2:2](../kjv/ezr002.htm#002.md).
(6.) Father of Ezra the scribe ([Ezr 7:1](../kjv/ezr007.htm#001)). (7..md)
A ruler of the temple ([Neh 11:11](../kjv/neh011.htm#011)). (8..md) A
priest of the days of Jehoiakim ([Neh 12:1](../kjv/neh012.htm#001.md), [Neh
12:12](../kjv/neh012.htm#012)). (9..md) The son of Neriah. When Zedekiah
made a journey to Babylon to do homage to Nebuchadnezzar, Seraiah had
charge of the royal gifts to be presented on that occasion. Jeremiah
took advantage of the occasion, and sent with Seraiah a word of cheer to
the exiles in Babylon, and an announcement of the doom in store for that
guilty city. The roll containing this message ([Jer
50:1](../kjv/jer050.htm#001).md) Seraiah was to read to the exiles, and
then, after fixing a stone to it, was to throw it into the Euphrates,
uttering, as it sank, the prayer recorded in [Jer
51:59](../kjv/jer051.htm#059.md). Babylon was at this time in the height of
its glory, the greatest and most powerful monarchy in the world.
Scarcely seventy years elapsed when the words of the prophet were all
fulfilled. [Jer 51:59](../kjv/jer051.htm#059.md) is rendered in the Revised
Version, "Now Seraiah was chief chamberlain," instead of "was a quiet
prince," as in the Authorized Version.

<span id="004">**Seraphim**</span> Mentioned in [Isa
6:2](../kjv/isa006.htm#002), [Isa 6:3](../kjv/isa006.htm#003.md), [Isa
6:6](../kjv/isa006.htm#006), [Isa 6:7](../kjv/isa006.htm#007.md). This word
means fiery ones, in allusion, as is supposed, to their burning love.
They are represented as "standing" above the King as he sat upon his
throne, ready at once to minister unto him. Their form appears to have
been human, with the addition of wings. (See ANGELS.) This word, in the
original, is used elsewhere only of the "fiery serpents" ([Num
21:6](../kjv/num021.htm#006), [Num 21:8](../kjv/num021.htm#008.md); [Deu
8:15](../kjv/deu008.htm#015.md); compare [Isa
14:29](../kjv/isa014.htm#029); [Isa 30:6](../kjv/isa030.htm#006).md) sent
by God as his instruments to inflict on the people the righteous penalty
of sin.

<span id="005">**Sered**</span> Fear, one of the sons of Zebulun ([Gen
46:14](../kjv/gen046.htm#014).md).

<span id="006">**Sergeants**</span> [Act 16:35](../kjv/act016.htm#035.md),
[Act 16:38](../kjv/act016.htm#038) (R.V., "lictors".md), officers who
attended the magistrates and assisted them in the execution of justice.

<span id="007">**Sergius Paulus**</span> A "prudent man" (R.V., "man of
understanding"), the deputy (R.V., "proconsul") of Cyprus ([Act
13:6](../kjv/act013.htm#006).md). He became a convert to Christianity under
Paul, who visited this island on his first mission to the heathen. A
remarkable memorial of this proconsul was recently (1887) discovered at
Rome. On a boundary stone of Claudius his name is found, among others,
as having been appointed (A.D. 47) one of the curators of the banks and
the channel of the river Tiber. After serving his three years as
proconsul at Cyprus, he returned to Rome, where he held the office
referred to. As he is not saluted in Paul's letter to the Romans, he
probably died before it was written.

<span id="008">**Sermon on the Mount**</span> After spending a night in
solemn meditation and prayer in the lonely mountain-range to the west of
the Lake of Galilee ([Luk 6:12](../kjv/luk006.htm#012).md), on the
following morning our Lord called to him his disciples, and from among
them chose twelve, who were to be henceforth trained to be his apostles
([Mar 3:14](../kjv/mar003.htm#014), [Mar 3:15](../kjv/mar003.htm#015).md).
After this solemn consecration of the twelve, he descended from the
mountain-peak to a more level spot ([Luk 6:17](../kjv/luk006.htm#017).md),
and there he sat down and delivered the "sermon on the mount" (Matt.
5-7; Luke 6:20-49) to the assembled multitude. The mountain here spoken
of was probably that known by the name of the "Horns of Hattin" (Kurun
Hattin), a ridge running east and west, not far from Capernaum. It was
afterwards called the "Mount of Beatitudes."

<span id="009">**Serpent**</span> (Heb. nahash ; Gr. ophis ), frequently
noticed in Scripture. More than forty species are found in Syria and
Arabia. The poisonous character of the serpent is alluded to in Jacob's
blessing on Dan ([Gen 49:17](../kjv/gen049.htm#017.md); see [Pro
30:18](../kjv/pro030.htm#018), [Pro 30:19](../kjv/pro030.htm#019.md); [Jam
3:7](../kjv/jam003.htm#007); [Jer 8:17](../kjv/jer008.htm#017).md). (See
ADDER.) This word is used symbolically of a deadly, subtle, malicious
enemy ([Luk 10:19](../kjv/luk010.htm#019).md). The serpent is first
mentioned in connection with the history of the temptation and fall of
our first parents (Gen. 3). It has been well remarked regarding this
temptation: "A real serpent was the agent of the temptation, as is plain
from what is said of the natural characteristic of the serpent in the
first verse of the chapter ([Gen 3:1](../kjv/gen003.htm#001).md), and from
the curse pronounced upon the animal itself. But that Satan was the
actual tempter, and that he used the serpent merely as his instrument,
is evident (1.) from the nature of the transaction; for although the
serpent may be the most subtle of all the beasts of the field, yet he
has not the high intellectual faculties which the tempter here
displayed. (2.) In the New Testament it is both directly asserted and in
various forms assumed that Satan seduced our first parents into sin
([Joh 8:44](../kjv/joh008.htm#044); [Rom 16:20](../kjv/rom016.htm#020.md);
[Co2 11:3](../kjv/co2011.htm#003), [Co2 11:14](../kjv/co2011.htm#014.md);
[Rev 12:9](../kjv/rev012.htm#009); [Rev 20:2](../kjv/rev020.htm#002).md)."
