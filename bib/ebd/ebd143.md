<span id="000">**Gap**</span> A rent or opening in a wall ([Eze
13:5](../kjv/eze013.htm#005); compare [Amo 4:3](../kjv/amo004.htm#003).md).
The false prophets did not stand in the gap ([Eze
22:30](../kjv/eze022.htm#030).md), i.e., they did nothing to stop the
outbreak of wickedness.

<span id="001">**Gardens**</span> Mentioned in Scripture, of Eden ([Gen
2:8](../kjv/gen002.htm#008), [Gen 2:9](../kjv/gen002.htm#009).md); Ahab's
garden of herbs ([Kg1 21:2](../kjv/kg1021.htm#002).md); the royal garden
([Kg2 21:18](../kjv/kg2021.htm#018).md); the royal garden at Susa ([Est
1:5](../kjv/est001.htm#005).md); the garden of Joseph of Arimathea ([Joh
19:41](../kjv/joh019.htm#041).md); of Gethsemane ([Joh
18:1](../kjv/joh018.htm#001).md). The "king's garden" mentioned [Kg2
25:4](../kjv/kg2025.htm#004), [Neh 3:15](../kjv/neh003.htm#015.md), was
near the Pool of Siloam. Gardens were surrounded by hedges of thorns
([Isa 5:5](../kjv/isa005.htm#005).md) or by walls of stone ([Pro
24:31](../kjv/pro024.htm#031).md). "Watch-towers" or "lodges" were also
built in them ([Isa 1:8](../kjv/isa001.htm#008.md); [Mar
12:1](../kjv/mar012.htm#001).md), in which their keepers sat. On account of
their retirement they were frequently used as places for secret prayer
and communion with God ([Gen 24:63](../kjv/gen024.htm#063.md); [Mat
26:30](../kjv/mat026.htm#030); [Joh 1:48](../kjv/joh001.htm#048.md); [Joh
18:1](../kjv/joh018.htm#001), [Joh 18:2](../kjv/joh018.htm#002).md). The
dead were sometimes buried in gardens ([Gen
23:19](../kjv/gen023.htm#019), [Gen 23:20](../kjv/gen023.htm#020.md); [Kg2
21:18](../kjv/kg2021.htm#018), [Kg2 21:26](../kjv/kg2021.htm#026.md); [Sa1
25:1](../kjv/sa1025.htm#001); [Mar 15:46](../kjv/mar015.htm#046.md); [Joh
19:41](../kjv/joh019.htm#041)). (See PARADISE..md)

<span id="002">**Gareb**</span> Scabby; itch. (1.) One of David's
warriors ([Sa2 23:38](../kjv/sa2023.htm#038)), an Ithrite. (2..md) A hill
near Jerusalem ([Jer 31:39](../kjv/jer031.htm#039).md), probably the hill
of lepers, and consequently a place outside the boundary of the city.

<span id="003">**Garlands**</span> ([Act 14:13](../kjv/act014.htm#013).md).
In heathen sacrifices the victims were adorned with fillets and garlands
made of wool, with leaves and flowers interwoven. The altar and the
priests and attendants were also in like manner adorned.

<span id="004">**Garlic**</span> (Heb. shum , from its strong odor),
mentioned only once ([Num 11:5](../kjv/num011.htm#005).md). The garlic
common in Eastern countries is the Allium sativum or Allium Ascalonicum,
so called from its having been brought into Europe from Ascalon by the
Crusaders. It is now known by the name of "shallot" or "eschalot."

<span id="005">**Garner**</span> (1.) Heb. 'otsar , a treasure; a store
of goods laid up, and hence also the place where they are deposited
([Joe 1:17](../kjv/joe001.htm#017); [Ch2 32:27](../kjv/ch2032.htm#027.md),
rendered "treasury"). (2.) Heb. mezev , a cell, storeroom ([Psa
144:13](../kjv/psa144.htm#013).md); Gr. apotheke , a place for storing
anything, a granary ([Mat 3:12](../kjv/mat003.htm#012.md); [Luk
3:17](../kjv/luk003.htm#017).md).

<span id="006">**Garnish**</span> Overlay with stones ([Ch2
3:6](../kjv/ch2003.htm#006).md), adorn ([Rev
21:19](../kjv/rev021.htm#019).md), deck with garlands ([Mat
23:29](../kjv/mat023.htm#029).md), furnish ([Mat
12:44](../kjv/mat012.htm#044)). In [Job 26:13](../kjv/job026.htm#013.md)
(Heb. shiphrah , meaning "brightness"), "By his spirit the heavens are
brightness" i.e., are bright, splendid, beautiful.

<span id="007">**Garrison**</span> (1.) Heb. matstsab , a station; a
place where one stands ([Sa1 14:12](../kjv/sa1014.htm#012).md); a military
or fortified post ([Sa1 13:23](../kjv/sa1013.htm#023.md); [Sa1
14:1](../kjv/sa1014.htm#001), [Sa1 14:4](../kjv/sa1014.htm#004.md), [Sa1
14:6](../kjv/sa1014.htm#006), etc.). (2..md) Heb. netsib , a praefect,
superintendent; hence a military post ([Sa1
10:5](../kjv/sa1010.htm#005); [Sa1 13:3](../kjv/sa1013.htm#003.md), [Sa1
13:4](../kjv/sa1013.htm#004); [Sa2 8:6](../kjv/sa2008.htm#006).md). This
word has also been explained to denote a pillar set up to mark the
Philistine conquest, or an officer appointed to collect taxes; but the
idea of a military post seems to be the correct one. (3.) Heb.
matstsebah , properly a monumental column; improperly rendered pl.
"garrisons" in [Eze 26:11](../kjv/eze026.htm#011.md); correctly in Revised
Version "pillars," marg. "obelisks," probably an idolatrous image.

<span id="008">**Gate**</span> (1.) Of cities, as of Jerusalem ([Jer
37:13](../kjv/jer037.htm#013); [Neh 1:3](../kjv/neh001.htm#003.md); [Neh
2:3](../kjv/neh002.htm#003); [Neh 3:3](../kjv/neh003.htm#003).md), of Sodom
([Gen 19:1](../kjv/gen019.htm#001).md), of Gaza ([Jdg
16:3](../kjv/jdg016.htm#003)). (2..md) Of royal palaces ([Neh
2:8](../kjv/neh002.htm#008)). (3..md) Of the temple of Solomon ([Kg1
6:34](../kjv/kg1006.htm#034), [Kg1 6:35](../kjv/kg1006.htm#035.md); [Kg2
18:16](../kjv/kg2018.htm#016).md); of the holy place ([Kg1
6:31](../kjv/kg1006.htm#031), [Kg1 6:32](../kjv/kg1006.htm#032.md); [Eze
41:23](../kjv/eze041.htm#023), [Eze 41:24](../kjv/eze041.htm#024).md); of
the outer courts of the temple, the beautiful gate ([Act
3:2](../kjv/act003.htm#002)). (4..md) Tombs ([Mat
27:60](../kjv/mat027.htm#060)). (5..md) Prisons ([Act
12:10](../kjv/act012.htm#010); [Act 16:27](../kjv/act016.htm#027)). (6..md)
Caverns ([Kg1 19:13](../kjv/kg1019.htm#013)). (7..md) Camps ([Exo
32:26](../kjv/exo032.htm#026), [Exo 32:27](../kjv/exo032.htm#027.md); [Heb
13:12](../kjv/heb013.htm#012).md). The materials of which gates were made
were, (1.) Iron and brass ([Psa 107:16](../kjv/psa107.htm#016.md); [Isa
45:2](../kjv/isa045.htm#002); [Act 12:10](../kjv/act012.htm#010)). (2..md)
Stones and pearls ([Isa 54:12](../kjv/isa054.htm#012.md); [Rev
21:21](../kjv/rev021.htm#021)). (3..md) Wood ([Jdg
16:3](../kjv/jdg016.htm#003).md) probably. At the gates of cities courts of
justice were frequently held, and hence "judges of the gate" are spoken
of ([Deu 16:18](../kjv/deu016.htm#018.md); [Deu
17:8](../kjv/deu017.htm#008); [Deu 21:19](../kjv/deu021.htm#019.md); [Deu
25:6](../kjv/deu025.htm#006), [Deu 25:7](../kjv/deu025.htm#007), etc..md).
At the gates prophets also frequently delivered their messages ([Pro
1:21](../kjv/pro001.htm#021); [Pro 8:3](../kjv/pro008.htm#003.md); [Isa
29:21](../kjv/isa029.htm#021); [Jer 17:19](../kjv/jer017.htm#019.md), [Jer
17:20](../kjv/jer017.htm#020); [Jer 26:10](../kjv/jer026.htm#010).md).
Criminals were punished without the gates ([Kg1
21:13](../kjv/kg1021.htm#013); [Act 7:59](../kjv/act007.htm#059).md). By
the "gates of righteousness" we are probably to understand those of the
temple ([Psa 118:19](../kjv/psa118.htm#019).md). "The gates of hell" (R.V.,
"gates of Hades") [Mat 16:18](../kjv/mat016.htm#018.md), are generally
interpreted as meaning the power of Satan, but probably they may mean
the power of death, denoting that the Church of Christ shall never die.

<span id="009">**Gath**</span> A wine-vat one of the five royal cities
of the Philistines ([Jos 13:3](../kjv/jos013.htm#003).md) on which the ark
brought calamity ([Sa1 5:8](../kjv/sa1005.htm#008.md), [Sa1
5:9](../kjv/sa1005.htm#009); [Sa1 6:17](../kjv/sa1006.htm#017).md). It was
famous also as being the birthplace or residence of Goliath ([Sa1
17:4](../kjv/sa1017.htm#004).md). David fled from Saul to Achish, king of
Gath ([Sa1 21:10](../kjv/sa1021.htm#010.md); [Sa1
27:2](../kjv/sa1027.htm#002); [Psa 56:1](../kjv/psa056.htm#001).md), and
his connection with it will account for the words in [Sa2
1:20](../kjv/sa2001.htm#020.md). It was afterwards conquered by David ([Sa2
8:1](../kjv/sa2008.htm#001).md). It occupied a strong position on the
borders of Judah and Philistia ([Sa1 21:10](../kjv/sa1021.htm#010.md); [Ch1
18:1](../kjv/ch1018.htm#001).md). Its site has been identified with the
hill called Tell es Safieh, the Alba Specula of the Middle Ages, which
rises 695 feet above the plain on its east edge. It is noticed on
monuments about 1500 B.C.. (See METHEG-AMMAH.)
