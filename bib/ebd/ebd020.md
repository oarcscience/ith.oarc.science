<span id="000">**Ambush**</span> Joshua at the capture of Ai lay in
ambush, and so deceived the inhabitants that he gained an easy victory
(Josh. 8:4-26). Shechem was taken in this manner (Judg. 9:30-45. Compare
[Jer 51:12](../kjv/jer051.htm#012).md).

<span id="001">**Amen**</span> This Hebrew word means firm, and hence
also faithful ([Rev 3:14](../kjv/rev003.htm#014).md). In [Isa
65:16](../kjv/isa065.htm#016.md), the Authorized Version has "the God of
truth," which in Hebrew is "the God of Amen." It is frequently used by
our Saviour to give emphasis to his words, where it is translated
"verily." Sometimes, only, however, in John's Gospel, it is repeated,
"Verily, verily." It is used as an epithet of the Lord Jesus Christ
([Rev 3:14](../kjv/rev003.htm#014).md). It is found singly and sometimes
doubly at the end of prayers ([Psa 41:13](../kjv/psa041.htm#013.md); [Psa
72:19](../kjv/psa072.htm#019); [Psa 89:52](../kjv/psa089.htm#052).md), to
confirm the words and invoke the fulfillment of them. It is used in
token of being bound by an oath ([Num 5:22](../kjv/num005.htm#022.md); [Deu
27:15](../kjv/deu027.htm#015); [Neh 5:13](../kjv/neh005.htm#013.md); [Neh
8:6](../kjv/neh008.htm#006); [Ch1 16:36](../kjv/ch1016.htm#036).md). In the
primitive churches it was common for the general audience to say "Amen"
at the close of the prayer ([Co1 14:16](../kjv/co1014.htm#016).md). The
promises of God are Amen; i.e., they are all true and sure ([Co2
1:20](../kjv/co2001.htm#020).md).

<span id="002">**Amethyst**</span> One of the precious stones in the
breastplate of the high priest ([Exo 28:19](../kjv/exo028.htm#019.md); [Exo
39:12](../kjv/exo039.htm#012).md), and in the foundation of the New
Jerusalem ([Rev 21:20](../kjv/rev021.htm#020).md). The ancients thought
that this stone had the power of dispelling drunkenness in all who wore
or touched it, and hence its Greek name formed from a, " privative ,"
and methuo , "to get drunk." Its Jewish name, ahlamah' , was derived by
the rabbins from the Hebrew word halam , "to dream," from its supposed
power of causing the wearer to dream. It is a pale-blue crystallized
quartz, varying to a dark purple blue. It is found in Persia and India,
also in different parts of Europe.

a native of Gath-hepher ([Kg2 14:25](../kjv/kg2014.htm#025.md); [Jon
1:1](../kjv/jon001.htm#001).md).

<span id="004">**Ammah**</span> A cubit, the name of a hill which Joab
and Abishai reached as the sun went down, when they were in pursuit of
Abner ([Sa2 2:24](../kjv/sa2002.htm#024).md). It lay to the east of Gibeon.

<span id="005">**Ammi**</span> My people, a name given by Jehovah to the
people of Israel ([Hos 2:1](../kjv/hos002.htm#001.md), [Hos
2:23](../kjv/hos002.htm#023). Compare [Hos 1:9](../kjv/hos001.htm#009.md);
[Eze 16:8](../kjv/eze016.htm#008); [Rom 9:25](../kjv/rom009.htm#025.md),
[Rom 9:26](../kjv/rom009.htm#026); [Pe1 2:10](../kjv/pe1002.htm#010).md).
