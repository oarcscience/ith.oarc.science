------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Mahlah**</span> Disease, one of the five daughters of
Zelophehad ([Num 27:1](../kjv/num027.htm#001).md) who had their father's
inheritance, the law of inheritance having been altered in their favour.

<span id="001">**Mahlon**</span> Sickly, the elder of Elimelech the
Bethlehemite's two sons by Naomi. He married Ruth and died childless
([Rut 1:2](../kjv/rut001.htm#002), [Rut 1:5](../kjv/rut001.htm#005.md);
[Rut 4:9](../kjv/rut004.htm#009), [Rut 4:10](../kjv/rut004.htm#010).md), in
the land of Moab.

<span id="002">**Mahol**</span> Dance, the father of four sons ([Kg1
4:31](../kjv/kg1004.htm#031).md) who were inferior in wisdom only to
Solomon.

<span id="003">**Mail, Coat of**</span> "A corselet of scales," a
cuirass formed of pieces of metal overlapping each other, like
fish-scales ([Sa1 17:5](../kjv/sa1017.htm#005).md); also ([Sa1
17:38](../kjv/sa1017.htm#038).md) a corselet or garment thus encased.

<span id="004">**Main-sail**</span> (Gr. artemon ), answering to the
modern "mizzen-sail," as some suppose. Others understand the "jib," near
the prow, or the "fore-sail," as likely to be most useful in bringing a
ship's head to the wind in the circumstances described ([Act
27:40](../kjv/act027.htm#040).md).

<span id="005">**Makheloth**</span> Assemblies, a station of the
Israelites in the desert ([Num 33:25](../kjv/num033.htm#025.md), [Num
33:26](../kjv/num033.htm#026).md).

<span id="006">**Makkedah**</span> Herdsman's place, one of the royal
cities of the Canaanites ([Jos 12:16](../kjv/jos012.htm#016).md), near
which was a cave where the five kings who had confederated against
Israel sought refuge (Josh. 10:10-29). They were put to death by Joshua,
who afterwards suspended their bodies upon five trees. It has been
identified with the modern village called Sumeil, standing on a low hill
about 7 miles to the north-west of Eleutheropolis (Beit Jibrin), where
are ancient remains and a great cave. The Palestine Exploration
surveyors have, however, identified it with el-Mughar, or "the caves," 3
miles from Jabneh and 2 1/2 southwest of Ekron, because, they say, "at
this site only of all possible sites for Makkedah in the Palestine plain
do caves still exist." (See ADONI-ZEDEC.)

<span id="007">**Maktesh**</span> Mortar, a place in or near Jerusalem
inhabited by silver merchants ([Zep 1:11](../kjv/zep001.htm#011).md). It
has been conjectured that it was the "Phoenician quarter" of the city,
where the traders of that nation resided, after the Oriental custom.

<span id="008">**Malachi**</span> Messenger or angel, the last of the
minor prophets, and the writer of the last book of the Old Testament
canon ([Mal 4:4](../kjv/mal004.htm#004.md), [Mal
4:5](../kjv/mal004.htm#005), [Mal 4:6](../kjv/mal004.htm#006).md). Nothing
is known of him beyond what is contained in his book of prophecies. Some
have supposed that the name is simply a title descriptive of his
character as a messenger of Jehovah, and not a proper name. There is
reason, however, to conclude that Malachi was the ordinary name of the
prophet. He was contemporary with Nehemiah (compare [Mal
2:8](../kjv/mal002.htm#008) with [Neh 13:15](../kjv/neh013.htm#015.md);
[Mal 2:10](../kjv/mal002.htm#010.md) with [Neh
13:23](../kjv/neh013.htm#023).md). No allusion is made to him by Ezra, and
he does not mention the restoration of the temple, and hence it is
inferred that he prophesied after Haggai and Zechariah, and when the
temple services were still in existence ([Mal
1:10](../kjv/mal001.htm#010); [Mal 3:1](../kjv/mal003.htm#001.md), [Mal
3:10](../kjv/mal003.htm#010).md). It is probable that he delivered his
prophecies about 420 B.C., after the second return of Nehemiah from
Persia ([Neh 13:6](../kjv/neh013.htm#006).md), or possibly before his
return.

<span id="009">**Malachi, Prophecies of**</span> The contents of the
book are comprised in four chapters. In the Hebrew text the third and
fourth chapters (of the A.V.) form but one. The whole consists of three
sections, preceded by an introduction ([Mal
1:1](../kjv/mal001.htm#001).md), in which the prophet reminds Israel of
Jehovah's love to them. The first section (Mal. 1:6 - 2:9) contains a
stern rebuke addressed to the priests who had despised the name of
Jehovah, and been leaders in a departure from his worship and from the
covenant, and for their partiality in administering the law. In the
second ([Mal 2:9](../kjv/mal002.htm#009).md) the people are rebuked for
their intermarriages with idolatrous heathen. In the third (Mal.
2:17-4:6) he addresses the people as a whole, and warns them of the
coming of the God of judgment, preceded by the advent of the Messiah.
This book is frequently referred to in the New Testament ([Mat
11:10](../kjv/mat011.htm#010); [Mat 17:12](../kjv/mat017.htm#012.md); [Mar
1:2](../kjv/mar001.htm#002); [Mar 9:11](../kjv/mar009.htm#011.md), [Mar
9:12](../kjv/mar009.htm#012); [Luk 1:17](../kjv/luk001.htm#017.md); [Rom
9:13](../kjv/rom009.htm#013).md).
