<span id="000">**Buckler**</span> (1.) A portable shield ([Sa2
22:31](../kjv/sa2022.htm#031); [Ch1 5:18](../kjv/ch1005.htm#018)). (2..md)
A shield surrounding the person; the targe or round form; used once
figuratively ([Psa 91:4](../kjv/psa091.htm#004)). (3..md) A large shield
protecting the whole body ([Psa 35:2](../kjv/psa035.htm#002.md); [Eze
23:24](../kjv/eze023.htm#024); [Eze 26:8](../kjv/eze026.htm#008)). (4..md)
A lance or spear; improperly rendered "buckler" in the Authorized
Version ([Ch1 12:8](../kjv/ch1012.htm#008).md), but correctly in the
Revised Version "spear." The leather of shields required oiling ([Sa2
1:21](../kjv/sa2001.htm#021); [Isa 21:5](../kjv/isa021.htm#005).md), so as
to prevent its being injured by moisture. Copper (= "brass") shields
were also in use ([Sa1 17:6](../kjv/sa1017.htm#006.md); [Kg1
14:27](../kjv/kg1014.htm#027).md). Those spoken of in [Kg1
10:16](../kjv/kg1010.htm#016), etc.; [Kg1 14:26](../kjv/kg1014.htm#026.md),
were probably of massive metal. The shields David had taken from his
enemies were suspended in the temple as mementos ([Kg2
11:10](../kjv/kg2011.htm#010)). (See ARMOUR, SHIELD..md)

<span id="001">**Building**</span> Among the Jews was suited to the
climate and conditions of the country. They probably adopted the kind of
architecture for their dwellings which they found already existing when
they entered Canaan ([Deu 6:10](../kjv/deu006.htm#010.md); [Num
13:19](../kjv/num013.htm#019).md). Phoenician artists ([Sa2
5:11](../kjv/sa2005.htm#011); [Kg1 5:6](../kjv/kg1005.htm#006.md), [Kg1
5:18](../kjv/kg1005.htm#018).md) assisted at the erection of the royal
palace and the temple at Jerusalem. Foreigners also assisted at the
restoration of the temple after the Exile ([Ezr
3:7](../kjv/ezr003.htm#007)). In [Gen 11:3](../kjv/gen011.htm#003.md), [Gen
11:9](../kjv/gen011.htm#009.md), we have the first recorded instance of the
erection of buildings. The cities of the plain of Shinar were founded by
the descendants of Shem ([Gen 10:11](../kjv/gen010.htm#011.md), [Gen
10:12](../kjv/gen010.htm#012), [Gen 10:22](../kjv/gen010.htm#022).md). The
Israelites were by occupation shepherds and dwellers in tents ([Gen
47:3](../kjv/gen047.htm#003).md); but from the time of their entering
Canaan they became dwellers in towns, and in houses built of the native
limestone of Palestine. Much building was carried on in Solomon's time.
Besides the buildings he completed at Jerusalem, he also built Baalath
and Tadmor ([Kg1 9:15](../kjv/kg1009.htm#015.md), [Kg1
9:24](../kjv/kg1009.htm#024).md). Many of the kings of Israel and Judah
were engaged in erecting various buildings. Herod and his sons and
successors restored the temple, and built fortifications and other
structures of great magnificence in Jerusalem ([Luk
21:5](../kjv/luk021.htm#005).md). The instruments used in building are
mentioned as the plumb line ([Amo 7:7](../kjv/amo007.htm#007).md), the
measuring-reed ([Eze 40:3](../kjv/eze040.htm#003).md), and the saw ([Kg1
7:9](../kjv/kg1007.htm#009).md). Believers are "God's building" ([Co1
3:9](../kjv/co1003.htm#009).md); and heaven is called "a building of God"
([Co2 5:1](../kjv/co2005.htm#001).md). Christ is the only foundation of his
church ([Co1 3:10](../kjv/co1003.htm#010).md), of which he also is the
builder ([Mat 16:18](../kjv/mat016.htm#018).md).

<span id="002">**Bul**</span> Rainy, the eighth ecclesiastical month of
the year ([Kg1 6:38](../kjv/kg1006.htm#038).md), and the second month of
the civil year; later called Marchesvan (q.v.). (See MONTH.)

<span id="003">**Bullock**</span> (1.) The translation of a word which
is a generic name for horned cattle ([Isa
65:25](../kjv/isa065.htm#025).md). It is also rendered "cow" ([Eze
4:15](../kjv/eze004.htm#015).md), "ox" ([Gen
12:16](../kjv/gen012.htm#016)). (2..md) The translation of a word always
meaning an animal of the ox kind, without distinction of age or sex
([Hos 12:11](../kjv/hos012.htm#011).md). It is rendered "cow" ([Num
18:17](../kjv/num018.htm#017).md) and "ox" ([Lev
17:3](../kjv/lev017.htm#003)). (3..md) Another word is rendered in the same
way ([Jer 31:18](../kjv/jer031.htm#018).md). It is also translated "calf"
([Lev 9:3](../kjv/lev009.htm#003); [Mic 6:6](../kjv/mic006.htm#006).md). It
is the same word used of the "molten calf" ([Exo
32:4](../kjv/exo032.htm#004), [Exo 32:8](../kjv/exo032.htm#008).md) and
"the golden calf" ([Kg1 12:28](../kjv/kg1012.htm#028)). (4..md) In [Jdg
6:25](../kjv/jdg006.htm#025); [Isa 34:7](../kjv/isa034.htm#007.md), the
Hebrew word is different. It is the customary word for bulls offered in
sacrifice. In [Hos 14:2](../kjv/hos014.htm#002.md), the Authorized Version
has "calves," the Revised Version "bullocks."

<span id="004">**Bulrush**</span> (1.) In [Isa
58:5](../kjv/isa058.htm#005.md) the rendering of a word which denotes
"belonging to a marsh," from the nature of the soil in which it grows
([Isa 18:2](../kjv/isa018.htm#002).md). It was sometimes platted into ropes
([Job 41:2](../kjv/job041.htm#002.md); A.V., "hook," R.V., "rope," lit.
"cord of rushes"). (2.) In [Exo 2:3](../kjv/exo002.htm#003.md), [Isa
18:2](../kjv/isa018.htm#002) (R.V., "papyrus".md) this word is the
translation of the Hebrew gome, which designates the plant as absorbing
moisture. In [Isa 35:7](../kjv/isa035.htm#007.md) and [Job
8:11](../kjv/job008.htm#011.md) it is rendered "rush." This was the
Egyptian papyrus (papyrus Nilotica). It was anciently very abundant in
Egypt. The Egyptians made garments and shoes and various utensils of it.
It was used for the construction of the ark of Moses ([Exo
2:3](../kjv/exo002.htm#003), [Exo 2:5](../kjv/exo002.htm#005).md). The root
portions of the stem were used for food. The inside bark was cut into
strips, which were sewed together and dried in the sun, forming the
papyrus used for writing. It is no longer found in Egypt, but grows
luxuriantly in Palestine, in the marshes of the Huleh, and in the swamps
at the north end of the Lake of Gennesaret. (See CANE.)

<span id="005">**Bulwarks**</span> Mural towers, bastions, were
introduced by king Uzziah ([Ch2 26:15](../kjv/ch2026.htm#015.md); [Zep
1:16](../kjv/zep001.htm#016); [Psa 48:13](../kjv/psa048.htm#013.md); [Isa
26:1](../kjv/isa026.htm#001).md). There are five Hebrew words so rendered
in the Authorized Version, but the same word is also variously rendered.

<span id="006">**Bunch**</span> (1.) A bundle of twigs ([Exo
12:22](../kjv/exo012.htm#022)). (2..md) Bunch or cake of raisins ([Sa2
16:1](../kjv/sa2016.htm#001)). (3..md) The "bunch of a camel" ([Isa
30:6](../kjv/isa030.htm#006).md).

<span id="007">**Burden**</span> (1.) A load of any kind ([Exo
23:5](../kjv/exo023.htm#005)). (2..md) A severe task ([Exo
2:11](../kjv/exo002.htm#011)). (3..md) A difficult duty, requiring effort
([Exo 18:22](../kjv/exo018.htm#022)). (4..md) A prophecy of a calamitous or
disastrous nature ([Isa 13:1](../kjv/isa013.htm#001.md); [Isa
17:1](../kjv/isa017.htm#001); [Hab 1:1](../kjv/hab001.htm#001), etc..md).

<span id="008">**Burial**</span> The first burial we have an account of
is that of Sarah (Gen. 23). The first commercial transaction recorded is
that of the purchase of a burial-place, for which Abraham weighed to
Ephron "four hundred shekels of silver current money with the
merchants." Thus the patriarch became the owner of a part of the land of
Canaan, the only part he ever possessed. When he himself died, "his sons
Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah," beside Sarah his
wife ([Gen 25:9](../kjv/gen025.htm#009).md). Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, was
buried under Allon-bachuth, "the oak of weeping" ([Gen
35:8](../kjv/gen035.htm#008).md), near to Bethel. Rachel died, and was
buried near Ephrath; "and Jacob set a pillar upon her grave" ([Gen
35:16](../kjv/gen035.htm#016).md). Isaac was buried at Hebron, where he had
died ([Gen 35:27](../kjv/gen035.htm#027.md), [Gen
35:29](../kjv/gen035.htm#029).md). Jacob, when charging his sons to bury
him in the cave of Machpelah, said, "There they buried Abraham and Sarah
his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I
buried Leah" ([Gen 49:31](../kjv/gen049.htm#031).md). In compliance with
the oath which he made him swear unto him ([Gen
47:29](../kjv/gen047.htm#029).md), Joseph, assisted by his brethren, buried
Jacob in the cave of Machpelah ([Gen 50:2](../kjv/gen050.htm#002.md), [Gen
50:13](../kjv/gen050.htm#013).md). At the Exodus, Moses "took the bones of
Joseph with him," and they were buried in the "parcel of ground" which
Jacob had bought of the sons of Hamor ([Jos
24:32](../kjv/jos024.htm#032).md), which became Joseph's inheritance ([Gen
48:22](../kjv/gen048.htm#022); [Ch1 5:1](../kjv/ch1005.htm#001.md); [Joh
4:5](../kjv/joh004.htm#005).md). Two burials are mentioned as having taken
place in the wilderness. That of Miriam ([Num
20:1](../kjv/num020.htm#001).md), and that of Moses, "in the land of Moab"
([Deu 34:5](../kjv/deu034.htm#005), [Deu 34:6](../kjv/deu034.htm#006.md),
[Deu 34:8](../kjv/deu034.htm#008).md). There is no account of the actual
burial of Aaron, which probably, however, took place on the summit of
Mount Hor ([Num 20:28](../kjv/num020.htm#028.md), [Num
20:29](../kjv/num020.htm#029).md). Joshua was buried "in the border of his
inheritance in Timnath-serah" ([Jos 24:30](../kjv/jos024.htm#030).md). In
Job we find a reference to burying-places, which were probably the
Pyramids ([Job 3:14](../kjv/job003.htm#014.md), [Job
3:15](../kjv/job003.htm#015).md). The Hebrew word for "waste places" here
resembles in sound the Egyptian word for "pyramids." Samuel, like Moses,
was honoured with a national burial ([Sa1 25:1](../kjv/sa1025.htm#001).md).
Joab ([Kg1 2:34](../kjv/kg1002.htm#034).md) "was buried in his own house in
the wilderness." In connection with the burial of Saul and his three
sons we meet for the first time with the practice of burning the dead
([Sa1 31:11](../kjv/sa1031.htm#011).md). The same practice is again
referred to by Amos ([Amo 6:10](../kjv/amo006.htm#010).md). Absalom was
buried "in the wood" where he was slain ([Sa2
18:17](../kjv/sa2018.htm#017), [Sa2 18:18](../kjv/sa2018.htm#018).md). The
raising of the heap of stones over his grave was intended to mark
abhorrence of the person buried (compare [Jos
7:26](../kjv/jos007.htm#026); [Jos 8:29](../kjv/jos008.htm#029).md). There
was no fixed royal burying-place for the Hebrew kings. We find several
royal burials taking place, however, "in the city of David" ([Kg1
2:10](../kjv/kg1002.htm#010); [Kg1 11:43](../kjv/kg1011.htm#043.md); [Kg1
15:8](../kjv/kg1015.htm#008); [Kg2 14:19](../kjv/kg2014.htm#019.md), [Kg2
14:20](../kjv/kg2014.htm#020); [Kg2 15:38](../kjv/kg2015.htm#038.md); [Kg1
14:31](../kjv/kg1014.htm#031); [Kg1 22:50](../kjv/kg1022.htm#050.md); [Ch2
21:19](../kjv/ch2021.htm#019), [Ch2 21:20](../kjv/ch2021.htm#020.md); [Ch2
24:25](../kjv/ch2024.htm#025), etc..md). Hezekiah was buried in the mount
of the sepulchres of the sons of David; "and all Judah and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death" ([Ch2
32:33](../kjv/ch2032.htm#033).md). Little is said regarding the burial of
the kings of Israel. Some of them were buried in Samaria, the capital of
their kingdom ([Kg2 10:35](../kjv/kg2010.htm#035.md); [Kg2
13:9](../kjv/kg2013.htm#009); [Kg2 14:16](../kjv/kg2014.htm#016).md). Our
Lord was buried in a new tomb, hewn out of the rock, which Joseph of
Arimathea had prepared for himself ([Mat 27:57](../kjv/mat027.htm#057.md);
[Mar 15:46](../kjv/mar015.htm#046); [Joh 19:41](../kjv/joh019.htm#041.md),
[Joh 19:42](../kjv/joh019.htm#042).md). The grave of Lazarus was "a cave,
and a stone lay on it" ([Joh 11:38](../kjv/joh011.htm#038).md). Graves were
frequently either natural caverns or artificial excavations formed in
the sides of rocks ([Gen 23:9](../kjv/gen023.htm#009.md); [Mat
27:60](../kjv/mat027.htm#060).md); and coffins were seldom used, unless
when the body was brought from a distance.

<span id="009">**Burnt-offering**</span> Hebrew olah; i.e., "ascending,"
the whole being consumed by fire, and regarded as ascending to God while
being consumed. Part of every offering was burnt in the sacred fire, but
this was wholly burnt, a "whole burnt offering." It was the most
frequent form of sacrifice, and apparently the only one mentioned in the
book of Genesis. Such were the sacrifices offered by Abel ([Gen
4:3](../kjv/gen004.htm#003), [Gen 4:4](../kjv/gen004.htm#004.md), here
called minhah; i.e., "a gift"), Noah ([Gen
8:20](../kjv/gen008.htm#020).md), Abraham ([Gen
22:2](../kjv/gen022.htm#002), [Gen 22:7](../kjv/gen022.htm#007.md), [Gen
22:8](../kjv/gen022.htm#008), [Gen 22:13](../kjv/gen022.htm#013).md), and
by the Hebrews in Egypt ([Exo 10:25](../kjv/exo010.htm#025).md). The law of
Moses afterwards prescribed the occasions and the manner in which burnt
sacrifices were to be offered. There were "the continual burnt offering"
([Exo 29:38](../kjv/exo029.htm#038); [Lev 6:9](../kjv/lev006.htm#009).md),
"the burnt offering of every sabbath," which was double the daily one
([Num 28:9](../kjv/num028.htm#009), [Num 28:10](../kjv/num028.htm#010).md),
"the burnt offering of every month" ([Num
28:11](../kjv/num028.htm#011).md), the offerings at the Passover ([Num
28:19](../kjv/num028.htm#019).md), at Pentecost ([Lev
23:16](../kjv/lev023.htm#016).md), the feast of Trumpets ([Lev
23:23](../kjv/lev023.htm#023)), and on the day of Atonement (Lev. 16.md).
On other occasions special sacrifices were offered, as at the
consecration of Aaron (Ex. 29) and the dedication of the temple ([Kg1
8:5](../kjv/kg1008.htm#005), [Kg1 8:62](../kjv/kg1008.htm#062).md).
Free-will burnt offerings were also permitted ([Lev
1:13](../kjv/lev001.htm#013).md), and were offered at the accession of
Solomon to the throne ([Ch1 29:21](../kjv/ch1029.htm#021).md), and at the
reformation brought about by Hezekiah ([Ch2
29:31](../kjv/ch2029.htm#031).md). These offerings signified the complete
dedication of the offerers unto God. This is referred to in [Rom
12:1](../kjv/rom012.htm#001). (See ALTAR, SACRIFICE..md)
