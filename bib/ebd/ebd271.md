<span id="000">**Nergal-sharezer**</span> Nergal, protect the king! (1.)
One of the "princes of the king of Babylon who accompanied him in his
last expedition against Jerusalem" ([Jer 39:3](../kjv/jer039.htm#003.md),
[Jer 39:13](../kjv/jer039.htm#013)). (2..md) Another of the "princes," who
bore the title of "Rabmag." He was one of those who were sent to release
Jeremiah from prison ([Jer 39:13](../kjv/jer039.htm#013).md) by "the
captain of the guard." He was a Babylonian grandee of high rank. From
profane history and the inscriptions, we are led to conclude that he was
the Neriglissar who murdered Evilmerodach, the son of Nebuchadnezzar,
and succeeded him on the throne of Babylon (559-556 B.C.). He was
married to a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar. The ruins of a palace, the only
one on the right bank of the Euphrates, bear inscriptions denoting that
it was built by this king. He was succeeded by his son, a mere boy, who
was murdered after a reign of some nine months by a conspiracy of the
nobles, one of whom, Nabonadius, ascended the vacant throne, and reigned
for a period of seventeen years (B.C.555-538), at the close of which
period Babylon was taken by Cyrus. Belshazzar, who comes into notice in
connection with the taking of Babylon, was by some supposed to have been
the same as Nabonadius, who was called Nebuchadnezzar's son ([Dan
5:11](../kjv/dan005.htm#011), [Dan 5:18](../kjv/dan005.htm#018.md), [Dan
5:22](../kjv/dan005.htm#022).md), because he had married his daughter. But
it is known from the inscriptions that Nabonadius had a son called
Belshazzar, who may have been his father's associate on the throne at
the time of the fall of Babylon, and who therefore would be the grandson
of Nebuchadnezzar. The Jews had only one word, usually rendered
"father," to represent also such a relationship as that of "grandfather"
or "great-grandfather."

<span id="001">**Nero**</span> Occurs only in the superscription (which
is probably spurious, and is altogether omitted in the R.V.) to the
Second Epistle to Timothy. He became emperor of Rome when he was about
seventeen years of age (A.D. 54), and soon began to exhibit the
character of a cruel tyrant and heathen debaucher. In May A.D. 64, a
terrible conflagration broke out in Rome, which raged for six days and
seven nights, and totally destroyed a great part of the city. The guilt
of this fire was attached to him at the time, and the general verdict of
history accuses him of the crime. "Hence, to suppress the rumour," says
Tacitus (Annals, xv. 44), "he falsely charged with the guilt, and
punished with the most exquisite tortures, the persons commonly called
Christians, who are hated for their enormities. Christus, the founder of
that name, was put to death as a criminal by Pontius Pilate, procurator
of Judea, in the reign of Tiberius; but the pernicious superstition,
repressed for a time, broke out again, not only throughout Judea, where
the mischief originated, but through the city of Rome also, whither all
things horrible and disgraceful flow, from all quarters, as to a common
receptacle, and where they are encouraged. Accordingly, first three were
seized, who confessed they were Christians. Next, on their information,
a vast multitude were convicted, not so much on the charge of burning
the city as of hating the human race. And in their deaths they were also
made the subjects of sport; for they were covered with the hides of wild
beasts and worried to death by dogs, or nailed to crosses, or set fire
to, and, when day declined, burned to serve for nocturnal lights. Nero
offered his own gardens for that spectacle, and exhibited a Circensian
game, indiscriminately mingling with the common people in the habit of a
charioteer, or else standing in his chariot; whence a feeling of
compassion arose toward the sufferers, though guilty and deserving to be
made examples of by capital punishment, because they seemed not to be
cut off for the public good, but victims to the ferocity of one man."
Another Roman historian, Suetonius (Nero, xvi.), says of him: "He
likewise inflicted punishments on the Christians, a sort of people who
hold a new and impious superstition" (Forbes's Footsteps of St. Paul, p.
60). Nero was the emperor before whom Paul was brought on his first
imprisonment at Rome, and the apostle is supposed to have suffered
martyrdom during this persecution. He is repeatedly alluded to in
Scripture ([Act 25:11](../kjv/act025.htm#011.md); [Phi
1:12](../kjv/phi001.htm#012), [Phi 1:13](../kjv/phi001.htm#013.md); [Phi
4:22](../kjv/phi004.htm#022).md). He died A.D. 68.

<span id="002">**Net**</span> In use among the Hebrews for fishing,
hunting, and fowling. The fishing-net was probably constructed after the
form of that used by the Egyptians ([Isa 19:8](../kjv/isa019.htm#008).md).
There were three kinds of nets. (1.) The drag-net or hauling-net (Gr.
sagene ), of great size, and requiring many men to work it. It was
usually let down from the fishing-boat, and then drawn to the shore or
into the boat, as circumstances might require ([Mat
13:47](../kjv/mat013.htm#047), [Mat 13:48](../kjv/mat013.htm#048)). (2..md)
The hand-net or casting-net (Gr. amphiblestron ), which was thrown from
a rock or a boat at any fish that might be seen ([Mat
4:18](../kjv/mat004.htm#018); [Mar 1:16](../kjv/mar001.htm#016).md). It was
called by the Latins funda. It was of circular form, "like the top of a
tent." (3.) The bag-net (Gr. diktyon ), used for enclosing fish in deep
water ([Luk 5:4](../kjv/luk005.htm#004)). The fowling-nets were (1..md) the
trap, consisting of a net spread over a frame, and supported by a stick
in such a way that it fell with the slightest touch ([Amo
3:5](../kjv/amo003.htm#005), "gin;" [Psa 69:22](../kjv/psa069.htm#022.md);
[Job 18:9](../kjv/job018.htm#009); [Ecc 9:12](../kjv/ecc009.htm#012).md).
(2.) The snare, consisting of a cord to catch birds by the leg ([Job
18:10](../kjv/job018.htm#010); [Psa 18:5](../kjv/psa018.htm#005.md); [Psa
116:3](../kjv/psa116.htm#003); [Psa 140:5](../kjv/psa140.htm#005)). (3..md)
The decoy, a cage filled with birds as decoys ([Jer
5:26](../kjv/jer005.htm#026), [Jer 5:27](../kjv/jer005.htm#027).md).
Hunting-nets were much in use among the Hebrews.

<span id="003">**Nethaneel**</span> Given of God. (1.) The son of Zuar,
chief of the tribe of Issachar at the Exodus ([Num
1:8](../kjv/num001.htm#008); [Num 2:5](../kjv/num002.htm#005)). (2..md) One
of David's brothers ([Ch1 2:14](../kjv/ch1002.htm#014)). (3..md) A priest
who blew the trumpet before the ark when it was brought up to Jerusalem
([Ch1 15:24](../kjv/ch1015.htm#024)). (4..md) A Levite ([Ch1
24:6](../kjv/ch1024.htm#006)). (5..md) A temple porter, of the family of
the Korhites ([Ch1 26:4](../kjv/ch1026.htm#004)). (6..md) One of the
"princes" appointed by Jehoshaphat to teach the law through the cities
of Judah ([Ch2 17:7](../kjv/ch2017.htm#007)). (7..md) A chief Levite in the
time of Josiah ([Ch2 35:9](../kjv/ch2035.htm#009)). (8..md) [Ezr
10:22](../kjv/ezr010.htm#022). (9.) [Neh 12:21](../kjv/neh012.htm#021.md).
(10.) A priest's son who bore a trumpet at the dedication of the walls
of Jerusalem ([Neh 12:36](../kjv/neh012.htm#036).md).

<span id="004">**Nethaniah**</span> Given of Jehovah. (1.) One of
Asaph's sons, appointed by David to minister in the temple ([Ch1
25:2](../kjv/ch1025.htm#002), [Ch1 25:12](../kjv/ch1025.htm#012)). (2..md)
A Levite sent by Jehoshaphat to teach the law ([Ch2
17:8](../kjv/ch2017.htm#008)). (3.) [Jer 36:14](../kjv/jer036.htm#014.md).
(4.) [Kg2 25:23](../kjv/kg2025.htm#023.md), [Kg2
25:25](../kjv/kg2025.htm#025.md).

<span id="005">**Nethinim**</span> The name given to the hereditary
temple servants in all the post-Exilian books of Scripture. The word
means given, i.e., "those set apart", viz., to the menial work of the
sanctuary for the Levites. The name occurs seventeen times, and in each
case in the Authorized Version incorrectly terminates in s, "Nethinims;"
in the Revised Version, correctly without the s ([Ezr
2:70](../kjv/ezr002.htm#070); [Ezr 7:7](../kjv/ezr007.htm#007.md), [Ezr
7:24](../kjv/ezr007.htm#024); [Ezr 8:20](../kjv/ezr008.htm#020), etc..md).
The tradition is that the Gibeonites ([Jos 9:27](../kjv/jos009.htm#027).md)
were the original caste, afterwards called Nethinim. Their numbers were
added to afterwards from captives taken in battle; and they were
formally given by David to the Levites ([Ezr
8:20](../kjv/ezr008.htm#020).md), and so were called Nethinim, i.e., the
given ones, given to the Levites to be their servants. Only 612 Nethinim
returned from Babylon ([Ezr 2:58](../kjv/ezr002.htm#058.md); [Ezr
8:20](../kjv/ezr008.htm#020).md). They were under the control of a chief
from among themselves ([Ezr 2:43](../kjv/ezr002.htm#043.md); [Neh
7:46](../kjv/neh007.htm#046).md). No reference to them appears in the New
Testament, because it is probable that they became merged in the general
body of the Jewish people.

<span id="006">**Netophah**</span> Distillation; dropping, a town in
Judah, in the neighbourhood, probably, of Bethlehem ([Neh
7:26](../kjv/neh007.htm#026); [Ch1 2:54](../kjv/ch1002.htm#054).md). Two of
David's guards were Netophathites ([Ch1 27:13](../kjv/ch1027.htm#013.md),
[Ch1 27:15](../kjv/ch1027.htm#015).md). It has been identified with the
ruins of Metoba, or Um Toba, to the north-east of Bethlehem.

<span id="007">**Nettle**</span> (1.) Heb. haral , "pricking" or
"burning," [Pro 24:30](../kjv/pro024.htm#030.md), [Pro
24:31](../kjv/pro024.htm#031) (R.V. marg., "wild vetches".md); [Job
30:7](../kjv/job030.htm#007); [Zep 2:9](../kjv/zep002.htm#009.md). Many
have supposed that some thorny or prickly plant is intended by this
word, such as the bramble, the thistle, the wild plum, the cactus or
prickly pear, etc. It may probably be a species of mustard, the Sinapis
arvensis, which is a pernicious weed abounding in corn-fields. Tristram
thinks that this word "designates the prickly acanthus (Acanthus
spinosus), a very common and troublesome weed in the plains of
Palestine." (2.) Heb. qimmosh , [Isa 34:13](../kjv/isa034.htm#013.md); [Hos
9:6](../kjv/hos009.htm#006); [Pro 24:31](../kjv/pro024.htm#031.md) (in both
versions, "thorns"). This word has been regarded as denoting thorns,
thistles, wild camomile; but probably it is correctly rendered "nettle,"
the Urtica pilulifera, "a tall and vigorous plant, often 6 feet high,
the sting of which is much more severe and irritating than that of our
common nettle."

<span id="008">**New Moon, Feast of**</span> Special services were
appointed for the commencement of a month ([Num
28:11](../kjv/num028.htm#011); [Num 10:10](../kjv/num010.htm#010).md). (See
FESTIVALS.)

<span id="009">**New Testament**</span> [Luk
22:20](../kjv/luk022.htm#020).md), rather "New Covenant," in contrast to
the old covenant of works, which is superseded. "The covenant of grace
is called new; it succeeds to the old broken covenant of works. It is
ever fresh, flourishing, and excellent; and under the gospel it is
dispensed in a more clear, spiritual, extensive, and powerful manner
than of old" (Brown of Haddington). Hence is derived the name given to
the latter portion of the Bible. (See TESTAMENT.)
