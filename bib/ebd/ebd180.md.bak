<span id="000">**Hobab**</span> Beloved, the Kenite, has been usually
identified with Jethro (q.v.), [Exo 18:5](../kjv/exo018.htm#005.md), [Exo
18:27](../kjv/exo018.htm#027.md); compare [Num
10:29](../kjv/num010.htm#029), [Num 10:30](../kjv/num010.htm#030.md). In
[Jdg 4:11](../kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md), the word rendered "father-in-law"
means properly any male relative by marriage (compare [Gen
19:14](../kjv/gen019.htm#014), "son-in-law," A.V..md), and should be
rendered "brother-in-law," as in the R.V. His descendants followed
Israel to Canaan ([Num 10:29](../kjv/num010.htm#029).md), and at first
pitched their tents near Jericho, but afterwards settled in the south in
the borders of Arad ([Jdg 1:8](../kjv/jdg001.htm#008.md), [Jdg
1:16](../kjv/jdg001.htm#016).md).

<span id="001">**Hobah**</span> Hiding-place, a place to the north of
Damascus, to which Abraham pursued Chedorlaomer and his confederates
([Gen 14:15](../kjv/gen014.htm#015).md).

<span id="002">**Hodijah**</span> Majesty of Jehovah. (1.) One of the
Levites who assisted Ezra in expounding the law ([Neh
8:7](../kjv/neh008.htm#007); [Neh 9:5](../kjv/neh009.htm#005)). (2..md)
[Neh 10:18](../kjv/neh010.htm#018.md), a Levite who sealed the covenant.

<span id="003">**Hoglah**</span> Partridge, one of the daughters of
Zelophehad the Gileadite, to whom portions were assigned by Moses ([Num
26:33](../kjv/num026.htm#033); [Num 27:1](../kjv/num027.htm#001.md); [Num
36:11](../kjv/num036.htm#011).md).

<span id="004">**Hoham**</span> Jehovah impels, the king of Hebron who
joined the league against Gibeon. He and his allies were defeated ([Jos
10:3](../kjv/jos010.htm#003), [Jos 10:5](../kjv/jos010.htm#005.md), [Jos
10:16](../kjv/jos010.htm#016).md).

<span id="005">**Hold**</span> A fortress, the name given to David's
lurking-places ([Sa1 22:4](../kjv/sa1022.htm#004.md), [Sa1
22:5](../kjv/sa1022.htm#005); [Sa1 24:22](../kjv/sa1024.htm#022).md).

<span id="006">**Holiness**</span> In the highest sense belongs to God
([Isa 6:3](../kjv/isa006.htm#003); [Rev 15:4](../kjv/rev015.htm#004).md),
and to Christians as consecrated to God's service, and in so far as they
are conformed in all things to the will of God ([Rom
6:19](../kjv/rom006.htm#019), [Rom 6:22](../kjv/rom006.htm#022.md); [Eph
1:4](../kjv/eph001.htm#004); [Tit 1:8](../kjv/tit001.htm#008.md); [Pe1
1:15](../kjv/pe1001.htm#015).md). Personal holiness is a work of gradual
development. It is carried on under many hindrances, hence the frequent
admonitions to watchfulness, prayer, and perseverance ([Co1
1:30](../kjv/co1001.htm#030); [Co2 7:1](../kjv/co2007.htm#001.md); [Eph
4:23](../kjv/eph004.htm#023), [Eph 4:24](../kjv/eph004.htm#024).md). (See
SANCTIFICATION.)

<span id="007">**Holy Ghost**</span> The third Person of the adorable
Trinity. His personality is proved (1.) from the fact that the
attributes of personality, as intelligence and volition, are ascribed to
him ([Joh 14:17](../kjv/joh014.htm#017.md), [Joh
14:26](../kjv/joh014.htm#026); [Joh 15:26](../kjv/joh015.htm#026.md); [Co1
2:10](../kjv/co1002.htm#010), [Co1 2:11](../kjv/co1002.htm#011.md); [Co1
12:11](../kjv/co1012.htm#011).md). He reproves, helps, glorifies,
intercedes ([Joh 16:7](../kjv/joh016.htm#007.md); [Rom
8:26](../kjv/rom008.htm#026)). (2..md) He executes the offices peculiar
only to a person. The very nature of these offices involves personal
distinction ([Luk 12:12](../kjv/luk012.htm#012.md); [Act
5:32](../kjv/act005.htm#032); [Act 15:28](../kjv/act015.htm#028.md); [Act
16:6](../kjv/act016.htm#006); [Act 28:25](../kjv/act028.htm#025.md); [Co1
2:13](../kjv/co1002.htm#013); [Heb 2:4](../kjv/heb002.htm#004.md); [Heb
3:7](../kjv/heb003.htm#007); [Pe2 1:21](../kjv/pe2001.htm#021).md). His
divinity is established (1.) from the fact that the names of God are
ascribed to him ([Exo 17:7](../kjv/exo017.htm#007.md); [Psa
95:7](../kjv/psa095.htm#007); compare [Heb 3:7](../kjv/heb003.htm#007).md);
and (2.) that divine attributes are also ascribed to him, omnipresence
([Psa 139:7](../kjv/psa139.htm#007); [Eph 2:17](../kjv/eph002.htm#017.md),
[Eph 2:18](../kjv/eph002.htm#018); [Co1 12:13](../kjv/co1012.htm#013).md);
omniscience ([Co1 2:10](../kjv/co1002.htm#010.md), [Co1
2:11](../kjv/co1002.htm#011).md); omnipotence ([Luk
1:35](../kjv/luk001.htm#035); [Rom 8:11](../kjv/rom008.htm#011).md);
eternity ([Heb 9:4](../kjv/heb009.htm#004)). (3..md) Creation is ascribed
to him ([Gen 1:2](../kjv/gen001.htm#002.md); [Job
26:13](../kjv/job026.htm#013); [Psa 104:30](../kjv/psa104.htm#030).md), and
the working of miracles ([Mat 12:28](../kjv/mat012.htm#028.md); [Co1
12:9](../kjv/co1012.htm#009)). (4..md) Worship is required and ascribed to
him ([Isa 6:3](../kjv/isa006.htm#003.md); [Act
28:25](../kjv/act028.htm#025); [Rom 9:1](../kjv/rom009.htm#001.md); [Rev
1:4](../kjv/rev001.htm#004); [Mat 28:19](../kjv/mat028.htm#019).md).

<span id="008">**Holy Place**</span> One of the two portions into which
the tabernacle was divided ([Exo 26:31](../kjv/exo026.htm#031.md); [Exo
37:17](../kjv/exo037.htm#017); [Heb 9:2](../kjv/heb009.htm#002).md). It was
20 cubits long and 10 in height and breadth. It was illuminated by the
golden candlestick, as it had no opening to admit the light. It
contained the table of show-bread ([Exo 25:23](../kjv/exo025.htm#023).md)
and the golden altar of incense ([Exo 30:1](../kjv/exo030.htm#001).md). It
was divided from the holy of holies by a veil of the most costly
materials and the brightest colours. The arrangement of the temple
(q.v.) was the same in this respect. In it the walls of hewn stone were
wainscoted with cedar and overlaid with gold, and adorned with beautiful
carvings. It was entered from the porch by folding doors overlaid with
gold and richly embossed. Outside the holy place stood the great tank or
"sea" of molten brass, supported by twelve oxen, three turned each way,
capable of containing two thousand baths of water. Besides this there
were ten lavers and the brazen altar of burnt sacrifice.

<span id="009">**Holy of Holies**</span> The second or interior portion
of the tabernacle. It was left in total darkness. No one was permitted
to enter it except \[the high priest, and that only once a year. It
contained the ark of the covenant only ([Exo
25:10](../kjv/exo025.htm#010).md). It was in the form of a perfect cube of
20 cubits. (See TABERNACLE.)
