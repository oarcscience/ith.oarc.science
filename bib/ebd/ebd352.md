------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Straw**</span> Used in brick-making ([Exo
5:7](../kjv/exo005.htm#007).md). Used figuratively in [Job
41:27](../kjv/job041.htm#027); [Isa 11:7](../kjv/isa011.htm#007.md); [Isa
25:10](../kjv/isa025.htm#010); [Isa 65:25](../kjv/isa065.htm#025.md).

<span id="001">**Stealing**</span> See THEFT.

<span id="002">**Stoning**</span> A form of punishment ([Lev
20:2](../kjv/lev020.htm#002); [Lev 24:14](../kjv/lev024.htm#014.md); [Deu
13:10](../kjv/deu013.htm#010); [Deu 17:5](../kjv/deu017.htm#005.md); [Deu
22:21](../kjv/deu022.htm#021).md) prescribed for certain offenses. Of Achan
([Jos 7:25](../kjv/jos007.htm#025)), Naboth (1 Kings 21.md), Stephen ([Act
7:59](../kjv/act007.htm#059)), Paul ([Act 14:19](../kjv/act014.htm#019.md);
[Co2 11:25](../kjv/co2011.htm#025).md).

<span id="003">**Stream of Egypt**</span> ([Isa
27:12](../kjv/isa027.htm#012).md), the Wady el-'Arish , called also "the
river of Egypt," R.V., "brook of Egypt" ([Num
34:5](../kjv/num034.htm#005); [Jos 15:4](../kjv/jos015.htm#004.md); [Kg2
24:7](../kjv/kg2024.htm#007).md). It is the natural boundary of Egypt.
Occasionally in winter, when heavy rains have fallen among the mountains
inland, it becomes a turbulent rushing torrent. The present boundary
between Egypt and Palestine is about midway between el-'Arish and Gaza.

<span id="004">**Street**</span> The street called "Straight" at
Damascus ([Act 9:11](../kjv/act009.htm#011).md) is "a long broad street,
running from east to west, about a mile in length, and forming the
principal thoroughfare in the city." In Oriental towns streets are
usually narrow and irregular and filthy ([Psa
18:42](../kjv/psa018.htm#042); [Isa 10:6](../kjv/isa010.htm#006).md). "It
is remarkable," says Porter, "that all the important cities of Palestine
and Syria Samaria, Caesarea, Gerasa, Bozrah, Damascus, Palmyra, had
their 'straight streets' running through the centre of the city, and
lined with stately rows of columns. The most perfect now remaining are
those of Palmyra and Gerasa, where long ranges of the columns still
stand." Through Samaria, etc.

<span id="005">**Stripes**</span> As a punishment were not to exceed
forty ([Deu 25:1](../kjv/deu025.htm#001).md), and hence arose the custom of
limiting them to thirty-nine ([Co2 11:24](../kjv/co2011.htm#024).md). Paul
claimed the privilege of a Roman citizen in regard to the infliction of
stripes ([Act 16:37](../kjv/act016.htm#037.md), [Act
16:38](../kjv/act016.htm#038); [Act 22:25](../kjv/act022.htm#025).md). Our
Lord was beaten with stripes ([Mat 27:26](../kjv/mat027.htm#026).md).

<span id="006">**Subscriptions**</span> The subscriptions to Paul's
epistles are no part of the original. In their present form they are
ascribed to Euthalius, a bishop of the fifth century. Some of them are
obviously incorrect.

<span id="007">**Suburbs**</span> The immediate vicinity of a city or
town ([Num 35:3](../kjv/num035.htm#003.md), [Num
35:7](../kjv/num035.htm#007); [Eze 45:2](../kjv/eze045.htm#002).md). In
[Kg2 23:11](../kjv/kg2023.htm#011) the Hebrew word there used (parvarim.md)
occurs nowhere else. The Revised Version renders it "precincts." The
singular form of this Hebrew word (parvar) is supposed by some to be the
same as Parbar (q.v.), which occurs twice in [Ch1
26:18](../kjv/ch1026.htm#018.md).

<span id="008">**Succoth**</span> Booths. (1.) The first encampment of
the Israelites after leaving Ramesses ([Exo
12:37](../kjv/exo012.htm#037)); the civil name of Pithom (q.v.). (2..md) A
city on the east of Jordan, identified with Tell Dar'ala , a high mound,
a mass of debris, in the plain north of Jabbok and about one mile from
it ([Jos 13:27](../kjv/jos013.htm#027).md). Here Jacob ([Gen
32:17](../kjv/gen032.htm#017), [Gen 32:30](../kjv/gen032.htm#030.md); [Gen
33:17](../kjv/gen033.htm#017).md), on his return from Padan-aram after his
interview with Esau, built a house for himself and made booths for his
cattle. The princes of this city churlishly refused to afford help to
Gideon and his 300 men when "faint yet pursuing" they followed one of
the bands of the fugitive Midianites after the great victory at Gilboa.
After overtaking and routing this band at Karkor, Gideon on his return
visited the rulers of the city with severe punishment. "He took the
elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with
them he taught the men of Succoth" ([Jdg 8:13](../kjv/jdg008.htm#013).md).
At this place were erected the foundries for casting the metal-work for
the temple ([Kg1 7:46](../kjv/kg1007.htm#046).md).

<span id="009">**Succoth-benoth**</span> Tents of daughters, supposed to
be the name of a Babylonian deity, the goddess Zir-banit, the wife of
Merodach, worshipped by the colonists in Samaria ([Kg2
17:30](../kjv/kg2017.htm#030).md).
