<span id="000">**Emmanuel**</span> God with us, [Mat
1:23](../kjv/mat001.htm#023)). (See IMMANUEL..md)

<span id="001">**Emmaus**</span> Hot baths, a village "three-score
furlongs" from jerusalem, where our Lord had an interview with two of
his disciples on the day of his resurrection ([Luk
24:13](../kjv/luk024.htm#013).md). This has been identified with the modern
el-Kubeibeh, lying over 7 miles north-west of Jerusalem. This name,
el-Kubeibeh, meaning "little dome," is derived from the remains of the
Crusaders' church yet to be found there. Others have identified it with
the modern Khurbet Khamasa i.e., "the ruins of Khamasa", about 8 miles
south-west of Jerusalem, where there are ruins also of a Crusaders'
church. Its site, however has been much disputed.

<span id="002">**Emmor**</span> An ass, [Act
7:16](../kjv/act007.htm#016). (See HAMOR..md)

<span id="003">**Encamp**</span> An encampment was the resting-place for
a longer or shorter period of an army or company of travelers ([Exo
13:20](../kjv/exo013.htm#020); [Exo 14:19](../kjv/exo014.htm#019.md); [Jos
10:5](../kjv/jos010.htm#005); [Jos 11:5](../kjv/jos011.htm#005).md). The
manner in which the Israelites encamped during their march through the
wilderness is described in Num. 2 and 3. The order of the encampment
(see CAMP) was preserved in the march ([Num
2:17](../kjv/num002.htm#017).md), the signal for which was the blast of two
silver trumpets. Detailed regulations affecting the camp for sanitary
purposes are given ([Lev 4:11](../kjv/lev004.htm#011.md), [Lev
4:12](../kjv/lev004.htm#012); [Lev 6:11](../kjv/lev006.htm#011.md); [Lev
8:17](../kjv/lev008.htm#017); [Lev 10:4](../kjv/lev010.htm#004.md), [Lev
10:5](../kjv/lev010.htm#005); [Lev 13:46](../kjv/lev013.htm#046.md); [Lev
14:3](../kjv/lev014.htm#003); [Num 12:14](../kjv/num012.htm#014.md), [Num
12:15](../kjv/num012.htm#015); [Num 31:19](../kjv/num031.htm#019.md); [Deu
23:10](../kjv/deu023.htm#010), [Deu 23:12](../kjv/deu023.htm#012).md).
Criminals were executed without the camp ([Lev
4:12](../kjv/lev004.htm#012.md); compare [Joh
19:17](../kjv/joh019.htm#017), [Joh 19:20](../kjv/joh019.htm#020).md), and
there also the young bullock for a sin-offering was burnt ([Lev
24:14](../kjv/lev024.htm#014.md); compare [Heb
13:12](../kjv/heb013.htm#012).md). In the subsequent history of Israel
frequent mention is made of their encampments in the time of war ([Jdg
7:18](../kjv/jdg007.htm#018); [Sa1 13:2](../kjv/sa1013.htm#002.md), [Sa1
13:3](../kjv/sa1013.htm#003), [Sa1 13:16](../kjv/sa1013.htm#016.md), [Sa1
13:23](../kjv/sa1013.htm#023); [Sa1 17:3](../kjv/sa1017.htm#003.md); [Sa1
29:1](../kjv/sa1029.htm#001); [Sa1 30:9](../kjv/sa1030.htm#009.md), [Sa1
30:24](../kjv/sa1030.htm#024).md). The temple was sometimes called "the
camp of the Lord" ([Ch2 31:2](../kjv/ch2031.htm#002.md), R.V.; compare [Psa
78:28](../kjv/psa078.htm#028).md). The multitudes who flocked to David are
styled "a great host (i.e., "camp;" Heb. mahaneh ), like the host of
God" ([Ch1 12:22](../kjv/ch1012.htm#022).md).

<span id="004">**Enchantments**</span> (1.) The rendering of Hebrew
latim or lehatim, which means "something covered," "muffled up;" secret
arts, tricks ([Exo 7:11](../kjv/exo007.htm#011.md), [Exo
7:22](../kjv/exo007.htm#022); [Exo 8:7](../kjv/exo008.htm#007.md), [Exo
8:18](../kjv/exo008.htm#018).md), by which the Egyptian magicians imposed
on the credulity of Pharaoh. (2.) The rendering of the Hebrew keshaphim,
"muttered spells" or "incantations," rendered "sorceries" in [Isa
47:9](../kjv/isa047.htm#009), [Isa 47:12](../kjv/isa047.htm#012.md), i.e.,
the using of certain formulae under the belief that men could thus be
bound. (3.) Hebrew lehashim, "charming," as of serpents ([Jer
8:17](../kjv/jer008.htm#017.md); compare [Psa
58:5](../kjv/psa058.htm#005)). (4..md) Hebrew nehashim, the enchantments or
omens used by Balaam ([Num 24:1](../kjv/num024.htm#001).md); his
endeavouring to gain omens favourable to his design. (5.) Hebrew heber
([Isa 47:9](../kjv/isa047.htm#009), [Isa 47:12](../kjv/isa047.htm#012).md),
"magical spells." All kinds of enchantments were condemned by the Mosaic
law ([Lev 19:26](../kjv/lev019.htm#026.md); [Deu
18:10](../kjv/deu018.htm#010)). (See DIVINATION..md)

<span id="005">**End**</span> In [Heb 13:7](../kjv/heb013.htm#007.md), is
the rendering of the unusual Greek word ekbasin , meaning "outcome",
i.e., death. It occurs only elsewhere in [Co1
10:13](../kjv/co1010.htm#013.md), where it is rendered "escape."

<span id="006">**Endor**</span> Fountain of Dor; i.e., "of the age", a
place in the territory of Issachar ([Jos 17:11](../kjv/jos017.htm#011).md)
near the scene of the great victory which was gained by Deborah and
Barak over Sisera and Jabin (compare [Psa 83:9](../kjv/psa083.htm#009.md),
[Psa 83:10](../kjv/psa083.htm#010).md). To Endor, Saul resorted to consult
one reputed to be a witch on the eve of his last engagement with the
Philistines ([Sa1 28:7](../kjv/sa1028.htm#007).md). It is identified with
the modern village of Endur, "a dirty hamlet of some twenty houses, or
rather huts, most of them falling to ruin," on the northern slope of
Little Hermon, about 7 miles from Jezreel.

<span id="007">**En-eglaim**</span> Fountain of two calves, a place
mentioned only in [Eze 47:10](../kjv/eze047.htm#010.md). Somewhere near the
Dead Sea.

<span id="008">**En-gannim**</span> Fountain of gardens. (1.) A town in
the plains of Judah ([Jos 15:34](../kjv/jos015.htm#034).md), north-west of
Jerusalem, between Zanoah and Tappuah. It is the modern Umm Jina. (2.) A
city on the border of Machar ([Jos 19:21](../kjv/jos019.htm#021).md),
allotted to the Gershonite Levites ([Jos 21:29](../kjv/jos021.htm#029).md).
It is identified with the modern Jenin, a large and prosperous town of
about 4,000 inhabitants, situated 15 miles south of Mount Tabor, through
which the road from Jezreel to Samaria and Jerusalem passes. When
Ahaziah, king of Judah, attempted to escape from Jehu, he "fled by the
way of the garden house" i.e., by way of En-gannim. Here he was
overtaken by Jehu and wounded in his chariot, and turned aside and fled
to Megiddo, a distance of about 20 miles, to die there.

<span id="009">**Engedi**</span> Fountain of the kid, place in the
wilderness of Judah ([Jos 15:62](../kjv/jos015.htm#062).md), on the western
shore of the Dead Sea ([Eze 47:10](../kjv/eze047.htm#010).md), and nearly
equidistant from both extremities. To the wilderness near this town
David fled for fear of Saul ([Jos 15:62](../kjv/jos015.htm#062.md); [Sa1
23:29](../kjv/sa1023.htm#029).md). It was at first called Hazezon-tamar
([Gen 14:7](../kjv/gen014.htm#007).md), a city of the Amorites. The
vineyards of Engedi were celebrated in Solomon's time ([Sol
1:4](../kjv/sol001.htm#004).md). It is the modern 'Ain Jidy . The
"fountain" from which it derives its name rises on the mountain side
about 600 feet above the sea, and in its rapid descent spreads
luxuriance all around it. Along its banks the osher grows abundantly.
That shrub is thus described by Porter: "The stem is stout, measuring
sometimes nearly a foot in diameter, and the plant grows to the height
of 15 feet or more. It has a grayish bark and long oval leaves, which
when broken off discharge a milky fluid. The fruit resembles an apple,
and hangs in clusters of two or three. When ripe it is of a rich yellow
colour, but on being pressed it explodes like a puff-ball. It is chiefly
filled with air... This is the so-called 'apple of Sodom.'" Through
Samaria, etc. (See APPLE.)
