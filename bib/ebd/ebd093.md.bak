<span id="000">**Cross**</span> In the New Testament the instrument of
crucifixion, and hence used for the crucifixion of Christ itself ([Eph
2:16](../kjv/eph002.htm#016); [Heb 12:2](../kjv/heb012.htm#002.md); [Co1
1:17](../kjv/co1001.htm#017), [Co1 1:18](../kjv/co1001.htm#018.md); [Gal
5:11](../kjv/gal005.htm#011); [Gal 6:12](../kjv/gal006.htm#012.md), [Gal
6:14](../kjv/gal006.htm#014); [Phi 3:18](../kjv/phi003.htm#018).md). The
word is also used to denote any severe affliction or trial ([Mat
10:38](../kjv/mat010.htm#038); [Mat 16:24](../kjv/mat016.htm#024.md); [Mar
8:34](../kjv/mar008.htm#034); [Mar 10:21](../kjv/mar010.htm#021).md). The
forms in which the cross is represented are these: (1.) The crux simplex
(I), a "single piece without transom." (2.) The crux decussata (X), or
St. Andrew's cross. (3.) The crux commissa (T), or St. Anthony's cross.
(4.) The crux immissa ( or Latin cross, which was the kind of cross on
which our Saviour died. Above our Lord's head, on the projecting beam,
was placed the "title." (See CRUCIFIXION.) After the conversion,
so-called, of Constantine the Great (313 B.C.), the cross first came
into use as an emblem of Christianity. He pretended at a critical moment
that he saw a flaming cross in the heavens bearing the inscription, "In
hoc signo vinces", i.e., By this sign thou shalt conquer, and that on
the following night Christ himself appeared and ordered him to take for
his standard the sign of this cross. In this form a new standard, called
the Labarum, was accordingly made, and borne by the Roman armies. It
remained the standard of the Roman army till the downfall of the Western
empire. It bore the embroidered monogram of Christ, i.e., the first two
Greek letters of his name, X and P ( chi and rho ), with the Alpha and
Omega . (See ALPHA.)

<span id="001">**Crown**</span> (1.) Denotes the plate of gold in the
front of the high priest's mitre ([Exo 29:6](../kjv/exo029.htm#006.md);
[Exo 39:30](../kjv/exo039.htm#030).md). The same Hebrew word so rendered (
ne'zer ) denotes the diadem worn by Saul in battle ([Sa2
1:10](../kjv/sa2001.htm#010).md), and also that which was used at the
coronation of Joash ([Kg2 11:12](../kjv/kg2011.htm#012)). (2..md) The more
general name in Hebrew for a crown is 'atarah , meaning a "circlet."
This is used of crowns and head ornaments of divers kinds, including
royal crowns. Such was the crown taken from the king of Ammon by David
([Sa2 12:30](../kjv/sa2012.htm#030).md). The crown worn by the Assyrian
kings was a high mitre, sometimes adorned with flowers. There are
sculptures also representing the crowns worn by the early Egyptian and
Persian kings. Sometimes a diadem surrounded the royal head-dress of two
or three fillets. This probably signified that the wearer had dominion
over two or three countries. In [Rev 12:3](../kjv/rev012.htm#003.md); [Rev
13:1](../kjv/rev013.htm#001.md), we read of "many crowns," a token of
extended dominion. (3.) The ancient Persian crown ([Est
1:11](../kjv/est001.htm#011); [Est 2:17](../kjv/est002.htm#017.md); [Est
6:8](../kjv/est006.htm#008).md) was called kether; i.e., "a chaplet," a
high cap or tiara. Crowns were worn sometimes to represent honour and
power ([Eze 23:42](../kjv/eze023.htm#042).md). They were worn at marriages
([Sol 3:11](../kjv/sol003.htm#011); [Isa 61:10](../kjv/isa061.htm#010.md),
"ornaments;" R.V., "a garland"), and at feasts and public festivals. The
crown was among the Romans and Greeks a symbol of victory and reward.
The crown or wreath worn by the victors in the Olympic games was made of
leaves of the wild olive; in the Pythian games, of laurel; in the Nemean
games, of parsley; and in the Isthmian games, of the pine. The Romans
bestowed the "civic crown" on him who saved the life of a citizen. It
was made of the leaves of the oak. In opposition to all these fading
crowns the apostles speak of the incorruptible crown, the crown of life
([Jam 1:12](../kjv/jam001.htm#012); [Rev 2:10](../kjv/rev002.htm#010).md)
"that fadeth not away" ([Pe1 5:4](../kjv/pe1005.htm#004.md), Gr.
amarantinos ; compare [Pe1 1:4](../kjv/pe1001.htm#004).md). Probably the
word "amaranth" was applied to flowers we call "everlasting," the
"immortal amaranth."

<span id="002">**Crown of Thorns**</span> Our Lord was crowned with a,
in mockery by the Romans ([Mat 27:29](../kjv/mat027.htm#029).md). The
object of Pilate's guard in doing this was probably to insult, and not
specially to inflict pain. There is nothing to show that the shrub thus
used was, as has been supposed, the spina Christi, which could have been
easily woven into a wreath. It was probably the thorny nabk, which grew
abundantly round about Jerusalem, and whose flexible, pliant, and round
branches could easily be platted into the form of a crown. (See THORN,
3.)

<span id="003">**Crucifixion**</span> A common mode of punishment among
heathen nations in early times. It is not certain whether it was known
among the ancient Jews; probably it was not. The modes of capital
punishment according to the Mosaic law were, by the sword (Ex. 21),
strangling, fire (Lev. 20), and stoning (Deut. 21). This was regarded as
the most horrible form of death, and to a Jew it would acquire greater
horror from the curse in [Deu 21:23](../kjv/deu021.htm#023.md). This
punishment began by subjecting the sufferer to scourging. In the case of
our Lord, however, his scourging was rather before the sentence was
passed upon him, and was inflicted by Pilate for the purpose, probably,
of exciting pity and procuring his escape from further punishment ([Luk
23:22](../kjv/luk023.htm#022); [Joh 19:1](../kjv/joh019.htm#001).md). The
condemned one carried his own cross to the place of execution, which was
outside the city, in some conspicuous place set apart for the purpose.
Before the nailing to the cross took place, a medicated cup of vinegar
mixed with gall and myrrh (the sopor) was given, for the purpose of
deadening the pangs of the sufferer. Our Lord refused this cup, that his
senses might be clear ([Mat 27:34](../kjv/mat027.htm#034).md). The
spongeful of vinegar, sour wine, posca, the common drink of the Roman
soldiers, which was put on a hyssop stalk and offered to our Lord in
contemptuous pity ([Mat 27:48](../kjv/mat027.htm#048.md); [Luk
23:36](../kjv/luk023.htm#036).md), he tasted to allay the agonies of his
thirst ([Joh 19:29](../kjv/joh019.htm#029).md). The accounts given of the
crucifixion of our Lord are in entire agreement with the customs and
practices of the Roman in such cases. He was crucified between two
"malefactors" ([Isa 53:12](../kjv/isa053.htm#012.md); [Luk
23:32](../kjv/luk023.htm#032).md), and was watched by a party of four
soldiers ([Joh 19:23](../kjv/joh019.htm#023.md); [Mat
27:36](../kjv/mat027.htm#036), [Mat 27:54](../kjv/mat027.htm#054).md), with
their centurion. The "breaking of the legs" of the malefactors was
intended to hasten death, and put them out of misery ([Joh
19:31](../kjv/joh019.htm#031).md); but the unusual rapidity of our Lord's
death ([Joh 19:33](../kjv/joh019.htm#033).md) was due to his previous
sufferings and his great mental anguish. The omission of the breaking of
his legs was the fulfillment of a type ([Exo
12:46](../kjv/exo012.htm#046).md). He literally died of a broken heart, a
ruptured heart, and hence the flowing of blood and water from the wound
made by the soldier's spear ([Joh 19:34](../kjv/joh019.htm#034).md). Our
Lord uttered seven memorable words from the cross, namely, (1.) [Luk
23:34](../kjv/luk023.htm#034); (2.) [Luk 23:43](../kjv/luk023.htm#043.md);
(3.) [Joh 19:26](../kjv/joh019.htm#026); (4..md) [Mat
27:46](../kjv/mat027.htm#046), [Mar 15:34](../kjv/mar015.htm#034); (5..md)
[Joh 19:28](../kjv/joh019.htm#028); (6..md) [Joh
19:30](../kjv/joh019.htm#030); (7.) [Luk 23:46](../kjv/luk023.htm#046.md).

<span id="004">**Cruse**</span> A utensil; a flask or cup for holding
water ([Sa1 26:11](../kjv/sa1026.htm#011.md), [Sa1
26:12](../kjv/sa1026.htm#012), [Sa1 26:16](../kjv/sa1026.htm#016.md); [Kg1
19:6](../kjv/kg1019.htm#006).md) or oil ([Kg1
17:12](../kjv/kg1017.htm#012), [Kg1 17:14](../kjv/kg1017.htm#014.md), [Kg1
17:16](../kjv/kg1017.htm#016)). In [Kg1 14:3](../kjv/kg1014.htm#003.md) the
word there so rendered means properly a bottle, as in [Jer
19:1](../kjv/jer019.htm#001), [Jer 19:10](../kjv/jer019.htm#010.md), or
pitcher. In [Kg2 2:20](../kjv/kg2002.htm#020.md), a platter or flat metal
saucer is intended. The Hebrew word here used is translated "dish" in
[Kg2 21:13](../kjv/kg2021.htm#013.md); "pans," in [Ch2
35:13](../kjv/ch2035.htm#013.md); and "bosom," in [Pro
19:24](../kjv/pro019.htm#024); [Pro 26:15](../kjv/pro026.htm#015.md) (R.V.,
"dish")

<span id="005">**Crystal**</span> ([Eze 1:22](../kjv/eze001.htm#022.md),
with the epithet "terrible," as dazzling the spectators with its
brightness). The word occurs in [Rev 4:6](../kjv/rev004.htm#006.md); [Rev
21:11](../kjv/rev021.htm#011); [Rev 22:1](../kjv/rev022.htm#001.md). It is
a stone of the flint order, the most refined kind of quartz. The Greek
word here used means also literally "ice." The ancients regarded the
crystal as only pure water congealed into extreme hardness by great
length of time.

<span id="006">**Cubit**</span> Heb. 'ammah ; i.e., "mother of the arm,"
the fore-arm, is a word derived from the Latin cubitus , the lower arm.
It is difficult to determine the exact length of this measure, from the
uncertainty whether it included the entire length from the elbow to the
tip of the longest finger, or only from the elbow to the root of the
hand at the wrist. The probability is that the longer was the original
cubit. The common computation as to the length of the cubit makes it
20.24 inches for the ordinary cubit, and 21.888 inches for the sacred
one. This is the same as the Egyptian measurements. A rod or staff the
measure of a cubit is called in [Jdg 3:16](../kjv/jdg003.htm#016.md) gomed,
which literally means a "cut," something "cut off." The LXX. and Vulgate
render it "span."

<span id="007">**Cuckoo**</span> (Heb. shahaph ), from a root meaning
"to be lean; slender." This bird is mentioned only in [Lev
11:16](../kjv/lev011.htm#016) and [Deu 14:15](../kjv/deu014.htm#015.md)
(R.V., "seamew"). Some have interpreted the Hebrew word by "petrel" or
"shearwater" (Puffinus cinereus), which is found on the coast of Syria;
others think it denotes the "sea-gull" or "seamew." The common cuckoo
(Cuculus canorus) feeds on reptiles and large insects. It is found in
Asia and Africa as well as in Europe. It only passes the winter in
Palestine. The Arabs suppose it to utter the cry Yakub, and hence they
call it tir el-Yakub; i.e., "Jacob's bird."

<span id="008">**Cucumbers**</span> (Heb. plur. kishshuim ; i.e.,
"hard," "difficult" of digestion, only in [Num
11:5](../kjv/num011.htm#005).md). This vegetable is extensively cultivated
in the East at the present day, as it appears to have been in earlier
times among the Hebrews. It belongs to the gourd family of plants. In
the East its cooling pulp and juice are most refreshing. "We need not
altogether wonder that the Israelites, wearily marching through the arid
solitudes of the Sinaitic peninsula, thought more of the cucumbers and
watermelons of which they had had no lack in Egypt, rather than of the
cruel bondage which was the price of these luxuries." Groser's Scripture
Natural History. Isaiah speaks of a "lodge" ([Isa
1:8](../kjv/isa001.htm#008); Heb. sukkah .md), i.e., a shed or edifice more
solid than a booth, for the protection throughout the season from spring
to autumn of the watchers in a "garden of cucumbers."

<span id="009">**Cummin**</span> (Heb. kammon ; i.e., a "condiment"),
the fruit or seed of an umbelliferous plant, the Cuminum sativum, still
extensively cultivated in the East. Its fruit is mentioned in [Isa
28:25](../kjv/isa028.htm#025), [Isa 28:27](../kjv/isa028.htm#027.md). In
the New Testament it is mentioned in [Mat 23:23](../kjv/mat023.htm#023.md),
where our Lord pronounces a "woe" on the scribes and Pharisees, who were
zealous in paying tithes of "mint and anise and cummin," while they
omitted the weightier matters of the law." "It is used as a spice, both
bruised, to mix with bread, and also boiled, in the various messes and
stews which compose an Oriental banquet." Tristram, Natural History.
