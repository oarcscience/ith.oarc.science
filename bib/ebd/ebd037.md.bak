<span id="000">**Avenger of Blood**</span> (Heb. goel , from verb gaal ,
"to be near of kin," "to redeem"), the nearest relative of a murdered
person. It was his right and duty to slay the murderer ([Sa2
14:7](../kjv/sa2014.htm#007), [Sa2 14:11](../kjv/sa2014.htm#011).md) if he
found him outside of a city of refuge. In order that this law might be
guarded against abuse, Moses appointed six cities of refuge ([Exo
21:13](../kjv/exo021.htm#013); [Num 35:13](../kjv/num035.htm#013.md); [Deu
19:1](../kjv/deu019.htm#001), [Deu 19:9](../kjv/deu019.htm#009).md). These
were in different parts of the country, and every facility was afforded
the manslayer that he might flee to the city that lay nearest him for
safety. Into the city of refuge the avenger did not dare to follow him.
This arrangement applied only to cases where the death was not
premeditated. The case had to be investigated by the authorities of the
city, and the willful murderer was on no account to be spared. He was
regarded as an impure and polluted person, and was delivered up to the
goel ([Deu 19:11](../kjv/deu019.htm#011).md). If the offense was merely
manslaughter, then the fugitive must remain within the city till the
death of the high priest ([Num 35:25](../kjv/num035.htm#025).md).

<span id="001">**Avim**</span> A people dwelling in Hazerim, or "the
villages" or "encampments" on the south-west corner of the sea-coast
([Deu 2:23](../kjv/deu002.htm#023).md). They were subdued and driven
northward by the Caphtorim. A trace of them is afterwards found in [Jos
13:3](../kjv/jos013.htm#003.md), where they are called Avites.

<span id="002">**Awl**</span> An instrument only referred to in
connection with the custom of boring the ear of a slave ([Exo
21:6](../kjv/exo021.htm#006); [Deu 15:17](../kjv/deu015.htm#017).md), in
token of his volunteering perpetual service when he might be free.
(Compare [Psa 40:6](../kjv/psa040.htm#006.md); [Isa
50:5](../kjv/isa050.htm#005).md).

<span id="003">**Axe**</span> Used in the Authorized Version of [Deu
19:5](../kjv/deu019.htm#005); [Deu 20:19](../kjv/deu020.htm#019.md); [Kg1
6:7](../kjv/kg1006.htm#007.md), as the translation of a Hebrew word which
means "chopping." It was used for felling trees ([Isa
10:34](../kjv/isa010.htm#034).md) and hewing timber for building. It is the
rendering of a different word in [Jdg 9:48](../kjv/jdg009.htm#048.md), [Sa1
13:20](../kjv/sa1013.htm#020), [Sa1 13:21](../kjv/sa1013.htm#021.md), [Psa
74:5](../kjv/psa074.htm#005.md), which refers to its sharpness. In [Kg2
6:5](../kjv/kg2006.htm#005.md) it is the translation of a word used with
reference to its being made of iron. In [Isa
44:12](../kjv/isa044.htm#012.md) the Revised Version renders by "axe" the
Hebrew maatsad, which means a "hewing" instrument. In the Authorized
Version it is rendered "tongs." It is also used in [Jer
10:3](../kjv/jer010.htm#003.md), and rendered "axe." The "battle-axe" (army
of Medes and Persians) mentioned in [Jer 51:20](../kjv/jer051.htm#020.md)
was probably, as noted in the margin of the Revised Version, a "maul" or
heavy mace. In [Psa 74:6](../kjv/psa074.htm#006.md) the word so rendered
means "feller." (See the figurative expression in [Mat
3:10](../kjv/mat003.htm#010); [Luk 3:9](../kjv/luk003.htm#009)..md)

<span id="004">**Azal**</span> ([Zac 14:5](../kjv/zac014.htm#005).md)
should perhaps be rendered "very near" = "the way of escape shall be
made easy." If a proper name, it may denote some place near the western
extremity of the valley here spoken of near Jerusalem.

<span id="005">**Azariah**</span> Whom Jehovah helps. (1.) Son of Ethan,
of the tribe of Judah ([Ch1 2:8](../kjv/ch1002.htm#008)). (2..md)Son of
Ahimaaz, who succeeded his grandfather Zadok as high priest ([Ch1
6:9](../kjv/ch1006.htm#009); [Kg1 4:2](../kjv/kg1004.htm#002).md) in the
days of Solomon. He officiated at the consecration of the temple ([Ch1
6:10](../kjv/ch1006.htm#010)). (3..md)The son of Johanan, high priest in
the reign of Abijah and Asa ([Ch2 6:10](../kjv/ch2006.htm#010.md), [Ch2
6:11](../kjv/ch2006.htm#011)). (4..md)High priest in the reign of Uzziah,
king of Judah ([Kg2 14:21](../kjv/kg2014.htm#021.md); [Ch2
26:17](../kjv/ch2026.htm#017).md). He was contemporary with the prophets
Isaiah, Amos, and Joel. (5.)High priest in the days of Hezekiah ([Ch2
31:10](../kjv/ch2031.htm#010)). Of the house of Zadok. (6..md)Several other
priests and Levites of this name are mentioned ([Ch1
6:36](../kjv/ch1006.htm#036); [Ezr 7:1](../kjv/ezr007.htm#001.md); [Ch1
9:11](../kjv/ch1009.htm#011); [Neh 3:23](../kjv/neh003.htm#023), etc..md).
(7.)The original name of Abed-nego ([Dan 1:6](../kjv/dan001.htm#006.md),
[Dan 1:7](../kjv/dan001.htm#007), [Dan 1:11](../kjv/dan001.htm#011.md),
[Dan 1:16](../kjv/dan001.htm#016).md). He was of the royal family of Judah,
and with his other two companions remarkable for his personal beauty and
his intelligence as well as piety. (8.)The son of Oded, a remarkable
prophet in the days of Asa ([Ch2 15:1](../kjv/ch2015.htm#001).md). He
stirred up the king and the people to a great national reformation.

<span id="006">**Azazel**</span> ([Lev 16:8](../kjv/lev016.htm#008.md),
[Lev 16:10](../kjv/lev016.htm#010), [Lev 16:26](../kjv/lev016.htm#026.md),
Revised Version only here; rendered "scape-goat" in the Authorized
Version). This word has given rise to many different views. Some Jewish
interpreters regard it as the name of a place some 12 miles east of
Jerusalem, in the wilderness. Others take it to be the name of an evil
spirit, or even of Satan. But when we remember that the two goats
together form a type of Christ, on whom the Lord "laid the iniquity of
us all," and examine into the root meaning of this word (viz.,
"separation"), the interpretation of those who regard the one goat as
representing the atonement made, and the other, that "for Azazel," as
representing the effect of the great work of atonement (viz., the
complete removal of sin), is certainly to be preferred. The one goat
which was "for Jehovah" was offered as a sin-offering, by which
atonement was made. But the sins must also be visibly banished, and
therefore they were symbolically laid by confession on the other goat,
which was then "sent away for Azazel" into the wilderness. The form of
this word indicates intensity, and therefore signifies the total
separation of sin: it was wholly carried away. It was important that the
result of the sacrifices offered by the high priest alone in the
sanctuary should be embodied in a visible transaction, and hence the
dismissal of the "scape-goat." It was of no consequence what became of
it, as the whole import of the transaction lay in its being sent into
the wilderness bearing away sin. As the goat "for Jehovah" was to
witness to the demerit of sin and the need of the blood of atonement, so
the goat "for Azazel" was to witness to the efficacy of the sacrifice
and the result of the shedding of blood in the taking away of sin.

<span id="007">**Azaziah**</span> Whom Jehovah strengthened. (1.) One of
the Levitical harpers in the temple ([Ch1
15:21](../kjv/ch1015.htm#021)). (2..md) The father of Hoshea, who was made
ruler over the Ephraimites ([Ch1 27:20](../kjv/ch1027.htm#020)). (3..md)
One who had charge of the temple offerings ([Ch2
31:13](../kjv/ch2031.htm#013).md).

<span id="008">**Azekah**</span> Dug over, a town in the Shephelah or
low hills of Judah ([Jos 15:35](../kjv/jos015.htm#035).md), where the five
confederated Amoritish kings were defeated by Joshua and their army
destroyed by a hailstorm ([Jos 10:10](../kjv/jos010.htm#010.md), [Jos
10:11](../kjv/jos010.htm#011).md). It was one of the places re-occupied by
the Jews on their return from the Captivity ([Neh
11:30](../kjv/neh011.htm#030).md)

<span id="009">**Azel**</span> Noble, a descendant of king Saul ([Ch1
8:37](../kjv/ch1008.htm#037); [Ch1 9:43](../kjv/ch1009.htm#043.md), [Ch1
9:44](../kjv/ch1009.htm#044).md).
