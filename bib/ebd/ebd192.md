<span id="000">**Ivory**</span> (Heb. pl. shenhabbim , the "tusks of
elephants") was early used in decorations by the Egyptians, and a great
trade in it was carried on by the Assyrians ([Eze
27:6](../kjv/eze027.htm#006); [Rev 18:12](../kjv/rev018.htm#012)). It
was used by the Phoenicians to ornament the box-wood rowing-benches of
their galleys, and Hiram's skilled workmen made Solomon's throne of
ivory ([Kg1 10:18](../kjv/kg1010.htm#018)). It was brought by the
caravans of Dedan ([Isa 21:13](../kjv/isa021.htm#013)), and from the
East Indies by the navy of Tarshish ([Kg1
10:22](../kjv/kg1010.htm#022)). Many specimens of ancient Egyptian and
Assyrian ivory-work have been preserved. The word habbim is derived from
the Sanscrit ibhas, meaning "elephant," preceded by the Hebrew article
(ha); and hence it is argued that Ophir, from which it and the other
articles mentioned in [Kg1 10:22](../kjv/kg1010.htm#022) were brought,
was in India.
