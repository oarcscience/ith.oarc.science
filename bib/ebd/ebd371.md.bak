------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Tortoise**</span> (Heb. tsabh ). Ranked among the
unclean animals ([Lev 11:29](../kjv/lev011.htm#029).md). Land tortoises are
common in Syria. The LXX. renders the word by "land crocodile." The
word, however, more probably denotes a lizard, called by the modern
Arabs dhabb .

<span id="001">**Tow**</span> ([Jdg 16:9](../kjv/jdg016.htm#009).md). See
FLAX.

<span id="002">**Towers**</span> Of Babel ([Gen
11:4](../kjv/gen011.htm#004).md), Edar ([Gen
35:21](../kjv/gen035.htm#021).md), Penuel ([Jdg
8:9](../kjv/jdg008.htm#009), [Jdg 8:17](../kjv/jdg008.htm#017).md), Shechem
([Jdg 9:46](../kjv/jdg009.htm#046).md), David ([Sol
4:4](../kjv/sol004.htm#004).md), Lebanon ([Sol
7:4](../kjv/sol007.htm#004).md), Syene ([Eze
29:10](../kjv/eze029.htm#010).md), Hananeel ([Zac
14:10](../kjv/zac014.htm#010).md), Siloam ([Luk
13:4](../kjv/luk013.htm#004).md). There were several towers in Jerusalem
([Ch2 26:9](../kjv/ch2026.htm#009); [Psa 48:12](../kjv/psa048.htm#012).md).
They were erected for various purposes, as watch-towers in vineyard
([Isa 5:2](../kjv/isa005.htm#002); [Mat 21:33](../kjv/mat021.htm#033).md)
and towers for defense.

<span id="003">**Tower of the Furnaces**</span> ([Neh
3:11](../kjv/neh003.htm#011); [Neh 12:38](../kjv/neh012.htm#038).md), a
tower at the north-western angle of the second wall of Jerusalem. It was
probably so named from its contiguity to the "bakers' street" ([Jer
37:21](../kjv/jer037.htm#021).md).

<span id="004">**Trachonitis**</span> A rugged region, corresponds to
the Heb. Argob (q.v.), the Greek name of a region on the east of Jordan
([Luk 3:1](../kjv/luk003.htm#001).md); one of the five Roman provinces into
which that district was divided. It was in the tetrarchy of Philip, and
is now called the Lejah.

<span id="005">**Tradition**</span> Any kind of teaching, written or
spoken, handed down from generation to generation. In [Mar
7:3](../kjv/mar007.htm#003), [Mar 7:9](../kjv/mar007.htm#009.md), [Mar
7:13](../kjv/mar007.htm#013), [Col 2:8](../kjv/col002.htm#008.md), this
word refers to the arbitrary interpretations of the Jews. In [Th2
2:15](../kjv/th2002.htm#015); [Th2 3:6](../kjv/th2003.htm#006.md), it is
used in a good sense. Peter ([Pe1 1:18](../kjv/pe1001.htm#018).md) uses
this word with reference to the degenerate Judaism of the "strangers
scattered" whom he addresses (compare [Act
15:10](../kjv/act015.htm#010); [Mat 15:2](../kjv/mat015.htm#002.md); [Gal
1:14](../kjv/gal001.htm#014).md).

<span id="006">**Trance**</span> (Gr. ekstasis , from which the word
"ecstasy" is derived) denotes the state of one who is "out of himself."
Such were the trances of Peter and Paul, [Act
10:10](../kjv/act010.htm#010); [Act 11:5](../kjv/act011.htm#005.md); [Act
22:17](../kjv/act022.htm#017.md), ecstasies, "a preternatural, absorbed
state of mind preparing for the reception of the vision", compare [Co2
12:1](../kjv/co2012.htm#001)). In [Mar 5:42](../kjv/mar005.htm#042.md) and
[Luk 5:26](../kjv/luk005.htm#026.md) the Greek word is rendered
"astonishment," "amazement" (compare [Mar 16:8](../kjv/mar016.htm#008.md);
[Act 3:10](../kjv/act003.htm#010).md).

<span id="007">**Transfiguration, The**</span> Of our Lord on a "high
mountain apart," is described by each of the three evangelists ([Mat
17:1](../kjv/mat017.htm#001); [Mar 9:2](../kjv/mar009.htm#002.md); [Luk
9:28](../kjv/luk009.htm#028).md). The fullest account is given by Luke,
who, no doubt, was informed by Peter, who was present on the occasion.
What these evangelists record was an absolute historical reality, and
not a mere vision. The concurrence between them in all the circumstances
of the incident is exact. John seems to allude to it also ([Joh
1:14](../kjv/joh001.htm#014).md). Forty years after the event Peter
distinctly makes mention of it ([Pe2 1:16](../kjv/pe2001.htm#016).md). In
describing the sanctification of believers, Paul also seems to allude to
this majestic and glorious appearance of our Lord on the "holy mount"
([Rom 12:2](../kjv/rom012.htm#002); [Co2 3:18](../kjv/co2003.htm#018).md).
The place of the transfiguration was probably Mount Hermon (q.v.), and
not Mount Tabor, as is commonly supposed.

<span id="008">**Treasure Cities**</span> Store cities which the
Israelites built for the Egyptians ([Exo 1:11](../kjv/exo001.htm#011).md).
(See PITHOM.) Towns in which the treasures of the kings of Judah were
kept were so designated ([Ch1 27:25](../kjv/ch1027.htm#025).md).

<span id="009">**Treasure Houses**</span> The houses or magazines built
for the safe keeping of treasure and valuable articles of any kind ([Ezr
5:17](../kjv/ezr005.htm#017); [Ezr 7:20](../kjv/ezr007.htm#020.md); [Neh
10:38](../kjv/neh010.htm#038); [Dan 1:2](../kjv/dan001.htm#002).md).
