<span id="000">**Antichrist**</span> Against Christ, or an opposition
Christ, a rival Christ. The word is used only by the apostle John.
Referring to false teachers, he says ([Jo1 2:18](../kjv/jo1002.htm#018.md),
[Jo1 2:22](../kjv/jo1002.htm#022); [Jo1 4:3](../kjv/jo1004.htm#003.md);
[Jo2 1:7](../kjv/jo2001.htm#007).md), "Even now are there many
antichrists." (1.) This name has been applied to the "little horn" of
the "king of fierce countenance" ([Dan 7:24](../kjv/dan007.htm#024.md),
[Dan 7:25](../kjv/dan007.htm#025); [Dan 8:23](../kjv/dan008.htm#023).md).
(2.) It has been applied also to the "false Christs" spoken of by our
Lord ([Mat 24:5](../kjv/mat024.htm#005.md), [Mat
24:23](../kjv/mat024.htm#023), [Mat 24:24](../kjv/mat024.htm#024)). (3..md)
To the "man of sin" described by Paul ([Th2 2:3](../kjv/th2002.htm#003.md),
[Th2 2:4](../kjv/th2002.htm#004), [Th2 2:8](../kjv/th2002.htm#008).md).
(4.) And to the "beast from the sea" ([Rev 13:1](../kjv/rev013.htm#001.md);
17:1-18).

<span id="001">**Antioch**</span> (1.) In Syria, on the river Orontes,
about 16 miles from the Mediterranean, and some 300 miles north of
Jerusalem. It was the metropolis of Syria, and afterwards became the
capital of the Roman province in Asia. It ranked third, after Rome and
Alexandria, in point of importance, of the cities of the Roman empire.
It was called the "first city of the East." Christianity was early
introduced into it ([Act 11:19](../kjv/act011.htm#019.md), [Act
11:21](../kjv/act011.htm#021), [Act 11:24](../kjv/act011.htm#024).md), and
the name "Christian" was first applied here to its professors ([Act
11:26](../kjv/act011.htm#026).md). It is intimately connected with the
early history of the gospel ([Act 6:5](../kjv/act006.htm#005.md); [Act
11:19](../kjv/act011.htm#019), [Act 11:27](../kjv/act011.htm#027.md), [Act
11:28](../kjv/act011.htm#028), [Act 11:30](../kjv/act011.htm#030.md); [Act
12:25](../kjv/act012.htm#025); [Act 15:22](../kjv/act015.htm#022.md); [Gal
2:11](../kjv/gal002.htm#011), [Gal 2:12](../kjv/gal002.htm#012).md). It was
the great central point whence missionaries to the Gentiles were sent
forth. It was the birth-place of the famous Christian father Chrysostom,
who died A.D. 407. It bears the modern name of Antakia, and is now a
miserable, decaying Turkish town. Like Philippi, it was raised to the
rank of a Roman colony. Such colonies were ruled by "praetors" (R.V.
marg., [Act 16:20](../kjv/act016.htm#020.md), [Act
16:21](../kjv/act016.htm#021)). (2..md) In the extreme north of Pisidia;
was visited by Paul and Barnabas on the first missionary journey ([Act
13:14](../kjv/act013.htm#014).md). Here they found a synagogue and many
proselytes. They met with great success in preaching the gospel, but the
Jews stirred up a violent opposition against them, and they were obliged
to leave the place. On his return, Paul again visited Antioch for the
purpose of confirming the disciples ([Act
14:21](../kjv/act014.htm#021).md). It has been identified with the modern
Yalobatch, lying to the east of Ephesus. See map, Showing Position of
Syrian Antioch

<span id="002">**Antiochus**</span> The name of several Syrian kings
from 280 to 65 B.C.. The most notable of these were (1.) Antiochus the
Great, who ascended the throne 223 B.C.. He is regarded as the "king of
the north" referred to in [Dan 11:13](../kjv/dan011.htm#013.md). He was
succeeded (187 B.C.) by his son, Seleucus Philopater, spoken of by
Daniel ([Dan 11:20](../kjv/dan011.htm#020).md) as "a raiser of taxes", in
the Revised Version, "one that shall cause an exactor to pass through
the glory of the kingdom." (2.) Antiochus IV., surnamed "Epiphanes"
i.e., the Illustrious, succeeded his brother Seleucus (175 B.C.). His
career and character are prophetically described by Daniel ([Dan
11:21](../kjv/dan011.htm#021).md). He was a "vile person." In a spirit of
revenge he organized an expedition against Jerusalem, which he
destroyed, putting vast multitudes of its inhabitants to death in the
most cruel manner. From this time the Jews began the great war of
independence under their heroic Maccabean leaders with marked success,
defeating the armies of Antiochus that were sent against them. Enraged
at this, Antiochus marched against them in person, threatening utterly
to exterminate the nation; but on the way he was suddenly arrested by
the hand of death (164 B.C.).

<span id="003">**Antipas**</span> (1.)Herod Antipas, a son of Herod the
Great by his Samaritan wife Malthace. He was tetrarch of Galilee and
Peraea during the whole period of our Lord's life on earth ([Luk
23:7](../kjv/luk023.htm#007).md). He was a frivolous and vain prince, and
was chargeable with many infamous crimes ([Mar
8:15](../kjv/mar008.htm#015); [Luk 3:19](../kjv/luk003.htm#019.md); [Luk
13:31](../kjv/luk013.htm#031), [Luk 13:32](../kjv/luk013.htm#032).md). He
beheaded John the Baptist ([Mat 14:1](../kjv/mat014.htm#001).md) at the
instigation of Herodias, the wife of his half-brother Herod-Philip, whom
he had married. Pilate sent Christ to him when he was at Jerusalem at
the Passover ([Luk 23:7](../kjv/luk023.htm#007).md). He asked some idle
questions of him, and after causing him to be mocked, sent him back
again to Pilate. The wife of Chuza, his house-steward, was one of our
Lord's disciples ([Luk 8:3](../kjv/luk008.htm#003)). (2..md) A "faithful
martyr" ([Rev 2:13](../kjv/rev002.htm#013).md), of whom nothing more is
certainly known.

<span id="004">**Antipatris**</span> A city built by Herod the Great,
and called by this name in honour of his father, Antipater. It lay
between Caesarea and Lydda, two miles inland, on the great Roman road
from Caesarea to Jerusalem. To this place Paul was brought by night
([Act 23:31](../kjv/act023.htm#031).md) on his way to Caesarea, from which
it was distant 28 miles. It is identified with the modern, Ras-el-'Ain
where rise the springs of Aujeh, the largest springs in Palestine.

<span id="005">**Antonia**</span> A fortress in Jerusalem, at the
north-west corner of the temple area. It is called "the castle" ([Act
21:34](../kjv/act021.htm#034), [Act 21:37](../kjv/act021.htm#037).md). See
map, Showing position of Antonia From the stairs of this castle Paul
delivered his famous speech to the multitude in the area below (Acts
22:1-21). It was originally a place in which were kept the vestments of
the high priest. Herod fortified it, and called it Antonia in honour of
his friend Mark Antony. It was of great size, and commanded the temple.
It was built on a plateau of rock, separated on the north from the hill
Bezetha by a ditch about 30 feet deep and 165 feet wide.

<span id="006">**Antothite**</span> An inhabitant of Anathoth, found
only in [Ch1 11:28](../kjv/ch1011.htm#028.md); [Ch1
12:3](../kjv/ch1012.htm#003). In [Sa2 23:27](../kjv/sa2023.htm#027.md) it
is Anethothite; in [Ch1 27:12](../kjv/ch1027.htm#012.md), Anetothite.
(R.V., "Anathothite.")

<span id="007">**Anvil**</span> The rendering of the Hebrew word for
"beaten," found only in [Isa 41:7](../kjv/isa041.htm#007.md).

<span id="008">**Ape**</span> An animal of the monkey tribe ([Kg1
10:22](../kjv/kg1010.htm#022); [Ch2 9:21](../kjv/ch2009.htm#021).md). It
was brought from India by the fleets of Solomon and Hiram, and was
called by the Hebrews - , and by the Greeks - , both words being just
the Indian Tamil name of the monkey, kapi, i.e., swift, nimble, active.
No species of ape has ever been found in Palestine or the adjacent
regions.

<span id="009">**Apelles**</span> A Christian at Rome whom Paul salutes
([Rom 16:10](../kjv/rom016.htm#010).md), and styles "approved in Christ."
