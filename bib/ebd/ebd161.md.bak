<span id="000">**Hammer**</span> (1.) Heb. pattish , used by
gold-beaters ([Isa 41:7](../kjv/isa041.htm#007).md) and by quarrymen ([Jer
23:29](../kjv/jer023.htm#029).md). Metaphorically of Babylon ([Jer
50:23](../kjv/jer050.htm#023)) or Nebuchadnezzar. (2..md) Heb. makabah , a
stone-cutter's mallet ([Kg1 6:7](../kjv/kg1006.htm#007).md), or of any
workman ([Jdg 4:21](../kjv/jdg004.htm#021.md); [Isa
44:12](../kjv/isa044.htm#012)). (3..md) Heb. halmuth , a poetical word for
a workman's hammer, found only in [Jdg 5:26](../kjv/jdg005.htm#026.md),
where it denotes the mallet with which the pins of the tent of the nomad
are driven into the ground. (4.) Heb. mappets , rendered "battle-ax" in
[Jer 51:20](../kjv/jer051.htm#020.md). This was properly a "mace," which is
thus described by Rawlinson: "The Assyrian mace was a short, thin
weapon, and must either have been made of a very tough wood or (and this
is more probable) of metal. It had an ornamented head, which was
sometimes very beautifully modeled, and generally a strap or string at
the lower end by which it could be grasped with greater firmness."
