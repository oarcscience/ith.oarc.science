<span id="000">**Arch**</span> An architectural term found only in [Eze
40:16](../kjv/eze040.htm#016), [Eze 40:21](../kjv/eze040.htm#021.md), [Eze
40:22](../kjv/eze040.htm#022), [Eze 40:26](../kjv/eze040.htm#026.md), [Eze
40:29](../kjv/eze040.htm#029.md). There is no absolute proof that the
Israelites employed arches in their buildings. The arch was employed in
the building of the pyramids of Egypt. The oldest existing arch is at
Thebes, and bears the date 1350 B.C.. There are also still found the
remains of an arch, known as Robinson's Arch, of the bridge connecting
Zion and Moriah. (See TYROPOEON VALLEY.)

<span id="001">**Archelaus**</span> Ruler of the people, son of Herod
the Great, by Malthace, a Samaritan woman. He was educated along with
his brother Antipas at Rome. He inherited from his father a third part
of his kingdom viz., Idumea, Judea, and Samaria, and hence is called
"king" ([Mat 2:22](../kjv/mat002.htm#022).md). It was for fear of him that
Joseph and Mary turned aside on their way back from Egypt. Till a few
days before his death Herod had named Antipas as his successor, but in
his last moments he named Archelaus.

<span id="002">**Archer**</span> A shooter with the bow ([Ch1
10:3](../kjv/ch1010.htm#003).md). This art was of high antiquity ([Gen
21:20](../kjv/gen021.htm#020); [Gen 27:3](../kjv/gen027.htm#003).md). Saul
was wounded by the Philistine archers ([Sa1
31:3](../kjv/sa1031.htm#003).md). The phrase "breaking the bow" ([Hos
1:5](../kjv/hos001.htm#005); [Jer 49:35](../kjv/jer049.htm#035).md) is
equivalent to taking away one's power, while "strengthening the bow" is
a symbol of its increase ([Gen 49:24](../kjv/gen049.htm#024).md). The
Persian archers were famous among the ancients ([Isa
13:18](../kjv/isa013.htm#018); [Jer 49:35](../kjv/jer049.htm#035.md); [Jer
50:9](../kjv/jer050.htm#009), [Jer 50:14](../kjv/jer050.htm#014.md), [Jer
50:29](../kjv/jer050.htm#029), [Jer 50:42](../kjv/jer050.htm#042.md). (See
Bow).

<span id="003">**Archevite**</span> One of the nations planted by the
Assyrians in Samaria ([Ezr 4:9](../kjv/ezr004.htm#009).md); the men of
Erech.

<span id="004">**Archi**</span> A city on the boundary of Ephraim and
Benjamin ([Jos 16:2](../kjv/jos016.htm#002).md), between Bethel and
Beth-horon the nether.

<span id="005">**Archippus**</span> Master of the horse, a
"fellow-soldier" of Paul's ([Plm 1:2](../kjv/plm001.htm#002).md), whom he
exhorts to renewed activity ([Col 4:17](../kjv/col004.htm#017).md). He was
a member of Philemon's family, probably his son.

<span id="006">**Archite**</span> The usual designation of Hushai ([Sa2
15:32](../kjv/sa2015.htm#032); [Sa2 17:5](../kjv/sa2017.htm#005.md), [Sa2
17:14](../kjv/sa2017.htm#014); [Ch1 27:33](../kjv/ch1027.htm#033).md), who
was a native of Archi. He was "the king's friend", i.e., he held office
under David similar to that of our modern privy councilor.

<span id="007">**Arcturus**</span> Bear-keeper, the name given by the
ancients to the brightest star in the constellation Bootes. In the
Authorized Version ([Job 9:9](../kjv/job009.htm#009.md); [Job
38:32](../kjv/job038.htm#032).md) it is the rendering of the Hebrew word
'ash , which probably designates the constellation the Great Bear. This
word ( 'ash ) is supposed to be derived from an Arabic word meaning
nightwatcher, because the Great Bear always revolves about the pole, and
to our northern hemisphere never sets.

<span id="008">**Ard**</span> Descent, a grandson of Benjamin ([Num
26:38](../kjv/num026.htm#038)). In [Ch1 8:3](../kjv/ch1008.htm#003.md) he
is called Addar. His descendants are mentioned in [Num
26:40](../kjv/num026.htm#040.md).

<span id="009">**Ardon**</span> Descendant, the last of the three sons
of Caleb by his first wife Azubah ([Ch1 2:18](../kjv/ch1002.htm#018).md).
