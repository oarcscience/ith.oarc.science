<span id="000">**Treasury**</span> ([Mat 27:6](../kjv/mat027.htm#006);
[Mar 12:41](../kjv/mar012.htm#041); [Joh 8:20](../kjv/joh008.htm#020)).
It does not appear that there was a separate building so called. The
name was given to the thirteen brazen chests, called "trumpets," from
the form of the opening into which the offerings of the temple
worshippers were put. These stood in the outer "court of the women."
"Nine chests were for the appointed money-tribute and for the
sacrifice-tribute, i.e., money-gifts instead of the sacrifices; four
chests for freewill-offerings for wood, incense, temple decoration, and
burnt-offerings" (Lightfoot's Hor. Heb.).

<span id="001">**Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil**</span> Stood
in the midst of the garden of Eden, beside the tree of life (Gen. 2, 3).
Adam and Eve were forbidden to take of the fruit which grew upon it. But
they disobeyed the divine injunction, and so sin and death by sin
entered our world and became the heritage of Adam's posterity. (See
ADAM.)

<span id="002">**Tree of Life**</span> Stood also in the midst of the
garden of Eden ([Gen 2:9](../kjv/gen002.htm#009); [Gen
3:22](../kjv/gen003.htm#022)). Some writers have advanced the opinion
that this tree had some secret virtue, which was fitted to preserve
life. Probably the lesson conveyed was that life was to be sought by
man, not in himself or in his own power, but from without, from Him who
is emphatically the Life ([Joh 1:4](../kjv/joh001.htm#004); [Joh
14:6](../kjv/joh014.htm#006)). Wisdom is compared to the tree of life
([Pro 3:18](../kjv/pro003.htm#018)). The "tree of life" spoken of in the
Book of Revelation ([Rev 2:7](../kjv/rev002.htm#007); [Rev
22:2](../kjv/rev022.htm#002), [Rev 22:14](../kjv/rev022.htm#014)) is an
emblem of the joys of the celestial paradise.

<span id="003">**Trespass Offering**</span> (Heb. 'asham , "debt"), the
law concerning, given in Lev. 5:14 - 6:7; also in [Num
5:5](../kjv/num005.htm#005). The idea of sin as a "debt" pervades this
legislation. The asham, which was always a ram, was offered in cases
where sins were more private. (See OFFERING.)

<span id="004">**Tribe**</span> A collection of families descending from
one ancestor. The "twelve tribes" of the Hebrews were the twelve
collections of families which sprang from the sons of Jacob. In [Mat
24:30](../kjv/mat024.htm#030) the word has a wider significance. The
tribes of Israel are referred to as types of the spiritual family of God
(Rev. 7). (See KINGDOM OF ISRAEL; OF JUDAH.)

<span id="005">**Tribulation**</span> Trouble or affliction of any kind
([Deu 4:30](../kjv/deu004.htm#030); [Mat 13:21](../kjv/mat013.htm#021);
[Co2 7:4](../kjv/co2007.htm#004)). In [Rom 2:9](../kjv/rom002.htm#009)
"tribulation and anguish" are the penal sufferings that shall overtake
the wicked. In [Mat 24:21](../kjv/mat024.htm#021), [Mat
24:29](../kjv/mat024.htm#029), the word denotes the calamities that were
to attend the destruction of Jerusalem.

<span id="006">**Tribute**</span> A tax imposed by a king on his
subjects ([Sa2 20:24](../kjv/sa2020.htm#024); [Kg1
4:6](../kjv/kg1004.htm#006); [Rom 13:6](../kjv/rom013.htm#006)). In [Mat
17:24](../kjv/mat017.htm#024) the word denotes the temple rate (the
"didrachma," the "half-shekel," as rendered by the R.V.) which was
required to be paid for the support of the temple by every Jew above
twenty years of age ([Exo 30:12](../kjv/exo030.htm#012); [Kg2
12:4](../kjv/kg2012.htm#004); [Ch2 24:6](../kjv/ch2024.htm#006), [Ch2
24:9](../kjv/ch2024.htm#009)). It was not a civil but a religious tax.
In [Mat 22:17](../kjv/mat022.htm#017), [Mar
12:14](../kjv/mar012.htm#014), [Luk 20:22](../kjv/luk020.htm#022), the
word may be interpreted as denoting the capitation tax which the Romans
imposed on the Jewish people. It may, however, be legitimately regarded
as denoting any tax whatever imposed by a foreign power on the people of
Israel. The "tribute money" shown to our Lord ([Mat
22:19](../kjv/mat022.htm#019)) was the denarius, bearing Caesar's
superscription. It was the tax paid by every Jew to the Romans. (See
PENNY.)

<span id="007">**Trinity**</span> A word not found in Scripture, but
used to express the doctrine of the unity of God as subsisting in three
distinct Persons. This word is derived from the Gr. trias , first used
by Theophilus (A.D. 168-183), or from the Lat. trinitas , first used by
Tertullian (A.D. 220), to express this doctrine. The propositions
involved in the doctrine are these: (1.) That God is one, and that there
is but one God ([Deu 6:4](../kjv/deu006.htm#004); [Kg1
8:60](../kjv/kg1008.htm#060); [Isa 44:6](../kjv/isa044.htm#006); [Mar
12:29](../kjv/mar012.htm#029), [Mar 12:32](../kjv/mar012.htm#032); [Joh
10:30](../kjv/joh010.htm#030)). (2.) That the Father is a distinct
divine Person ( hypostasis, subsistentia, persona, suppositum
intellectuale ), distinct from the Son and the Holy Spirit. (3.) That
Jesus Christ was truly God, and yet was a Person distinct from the
Father and the Holy Spirit. (4.) That the Holy Spirit is also a distinct
divine Person.

<span id="008">**Troas**</span> A city on the coast of Mysia, in the
north-west of Asia Minor, named after ancient Troy, which was at some
little distance from it (about 4 miles) to the north. Here Paul, on his
second missionary journey, saw the vision of a "man of Macedonia," who
appeared to him, saying, "Come over, and help us" ([Act
16:8](../kjv/act016.htm#008)). He visited this place also on other
occasions, and on one of these visits he left his cloak and some books
there ([Co2 2:12](../kjv/co2002.htm#012); [Ti2
4:13](../kjv/ti2004.htm#013)). The ruins of Troas extend over many
miles, the site being now mostly covered with a forest of oak trees. The
modern name of the ruins is Eski Stamboul i.e., Old Constantinople.

<span id="009">**Trogyllium**</span> A town on the western coast of Asia
Minor, where Paul "tarried" when on his way from Assos to Miletus, on
his third missionary journey ([Act 20:15](../kjv/act020.htm#015)).
