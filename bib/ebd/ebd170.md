<span id="000">**Heap**</span> When Joshua took the city of Ai (Josh.
8), he burned it and "made it an heap \[Heb. tel \] for ever" ([Jos
8:28](../kjv/jos008.htm#028).md). The ruins of this city were for a long
time sought for in vain. It has been at length, however, identified with
the mound which simply bears the name of "Tel." "There are many Tels in
modern Palestine, that land of Tels, each Tel with some other name
attached to it to mark the former site. But the site of Ai has no other
name 'unto this day.' It is simply et-Tel, 'the heap' par excellence."

<span id="001">**Heart**</span> According to the Bible, the heart is the
centre not only of spiritual activity, but of all the operations of
human life. "Heart" and "soul" are often used interchangeably ([Deu
6:5](../kjv/deu006.htm#005); [Deu 26:16](../kjv/deu026.htm#016.md); compare
[Mat 22:37](../kjv/mat022.htm#037); [Mar 12:30](../kjv/mar012.htm#030.md),
[Mar 12:33](../kjv/mar012.htm#033).md), but this is not generally the case.
The heart is the "home of the personal life," and hence a man is
designated, according to his heart, wise ([Kg1
3:12](../kjv/kg1003.htm#012), etc..md), pure ([Psa
24:4](../kjv/psa024.htm#004); [Mat 5:8](../kjv/mat005.htm#008), etc..md),
upright and righteous ([Gen 20:5](../kjv/gen020.htm#005.md), [Gen
20:6](../kjv/gen020.htm#006); [Psa 11:2](../kjv/psa011.htm#002.md); [Psa
78:72](../kjv/psa078.htm#072).md), pious and good ([Luk
8:15](../kjv/luk008.htm#015).md), etc. In these and such passages the word
"soul" could not be substituted for "heart." The heart is also the seat
of the conscience ([Rom 2:15](../kjv/rom002.htm#015).md). It is naturally
wicked ([Gen 8:21](../kjv/gen008.htm#021).md), and hence it contaminates
the whole life and character ([Mat 12:34](../kjv/mat012.htm#034.md); [Mat
15:18](../kjv/mat015.htm#018.md); compare [Ecc
8:11](../kjv/ecc008.htm#011); [Psa 73:7](../kjv/psa073.htm#007).md). Hence
the heart must be changed, regenerated ([Eze
36:26](../kjv/eze036.htm#026); [Eze 11:19](../kjv/eze011.htm#019.md); [Psa
51:10](../kjv/psa051.htm#010).md), before a man can willingly obey God. The
process of salvation begins in the heart by the believing reception of
the testimony of God, while the rejection of that testimony hardens the
heart ([Psa 95:8](../kjv/psa095.htm#008.md); [Pro
28:14](../kjv/pro028.htm#014); [Ch2 36:13](../kjv/ch2036.htm#013).md).
"Hardness of heart evidences itself by light views of sin; partial
acknowledgment and confession of it; pride and conceit; ingratitude;
unconcern about the word and ordinances of God; inattention to divine
providences; stifling convictions of conscience; shunning reproof;
presumption, and general ignorance of divine things."

<span id="002">**Hearth**</span> Heb. ah ([Jer
36:22](../kjv/jer036.htm#022), [Jer 36:23](../kjv/jer036.htm#023.md); R.V.,
"brazier"), meaning a large pot like a brazier, a portable furnace in
which fire was kept in the king's winter apartment. Heb. kiyor ([Zac
12:6](../kjv/zac012.htm#006); R.V., "pan".md), a fire-pan. Heb. moqed ([Psa
102:3](../kjv/psa102.htm#003); R.V., "fire-brand".md), properly a fagot.
Heb. yaqud ([Isa 30:14](../kjv/isa030.htm#014).md), a burning mass on a
hearth.

<span id="003">**He-ass**</span> Heb. hamor , ([Gen
12:16](../kjv/gen012.htm#016).md), the general designation of the donkey
used for carrying burdens ([Gen 42:26](../kjv/gen042.htm#026).md) and for
ploughing ([Isa 30:24](../kjv/isa030.htm#024).md). It is described in [Gen
49:14](../kjv/gen049.htm#014), [Sa2 19:26](../kjv/sa2019.htm#026.md). (See
ASS.)

<span id="004">**Heath**</span> Heb. 'arar , ([Jer
17:6](../kjv/jer017.htm#006); [Jer 48:6](../kjv/jer048.htm#006).md), a
species of juniper called by the Arabs by the same name ( 'arar ), the
Juniperus sabina or savin. "Its gloomy, stunted appearance, with its
scale-like leaves pressed close to its gnarled stem, and cropped close
by the wild goats, as it clings to the rocks about Petra, gives great
force to the contrast suggested by the prophet, between him that
trusteth in man, naked and destitute, and the man that trusteth in the
Lord, flourishing as a tree planted by the waters" (Tristram, Natural
History of the Bible).

<span id="005">**Heathen**</span> (Heb. plural goyum ). At first the
word goyim denoted generally all the nations of the world ([Gen
18:18](../kjv/gen018.htm#018.md); compare [Gal
3:8](../kjv/gal003.htm#008).md). The Jews afterwards became a people
distinguished in a marked manner from the other goyim. They were a
separate people ([Lev 20:23](../kjv/lev020.htm#023.md); 26:14-45; Deut.
28), and the other nations, the Amorites, Hittites, etc., were the
goyim, the heathen, with whom the Jews were forbidden to be associated
in any way ([Jos 23:7](../kjv/jos023.htm#007.md); [Kg1
11:2](../kjv/kg1011.htm#002).md). The practice of idolatry was the
characteristic of these nations, and hence the word came to designate
idolaters ([Psa 106:47](../kjv/psa106.htm#047.md); [Jer
46:28](../kjv/jer046.htm#028); [Lam 1:3](../kjv/lam001.htm#003.md); [Isa
36:18](../kjv/isa036.htm#018).md), the wicked ([Psa
9:5](../kjv/psa009.htm#005), [Psa 9:15](../kjv/psa009.htm#015.md), [Psa
9:17](../kjv/psa009.htm#017).md). The corresponding Greek word in the New
Testament, ethne , has similar shades of meaning. In [Act
22:21](../kjv/act022.htm#021), [Gal 3:14](../kjv/gal003.htm#014.md), it
denotes the people of the earth generally; and in [Mat
6:7](../kjv/mat006.htm#007.md), an idolater. In modern usage the word
denotes all nations that are strangers to revealed religion.

<span id="006">**Heaven**</span> (1.) Definitions., The phrase "heaven
and earth" is used to indicate the whole universe ([Gen
1:1](../kjv/gen001.htm#001); [Jer 23:24](../kjv/jer023.htm#024.md); [Act
17:24](../kjv/act017.htm#024).md). According to the Jewish notion there
were three heavens, (a) The firmament, as "fowls of the heaven" ([Gen
2:19](../kjv/gen002.htm#019); [Gen 7:3](../kjv/gen007.htm#003.md), [Gen
7:23](../kjv/gen007.htm#023); [Psa 8:8](../kjv/psa008.htm#008), etc..md),
"the eagles of heaven" ([Lam 4:19](../kjv/lam004.htm#019)), etc. (b.md) The
starry heavens ([Deu 17:3](../kjv/deu017.htm#003.md); [Jer
8:2](../kjv/jer008.htm#002); [Mat 24:29](../kjv/mat024.htm#029)). (c.md)
"The heaven of heavens," or "the third heaven" ([Deu
10:14](../kjv/deu010.htm#014); [Kg1 8:27](../kjv/kg1008.htm#027.md); [Psa
115:16](../kjv/psa115.htm#016); [Psa 148:4](../kjv/psa148.htm#004.md); [Co2
12:2](../kjv/co2012.htm#002)). (2..md) Meaning of words in the original,
(a) The usual Hebrew word for "heavens" is shamayim, a plural form
meaning "heights," "elevations" ([Gen 1:1](../kjv/gen001.htm#001.md); [Gen
2:1](../kjv/gen002.htm#001)). (b.md) The Hebrew word marom is also used
([Psa 68:18](../kjv/psa068.htm#018); [Psa 93:4](../kjv/psa093.htm#004.md);
[Psa 102:19](../kjv/psa102.htm#019), etc..md) as equivalent to shamayim,
"high places," "heights." (c) Heb. galgal , literally a "wheel," is
rendered "heaven" in [Psa 77:18](../kjv/psa077.htm#018.md) (R.V.,
"whirlwind"). (d) Heb. shahak , rendered "sky" ([Deu
33:26](../kjv/deu033.htm#026); [Job 37:18](../kjv/job037.htm#018.md); [Psa
18:11](../kjv/psa018.htm#011).md), plural "clouds" ([Job
35:5](../kjv/job035.htm#005); [Job 36:28](../kjv/job036.htm#028.md); [Psa
68:34](../kjv/psa068.htm#034), marg. "heavens".md), means probably the
firmament. (e) Heb. rakia is closely connected with (d), and is rendered
"firmamentum" in the Vulgate, whence our "firmament" ([Gen
1:6](../kjv/gen001.htm#006); [Deu 33:26](../kjv/deu033.htm#026), etc..md),
regarded as a solid expanse. (3.) Metaphorical meaning of term. [Isa
14:13](../kjv/isa014.htm#013), [Isa 14:14](../kjv/isa014.htm#014.md);
"doors of heaven" ([Psa 78:23](../kjv/psa078.htm#023).md); heaven "shut"
([Kg1 8:35](../kjv/kg1008.htm#035).md); "opened" ([Eze
1:1](../kjv/eze001.htm#001)). (See [Ch1 21:16](../kjv/ch1021.htm#016)..md)
(4.) Spiritual meaning. The place of the everlasting blessedness of the
righteous; the abode of departed spirits. (a) Christ calls it his
"Father's house" ([Joh 14:2](../kjv/joh014.htm#002)). (b.md) It is called
"paradise" ([Luk 23:43](../kjv/luk023.htm#043.md); [Co2
12:4](../kjv/co2012.htm#004); [Rev 2:7](../kjv/rev002.htm#007)). (c.md)
"The heavenly Jerusalem" ([Gal 4:26](../kjv/gal004.htm#026.md); [Heb
12:22](../kjv/heb012.htm#022); [Rev 3:12](../kjv/rev003.htm#012)). (d.md)
The "kingdom of heaven" ([Mat 25:1](../kjv/mat025.htm#001.md); [Jam
2:5](../kjv/jam002.htm#005)). (e.md) The "eternal kingdom" ([Pe2
1:11](../kjv/pe2001.htm#011)). (f.md) The "eternal inheritance" ([Pe1
1:4](../kjv/pe1001.htm#004); [Heb 9:15](../kjv/heb009.htm#015)). (g.md) The
"better country" ([Heb 11:14](../kjv/heb011.htm#014.md), [Heb
11:16](../kjv/heb011.htm#016)). (h.md) The blessed are said to "sit down
with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob," and to be "in Abraham's bosom" ([Luk
16:22](../kjv/luk016.htm#022); [Mat 8:11](../kjv/mat008.htm#011).md); to
"reign with Christ" ([Ti2 2:12](../kjv/ti2002.htm#012).md); and to enjoy
"rest" ([Heb 4:10](../kjv/heb004.htm#010.md), [Heb
4:11](../kjv/heb004.htm#011).md). In heaven the blessedness of the
righteous consists in the possession of "life everlasting," "an eternal
weight of glory" ([Co2 4:17](../kjv/co2004.htm#017).md), an exemption from
all sufferings forever, a deliverance from all evils ([Co2
5:1](../kjv/co2005.htm#001), [Co2 5:2](../kjv/co2005.htm#002).md) and from
the society of the wicked ([Ti2 4:18](../kjv/ti2004.htm#018).md), bliss
without termination, the "fulness of joy" for ever ([Luk
20:36](../kjv/luk020.htm#036); [Co2 4:16](../kjv/co2004.htm#016.md), [Co2
4:18](../kjv/co2004.htm#018); [Pe1 1:4](../kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md); [Pe1
5:10](../kjv/pe1005.htm#010); [Jo1 3:2](../kjv/jo1003.htm#002).md). The
believer's heaven is not only a state of everlasting blessedness, but
also a "place", a place "prepared" for them ([Joh
14:2](../kjv/joh014.htm#002).md).

<span id="007">**Heave Offering**</span> Heb. terumah , ([Exo
29:27](../kjv/exo029.htm#027).md) means simply an offering, a present,
including all the offerings made by the Israelites as a present. This
Hebrew word is frequently employed. Some of the rabbis attach to the
word the meaning of elevation, and refer it to the heave offering, which
consisted in presenting the offering by a motion up and down,
distinguished from the wave offering, which consisted in a repeated
movement in a horizontal direction, a "wave offering to the Lord as
ruler of earth, a heave offering to the Lord as ruler of heaven." The
right shoulder, which fell to the priests in presenting thank offerings,
was called the heave shoulder ([Lev 7:34](../kjv/lev007.htm#034.md); [Num
6:20](../kjv/num006.htm#020).md). The first fruits offered in harvest-time
([Num 15:20](../kjv/num015.htm#020), [Num 15:21](../kjv/num015.htm#021).md)
were heave offerings.

<span id="008">**Heber**</span> Passing over. (1.) Son of Beriah and
grandson of Asher ([Gen 46:17](../kjv/gen046.htm#017.md); [Ch1
7:31](../kjv/ch1007.htm#031), [Ch1 7:32](../kjv/ch1007.htm#032)). (2..md)
The Kenite ([Jdg 4:11](../kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md), [Jdg
4:17](../kjv/jdg004.htm#017); [Jdg 5:24](../kjv/jdg005.htm#024).md), a
descendant of Hobab. His wife Jael received Sisera (q.v.) into her tent
and then killed him. (3.) [Ch1 4:18](../kjv/ch1004.htm#018). (4..md) A
Benjamite ([Ch1 8:17](../kjv/ch1008.htm#017)). (5..md) A Gadite ([Ch1
5:13](../kjv/ch1005.htm#013)). (See EBER..md)

<span id="009">**Hebrew**</span> A name applied to the Israelites in
Scripture only by one who is a foreigner ([Gen
39:14](../kjv/gen039.htm#014), [Gen 39:17](../kjv/gen039.htm#017.md); [Gen
41:12](../kjv/gen041.htm#012), etc..md), or by the Israelites when they
speak of themselves to foreigners ([Gen 40:15](../kjv/gen040.htm#015.md);
[Exo 1:19](../kjv/exo001.htm#019).md), or when spoken of an contrasted with
other peoples ([Gen 43:32](../kjv/gen043.htm#032.md); [Exo
1:3](../kjv/exo001.htm#003), [Exo 1:7](../kjv/exo001.htm#007.md), [Exo
1:15](../kjv/exo001.htm#015); [Deu 15:12](../kjv/deu015.htm#012).md). In
the New Testament there is the same contrast between Hebrews and
foreigners ([Act 6:1](../kjv/act006.htm#001.md); [Phi
3:5](../kjv/phi003.htm#005)). Derivation. (1..md) The name is derived,
according to some, from Eber ([Gen 10:24](../kjv/gen010.htm#024).md), the
ancestor of Abraham. The Hebrews are "sons of Eber" ([Gen
10:21](../kjv/gen010.htm#021)). (2..md) Others trace the name of a Hebrew
root-word signifying "to pass over," and hence regard it as meaning "the
man who passed over," viz., the Euphrates; or to the Hebrew word meaning
"the region" or "country beyond," viz., the land of Chaldea. This latter
view is preferred. It is the more probable origin of the designation
given to Abraham coming among the Canaanites as a man from beyond the
Euphrates ([Gen 14:13](../kjv/gen014.htm#013)). (3..md) A third derivation
of the word has been suggested, viz., that it is from the Hebrew word
'abhar , "to pass over," whence 'ebher, in the sense of a "sojourner" or
"passer through" as distinct from a "settler" in the land, and thus
applies to the condition of Abraham ([Heb
11:13](../kjv/heb011.htm#013).md).
