<span id="000">**Saphir**</span> Beautiful, a town of Judah ([Mic
1:11](../kjv/mic001.htm#011).md), identified with es-Suafir, 5 miles
south-east of Ashdod.

<span id="001">**Sapphira**</span> Beautiful, the wife of Ananias
(q.v.). She was a partner in his guilt and also in his punishment ([Act
5:1](../kjv/act005.htm#001).md).

<span id="002">**Sapphire**</span> Associated with diamonds ([Exo
28:18](../kjv/exo028.htm#018).md) and emeralds ([Eze
28:13](../kjv/eze028.htm#013).md); one of the stones in the high priest's
breastplate. It is a precious stone of a sky-blue colour, probably the
lapis lazuli, brought from Babylon. The throne of God is described as of
the colour of a sapphire ([Exo 24:10](../kjv/exo024.htm#010.md); compare
[Eze 1:26](../kjv/eze001.htm#026).md).

<span id="003">**Sarah**</span> Princess, the wife and at the same time
the half-sister of Abraham ([Gen 11:29](../kjv/gen011.htm#029.md); [Gen
20:12](../kjv/gen020.htm#012).md). This name was given to her at the time
that it was announced to Abraham that she should be the mother of the
promised child. Her story is from her marriage identified with that of
the patriarch till the time of her death. Her death, at the age of one
hundred and twenty-seven years (the only instance in Scripture where the
age of a woman is recorded), was the occasion of Abraham's purchasing
the cave of Machpelah as a family burying-place. In the allegory of [Gal
4:22](../kjv/gal004.htm#022.md) she is the type of the "Jerusalem which is
above." She is also mentioned as Sara in [Heb
11:11](../kjv/heb011.htm#011.md) among the Old Testament worthies, who "all
died in faith." (See ABRAHAM.)

<span id="004">**Sarai**</span> My princess, the name originally borne
by Sarah ([Gen 11:31](../kjv/gen011.htm#031.md); [Gen
17:15](../kjv/gen017.htm#015).md).

<span id="005">**Sardine Stone**</span> ([Rev
4:3](../kjv/rev004.htm#003.md), R.V., "sardius;" Heb. 'odhem ; LXX., Gr.
sardion , from a root meaning "red"), a gem of a blood-red colour. It
was called "sardius" because obtained from Sardis in Lydia. It is
enumerated among the precious stones in the high priest's breastplate
([Exo 28:17](../kjv/exo028.htm#017.md); [Exo
39:10](../kjv/exo039.htm#010).md). It is our red carnelian.

<span id="006">**Sardis**</span> The metropolis of Lydia in Asia Minor.
It stood on the river Pactolus, at the foot of mount Tmolus. Here was
one of the seven Asiatic churches ([Rev 3:1](../kjv/rev003.htm#001).md). It
is now a ruin called Sert-Kalessi.

<span id="007">**Sardonyx**</span> ([Rev 21:20](../kjv/rev021.htm#020).md),
a species of the carnelian combining the sard and the onyx, having three
layers of opaque spots or stripes on a transparent red basis. Like the
sardine, it is a variety of the chalcedony.

<span id="008">**Sarepta**</span> ([Luk 4:26](../kjv/luk004.htm#026).md).
See ZAREPHATH.

<span id="009">**Sargon**</span> (In the inscriptions, "Sarrayukin"
\[the god\] has appointed the king; also "Sarru-kinu," the legitimate
king.) On the death of Shalmaneser (723 B.C.), one of the Assyrian
generals established himself on the vacant throne, taking the name of
"Sargon," after that of the famous monarch, the Sargon of Accad, founder
of the first Semitic empire, as well as of one of the most famous
libraries of Chaldea. He forthwith began a conquering career, and became
one of the most powerful of the Assyrian monarchs. He is mentioned by
name in the Bible only in connection with the siege of Ashdod ([Isa
20:1](../kjv/isa020.htm#001).md). At the very beginning of his reign he
besieged and took the city of Samaria ([Kg2
17:6](../kjv/kg2017.htm#006); [Kg2 18:9](../kjv/kg2018.htm#009).md). On an
inscription found in the palace he built at Khorsabad, near Nieveh, he
says, "The city of Samaria I besieged, I took; 27,280 of its inhabitants
I carried away; fifty chariots that were among them I collected," etc.
The northern kingdom he changed into an Assyrian satrapy. He afterwards
drove Merodach-baladan (q.v.), who kept him at bay for twelve years, out
of Babylon, which he entered in triumph. By a succession of victories he
gradually enlarged and consolidated the empire, which now extended from
the frontiers of Egypt in the west to the mountains of Elam in the east,
and thus carried almost to completion the ambitious designs of
Tiglath-pileser (q.v.). He was murdered by one of his own soldiers (705
B.C.) in his palace at Khorsabad, after a reign of sixteen years, and
was succeeded by his son Sennacherib.
