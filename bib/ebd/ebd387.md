<span id="000">**Zalmon**</span> Shady. (1.) One of David's warriors,
called the Ahohite ([Sa2 23:28](../kjv/sa2023.htm#028)); called also
Ilai ([Ch1 11:29](../kjv/ch1011.htm#029)). (2.) A wood near Shechem,
from which Abimelech and his party brought boughs and "put them to the
hold" of Shechem, "and set the hold on fire" ([Jdg
9:48](../kjv/jdg009.htm#048)). Probably the southern peak of Gerizim,
now called Jebel Sulman. (See SALMON.)

<span id="001">**Zalmonah**</span> Shady, one of the stations of the
Israelites in the wilderness ([Num 33:41](../kjv/num033.htm#041), [Num
33:42](../kjv/num033.htm#042)).

<span id="002">**Zalmunna**</span> One of the two kings of Midian whom
the "Lord delivered" into the hands of Gideon. He was slain afterwards
with Zebah (Judg. 8:5-21). (See ZEBAH.)

<span id="003">**Zamzummims**</span> A race of giants; "a people great,
and many, and tall, as the Anakims" ([Deu 2:20](../kjv/deu002.htm#020),
[Deu 2:21](../kjv/deu002.htm#021)). They were overcome by the Ammonites,
"who called them Zamzummims." They belonged to the Rephaim, and
inhabited the country afterwards occupied by the Ammonites. It has been
conjectured that they might be Ham-zuzims, i.e., Zuzims dwelling in Ham,
a place apparently to the south of Ashteroth ([Gen
14:5](../kjv/gen014.htm#005)), the ancient Rabbath-ammon.

<span id="004">**Zanoah**</span> Marsh. (1.) A town in the low country
or shephelah of Judah, near Zorah ([Jos 15:34](../kjv/jos015.htm#034)).
It was re-occupied after the return from the Captivity ([Neh
11:30](../kjv/neh011.htm#030)). Zanu'ah in Wady Ismail , 10 miles west
of Jerusalem, occupies probably the same site. (2.) A town in the hill
country of Judah, some 10 miles to the south-west of Hebron ([Jos
15:56](../kjv/jos015.htm#056)).

<span id="005">**Zaphnath-paaneah**</span> The name which Pharaoh gave
to Joseph when he raised him to the rank of prime minister or grand
vizier of the kingdom ([Gen 41:45](../kjv/gen041.htm#045)). This is a
pure Egyptian word, and has been variously explained. Some think it
means "creator," or "preserver of life." Brugsch interprets it as
"governor of the district of the place of life", i.e., of Goshen, the
chief city of which was Pithom, "the place of life." Others explain it
as meaning "a revealer of secrets," or "the man to whom secrets are
revealed."

<span id="006">**Zarephath**</span> Smelting-shop, "a workshop for the
refining and smelting of metals", a small Phoenician town, now Surafend,
about a mile from the coast, almost midway on the road between Tyre and
Sidon. Here Elijah sojourned with a poor widow during the "great
famine," when the "heaven was shut up three years and six months" ([Luk
4:26](../kjv/luk004.htm#026); [Kg1 17:10](../kjv/kg1017.htm#010)). It is
called Sarepta in the New Testament ([Luk 4:26](../kjv/luk004.htm#026)).

<span id="007">**Zaretan**</span> When the Hebrews crossed the Jordan,
as soon as the feet of the priests were dipped in the water, the flow of
the stream was arrested. The point of arrest was the "city of Adam
beside Zaretan," probably near Succoth, at the mouth of the Jabbok, some
30 miles up the river from where the people were encamped. There the
water "stood and rose upon an heap." Thus the whole space of 30 miles of
the river-bed was dry, that the tribes might pass over ([Jos
3:16](../kjv/jos003.htm#016), [Jos 3:17](../kjv/jos003.htm#017); compare
[Psa 104:3](../kjv/psa104.htm#003)).

<span id="008">**Zareth-shahar**</span> The splendour of the dawn, a
city "in the mount of the valley" ([Jos 13:19](../kjv/jos013.htm#019)).
It is identified with the ruins of Zara, near the mouth of the Wady
Zerka Main, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea, some 3 miles south of
the Callirrhoe. Of this town but little remains. "A few broken basaltic
columns and pieces of wall about 200 yards back from the shore, and a
ruined fort rather nearer the sea, about the middle of the coast line of
the plain, are all that are left" (Tristram's Land of Moab).

<span id="009">**Zarthan**</span> A place near Succoth, in the plain of
the Jordan, "in the clay ground," near which Hiram cast the brazen
utensils for the temple ([Kg1 7:46](../kjv/kg1007.htm#046)); probably
the same as Zartan. It is also called Zeredathah ([Ch2
4:17](../kjv/ch2004.htm#017)). (See ZEREDA.)
