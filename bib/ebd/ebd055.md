<span id="000">**Beth-arbel**</span> House of God's court, a place
alluded to by Hosea ([Hos 10:14](../kjv/hos010.htm#014).md) as the scene of
some great military exploit, but not otherwise mentioned in Scripture.
The Shalman here named was probably Shalmaneser, the king of Assyria
([Kg2 17:3](../kjv/kg2017.htm#003).md).

<span id="001">**Beth-aven**</span> House of nothingness; i.e., "of
idols", a place in the mountains of Benjamin, east of Bethel ([Jos
7:2](../kjv/jos007.htm#002); [Jos 18:12](../kjv/jos018.htm#012.md); [Sa1
13:5](../kjv/sa1013.htm#005)). In [Hos 4:15](../kjv/hos004.htm#015.md);
[Hos 5:8](../kjv/hos005.htm#008); [Hos 10:5](../kjv/hos010.htm#005.md) it
stands for "Bethel" (q.v.), and it is so called because it was no longer
the "house of God," but "the house of idols," referring to the calves
there worshipped.

<span id="002">**Beth-barah**</span> House of crossing, a place south of
the scene of Gideon's victory ([Jdg 7:24](../kjv/jdg007.htm#024).md). It
was probably the chief ford of the Jordan in that district, and may have
been that by which Jacob crossed when he returned from Mesopotamia, near
the Jabbok ([Gen 32:22](../kjv/gen032.htm#022).md), and at which Jephthah
slew the Ephraimites ([Jdg 12:4](../kjv/jdg012.htm#004).md). Nothing,
however, is certainly known of it. (See BETHABARA.)

<span id="003">**Beth-car**</span> Sheep-house, a place to which the
Israelites pursued the Philistines west from Mizpeh ([Sa1
7:11](../kjv/sa1007.htm#011).md).

<span id="004">**Beth-dagon**</span> House of Dagon. (1.) A city in the
low country or plain of Judah, near Philistia ([Jos
15:41](../kjv/jos015.htm#041).md); the modern Beit Degan, about 5 miles
from Lydda. (2.) A city near the south-east border of Asher ([Jos
19:27](../kjv/jos019.htm#027).md). It was a Philistine colony. It is
identical with the modern ruined village of Tell D'auk .

<span id="005">**Beth-diblathaim**</span> House of two cakes of figs, a
city of Moab, upon which Jeremiah ([Jer 48:22](../kjv/jer048.htm#022).md)
denounced destruction. It is called also Almon-diblathaim ([Num
33:46](../kjv/num033.htm#046).md) and Diblath ([Eze
6:14](../kjv/eze006.htm#014)). (R.V., "Diblah.".md)

<span id="006">**Bethel**</span> House of God. (1.) A place in Central
Palestine, about 10 miles north of Jerusalem, at the head of the pass of
Michmash and Ai. It was originally the royal Canaanite city of Luz ([Gen
28:19](../kjv/gen028.htm#019).md). The name Bethel was at first apparently
given to the sanctuary in the neighbourhood of Luz, and was not given to
the city itself till after its conquest by the tribe of Ephraim. When
Abram entered Canaan he formed his second encampment between Bethel and
Hai ([Gen 12:8](../kjv/gen012.htm#008).md); and on his return from Egypt he
came back to it, and again "called upon the name of the Lord" ([Gen
13:4](../kjv/gen013.htm#004).md). Here Jacob, on his way from Beersheba to
Haran, had a vision of the angels of God ascending and descending on the
ladder whose top reached unto heaven ([Gen
28:10](../kjv/gen028.htm#010), [Gen 28:19](../kjv/gen028.htm#019).md); and
on his return he again visited this place, "where God talked with him"
([Gen 35:1](../kjv/gen035.htm#001).md), and there he "built an altar, and
called the place El-beth-el" (q.v.). To this second occasion of God's
speaking with Jacob at Bethel, Hosea ([Gen 12:4](../kjv/gen012.htm#004.md),
[Gen 12:5](../kjv/gen012.htm#005).md) makes reference. In troublous times
the people went to Bethel to ask counsel of God ([Jdg
20:18](../kjv/jdg020.htm#018), [Jdg 20:31](../kjv/jdg020.htm#031.md); [Jdg
21:2](../kjv/jdg021.htm#002).md). Here the ark of the covenant was kept for
a long time under the care of Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron ([Jdg
20:26](../kjv/jdg020.htm#026).md). Here also Samuel held in rotation his
court of justice ([Sa1 7:16](../kjv/sa1007.htm#016).md). It was included in
Israel after the kingdom was divided, and it became one of the seats of
the worship of the golden calf ([Kg1 12:28](../kjv/kg1012.htm#028.md); [Kg1
13:1](../kjv/kg1013.htm#001).md). Hence the prophet Hosea ([Hos
4:15](../kjv/hos004.htm#015); [Hos 5:8](../kjv/hos005.htm#008.md); [Hos
10:5](../kjv/hos010.htm#005), [Hos 10:8](../kjv/hos010.htm#008).md) calls
it in contempt Beth-aven, i.e., "house of idols." Bethel remained an
abode of priests even after the kingdom of Israel was desolated by the
king of Assyria ([Kg2 17:28](../kjv/kg2017.htm#028.md), [Kg2
17:29](../kjv/kg2017.htm#029).md). At length all traces of the idolatries
were extirpated by Josiah, king of Judah ([Kg2
23:15](../kjv/kg2023.htm#015).md); and the place was still in existence
after the Captivity ([Ezr 2:28](../kjv/ezr002.htm#028.md); [Neh
7:32](../kjv/neh007.htm#032).md). It has been identified with the ruins of
Beitin, a small village amid extensive ruins some 9 miles south of
Shiloh. (2.) Mount Bethel was a hilly district near Bethel ([Jos
16:1](../kjv/jos016.htm#001); [Sa1 13:2](../kjv/sa1013.htm#002)). (3..md) A
town in the south of Judah ([Jos 8:17](../kjv/jos008.htm#017.md); [Jos
12:16](../kjv/jos012.htm#016).md).

<span id="007">**Bethelite**</span> A designation of Hiel (q.v.), who
rebuilt Jericho and experienced the curse pronounced long before ([Kg1
16:34](../kjv/kg1016.htm#034).md).

<span id="008">**Bether**</span> Dissection or separation, certain
mountains mentioned in [Sol 2:17](../kjv/sol002.htm#017.md); probably near
Lebanon.

<span id="009">**Bethesda**</span> House of mercy, a reservoir (Gr.
kolumbethra , "a swimming bath") with five porches, close to the
sheep-gate or market ([Neh 3:1](../kjv/neh003.htm#001.md); [Joh
5:2](../kjv/joh005.htm#002)). Eusebius the historian (A.D. 330.md) calls it
"the sheep-pool." It is also called "Bethsaida" and "Beth-zatha" ([Joh
5:2](../kjv/joh005.htm#002), R.V. marg..md). Under these "porches" or
colonnades were usually a large number of infirm people waiting for the
"troubling of the water." It is usually identified with the modern
so-called Fountain of the Virgin, in the valley of the Kidron, and not
far from the Pool of Siloam (q.v.); and also with the Birket Israel, a
pool near the mouth of the valley which runs into the Kidron south of
"St. Stephen's Gate." Others again identify it with the twin pools
called the "Souterrains," under the convent of the Sisters of Zion,
situated in what must have been the rock-hewn ditch between Bezetha and
the fortress of Antonia. But quite recently Schick has discovered a
large tank, as sketched here, situated about 100 feet north-west of St.
Anne's Church, which is, as he contends, very probably the Pool of
Bethesda. No certainty as to its identification, however, has as yet
been arrived at. (See FOUNTAIN; GIHON.)
