<span id="000">**Ludim**</span> Probably the same as Lud (2) (Compare
[Gen 10:13](../kjv/gen010.htm#013); [Ch1 1:11](../kjv/ch1001.htm#011)).
They are associated ([Jer 46:9](../kjv/jer046.htm#009)) with African
nations as mercenaries of the king of Egypt.

<span id="001">**Luhith**</span> Made of boards, a Moabitish place
between Zoar and Horonaim ([Isa 15:5](../kjv/isa015.htm#005); [Jer
48:5](../kjv/jer048.htm#005)).

<span id="002">**Luke**</span> The evangelist, was a Gentile. The date
and circumstances of his conversion are unknown. According to his own
statement ([Luk 1:2](../kjv/luk001.htm#002)), he was not an "eye-witness
and minister of the word from the beginning." It is probable that he was
a physician in Troas, and was there converted by Paul, to whom he
attached himself. He accompanied him to Philippi, but did not there
share his imprisonment, nor did he accompany him further after his
release in his missionary journey at this time ([Act
17:1](../kjv/act017.htm#001)). On Paul's third visit to Philippi ([Act
20:5](../kjv/act020.htm#005), [Act 20:6](../kjv/act020.htm#006)) we
again meet with Luke, who probably had spent all the intervening time in
that city, a period of seven or eight years. From this time Luke was
Paul's constant companion during his journey to Jerusalem (Acts
20:6-21:18). He again disappears from view during Paul's imprisonment at
Jerusalem and Caesarea, and only reappears when Paul sets out for Rome
([Act 27:1](../kjv/act027.htm#001)), whither he accompanies him ([Act
28:2](../kjv/act028.htm#002), [Act 28:12](../kjv/act028.htm#012)), and
where he remains with him till the close of his first imprisonment ([Plm
1:24](../kjv/plm001.htm#024); [Col 4:14](../kjv/col004.htm#014)). The
last notice of the "beloved physician" is in [Ti2
4:11](../kjv/ti2004.htm#011). There are many passages in Paul's
epistles, as well as in the writings of Luke, which show the extent and
accuracy of his medical knowledge.

<span id="003">**Luke, Gospel According to**</span> Was written by Luke.
He does not claim to have been an eye-witness of our Lord's ministry,
but to have gone to the best sources of information within his reach,
and to have written an orderly narrative of the facts ([Luk
1:1](../kjv/luk001.htm#001)). The authors of the first three Gospels,
the synoptics, wrote independently of each other. Each wrote his
independent narrative under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Each writer
has some things, both in matter and style, peculiar to himself, yet all
the three have much in common. Luke's Gospel has been called "the Gospel
of the nations, full of mercy and hope, assured to the world by the love
of a suffering Saviour;" "the Gospel of the saintly life;" "the Gospel
for the Greeks; the Gospel of the future; the Gospel of progressive
Christianity, of the universality and gratuitousness of the gospel; the
historic Gospel; the Gospel of Jesus as the good Physician and the
Saviour of mankind;" the "Gospel of the Fatherhood of God and the
brotherhood of man;" "the Gospel of womanhood;" "the Gospel of the
outcast, of the Samaritan, the publican, the harlot, and the prodigal;"
"the Gospel of tolerance." The main characteristic of this Gospel, as
Farrar (Cambridge Bible, Luke, Introd.) remarks, is fitfully expressed
in the motto, "Who went about doing good, and healing all that were
oppressed of the devil" ([Act 10:38](../kjv/act010.htm#038); compare
[Luk 4:18](../kjv/luk004.htm#018)). Luke wrote for the "Hellenic world."
This Gospel is indeed "rich and precious." "Out of a total of 1151
verses, Luke has 389 in common with Matthew and Mark, 176 in common with
Matthew alone, 41 in common with Mark alone, leaving 544 peculiar to
himself. In many instances all three use identical language." (See
MATTHEW; MARK; GOSPELS.) There are seventeen of our Lord's parables
peculiar to this Gospel. (See Table Parables in the Gospels.) Luke also
records seven of our Lord's miracles which are omitted by Matthew and
Mark. (See Table Miracles Recorded in the Gospels.) The synoptical
Gospels are related to each other after the following scheme. If the
contents of each Gospel be represented by 100, then when compared this
result is obtained in the following table: Synoptic Gospels
Peculiarities Coincidences Total Mark 07 93 100 Matthew 42 58 100 Luke
59 41 100 That is, thirteen-fourteenths of Mark, four-sevenths of
Matthew, and two-fifths of Luke are taken up in describing the same
things in very similar language. Luke's style is more finished and
classical than that of Matthew and Mark. There is less in it of the
Hebrew idiom. He uses a few Latin words ([Luk
12:6](../kjv/luk012.htm#006); [Luk 7:41](../kjv/luk007.htm#041); [Luk
8:30](../kjv/luk008.htm#030); [Luk 11:33](../kjv/luk011.htm#033); [Luk
19:20](../kjv/luk019.htm#020)), but no Syriac or Hebrew words except
sikera , an exciting drink of the nature of wine, but not made of grapes
(from Heb. shakar , "he is intoxicated", [Lev
10:9](../kjv/lev010.htm#009)), probably palm wine. This Gospel contains
twenty-eight distinct references to the Old Testament. The date of its
composition is uncertain. It must have been written before the Acts, the
date of the composition of which is generally fixed at about 63 or 64
A.D.. This Gospel was written, therefore, probably about 60 or 63 A.D.,
when Luke may have been at Caesarea in attendance on Paul, who was then
a prisoner. Others have conjectured that it was written at Rome during
Paul's imprisonment there. But on this point no positive certainty can
be attained. It is commonly supposed that Luke wrote under the
direction, if not at the dictation of Paul. Many words and phrases are
common to both; see table: Compare With [Luk

<span id="004">**Lunatic**</span> Probably the same as epileptic, the
symptoms of which disease were supposed to be more aggravated as the
moon increased. In [Mat 4:24](../kjv/mat004.htm#024) "lunatics" are
distinguished from demoniacs. In [Mat 17:15](../kjv/mat017.htm#015) the
name "lunatic" is applied to one who is declared to have been possessed.
(See DAEMONIAC.)

<span id="005">**Lust**</span> Sinful longing; the inward sin which
leads to the falling away from God ([Rom 1:21](../kjv/rom001.htm#021)).
"Lust, the origin of sin, has its place in the heart, not of necessity,
but because it is the centre of all moral forces and impulses and of
spiritual activity." In [Mar 4:19](../kjv/mar004.htm#019) "lusts" are
objects of desire.

<span id="006">**Luz**</span> A nut-bearing tree, the almond. (1.) The
ancient name of a royal Canaanitish city near the site of Bethel ([Gen
28:19](../kjv/gen028.htm#019); [Gen 35:6](../kjv/gen035.htm#006)), on
the border of Benjamin ([Jos 18:13](../kjv/jos018.htm#013)). Here Jacob
halted, and had a prophetic vision. (See BETHEL.) (2.) A place in the
land of the Hittites, founded ([Jdg 1:26](../kjv/jdg001.htm#026)) by "a
man who came forth out of the city of Luz." It is identified with
Luweiziyeh, 4 miles north-west of Banias.

<span id="007">**Lycaonia**</span> An inland province of Asia Minor, on
the west of Cappadocia and the south of Galatia. It was a Roman
province, and its chief towns were Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe. The
"speech of Lycaonia" ([Act 14:11](../kjv/act014.htm#011)) was probably
the ancient Assyrian language, or perhaps, as others think, a corrupt
Greek intermingled with Syriac words. Paul preached in this region, and
revisited it ([Act 16:1](../kjv/act016.htm#001); [Act
18:23](../kjv/act018.htm#023); [Act 19:1](../kjv/act019.htm#001)).

<span id="008">**Lycia**</span> A wolf, a province in the south-west of
Asia Minor, opposite the island of Rhodes. It forms part of the region
now called Tekeh. It was a province of the Roman empire when visited by
Paul ([Act 21:1](../kjv/act021.htm#001); [Act
27:5](../kjv/act027.htm#005)). Two of its towns are mentioned, Patara
([Act 21:1](../kjv/act021.htm#001), [Act 21:2](../kjv/act021.htm#002))
and Myra ([Act 27:5](../kjv/act027.htm#005)).

<span id="009">**Lydda**</span> A town in the tribe of Ephraim,
mentioned only in the New Testament ([Act 9:32](../kjv/act009.htm#032),
[Act 9:35](../kjv/act009.htm#035), [Act 9:38](../kjv/act009.htm#038)) as
the scene of Peter's miracle in healing the paralytic Aeneas. It lay
about 9 miles east of Joppa, on the road from the sea-port to Jerusalem.
In the Old Testament ([Ch1 8:12](../kjv/ch1008.htm#012)) it is called
Lod. It was burned by the Romans, but was afterwards rebuilt, and was
known by the name of Diospolis. Its modern name is Ludd. The so-called
patron saint of England, St. George, is said to have been born here.
