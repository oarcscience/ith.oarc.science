<span id="000">**Uzza**</span> Strength, a garden in which Manasseh and
Amon were buried ([Kg2 21:18](../kjv/kg2021.htm#018), [Kg2
21:26](../kjv/kg2021.htm#026)). It was probably near the king's palace
in Jerusalem, or may have formed part of the palace grounds. Manasseh
may probably have acquired it from some one of this name.

<span id="001">**Uzzah**</span> Strength, a son of Abinadab, in whose
house the men of Kirjath-jearim placed the ark when it was brought back
from the land of the Philistines ([Sa1 7:1](../kjv/sa1007.htm#001)). He
with his brother Ahio drove the cart on which the ark was placed when
David sought to bring it up to Jerusalem. When the oxen stumbled, Uzzah,
in direct violation of the divine law ([Num
4:15](../kjv/num004.htm#015)), put forth his hand to steady the ark, and
was immediately smitten unto death. The place where this occurred was
henceforth called Perez-uzzah ([Ch1 13:11](../kjv/ch1013.htm#011)).
David on this feared to proceed further, and placed the ark in the house
of Obed-edom the Gittite ([Sa2 6:2](../kjv/sa2006.htm#002); [Ch1
13:6](../kjv/ch1013.htm#006)).

<span id="002">**Uzzen-sherah**</span> A town probably near Beth-horon.
It derived its name from the daughter of Ephraim ([Ch1
7:24](../kjv/ch1007.htm#024)).

<span id="003">**Uzzi**</span> The Lord is my strength. (1.) The son of
Bukki, and a descendant of Aaron ([Ch1 6:5](../kjv/ch1006.htm#005), [Ch1
6:51](../kjv/ch1006.htm#051); [Ezr 7:4](../kjv/ezr007.htm#004)). (2.) A
grandson of Issachar ([Ch1 7:2](../kjv/ch1007.htm#002), [Ch1
7:3](../kjv/ch1007.htm#003)). (3.) A son of Bela, and grandson of
Benjamin ([Ch1 7:7](../kjv/ch1007.htm#007)). (4.) A Benjamite, a chief
in the tribe ([Ch1 9:8](../kjv/ch1009.htm#008)). (5.) A son of Bani. He
had the oversight of the Levites after the return from captivity ([Neh
11:22](../kjv/neh011.htm#022)). (6.) The head of the house of Jedaiah,
one of "the chief of the priests" ([Neh 12:19](../kjv/neh012.htm#019)).
(7.) A priest who assisted in the dedication of the walls of Jerusalem
([Neh 12:42](../kjv/neh012.htm#042)).

<span id="004">**Uzziah**</span> A contracted form of Azariah the Lord
is my strength. (1.) One of Amaziah's sons, whom the people made king of
Judah in his father's stead ([Kg2 14:21](../kjv/kg2014.htm#021); [Ch2
26:1](../kjv/ch2026.htm#001)). His long reign of about fifty-two years
was "the most prosperous excepting that of Jehosaphat since the time of
Solomon." He was a vigorous and able ruler, and "his name spread abroad,
even to the entering in of Egypt" ([Ch2 26:8](../kjv/ch2026.htm#008),
[Ch2 26:14](../kjv/ch2026.htm#014)). In the earlier part of his reign,
under the influence of Zechariah, he was faithful to Jehovah, and "did
that which was right in the sight of the Lord" ([Kg2
15:3](../kjv/kg2015.htm#003); [Ch2 26:4](../kjv/ch2026.htm#004), [Ch2
26:5](../kjv/ch2026.htm#005)); but toward the close of his long life
"his heart was lifted up to his destruction," and he wantonly invaded
the priest's office ([Ch2 26:16](../kjv/ch2026.htm#016)), and entering
the sanctuary proceeded to offer incense on the golden altar. Azariah
the high priest saw the tendency of such a daring act on the part of the
king, and with a band of eighty priests he withstood him ([Ch2
26:17](../kjv/ch2026.htm#017)), saying, "It appertaineth not unto thee,
Uzziah, to burn incense." Uzziah was suddenly struck with leprosy while
in the act of offering incense ([Ch2 26:19](../kjv/ch2026.htm#019)), and
he was driven from the temple and compelled to reside in "a several
house" to the day of his death [Kg2 15:5](../kjv/kg2015.htm#005), [Kg2
15:27](../kjv/kg2015.htm#027); [Ch2 26:3](../kjv/ch2026.htm#003)). He
was buried in a separate grave "in the field of the burial which
belonged to the kings" ([Kg2 15:7](../kjv/kg2015.htm#007); [Ch2
26:23](../kjv/ch2026.htm#023)). "That lonely grave in the royal
necropolis would eloquently testify to coming generations that all
earthly monarchy must bow before the inviolable order of the divine
will, and that no interference could be tolerated with that unfolding of
the purposes of God, which, in the fulness of time, would reveal the
Christ, the true High Priest and King for evermore" (Dr. Green's Kingdom
of Israel, etc.). (2.) The father of Jehonathan, one of David's
overseers ([Ch1 27:25](../kjv/ch1027.htm#025)).

<span id="005">**Uzziel**</span> Strength of God. (1.) One of the sons
of Kohath, and uncle of Aaron ([Exo 6:18](../kjv/exo006.htm#018); [Lev
10:4](../kjv/lev010.htm#004)). (2.) A Simeonite captain ([Ch1
4:39](../kjv/ch1004.htm#039)). (3.) A son of Bela, and grandson of
Benjamin ([Ch1 7:7](../kjv/ch1007.htm#007)). (4.) One of the sons of
Heman ([Ch1 25:4](../kjv/ch1025.htm#004)); called also Azareel ([Ch1
25:18](../kjv/ch1025.htm#018)). (5.) A son of Jeduthan ([Ch2
29:14](../kjv/ch2029.htm#014)). (6.) The son of Harhaiah ([Neh
3:8](../kjv/neh003.htm#008)).

<span id="006">**Vagabond**</span> From Lat. vagabundus , "a wanderer,"
"a fugitive;" not used opprobriously ([Gen 4:12](../kjv/gen004.htm#012),
R.V., "wanderer;" [Psa 109:10](../kjv/psa109.htm#010); [Act
19:13](../kjv/act019.htm#013), R.V., "strolling").

<span id="007">**Vajezatha**</span> Purity; worthy of honour one of
Haman's sons, whom the Jews slew in the palace of Shushan ([Est
9:9](../kjv/est009.htm#009)).

<span id="008">**Valley**</span> (1.) Heb. bik'ah , a "cleft" of the
mountains ([Deu 8:7](../kjv/deu008.htm#007); [Deu
11:11](../kjv/deu011.htm#011); [Psa 104:8](../kjv/psa104.htm#008); [Isa
41:18](../kjv/isa041.htm#018)); also a low plain bounded by mountains,
as the plain of Lebanon at the foot of Hermon around the sources of the
Jordan ([Jos 11:17](../kjv/jos011.htm#017); [Jos
12:7](../kjv/jos012.htm#007)), and the valley of Megiddo ([Ch2
35:22](../kjv/ch2035.htm#022)). (2.) 'Emek , "deep;" "a long, low plain"
([Job 39:10](../kjv/job039.htm#010), [Job 39:21](../kjv/job039.htm#021);
[Psa 65:13](../kjv/psa065.htm#013); [Sol 2:1](../kjv/sol002.htm#001)),
such as the plain of Esdraelon; the "valley of giants" ([Jos
15:8](../kjv/jos015.htm#008)), usually translated "valley of Rephaim"
([Sa2 5:18](../kjv/sa2005.htm#018)); of Elah ([Sa1
17:2](../kjv/sa1017.htm#002)), of Berachah ([Ch2
20:26](../kjv/ch2020.htm#026)); the king's "dale" ([Gen
14:17](../kjv/gen014.htm#017)); of Jehoshaphat ([Joe
3:2](../kjv/joe003.htm#002), [Joe 3:12](../kjv/joe003.htm#012)), of
Achor ([Jos 7:24](../kjv/jos007.htm#024); [Isa
65:10](../kjv/isa065.htm#010)), Succoth ([Psa
60:6](../kjv/psa060.htm#006)), Ajalon ([Jos
10:12](../kjv/jos010.htm#012)), Jezreel ([Hos
1:5](../kjv/hos001.htm#005)). (3.) Ge , "a bursting," a "flowing
together," a narrow glen or ravine, such as the valley of the children
of Hinnom ([Kg2 23:10](../kjv/kg2023.htm#010)); of Eshcol ([Deu
1:24](../kjv/deu001.htm#024)); of Sorek ([Jdg
16:4](../kjv/jdg016.htm#004)), etc. The "valley of vision" ([Isa
22:1](../kjv/isa022.htm#001)) is usually regarded as denoting Jerusalem,
which "may be so called," says Barnes (Com. on Isa.), "either (1.)
because there were several valleys within the city and adjacent to it,
as the vale between Mount Zion and Moriah, the vale between Mount Moriah
and Mount Ophel, between these and Mount Bezetha, and the valley of
Jehoshaphat, the valley of the brook Kidron, etc., without the walls of
the city; or (2.) more probably it was called the valley in reference to
its being compassed with hills rising to a considerable elevation above
the city" ([Psa 125:2](../kjv/psa125.htm#002); compare also [Jer
21:13](../kjv/jer021.htm#013), where Jerusalem is called a "valley").
(3.) Heb. nahal , a wady or water-course ([Gen
26:19](../kjv/gen026.htm#019); [Sol 6:11](../kjv/sol006.htm#011)).

was deposed from her royal dignity because she refused to obey the king
when he desired her to appear in the banqueting hall of Shushan the
palace ([Est 1:10](../kjv/est001.htm#010)). (See ESTHER.)
