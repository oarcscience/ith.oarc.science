<span id="000">**Euodias**</span> A good journey, a female member of the
church at Philippi. She was one who laboured much with Paul in the
gospel. He exhorts her to be of one mind with Syntyche ([Phi
4:2](../kjv/phi004.htm#002).md). From this it seems they had been at
variance with each other.

<span id="001">**Euphrates**</span> Hebrew, Perath ; Assyrian, Purat ;
Persian cuneiform , Ufratush , whence Greek Euphrates , meaning "sweet
water." The Assyrian name means "the stream," or "the great stream." It
is generally called in the Bible simply "the river" ([Exo
23:31](../kjv/exo023.htm#031).md), or "the great river" ([Deu
1:7](../kjv/deu001.htm#007).md). The Euphrates is first mentioned in [Gen
2:14](../kjv/gen002.htm#014.md) as one of the rivers of Paradise. See map,
Showing Course of Euphrates It is next mentioned in connection with the
covenant which God entered into with Abraham ([Gen
15:18](../kjv/gen015.htm#018).md), when he promised to his descendants the
land from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates (compare [Deu
11:24](../kjv/deu011.htm#024); [Jos 1:4](../kjv/jos001.htm#004).md), a
covenant promise afterwards fulfilled in the extended conquests of David
([Sa2 8:2](../kjv/sa2008.htm#002); [Ch1 18:3](../kjv/ch1018.htm#003.md);
[Kg1 4:24](../kjv/kg1004.htm#024).md). It was then the boundary of the
kingdom to the north-east. In the ancient history of Assyria, and
Babylon, and Egypt many events are recorded in which mention is made of
the "great river." Just as the Nile represented in prophecy the power of
Egypt, so the Euphrates represented the Assyrian power ([Isa
8:7](../kjv/isa008.htm#007); [Jer 2:18](../kjv/jer002.htm#018).md). It is
by far the largest and most important of all the rivers of Western Asia.
From its source in the Armenian mountains to the Persian Gulf, into
which it empties itself, it has a course of about 1,700 miles. It has
two sources, (1.) the Frat or Kara-su (i.e., "the black river"), which
rises 25 miles north-east of Erzeroum; and (2.) the Muradchai (i.e.,
"the river of desire"), which rises near Ararat, on the northern slope
of Ala-tagh. At Kebban Maden, 400 miles from the source of the former,
and 270 from that of the latter, they meet and form the majestic stream,
which is at length joined by the Tigris at Koornah, after which it is
called Shat-el-Arab, which runs in a deep and broad stream for above 140
miles to the sea. It is estimated that the alluvium brought down by
these rivers encroaches on the sea at the rate of about one mile in
thirty years.

<span id="002">**Euroclydon**</span> South-east billow, the name of the
wind which blew in the Adriatic Gulf, and which struck the ship in which
Paul was wrecked on the coast of Malta ([Act
27:14](../kjv/act027.htm#014.md); R.V., "Euraquilo," i.e., north-east
wind). It is called a "tempestuous wind," i.e., as literally rendered, a
"typhonic wind," or a typhoon. It is the modern Gregalia or Levanter.
(Compare [Jon 1:4](../kjv/jon001.htm#004)..md)

<span id="003">**Eutychus**</span> Fortunate, ([Act
20:9](../kjv/act020.htm#009).md), a young man of Troas who fell through
drowsiness from the open window of the third floor of the house where
Paul was preaching, and was "taken up dead." The lattice-work of the
window being open to admit the air, the lad fell out and down to the
court below. Paul restored him to life again. (Compare [Kg1
17:21](../kjv/kg1017.htm#021); [Kg2 4:34](../kjv/kg2004.htm#034)..md)

<span id="004">**Evangelist**</span> A "publisher of glad tidings;" a
missionary preacher of the gospel ([Eph 4:11](../kjv/eph004.htm#011).md).
This title is applied to Philip ([Act 21:8](../kjv/act021.htm#008).md), who
appears to have gone from city to city preaching the word ([Act
8:4](../kjv/act008.htm#004), [Act 8:40](../kjv/act008.htm#040).md). Judging
from the case of Philip, evangelists had neither the authority of an
apostle, nor the gift of prophecy, nor the responsibility of pastoral
supervision over a portion of the flock. They were itinerant preachers,
having it as their special function to carry the gospel to places where
it was previously unknown. The writers of the four Gospels are known as
the Evangelists.

<span id="005">**Eve**</span> Life; living, the name given by Adam to
his wife ([Gen 3:20](../kjv/gen003.htm#020.md); [Gen
4:1](../kjv/gen004.htm#001).md). The account of her creation is given in
[Gen 2:21](../kjv/gen002.htm#021), [Gen 2:22](../kjv/gen002.htm#022.md).
The Creator, by declaring that it was not good for man to be alone, and
by creating for him a suitable companion, gave sanction to monogamy. The
commentator Matthew Henry says: "This companion was taken from his side
to signify that she was to be dear unto him as his own flesh. Not from
his head, lest she should rule over him; nor from his feet, lest he
should tyrannize over her; but from his side, to denote that species of
equality which is to subsist in the marriage state." And again, "That
wife that is of God's making by special grace, and of God's bringing by
special providence, is likely to prove a help-meet to her husband."
Through the subtle temptation of the serpent she violated the
commandment of God by taking of the forbidden fruit, which she gave also
unto her husband ([Ti1 2:13](../kjv/ti1002.htm#013.md); [Co2
11:3](../kjv/co2011.htm#003).md). When she gave birth to her first son, she
said, "I have gotten a man from the Lord" (R.V., "I have gotten a man
with the help of the Lord," [Gen 4:1](../kjv/gen004.htm#001).md). Thus she
welcomed Cain, as some think, as if he had been the Promised One the
"Seed of the woman."

<span id="006">**Evening**</span> The period following sunset with which
the Jewish day began ([Gen 1:5](../kjv/gen001.htm#005.md); [Mar
13:35](../kjv/mar013.htm#035).md). The Hebrews reckoned two evenings of
each day, as appears from [Exo 16:12](../kjv/exo016.htm#012.md) : [Exo
30:8](../kjv/exo030.htm#008); [Exo 12:6](../kjv/exo012.htm#006) (marg..md);
[Lev 23:5](../kjv/lev023.htm#005.md) (marg. R.V., "between the two
evenings"). The "first evening" was that period when the sun was verging
towards setting, and the "second evening" the moment of actual sunset.
The word "evenings" in [Jer 5:6](../kjv/jer005.htm#006.md) should be
"deserts" (marg. R.V.).

<span id="007">**Everlasting**</span> Eternal, applied to God ([Gen
21:33](../kjv/gen021.htm#033); [Deu 33:27](../kjv/deu033.htm#027.md); [Psa
41:13](../kjv/psa041.htm#013); [Psa 90:2](../kjv/psa090.htm#002).md). We
also read of the "everlasting hills" ([Gen
49:26](../kjv/gen049.htm#026).md); an "everlasting priesthood" ([Exo
40:15](../kjv/exo040.htm#015); [Num 25:13](../kjv/num025.htm#013).md). (See
ETERNAL.)

<span id="008">**Evil eye**</span> ([Pro 23:6](../kjv/pro023.htm#006).md),
figuratively, the envious or covetous. (Compare [Deu
15:9](../kjv/deu015.htm#009); [Mat 20:15](../kjv/mat020.htm#015)..md)

<span id="009">**Evil-merodach**</span> Merodach's man, the son and
successor of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon ([Kg2
25:27](../kjv/kg2025.htm#027); [Jer 52:31](../kjv/jer052.htm#031.md), [Jer
52:34](../kjv/jer052.htm#034).md). He seems to have reigned but two years
(562-560 B.C.). Influenced probably by Daniel, he showed kindness to
Jehoiachin, who had been a prisoner in Babylon for thirty-seven years.
He released him, and "spoke kindly to him." He was murdered by
Nergal-sharezer = Neriglissar, his brother-in-law, who succeeded him
([Jer 39:3](../kjv/jer039.htm#003), [Jer 39:13](../kjv/jer039.htm#013).md).
