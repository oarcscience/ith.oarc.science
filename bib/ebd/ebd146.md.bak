<span id="000">**Gennesaret**</span> A garden of riches. (1.) A town of
Naphtali, called Chinnereth ([Jos 19:35](../kjv/jos019.htm#035).md),
sometimes in the plural form Chinneroth ([Jos
11:2](../kjv/jos011.htm#002).md). In later times the name was gradually
changed to Genezar and Gennesaret ([Luk 5:1](../kjv/luk005.htm#001).md).
This city stood on the western shore of the lake to which it gave its
name. No trace of it remains. The plain of Gennesaret has been called,
from its fertility and beauty, "the Paradise of Galilee." It is now
called el-Ghuweir. (2.) The Lake of Gennesaret, the Grecized form of
CHINNERETH (q.v.). (See GALILEE, SEA OF.)

<span id="001">**Gentiles**</span> (Heb., usually in plural, goyim),
meaning in general all nations except the Jews. In course of time, as
the Jews began more and more to pride themselves on their peculiar
privileges, it acquired unpleasant associations, and was used as a term
of contempt. In the New Testament the Greek word Hellenes , meaning
literally Greek (as in [Act 16:1](../kjv/act016.htm#001.md), [Act
16:3](../kjv/act016.htm#003); [Act 18:17](../kjv/act018.htm#017.md); [Rom
1:14](../kjv/rom001.htm#014).md), generally denotes any non-Jewish nation.

<span id="002">**Genubath**</span> Theft, the son of Hadad, of the
Edomitish royal family. He was brought up in Pharaoh's household. His
mother was a sister of Tahpenes, the king of Egypt's wife, mentioned in
[Kg1 11:20](../kjv/kg1011.htm#020.md).

<span id="003">**Gera**</span> Grain. (1.) The son of Bela and grandson
of Benjamin ([Ch1 8:3](../kjv/ch1008.htm#003.md), [Ch1
8:5](../kjv/ch1008.htm#005), [Ch1 8:7](../kjv/ch1008.htm#007)). (2..md) The
father of Ehud the judge ([Jdg 3:15](../kjv/jdg003.htm#015)). (3..md) The
father of Shimei, who so grossly abused David ([Sa2
16:5](../kjv/sa2016.htm#005); [Sa2 19:16](../kjv/sa2019.htm#016.md), [Sa2
19:18](../kjv/sa2019.htm#018).md).

<span id="004">**Gerah**</span> A bean, probably of the carob tree, the
smallest weight, and also the smallest piece of money, among the
Hebrews, equal to the twentieth part of a shekel ([Exo
30:13](../kjv/exo030.htm#013); [Lev 27:25](../kjv/lev027.htm#025.md); [Num
3:47](../kjv/num003.htm#047).md). This word came into use in the same way
as our word "grain," from a grain of wheat.

<span id="005">**Gerar**</span> A region; lodging-place, a very ancient
town and district in the south border of Palestine, which was ruled over
by a king named Abimelech ([Gen 10:19](../kjv/gen010.htm#019.md); [Gen
20:1](../kjv/gen020.htm#001), [Gen 20:2](../kjv/gen020.htm#002).md).
Abraham sojourned here, and perhaps Isaac was born in this place. Both
of these patriarchs were guilty of the sin of here denying their wives,
and both of them entered into a treaty with the king before they
departed to Beersheba ([Gen 21:23](../kjv/gen021.htm#023); 26.md). It seems
to have been a rich pastoral country ([Ch2
14:12](../kjv/ch2014.htm#012).md). Isaac here reaped an hundred-fold, and
was blessed of God ([Gen 26:12](../kjv/gen026.htm#012).md). The "valley of
Gerar" ([Gen 26:17](../kjv/gen026.htm#017).md) was probably the modern Wady
el-Jerdr.

<span id="006">**Gergesa**</span> =Gerasa identified with the modern
Khersa, "over against Galilee," close to the lake. This was probably the
scene of the miracle, Mark 5:1-20, etc. "From the base of the great
plateau of Bashan, 2,000 feet or more overhead, the ground slopes down
steeply, in places precipitously, to the shore. And at the foot of the
declivity a bold spur runs out to the water's edge. By it the frantic
swine would rush on headlong into the lake and perish." Porter's Through
Samaria. (See GADARA.)

<span id="007">**Gerizim**</span> A mountain of Samaria, about 3,000
feet above the Mediterranean. It was on the left of the valley
containing the ancient town of Shechem (q.v.), on the way to Jerusalem.
It stood over against Mount Ebal, the summits of these mountains being
distant from each other about 2 miles (Deut. 27; [Jos
8:30](../kjv/jos008.htm#030).md). On the slopes of this mountain the tribes
descended from the handmaids of Leah and Rachel, together with the tribe
of Reuben, were gathered together, and gave the responses to the
blessing pronounced as the reward of obedience, when Joshua in the
valley below read the whole law in the hearing of all the people; as
those gathered on Ebal responded with a loud Amen to the rehearsal of
the curses pronounced on the disobedient. It was probably at this time
that the coffin containing the embalmed body of Joseph was laid in the
"parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor" ([Gen
33:19](../kjv/gen033.htm#019); [Gen 50:25](../kjv/gen050.htm#025).md).
Josephus relates (Ant. [Jos 11:8](../kjv/jos011.htm#008.md), [Jos
11:2](../kjv/jos011.htm#002).md) that Sanballat built a temple for the
Samaritans on this mountain, and instituted a priesthood, as rivals to
those of the Jews at Jerusalem. This temple was destroyed after it had
stood two hundred years. It was afterwards rebuilt by Herod the Great.
There is a Samaritan tradition that it was the scene of the incident
recorded in Gen. 22. There are many ruins on this mountain, some of
which are evidently of Christian buildings. To this mountain the woman
of Sychar referred in [Joh 4:20](../kjv/joh004.htm#020.md). For centuries
Gerizim was the centre of political outbreaks. The Samaritans (q.v.), a
small but united body, still linger here, and keep up their ancient
ceremonial worship.

<span id="008">**Gershom**</span> Expulsion. (1.) The eldest son of Levi
([Ch1 6:16](../kjv/ch1006.htm#016), [Ch1 6:17](../kjv/ch1006.htm#017.md),
[Ch1 6:20](../kjv/ch1006.htm#020), [Ch1 6:43](../kjv/ch1006.htm#043.md),
[Ch1 6:62](../kjv/ch1006.htm#062), [Ch1 6:71](../kjv/ch1006.htm#071.md);
[Ch1 15:7](../kjv/ch1015.htm#007)) = GERSHON (q.v.). (2..md) The elder of
the two sons of Moses born to him in Midian ([Exo
2:22](../kjv/exo002.htm#022); [Exo 18:3](../kjv/exo018.htm#003).md). On his
way to Egypt with his family, in obedience to the command of the Lord,
Moses was attacked by a sudden and dangerous illness ([Joh
4:24](../kjv/joh004.htm#024).md), which Zipporah his wife believed to have
been sent because he had neglected to circumcise his son. She
accordingly took a "sharp stone" and circumcised her son Gershom,
saying, "Surely a bloody husband art thou to me", i.e., by the blood of
her child she had, as it were, purchased her husband, had won him back
again. (3.) A descendant of Phinehas who returned with Ezra from Babylon
([Ezr 8:2](../kjv/ezr008.htm#002)). (4..md) The son of Manasseh ([Jdg
18:30](../kjv/jdg018.htm#030).md), in R.V. "of Moses."

<span id="009">**Gershon**</span> =Gershom expulsion, the eldest of
Levi's three sons ([Gen 46:11](../kjv/gen046.htm#011.md); [Exo
6:16](../kjv/exo006.htm#016).md). In the wilderness the sons of Gershon had
charge of the fabrics of the tabernacle when it was moved from place to
place, the curtains, veils, tent-hangings ([Num
3:21](../kjv/num003.htm#021).md). Thirteen Levitical cities fell to the lot
of the Gershonites ([Jos 21:27](../kjv/jos021.htm#027).md).
