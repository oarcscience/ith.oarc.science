<span id="000">**Merari**</span> Sad; bitter, the youngest son of Levi,
born before the descent of Jacob into Egypt, and one of the seventy who
accompanied him thither ([Gen 46:11](../kjv/gen046.htm#011); [Exo
6:16](../kjv/exo006.htm#016)). He became the head of one of the great
divisions of the Levites ([Exo 6:19](../kjv/exo006.htm#019)). (See
MERARITES.)

<span id="001">**Merarites**</span> The descendants of Merari ([Num
26:57](../kjv/num026.htm#057)). They with the Gershonites and the
Kohathites had charge of the tabernacle, which they had to carry from
place to place ([Num 3:20](../kjv/num003.htm#020), [Num
3:33](../kjv/num003.htm#033); [Num 4:29](../kjv/num004.htm#029)). In the
distribution of the oxen and wagons offered by the princes (Num. 7),
Moses gave twice as many to the Merarites (four wagons and eight oxen)
as he gave to the Gershonites, because the latter had to carry only the
lighter furniture of the tabernacle, such as the curtains, hangings,
etc., while the former had to carry the heavier portion, as the boards,
bars, sockets, pillars, etc., and consequently needed a greater supply
of oxen and wagons. This is a coincidence illustrative of the truth of
the narrative. Their place in marching and in the camp was on the north
of the tabernacle. The Merarites afterwards took part with the other
Levitical families in the various functions of their office ([Ch1
23:6](../kjv/ch1023.htm#006), [Ch1 23:21](../kjv/ch1023.htm#021); [Ch2
29:12](../kjv/ch2029.htm#012), [Ch2 29:13](../kjv/ch2029.htm#013)).
Twelve cities with their suburbs were assigned to them ([Jos
21:7](../kjv/jos021.htm#007), [Jos 21:34](../kjv/jos021.htm#034)).

<span id="002">**Merathaim**</span> Double rebellion, probably a
symbolical name given to Babylon ([Jer 50:21](../kjv/jer050.htm#021)),
denoting rebellion exceeding that of other nations.

<span id="003">**Merchant**</span> The Hebrew word so rendered is from a
root meaning "to travel about," "to migrate," and hence "a traveler." In
the East, in ancient times, merchants traveled about with their
merchandise from place to place ([Gen 37:25](../kjv/gen037.htm#025);
[Job 6:18](../kjv/job006.htm#018)), and carried on their trade mainly by
bartering ([Gen 37:28](../kjv/gen037.htm#028); [Gen
39:1](../kjv/gen039.htm#001)). After the Hebrews became settled in
Palestine they began to engage in commercial pursuits, which gradually
expanded ([Gen 49:13](../kjv/gen049.htm#013); [Deu
33:18](../kjv/deu033.htm#018); [Jdg 5:17](../kjv/jdg005.htm#017)), till
in the time of Solomon they are found in the chief marts of the world
([Kg1 9:26](../kjv/kg1009.htm#026); [Kg1 10:11](../kjv/kg1010.htm#011),
[Kg1 10:26](../kjv/kg1010.htm#026), [Kg1 10:28](../kjv/kg1010.htm#028);
[Kg1 22:48](../kjv/kg1022.htm#048); [Ch2 1:16](../kjv/ch2001.htm#016);
[Ch2 9:10](../kjv/ch2009.htm#010), [Ch2 9:21](../kjv/ch2009.htm#021)).
After Solomon's time their trade with foreign nations began to decline.
After the Exile it again expanded into wider foreign relations, because
now the Jews were scattered in many lands.

<span id="004">**Mercurius**</span> The Hermes (i.e., "the speaker") of
the Greeks ([Act 14:12](../kjv/act014.htm#012)), a heathen God
represented as the constant attendant of Jupiter, and the god of
eloquence. The inhabitants of Lystra took Paul for this god because he
was the "chief speaker."

<span id="005">**Mercy**</span> Compassion for the miserable. Its object
is misery. By the atoning sacrifice of Christ a way is open for the
exercise of mercy towards the sons of men, in harmony with the demands
of truth and righteousness ([Gen 19:19](../kjv/gen019.htm#019); [Exo
20:6](../kjv/exo020.htm#006); [Exo 34:6](../kjv/exo034.htm#006), [Exo
34:7](../kjv/exo034.htm#007); [Psa 85:10](../kjv/psa085.htm#010); [Psa
86:15](../kjv/psa086.htm#015), [Psa 86:16](../kjv/psa086.htm#016)). In
Christ mercy and truth meet together. Mercy is also a Christian grace
([Mat 5:7](../kjv/mat005.htm#007); [Mat 18:33](../kjv/mat018.htm#033)).

<span id="006">**Mercy-seat**</span> (Heb. kapporeth , a "covering;"
LXX. and N.T., hilasterion ; Vulg., propitiatorium ), the covering or
lid of the ark of the covenant (q.v.). It was of acacia wood, overlaid
with gold, or perhaps rather a plate of solid gold, 2 1/2 cubits long
and 1 1/2 broad ([Exo 25:17](../kjv/exo025.htm#017); [Exo
30:6](../kjv/exo030.htm#006); [Exo 31:7](../kjv/exo031.htm#007)). It is
compared to the throne of grace ([Heb 9:5](../kjv/heb009.htm#005); [Eph
2:6](../kjv/eph002.htm#006)). The holy of holies is called the "place of
the mercy-seat" ([Ch1 28:11](../kjv/ch1028.htm#011); [Lev
16:2](../kjv/lev016.htm#002)). It has been conjectured that the censer
(thumiaterion, meaning "anything having regard to or employed in the
burning of incense") mentioned in [Heb 9:4](../kjv/heb009.htm#004) was
the "mercy-seat," at which the incense was burned by the high priest on
the great day of atonement, and upon or toward which the blood of the
goat was sprinkled ([Lev 16:11](../kjv/lev016.htm#011); compare [Num
7:89](../kjv/num007.htm#089) and [Exo 25:22](../kjv/exo025.htm#022)).

<span id="007">**Mered**</span> Rebellion, one of the sons of Ezra, of
the tribe of Judah ([Ch1 4:17](../kjv/ch1004.htm#017)).

<span id="008">**Meremoth**</span> Exaltations, heights, a priest who
returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel ([Neh
12:3](../kjv/neh012.htm#003)), to whom were sent the sacred vessels
([Ezr 8:33](../kjv/ezr008.htm#033)) belonging to the temple. He took
part in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem ([Neh
3:4](../kjv/neh003.htm#004)).

<span id="009">**Meribah**</span> Quarrel or strife. (1.) One of the
names given by Moses to the fountain in the desert of Sin, near
Rephidim, which issued from the rock in Horeb, which he smote by the
divine command, "because of the chiding of the children of Israel" ([Exo
17:1](../kjv/exo017.htm#001)). It was also called Massah (q.v.). It was
probably in Wady Feiran, near Mount Serbal. (2.) Another fountain having
a similar origin in the desert of Zin, near to Kadesh ([Num
27:14](../kjv/num027.htm#014). The two places are mentioned together in
[Deu 33:8](../kjv/deu033.htm#008). Some think the one place is called by
the two names ([Psa 81:7](../kjv/psa081.htm#007)). In smiting the rock
at this place Moses showed the same impatience as the people ([Num
20:10](../kjv/num020.htm#010)). This took place near the close of the
wanderings in the desert (Num. 20:1-24; [Deu
32:51](../kjv/deu032.htm#051)).
