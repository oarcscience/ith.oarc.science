<P><A NAME="000"><B>Eleazar</B></A>     God has helped.     (1.) The third son of Aaron (<A HREF="../kjv/exo006.htm#023">Exo 6:23</A>). His wife, a daughter of Putiel, bore him Phinehas (<A HREF="../kjv/exo006.htm#025">Exo 6:25</A>). After the death of Nadab and Abihu (<A HREF="../kjv/lev010.htm#012">Lev 10:12</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/num003.htm#004">Num 3:4</A>) he was appointed to the charge of the sanctuary (<A HREF="../kjv/num003.htm#032">Num 3:32</A>). On Mount Hor he was clothed with the sacred vestments, which Moses took from off his brother Aaron and put upon him as successor to his father in the high priest's office, which he held for more than twenty years (<A HREF="../kjv/num020.htm#025">Num 20:25</A>). He took part with Moses in numbering the people (<A HREF="../kjv/num026.htm#003">Num 26:3</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/num026.htm#004">Num 26:4</A>), and assisted at the inauguration of Joshua. He assisted in the distribution of the land after the conquest (<A HREF="../kjv/jos014.htm#001">Jos 14:1</A>). The high-priesthood remained in his family till the time of Eli, into whose family it passed, till it was restored to the family of Eleazar in the person of Zadok (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1002.htm#035">Sa1 2:35</A>; compare <A HREF="../kjv/kg1002.htm#027">Kg1 2:27</A>). &quot;And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/jos024.htm#033">Jos 24:33</A>). The word here rendered &quot;hill&quot; is Gibeah, the name of several towns in Palestine which were generally on or near a hill. The words may be more suitably rendered, &quot;They buried him in Gibeah of Phinehas&quot;, i.e., in the city of Phinehas, which has been identified, in accordance with Jewish and Samaritan traditions, with Kefr Ghuweirah =  'Awertah , about 7 miles north of Shiloh, and a few miles south-east of Nablus. &quot;His tomb is still shown there, overshadowed by venerable terebinths.&quot; Others, however, have identified it with the village of Gaba or Gebena of Eusebius, the modern Khurbet Jibia, 5 miles north of Guphna towards Nablus. (2.) An inhabitant of Kirjath-jearim who was &quot;sanctified&quot; to take charge of the ark, although not allowed to touch it, while it remained in the house of his father Abinadab (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1007.htm#001">Sa1 7:1</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1007.htm#002">Sa1 7:2</A>; compare <A HREF="../kjv/num003.htm#031">Num 3:31</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/num004.htm#015">Num 4:15</A>). (3.) The son of Dodo the Ahohite, of the tribe of Benjamin, one of the three most eminent of David's thirty-seven heroes (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1011.htm#012">Ch1 11:12</A>) who broke through the Philistine host and brought him water from the well of Bethlehem (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2023.htm#009">Sa2 23:9</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa2023.htm#016">Sa2 23:16</A>). (4.) A son of Phinehas associated with the priests in taking charge of the sacred vessels brought back to Jerusalem after the Exile (<A HREF="../kjv/ezr008.htm#033">Ezr 8:33</A>). (5.) A Levite of the family of Merari (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1023.htm#021">Ch1 23:21</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/ch1023.htm#022">Ch1 23:22</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Election of Grace</B></A>     The Scripture speaks     (1.) of the election of individuals to office or to honour and privilege, e.g., Abraham, Jacob, Saul, David, Solomon, were all chosen by God for the positions they held; so also were the apostles. (2.) There is also an election of nations to special privileges, e.g., the Hebrews (<A HREF="../kjv/deu007.htm#006">Deu 7:6</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/rom009.htm#004">Rom 9:4</A>). (3.) But in addition there is an election of individuals to eternal life (<A HREF="../kjv/th2002.htm#013">Th2 2:13</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/eph001.htm#004">Eph 1:4</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/pe1001.htm#002">Pe1 1:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/joh013.htm#018">Joh 13:18</A>).    The ground of this election to salvation is the good pleasure of God (<A HREF="../kjv/eph001.htm#005">Eph 1:5</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/eph001.htm#011">Eph 1:11</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat011.htm#025">Mat 11:25</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/mat011.htm#026">Mat 11:26</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/joh015.htm#016">Joh 15:16</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/joh015.htm#019">Joh 15:19</A>). God claims the right so to do (<A HREF="../kjv/rom009.htm#016">Rom 9:16</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/rom009.htm#021">Rom 9:21</A>). It is not conditioned on faith or repentance, but is of sovereign grace (<A HREF="../kjv/rom011.htm#004">Rom 11:4</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/eph001.htm#003">Eph 1:3</A>). All that pertain to salvation, the means (<A HREF="../kjv/eph002.htm#008">Eph 2:8</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/th2002.htm#013">Th2 2:13</A>) as well as the end, are of God (<A HREF="../kjv/act005.htm#031">Act 5:31</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ti2002.htm#025">Ti2 2:25</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/co1001.htm#030">Co1 1:30</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/eph002.htm#005">Eph 2:5</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/eph002.htm#010">Eph 2:10</A>). Faith and repentance and all other graces are the exercises of a regenerated soul; and regeneration is God's work, a &quot;new creature.&quot; Men are elected &quot;to salvation,&quot; &quot;to the adoption of sons,&quot; &quot;to be holy and without blame before him in love&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/th2002.htm#013">Th2 2:13</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gal004.htm#004">Gal 4:4</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gal004.htm#005">Gal 4:5</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/eph001.htm#004">Eph 1:4</A>). The ultimate end of election is the praise of God's grace (<A HREF="../kjv/eph001.htm#006">Eph 1:6</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/eph001.htm#012">Eph 1:12</A>). (See PREDESTINATION.)

<P><A NAME="002"><B>Elect lady</B></A>     To whom the Second Epistle of John is addressed (<A HREF="../kjv/jo2001.htm#001">Jo2 1:1</A>). Some think that the word rendered &quot;lady&quot; is a proper name, and thus that the expression should be &quot;elect Kyria.&quot; 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>El-elohe-Isreal</B></A>     Mighty one; God of Israel, the name which Jacob gave to the alter which he erected on the piece of land where he pitched his tent before Shechem, and which he afterwards purchased from the sons of Hamor (<A HREF="../kjv/gen033.htm#020">Gen 33:20</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Elements</B></A>     In its primary sense, as denoting the first principles or constituents of things, it is used in <A HREF="../kjv/pe2003.htm#010">Pe2 3:10</A> : &quot;The elements shall be dissolved.&quot; In a secondary sense it denotes the first principles of any art or science. In this sense it is used in <A HREF="../kjv/gal004.htm#003">Gal 4:3</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gal004.htm#009">Gal 4:9</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/col002.htm#008">Col 2:8</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/col002.htm#020">Col 2:20</A>, where the expressions, &quot;elements of the world,&quot; &quot;week and beggarly elements,&quot; denote that state of religious knowledge existing among the Jews before the coming of Christ, the rudiments of religious teaching. They are &quot;of the world,&quot; because they are made up of types which appeal to the senses. They are &quot;weak,&quot; because insufficient; and &quot;beggarly,&quot; or &quot;poor,&quot; because they are dry and barren, not being accompanied by an outpouring of spiritual gifts and graces, as the gospel is. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Elephant</B></A>     Not found in Scripture except indirectly in the original Greek word ( elephantinos ) translated &quot;of ivory&quot; in <A HREF="../kjv/rev018.htm#012">Rev 18:12</A>, and in the Hebrew word ( shenhabim , meaning &quot;elephant's tooth&quot;) rendered &quot;ivory&quot; in <A HREF="../kjv/kg1010.htm#022">Kg1 10:22</A> and <A HREF="../kjv/ch2009.htm#021">Ch2 9:21</A>. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Elhanan</B></A>     Whom God has graciously bestowed.     (1.) A warrior of the time of David famed for his exploits. In the Authorized Version (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2021.htm#019">Sa2 21:19</A>) it is recorded that &quot;Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath.&quot; The Revised Version here rightly omits the words &quot;the brother of.&quot; They were introduced in the Authorized Version to bring this passage into agreement with <A HREF="../kjv/ch1020.htm#005">Ch1 20:5</A>, where it is said that he &quot;slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath.&quot; Goliath the Gittite was killed by David (1 Sam. 17). The exploit of Elhanan took place late in David's reign. (2.) The son of Dodo, and one of David's warriors (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2023.htm#024">Sa2 23:24</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Eli</B></A>      (1.) Ascent - the high priest when the ark was at Shiloh (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1001.htm#003">Sa1 1:3</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1001.htm#009">Sa1 1:9</A>). He was the first of the line of Ithamar, Aaron's fourth son (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1024.htm#003">Ch1 24:3</A>; compare <A HREF="../kjv/sa2008.htm#017">Sa2 8:17</A>), who held that office. The office remained in his family till the time of Abiathar (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1002.htm#026">Kg1 2:26</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/kg1002.htm#027">Kg1 2:27</A>), whom Solomon deposed, and appointed Zadok, of the family of Eleazar, in his stead (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1002.htm#035">Kg1 2:35</A>). He acted also as a civil judge in Israel after the death of Samson (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1004.htm#018">Sa1 4:18</A>), and judged Israel for forty years. His sons Hophni and Phinehas grossly misconducted themselves, to the great disgust of the people (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1002.htm#027">Sa1 2:27</A>). They were licentious reprobates. He failed to reprove them so sternly as he ought to have done, and so brought upon his house the judgment of God (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1002.htm#022">Sa1 2:22</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa1003.htm#018">Sa1 3:18</A>). The Israelites proclaimed war against the Philistines, whose army was encamped at Aphek. The battle, fought a short way beyond Mizpeh, ended in the total defeat of Israel. Four thousand of them fell in &quot;battle array&quot;. They now sought safety in having the &quot;ark of the covenant of the Lord&quot; among them. They fetched it from Shiloh, and Hophni and Phinehas accompanied it. This was the first time since the settlement of Israel in Canaan that the ark had been removed from the sanctuary. The Philistines put themselves again in array against Israel, and in the battle which ensued &quot;Israel was smitten, and there was a very great slaughter.&quot; The tidings of this great disaster were speedily conveyed to Shiloh, about 20 miles distant, by a messenger, a Benjamite from the army. There Eli sat outside the gate of the sanctuary by the wayside, anxiously waiting for tidings from the battle-field. The full extent of the national calamity was speedily made known to him: &quot;Israel is fled before the Philistines, there has also been a great slaughter among the people, thy two sons Hophni and Phinehas are dead, and the ark of God is taken&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1004.htm#012">Sa1 4:12</A>). When the old man, whose eyes were &quot;stiffened&quot; (i.e., fixed, as of a blind eye unaffected by the light) with age, heard this sad story of woe, he fell backward from off his seat and died, being ninety and eight years old. (See ITHAMAR.) (2.) Heb.  eli , &quot;my God&quot;, (<A HREF="../kjv/mat027.htm#046">Mat 27:46</A>), an exclamation used by Christ on the cross. Mark (<A HREF="../kjv/mar015.htm#034">Mar 15:34</A>), as usual, gives the original Aramaic form of the word, Eloi.

<P><A NAME="008"><B>Eliab</B></A>     To whom God is father.     (1.) A Reubenite, son of Pallu (<A HREF="../kjv/num016.htm#001">Num 16:1</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/num016.htm#012">Num 16:12</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/num026.htm#008">Num 26:8</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/num026.htm#009">Num 26:9</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/deu011.htm#006">Deu 11:6</A>). (2.) A son of Helon, and chief of the tribe of Zebulun at the time of the census in the wilderness (<A HREF="../kjv/num001.htm#009">Num 1:9</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/num002.htm#007">Num 2:7</A>). (3.) The son of Jesse, and brother of David (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1016.htm#006">Sa1 16:6</A>). It was he who spoke contemptuously to David when he proposed to fight Goliath (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1017.htm#028">Sa1 17:28</A>). (4.) One of the Gadite heroes who joined David in his stronghold in the wilderness (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1012.htm#009">Ch1 12:9</A>).

A mighty man of war, a Benjamite (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2017.htm#017">Ch2 17:17</A>). (3.) An Aramite of Zobah, captain of a marauding band that troubled Solomon (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1011.htm#023">Kg1 11:23</A>).
