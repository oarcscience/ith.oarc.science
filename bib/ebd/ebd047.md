<span id="000">**Bastard**</span> In the Old Testament the rendering of
the Hebrew word mamzer' , which means "polluted." In [Deu
23:2](../kjv/deu023.htm#002.md), it occurs in the ordinary sense of
illegitimate offspring. In [Zac 9:6](../kjv/zac009.htm#006.md), the word is
used in the sense of foreigner. From the history of Jephthah we learn
that there were bastard offspring among the Jews ([Jdg
11:1](../kjv/jdg011.htm#001)). In [Heb 12:8](../kjv/heb012.htm#008.md), the
word (Gr. nothoi ) is used in its ordinary sense, and denotes those who
do not share the privileges of God's children.

<span id="001">**Bastinado**</span> Beating, a mode of punishment common
in the East. It is referred to by "the rod of correction" ([Pro
22:15](../kjv/pro022.htm#015).md), "scourging" ([Lev
19:20](../kjv/lev019.htm#020).md), "chastising" ([Deu
22:18](../kjv/deu022.htm#018).md). The number of blows could not exceed
forty ([Deu 25:2](../kjv/deu025.htm#002.md), [Deu
25:3](../kjv/deu025.htm#003).md).

<span id="002">**Bat**</span> The Hebrew word ( atalleph' ) so rendered
([Lev 11:19](../kjv/lev011.htm#019); [Deu 14:18](../kjv/deu014.htm#018).md)
implies "flying in the dark." The bat is reckoned among the birds in the
list of unclean animals. To cast idols to the "moles and to the bats"
means to carry them into dark caverns or desolate places to which these
animals resort ([Isa 2:20](../kjv/isa002.htm#020).md), i.e., to consign
them to desolation or ruin.

<span id="003">**Bath**</span> A Hebrew liquid measure, the tenth part
of an homer ([Kg1 7:26](../kjv/kg1007.htm#026.md), [Kg1
7:38](../kjv/kg1007.htm#038); [Eze 45:10](../kjv/eze045.htm#010.md), [Eze
45:14](../kjv/eze045.htm#014).md). It contained 8 gallons 3 quarts of our
measure. "Ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath" ([Isa
5:10](../kjv/isa005.htm#010).md) denotes great unproductiveness.

<span id="004">**Baths**</span> The use of the bath was very frequent
among the Hebrews ([Lev 14:8](../kjv/lev014.htm#008.md); [Num
19:19](../kjv/num019.htm#019), etc..md). The high priest at his
inauguration ([Lev 8:6](../kjv/lev008.htm#006).md), and on the day of
atonement, was required to bathe himself ([Lev
16:4](../kjv/lev016.htm#004), [Lev 16:24](../kjv/lev016.htm#024).md). The
"pools" mentioned in [Neh 3:15](../kjv/neh003.htm#015.md), [Neh
3:16](../kjv/neh003.htm#016), [Kg2 20:20](../kjv/kg2020.htm#020.md), [Isa
22:11](../kjv/isa022.htm#011), [Joh 9:7](../kjv/joh009.htm#007.md), were
public bathing-places.

<span id="005">**Bath-rabbim**</span> Daughter of many, the name of one
of the gates of the city of Heshbon, near which were pools ([Sol
7:4](../kjv/sol007.htm#004).md).

<span id="006">**Bath-sheba**</span> Daughter of the oath, or of seven,
called also Bath-shu'a ([Ch1 3:5](../kjv/ch1003.htm#005).md), was the
daughter of Eliam ([Sa2 11:3](../kjv/sa2011.htm#003).md) or Ammiel ([Ch1
3:5](../kjv/ch1003.htm#005).md), and wife of Uriah the Hittite. David
committed adultery with her ([Sa2 11:4](../kjv/sa2011.htm#004.md), [Sa2
11:5](../kjv/sa2011.htm#005); Ps. 51, title.md). The child born in adultery
died ([Sa2 12:15](../kjv/sa2012.htm#015).md). After her husband was slain
([Sa2 11:15](../kjv/sa2011.htm#015).md) she was married to David ([Sa2
11:27](../kjv/sa2011.htm#027).md), and became the mother of Solomon ([Sa2
12:24](../kjv/sa2012.htm#024); [Kg1 1:11](../kjv/kg1001.htm#011.md); [Kg1
2:13](../kjv/kg1002.htm#013).md). She took a prominent part in securing the
succession of Solomon to the throne ([Kg1 1:11](../kjv/kg1001.htm#011.md),
[Kg1 1:16](../kjv/kg1001.htm#016).md).

<span id="007">**Battering-ram**</span> ([Eze
4:2](../kjv/eze004.htm#002); [Eze 21:22](../kjv/eze021.htm#022).md), a
military engine, consisting of a long beam of wood hung upon a frame,
for making breaches in walls. The end of it which was brought against
the wall was shaped like a ram's head.

<span id="008">**Battle-axe**</span> A mallet or heavy war-club. Applied
metaphorically ([Jer 51:20](../kjv/jer051.htm#020).md) to Cyrus, God's
instrument in destroying Babylon.

<span id="009">**Battle-bow**</span> The war-bow used in fighting ([Zac
9:10](../kjv/zac009.htm#010); [Zac 10:4](../kjv/zac010.htm#004).md). "Thy
bow was made quite naked" ([Hab 3:9](../kjv/hab003.htm#009).md) means that
it was made ready for use. By David's order ([Sa2
1:18](../kjv/sa2001.htm#018).md) the young men were taught the use, or
rather the song of the bow. (See ARMOUR, BOW.)
