<span id="000">**Rhoda**</span> A rose, the damsel in the house of Mary,
the mother of John Mark. She came to hearken when Peter knocked at the
door of the gate ([Act 12:12](../kjv/act012.htm#012).md).

<span id="001">**Rhodes**</span> A rose, an island to the south of the
western extremity of Asia Minor, between Coos and Patara, about 46 miles
long and 18 miles broad. Here the apostle probably landed on his way
from Greece to Syria ([Act 21:1](../kjv/act021.htm#001).md), on returning
from his third missionary journey.

<span id="002">**Riblah**</span> Fruitful, an ancient town on the
northern frontier of Palestine, 35 miles north-east of Baalbec, and 10
or 12 south of Lake Homs, on the eastern bank of the Orontes, in a wide
and fertile plain. Here Nebuchadnezzar had his head-quarters in his
campaign against Jerusalem, and here also Necho fixed his camp after he
had routed Josiah's army at Megiddo ([Kg2 23:29](../kjv/kg2023.htm#029.md);
[Kg2 25:6](../kjv/kg2025.htm#006), [Kg2 25:20](../kjv/kg2025.htm#020.md),
[Kg2 25:21](../kjv/kg2025.htm#021); [Jer 39:5](../kjv/jer039.htm#005.md);
[Jer 52:10](../kjv/jer052.htm#010).md). It was on the great caravan road
from Palestine to Carchemish, on the Euphrates. It is described ([Num
34:11](../kjv/num034.htm#011).md) as "on the eastern side of Ain." A place
still called el Ain, i.e., "the fountain", is found in such a position
about 10 miles distant. (See JERUSALEM.)

<span id="003">**Riddle**</span> (Heb. hodah ). The oldest and, strictly
speaking, the only example of a riddle was that propounded by Samson
([Jdg 14:12](../kjv/jdg014.htm#012).md). The parabolic prophecy in Ezek.
17:2-18 is there called a "riddle." It was rather, however, an allegory.
The word "darkly" in [Co1 13:12](../kjv/co1013.htm#012.md) is the rendering
of the Greek enigma; marg., "in a riddle."

<span id="004">**Righteousness**</span> See JUSTIFICATION.

<span id="005">**Rimmon**</span> Pomegranate. (1.) A man of Beeroth
([Sa2 4:2](../kjv/sa2004.htm#002).md), one of the four Gibeonite cities.
(See [Jos 9:17](../kjv/jos009.htm#017).) (2..md) A Syrian idol, mentioned
only in [Kg2 5:18](../kjv/kg2005.htm#018). (3..md) One of the "uttermost
cities" of Judah, afterwards given to Simeon ([Jos
15:21](../kjv/jos015.htm#021), [Jos 15:32](../kjv/jos015.htm#032.md); [Jos
19:7](../kjv/jos019.htm#007); [Ch1 4:32](../kjv/ch1004.htm#032).md). In
[Jos 15:32](../kjv/jos015.htm#032.md) Ain and Rimmon are mentioned
separately, but in [Jos 19:7](../kjv/jos019.htm#007.md) and [Ch1
4:32](../kjv/ch1004.htm#032.md) (compare [Neh
11:29](../kjv/neh011.htm#029).md) the two words are probably to be
combined, as forming together the name of one place, Ain-Rimmon = the
spring of the pomegranate. It has been identified with Um er-Rumamin,
about 13 miles south-west of Hebron. (4.) "Rock of," to which the
Benjamites fled ([Jdg 20:45](../kjv/jdg020.htm#045.md), [Jdg
20:47](../kjv/jdg020.htm#047); [Jdg 21:13](../kjv/jdg021.htm#013).md), and
where they maintained themselves for four months after the fearful
battle at Gibeah, in which they were almost exterminated, 600 only
surviving out of about 27,000. It is the present village of Rummon, "on
the very edge of the hill country, with a precipitous descent toward the
Jordan valley," supposed to be the site of Ai.

<span id="006">**Rimmon-parez**</span> A pomegranate breach, or Rimmon
of the breach, one of the stations of the Israelites in the wilderness
([Num 33:19](../kjv/num033.htm#019.md), [Num
33:20](../kjv/num033.htm#020).md).

<span id="007">**Ring**</span> Used as an ornament to decorate the
fingers, arms, wrists, and also the ears and the nose. Rings were used
as a signet ([Gen 38:18](../kjv/gen038.htm#018).md). They were given as a
token of investment with authority ([Gen 41:42](../kjv/gen041.htm#042.md);
[Est 3:8](../kjv/est003.htm#008); [Est 8:2](../kjv/est008.htm#002).md), and
of favour and dignity ([Luk 15:22](../kjv/luk015.htm#022).md). They were
generally worn by rich men ([Jam 2:2](../kjv/jam002.htm#002).md). They are
mentioned by Isaiah ([Isa 3:21](../kjv/isa003.htm#021).md) among the
adornments of Hebrew women.

<span id="008">**Riphath**</span> A crusher, Gomer's second son ([Gen
10:3](../kjv/gen010.htm#003).md), supposed to have been the ancestor of the
Paphlagonians.

<span id="009">**Rissah**</span> Heap of ruins; dew, a station of the
Israelites in the wilderness ([Num 33:21](../kjv/num033.htm#021.md), [Num
33:22](../kjv/num033.htm#022).md).
