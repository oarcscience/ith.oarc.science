<span id="000">**Adummim**</span> The red ones, a place apparently on
the road between Jericho and Jerusalem, "on the south side of the
torrent" Wady Kelt, looking toward Gilgal, mentioned [Jos
15:7](../kjv/jos015.htm#007); [Jos 18:17](../kjv/jos018.htm#017.md). It was
nearly half-way between Jerusalem and Jericho, and now bears the name of
Tal-at-ed-Dumm. It is supposed to have been the place referred to in the
parable of the Good Samaritan ([Luk 10:30](../kjv/luk010.htm#030).md).
Recently a new carriage-road has been completed, and carriages for the
first time have come along this road from Jerusalem.

<span id="001">**Adversary**</span> (Heb. satan ), an opponent or foe
([Kg1 5:4](../kjv/kg1005.htm#004); [Kg1 11:14](../kjv/kg1011.htm#014.md),
[Kg1 11:23](../kjv/kg1011.htm#023), [Kg1 11:25](../kjv/kg1011.htm#025.md);
[Luk 13:17](../kjv/luk013.htm#017).md); one that speaks against another, a
complainant ([Mat 5:25](../kjv/mat005.htm#025.md); [Luk
12:58](../kjv/luk012.htm#058).md); an enemy ([Luk
18:3](../kjv/luk018.htm#003).md), and specially the devil ([Pe1
5:8](../kjv/pe1005.htm#008).md).

<span id="002">**Advocate**</span> (Gr. parakletos ), one who pleads
another's cause, who helps another by defending or comforting him. It is
a name given by Christ three times to the Holy Ghost ([Joh
14:16](../kjv/joh014.htm#016); [Joh 15:26](../kjv/joh015.htm#026.md); [Joh
16:7](../kjv/joh016.htm#007.md), where the Greek word is rendered
"Comforter," q.v.). It is applied to Christ in [Jo1
2:1](../kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md), where the same Greek word is rendered
"Advocate," the rendering which it should have in all the places where
it occurs. Tertullus "the orator" ([Act 24:1](../kjv/act024.htm#001).md)
was a Roman advocate whom the Jews employed to accuse Paul before Felix.

<span id="003">**Aenon**</span> Springs, a place near Salim where John
baptized ([Joh 3:23](../kjv/joh003.htm#023).md). It was probably near the
upper source of the Wady Far'ah , an open valley extending from Mount
Ebal to the Jordan. It is full of springs. A place has been found called
'Ainun , four miles north of the springs.

<span id="004">**Affection**</span> Feeling or emotion. Mention is made
of "vile affections" ([Rom 1:26](../kjv/rom001.htm#026).md) and "inordinate
affection" ([Col 3:5](../kjv/col003.htm#005).md). Christians are exhorted
to set their affections on things above ([Col
3:2](../kjv/col003.htm#002).md). There is a distinction between natural and
spiritual or gracious affections ([Eze 33:32](../kjv/eze033.htm#032).md).

<span id="005">**Affinity**</span> Relationship by alliance ([Ch2
18:1](../kjv/ch2018.htm#001).md) or by marriage ([Kg1
3:1](../kjv/kg1003.htm#001).md). Marriages are prohibited within certain
degrees of affinity, enumerated [Lev 18:6](../kjv/lev018.htm#006.md).
Consanguinity is relationship by blood.

<span id="006">**Afflictions**</span> Common to all ([Job
5:7](../kjv/job005.htm#007); [Job 14:1](../kjv/job014.htm#001.md); [Psa
34:19](../kjv/psa034.htm#019).md); are for the good of men ([Jam
1:2](../kjv/jam001.htm#002), [Jam 1:3](../kjv/jam001.htm#003.md), [Jam
1:12](../kjv/jam001.htm#012); [Co2 12:7](../kjv/co2012.htm#007).md) and the
glory of God ([Co2 12:7](../kjv/co2012.htm#007.md); [Pe1
4:14](../kjv/pe1004.htm#014).md), and are to be borne with patience by the
Lord's people ([Psa 94:12](../kjv/psa094.htm#012.md); [Pro
3:12](../kjv/pro003.htm#012).md). They are all directed by God ([Lam
3:33](../kjv/lam003.htm#033).md), and will result in the everlasting good
of his people ([Co2 4:16](../kjv/co2004.htm#016).md) in Christ Jesus ([Rom
8:35](../kjv/rom008.htm#035).md).

<span id="007">**Agabus**</span> Prophet, probably one of the seventy
disciples of Christ. He prophesied at Antioch of an approaching famine
([Act 11:27](../kjv/act011.htm#027.md), [Act
11:28](../kjv/act011.htm#028).md). Many years afterwards he met Paul at
Caesarea, and warned him of the bonds and affliction that awaited him at
Jerusalem should he persist in going thither ([Act
21:10](../kjv/act021.htm#010).md).

<span id="008">**Agag**</span> Flame, the usual title of the Amalekite
kings, as "Pharaoh" was of the Egyptian. (1.) A king of the Amalekites
referred to by Balaam ([Num 24:7](../kjv/num024.htm#007).md). He lived at
the time of the Exodus. (2.) Another king of the Amalekites whom Saul
spared unlawfully, but whom Samuel on his arrival in the camp of Saul
ordered, in retributive justice (Judg. 1), to be brought out and cut in
pieces (1 Sam. 15:8-33. Compare [Exo 17:11](../kjv/exo017.htm#011.md); [Num
14:45](../kjv/num014.htm#045).md).

<span id="009">**Agagite**</span> A name applied to Haman and also to
his father ([Est 3:1](../kjv/est003.htm#001.md), [Est
3:10](../kjv/est003.htm#010); [Est 8:3](../kjv/est008.htm#003.md), [Est
8:5](../kjv/est008.htm#005).md). Probably it was equivalent to Amalekite.
