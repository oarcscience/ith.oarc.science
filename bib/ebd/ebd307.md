<span id="000">**Ramathite**</span> The designation given to Shimei, the
manager of David's vineyard ([Ch1 27:27](../kjv/ch1027.htm#027)).

<span id="001">**Rameses**</span> "The land of" ([Gen
47:11](../kjv/gen047.htm#011)), was probably "the land of Goshen" (q.v.)
[Gen 45:10](../kjv/gen045.htm#010). After the Hebrews had built Rameses,
one of the "treasure cities," it came to be known as the "land" in which
that city was built. The city bearing this name ([Exo
12:37](../kjv/exo012.htm#037)) was probably identical with Zoan, which
Rameses II. ("son of the sun") rebuilt. It became his special residence,
and ranked next in importance and magnificence to Thebes. Huge masses of
bricks, made of Nile mud, sun-dried, some of them mixed with stubble,
possibly moulded by Jewish hands, still mark the site of Rameses. This
was the general rendezvous of the Israelites before they began their
march out of Egypt. Called also Raamses ([Exo
1:11](../kjv/exo001.htm#011)).

<span id="002">**Ramoth**</span> Heights. A Levitical city in the tribe
of Issachar ([Sa1 30:27](../kjv/sa1030.htm#027); [Ch1
6:73](../kjv/ch1006.htm#073)), the same as Jarmuth ([Jos
21:29](../kjv/jos021.htm#029)) and Remeth (q.v.), [Jos
19:21](../kjv/jos019.htm#021).

<span id="003">**Ramoth-gilead**</span> Heights of Gilead, a city of
refuge on the east of Jordan; called "Ramoth in Gilead" ([Deu
4:43](../kjv/deu004.htm#043); [Jos 20:8](../kjv/jos020.htm#008); [Jos
21:38](../kjv/jos021.htm#038)). Here Ahab, who joined Jehoshaphat in an
endeavour to rescue it from the hands of the king of Syria, was mortally
wounded (1 Kings 22:1-36). A similar attempt was afterwards made by
Ahaziah and Joram, when the latter was wounded ([Kg2
8:28](../kjv/kg2008.htm#028)). In this city Jehu, the son of
Jehoshaphat, was anointed by one of the sons of the prophets ([Kg2
9:1](../kjv/kg2009.htm#001), [Kg2 9:4](../kjv/kg2009.htm#004)). It has
with probability been identified with Reimun, on the northern slope of
the Jabbok, about 5 miles west of Jerash or Gerasa, one of the cities of
Decapolis. Others identify it with Gerosh, about 25 miles north-east of
es-Salt, with which also many have identified it. (See RAMATH-MIZPEH.)

<span id="004">**Ranges**</span> (1.) [Lev
11:35](../kjv/lev011.htm#035). Probably a cooking furnace for two or
more pots, as the Hebrew word here is in the dual number; or perhaps a
fire-place fitted to receive a pair of ovens. (2.) [Kg2
11:8](../kjv/kg2011.htm#008). A Hebrew word is here used different from
the preceding, meaning "ranks of soldiers." The Levites were appointed
to guard the king's person within the temple ([Ch2
23:7](../kjv/ch2023.htm#007)), while the soldiers were his guard in the
court, and in going from the temple to the palace. The soldiers are here
commanded to slay any one who should break through the "ranks" (as
rendered in the R.V.) to come near the king. In [Kg2
11:15](../kjv/kg2011.htm#015) the expression, "Have her forth without
the ranges," is in the Revised Version, "Have her forth between the
ranks;" i.e., Jehoiada orders that Athaliah should be kept surrounded by
his own guards, and at the same time conveyed beyond the precincts of
the temple.

<span id="005">**Ransom**</span> The price or payment made for our
redemption, as when it is said that the Son of man "gave his life a
ransom for many" ([Mat 20:28](../kjv/mat020.htm#028); compare [Act
20:28](../kjv/act020.htm#028); [Rom 3:23](../kjv/rom003.htm#023), [Rom
3:24](../kjv/rom003.htm#024); [Co1 6:19](../kjv/co1006.htm#019), [Co1
6:20](../kjv/co1006.htm#020); [Gal 3:13](../kjv/gal003.htm#013); [Gal
4:4](../kjv/gal004.htm#004), [Gal 4:5](../kjv/gal004.htm#005); [Eph
1:7](../kjv/eph001.htm#007); [Col 1:14](../kjv/col001.htm#014); [Ti1
2:6](../kjv/ti1002.htm#006); [Tit 2:14](../kjv/tit002.htm#014); [Pe1
1:18](../kjv/pe1001.htm#018), [Pe1 1:19](../kjv/pe1001.htm#019). In all
these passages the same idea is expressed). This word is derived from
the Fr. rancon; Lat. redemptio . The debt is represented not as canceled
but as fully paid. The slave or captive is not liberated by a mere
gratuitous favour, but a ransom price has been paid, in consideration of
which he is set free. The original owner receives back his alienated and
lost possession because he has bought it back "with a price." This price
or ransom (Gr. lutron ) is always said to be Christ, his blood, his
death. He secures our redemption by the payment of a ransom. (See
REDEMPTION.)

<span id="006">**Rapha**</span> Tall. (1.) A Benjamite, the son of Binea
([Ch1 8:2](../kjv/ch1008.htm#002), [Ch1 8:37](../kjv/ch1008.htm#037)), a
descendant of Saul. (2.) Margin of [Ch1 20:4](../kjv/ch1020.htm#004),
[Ch1 20:6](../kjv/ch1020.htm#006), where "giant" is given in the text.

<span id="007">**Raphu**</span> Healed, a Benjamite, whose son Palti was
one of the twelve spies ([Num 13:9](../kjv/num013.htm#009)).

<span id="008">**Raven**</span> Heb. 'orebh , from a root meaning "to be
black" (Compare [Sol 5:11](../kjv/sol005.htm#011)); first mentioned as
"sent forth" by Noah from the ark ([Gen 8:7](../kjv/gen008.htm#007)).
"Every raven after his kind" was forbidden as food ([Lev
11:15](../kjv/lev011.htm#015); [Deu 14:14](../kjv/deu014.htm#014)).
Ravens feed mostly on carrion, and hence their food is procured with
difficulty ([Job 38:41](../kjv/job038.htm#041); [Psa
147:9](../kjv/psa147.htm#009)). When they attack kids or lambs or weak
animals, it is said that they first pick out the eyes of their victims
([Pro 30:17](../kjv/pro030.htm#017)). When Elijah was concealed by the
brook Cherith, God commanded the ravens to bring him "bread and flesh in
the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening" ([Kg1
17:3](../kjv/kg1017.htm#003)). (See ELIJAH.) There are eight species of
ravens in Palestine, and they are everywhere very numerous in that land.

<span id="009">**Razor**</span> The Nazarites were forbidden to make use
of the razor ([Num 6:5](../kjv/num006.htm#005); [Jdg
13:5](../kjv/jdg013.htm#005)). At their consecration the Levites were
shaved all over with a razor ([Num 8:7](../kjv/num008.htm#007); compare
[Psa 52:2](../kjv/psa052.htm#002); [Eze 5:1](../kjv/eze005.htm#001)).
