<span id="000">**Bamah**</span> A height, a name used simply to denote a
high place where the Jews worshipped idols ([Eze
20:29](../kjv/eze020.htm#029).md). The plural is translated "high places"
in [Num 22:41](../kjv/num022.htm#041.md) and [Eze
36:2](../kjv/eze036.htm#002.md).

<span id="001">**Bamoth**</span> Heights, the forty-seventh station of
the Israelites ([Num 21:19](../kjv/num021.htm#019.md), [Num
21:20](../kjv/num021.htm#020).md) in the territory of the Moabites.

<span id="002">**Bamoth-baal**</span> Heights of Baal, a place on the
river Arnon, or in the plains through which it flows, east of Jordan
([Jos 13:17](../kjv/jos013.htm#017.md); compare [Num
21:28](../kjv/num021.htm#028).md). It has been supposed to be the same
place as Bamoth.

<span id="003">**Bands**</span> (1.) of love ([Hos
11:4](../kjv/hos011.htm#004)); (2..md) of Christ ([Psa
2:3](../kjv/psa002.htm#003)); (3..md) uniting together Christ's body the
church ([Col 2:19](../kjv/col002.htm#019.md); [Col
3:14](../kjv/col003.htm#014); [Eph 4:3](../kjv/eph004.htm#003)); (4..md)
the emblem of the captivity of Israel ([Eze
34:27](../kjv/eze034.htm#027); [Isa 28:22](../kjv/isa028.htm#022.md); [Isa
52:2](../kjv/isa052.htm#002)); (5..md) of brotherhood ([Eze
37:15](../kjv/eze037.htm#015)); (6..md) no bands to the wicked in their
death ([Psa 73:4](../kjv/psa073.htm#004.md); [Job
21:7](../kjv/job021.htm#007); [Psa 10:6](../kjv/psa010.htm#006).md). Also
denotes chains ([Luk 8:29](../kjv/luk008.htm#029).md); companies of
soldiers ([Act 21:31](../kjv/act021.htm#031).md); a shepherd's staff,
indicating the union between Judah and Israel ([Zac
11:7](../kjv/zac011.htm#007).md).

<span id="004">**Bani**</span> Built. (1.) [Ch1
6:46](../kjv/ch1006.htm#046). (2..md) One of David's thirty-seven warriors,
a Gadite ([Sa2 23:36](../kjv/sa2023.htm#036)). (3..md) [Ezr
2:10](../kjv/ezr002.htm#010); [Ezr 10:29](../kjv/ezr010.htm#029.md), [Ezr
10:34](../kjv/ezr010.htm#034), [Ezr 10:38](../kjv/ezr010.htm#038). (4..md)
A Levite who was prominent in the reforms on the return from Babylon
([Neh 8:7](../kjv/neh008.htm#007); [Neh 9:4](../kjv/neh009.htm#004.md),
[Neh 9:5](../kjv/neh009.htm#005).md). His son Rehum took part in rebuilding
the wall of Jerusalem ([Neh 3:17](../kjv/neh003.htm#017).md).

<span id="005">**Banner**</span> (1.) The flag or banner of the larger
kind, serving for three tribes marching together. These standards, of
which there were four, were worked with embroidery and beautifully
ornamented ([Num 1:52](../kjv/num001.htm#052.md); [Num
2:2](../kjv/num002.htm#002), [Num 2:3](../kjv/num002.htm#003.md), [Num
2:10](../kjv/num002.htm#010), [Num 2:18](../kjv/num002.htm#018.md), [Num
2:25](../kjv/num002.htm#025); [Sol 2:4](../kjv/sol002.htm#004.md); [Sol
6:4](../kjv/sol006.htm#004), [Sol 6:10](../kjv/sol006.htm#010)). (2..md)
The flag borne by each separate tribe, of a smaller form. Probably it
bore on it the name of the tribe to which it belonged, or some
distinguishing device ([Num 2:2](../kjv/num002.htm#002.md), [Num
2:34](../kjv/num002.htm#034)). (3..md) A lofty signal-flag, not carried
about, but stationary. It was usually erected on a mountain or other
lofty place. As soon as it was seen the war-trumpets were blown ([Psa
60:4](../kjv/psa060.htm#004); [Isa 5:26](../kjv/isa005.htm#026.md); [Isa
11:12](../kjv/isa011.htm#012); [Isa 13:2](../kjv/isa013.htm#002.md); [Isa
18:3](../kjv/isa018.htm#003); [Isa 30:17](../kjv/isa030.htm#017.md); [Jer
4:6](../kjv/jer004.htm#006), [Jer 4:21](../kjv/jer004.htm#021.md); [Eze
27:7](../kjv/eze027.htm#007)). (4..md) A "sign of fire" ([Jer
6:1](../kjv/jer006.htm#001).md) was sometimes used as a signal. The banners
and ensigns of the Roman army had idolatrous images upon them, and hence
they are called the "abomination of desolation" (q.v.). The principal
Roman standard, however, was an eagle. (See [Mat
24:28](../kjv/mat024.htm#028); [Luk 17:37](../kjv/luk017.htm#037.md), where
the Jewish nation is compared to a dead body, which the eagles gather
together to devour.) God's setting up or giving a banner ([Psa
20:5](../kjv/psa020.htm#005); [Psa 60:4](../kjv/psa060.htm#004.md); [Sol
2:4](../kjv/sol002.htm#004).md) imports his presence and protection and aid
extended to his people.

<span id="006">**Banquet**</span> A feast provided for the entertainment
of a company of guests ([Est 5:1](../kjv/est005.htm#001.md), [Est
7:1](../kjv/est007.htm#001); [Pe1 4:3](../kjv/pe1004.htm#003).md); such as
was provided for our Lord by his friends in Bethany ([Mat
26:6](../kjv/mat026.htm#006); [Mar 14:3](../kjv/mar014.htm#003.md); compare
[Joh 12:2](../kjv/joh012.htm#002).md). These meals were in the days of
Christ usually called "suppers," after the custom of the Romans, and
were partaken of toward the close of the day. It was usual to send a
second invitation ([Mat 22:3](../kjv/mat022.htm#003.md); [Luk
14:17](../kjv/luk014.htm#017).md) to those who had been already invited.
When the whole company was assembled, the master of the house shut the
door with his own hands ([Luk 13:25](../kjv/luk013.htm#025.md); [Mat
25:10](../kjv/mat025.htm#010).md). The guests were first refreshed with
water and fragrant oil ([Luk 7:38](../kjv/luk007.htm#038.md); [Mar
7:4](../kjv/mar007.htm#004).md). A less frequent custom was that of
supplying each guest with a robe to be worn during the feast ([Ecc
9:8](../kjv/ecc009.htm#008); [Rev 3:4](../kjv/rev003.htm#004.md), [Rev
3:5](../kjv/rev003.htm#005); [Mat 22:11](../kjv/mat022.htm#011).md). At
private banquets the master of the house presided; but on public
occasions a "governor of the feast" was chosen ([Joh
2:8](../kjv/joh002.htm#008).md). The guests were placed in order according
to seniority ([Gen 43:33](../kjv/gen043.htm#033).md), or according to the
rank they held ([Pro 25:6](../kjv/pro025.htm#006.md), [Pro
25:7](../kjv/pro025.htm#007); [Mat 23:6](../kjv/mat023.htm#006.md); [Luk
14:7](../kjv/luk014.htm#007).md). As spoons and knives and forks are a
modern invention, and were altogether unknown in the East, the hands
alone were necessarily used, and were dipped in the dish, which was
common to two of the guests ([Joh 13:26](../kjv/joh013.htm#026).md). In the
days of our Lord the guests reclined at table; but the ancient
Israelites sat around low tables, cross-legged, like the modern
Orientals. Guests were specially honoured when extra portions were set
before them ([Gen 43:34](../kjv/gen043.htm#034).md), and when their cup was
filled with wine till it ran over ([Psa 23:5](../kjv/psa023.htm#005).md).
The hands of the guests were usually cleaned by being rubbed on bread,
the crumbs of which fell to the ground, and were the portion for dogs
([Mat 15:27](../kjv/mat015.htm#027.md); [Luk
16:21](../kjv/luk016.htm#021).md). At the time of the three annual
festivals at Jerusalem family banquets were common. To these the "widow,
and the fatherless, and the stranger" were welcome ([Deu
16:11](../kjv/deu016.htm#011).md). Sacrifices also included a banquet ([Exo
34:15](../kjv/exo034.htm#015); [Jdg 16:23](../kjv/jdg016.htm#023).md).
Birthday banquets are mentioned ([Gen 40:20](../kjv/gen040.htm#020.md);
[Mat 14:6](../kjv/mat014.htm#006).md). They were sometimes protracted, and
attended with revelry and excess ([Gen 21:8](../kjv/gen021.htm#008.md);
[Gen 29:22](../kjv/gen029.htm#022); [Sa1 25:2](../kjv/sa1025.htm#002.md),
[Sa1 25:36](../kjv/sa1025.htm#036); [Sa2 13:23](../kjv/sa2013.htm#023).md).
Portions were sometimes sent from the table to poorer friends ([Neh
8:10](../kjv/neh008.htm#010); [Est 9:19](../kjv/est009.htm#019.md), [Est
9:22](../kjv/est009.htm#022)). (See MEALS..md)

<span id="007">**Baptism, Christian**</span> An ordinance immediately
instituted by Christ ([Mat 28:19](../kjv/mat028.htm#019.md), [Mat
28:20](../kjv/mat028.htm#020).md), and designed to be observed in the
church, like that of the Supper, "till he come." The words "baptize" and
"baptism" are simply Greek words transferred into English. It means to
dip a thing into an element or liquid. In the LXX, the Greek version of
the Old Testament, it is used of the ablutions and baptisms required by
the Mosaic law. These were effected by immersion, and the same word,
"washings" ([Heb 9:10](../kjv/heb009.htm#010.md), [Heb
9:13](../kjv/heb009.htm#013), [Heb 9:19](../kjv/heb009.htm#019.md), [Heb
9:21](../kjv/heb009.htm#021).md) or "baptisms," designates them all.
Moreover, all of the instances of baptism recorded in the Acts of the
Apostles ([Act 2:38](../kjv/act002.htm#038.md); [Act
8:26](../kjv/act008.htm#026); [Act 9:17](../kjv/act009.htm#017.md), [Act
9:18](../kjv/act009.htm#018); [Act 22:12](../kjv/act022.htm#012.md); [Act
10:44](../kjv/act010.htm#044); [Act 16:32](../kjv/act016.htm#032).md)
suggests the idea that it was by dipping the person baptized, i.e. by
immersion. Baptism and the Lord's Supper are the two symbolical
ordinances of the New Testament. The Supper represents the work of
Christ, and Baptism the work of the Spirit. As in the Supper a small
amount of bread and wine used in this ordinance exhibits in symbol the
great work of Christ, so in Baptism the work of the Holy Spirit is fully
seen in the water in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. The
apostles of our Lord were baptized with the Holy Ghost ([Mat
3:11](../kjv/mat003.htm#011).md) by his coming upon them ([Act
1:8](../kjv/act001.htm#008).md). The fire also with which they were
baptized sat upon them. The extraordinary event of Pentecost was
explained by Peter as a fulfillment of the ancient promise that the
Spirit would be poured out in the last days ([Act
2:17](../kjv/act002.htm#017).md). He uses also with the same reference the
expression shed forth as descriptive of the baptism of the Spirit ([Act
2:33](../kjv/act002.htm#033).md). In the Pentecostal baptism "the apostles
were not dipped into the Spirit, nor plunged into the Spirit; but the
Spirit was shed forth, poured out, fell on them ([Act
11:15](../kjv/act011.htm#015).md), came upon them, sat on them." The
subjects of baptism. This raises questions of greater importance than
those relating to its mode. The controversy here is not about
"believers' baptism," for that is common to all parties. Believers were
baptized in apostolic times, and they have been baptized in all time by
all the branches of the church. It is altogether a misrepresentation to
allege, as is sometimes done by Baptists, that their doctrine is
"believers' baptism," Every instance of adult baptism, or of "believers'
baptism," recorded in the New Testament ([Act
2:41](../kjv/act002.htm#041); [Act 8:37](../kjv/act008.htm#037.md); [Act
9:17](../kjv/act009.htm#017), [Act 9:18](../kjv/act009.htm#018.md); [Act
10:47](../kjv/act010.htm#047); [Act 16:15](../kjv/act016.htm#015.md); [Act
19:5](../kjv/act019.htm#005), etc..md) is just such as would be dealt with
in precisely the same way by all branches of the Protestant Church, a
profession of faith or of their being "believers" would be required from
every one of them before baptism. The point in dispute is not the
baptism of believers, but whether the infant children of believers,
i.e., of members of the church, ought to be baptized.

<span id="008">**Baptism of Christ**</span> Christ had to be formally
inaugurated into the public discharge of his offices. For this purpose
he came to John, who was the representative of the law and the prophets,
that by him he might be introduced into his offices, and thus be
publicly recognized as the Messiah of whose coming the prophecies and
types had for many ages borne witness. John refused at first to confer
his baptism on Christ, for he understood not what he had to do with the
"baptism of repentance." But Christ said, "'suffer it to be so now,' NOW
as suited to my state of humiliation, my state as a substitute in the
room of sinners." His reception of baptism was not necessary on his own
account. It was a voluntary act, the same as his act of becoming
incarnate. Yet if the work he had engaged to accomplish was to be
completed, then it became him to take on him the likeness of a sinner,
and to fulfill all righteousness ([Mat 3:15](../kjv/mat003.htm#015).md).
The official duty of Christ and the sinless person of Christ are to be
distinguished. It was in his official capacity that he submitted to
baptism. In coming to John our Lord virtually said, "Though sinless, and
without any personal taint, yet in my public or official capacity as the
Sent of God, I stand in the room of many, and bring with me the sin of
the world, for which I am the propitiation." Christ was not made under
the law on his own account. It was as surety of his people, a position
which he spontaneously assumed. The administration of the rite of
baptism was also a symbol of the baptism of suffering before him in this
official capacity ([Luk 12:50](../kjv/luk012.htm#050).md). In thus
presenting himself he in effect dedicated or consecrated himself to the
work of fulfilling all righteousness.

<span id="009">**Baptism, John's**</span> Was not Christian baptism, nor
was that which was practiced by the disciples previous to our Lord's
crucifixion. Till then the New Testament economy did not exist. John's
baptism bound its subjects to repentance, and not to the faith of
Christ. It was not administered in the name of the Trinity, and those
whom John baptized were rebaptized by Paul ([Act
18:24](../kjv/act018.htm#024); [Act 19:7](../kjv/act019.htm#007).md).
