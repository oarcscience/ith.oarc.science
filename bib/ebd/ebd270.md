<span id="000">**Nehushta**</span> Copper, the daughter of Elnathan of
Jerusalem, and the wife of Jehoiakin ([Kg2
24:8](../kjv/kg2024.htm#008)), king of Judah.

<span id="001">**Nehushtan**</span> Of copper; a brazen thing a name of
contempt given to the serpent Moses had made in the wilderness ([Num
21:8](../kjv/num021.htm#008)), and which Hezekiah destroyed because the
children of Israel began to regard it as an idol and "burn incense to
it." The lapse of nearly one thousand years had invested the "brazen
serpent" with a mysterious sanctity; and in order to deliver the people
from their infatuation, and impress them with the idea of its
worthlessness, Hezekiah called it, in contempt, "Nehushtan," a brazen
thing, a mere piece of brass ([Kg2 18:4](../kjv/kg2018.htm#004)).

<span id="002">**Neiel**</span> Dwelling-place of God, a town in the
territory of Asher, near its southern border ([Jos
19:27](../kjv/jos019.htm#027)). It has been identified with the ruin
Y'anin , near the outlet of the Wady esh Sha-ghur, less than 2 miles
north of Kabul, and 16 miles east of Caesarea.

<span id="003">**Nekeb**</span> Cavern, a town on the boundary of
Naphtali ([Jos 19:33](../kjv/jos019.htm#033)). It has with probability,
been identified with Seiyadeh, nearly 2 miles east of Bessum, a ruin
half way between Tiberias and Mount Tabor.

<span id="004">**Nemuel**</span> Day of God. (1.) One of Simeon's five
sons ([Ch1 4:24](../kjv/ch1004.htm#024)), called also Jemuel ([Gen
46:10](../kjv/gen046.htm#010)). (2.) A Reubenite, a son of Eliab, and
brother of Dathan and Abiram ([Num 26:9](../kjv/num026.htm#009)).

<span id="005">**Nephilim**</span> [Gen 6:4](../kjv/gen006.htm#004);
[Num 13:33](../kjv/num013.htm#033), R.V.), giants, the Hebrew word left
untranslated by the Revisers, the name of one of the Canaanitish tribes.
The Revisers have, however, translated the Hebrew gibborim, in [Gen
6:4](../kjv/gen006.htm#004), "mighty men."

<span id="006">**Nephtoah**</span> Opened, a fountain and a stream
issuing from it on the border between Judah and Benjamin ([Jos
15:8](../kjv/jos015.htm#008), [Jos 15:9](../kjv/jos015.htm#009); [Jos
18:15](../kjv/jos018.htm#015)). It has been identified with 'Ain Lifta ,
a spring about 2 1/2 miles north-west of Jerusalem. Others, however,
have identified it with 'Ain' Atan, on the south-west of Bethlehem,
whence water is conveyed through "Pilate's aqueduct" to the Haram area
at Jerusalem.

<span id="007">**Ner**</span> Light, the father of Kish ([Ch1
8:33](../kjv/ch1008.htm#033)). [Sa1 14:51](../kjv/sa1014.htm#051) should
be read, "Kish, the father of Saul, and Ner, the father of Abner, were
the sons of Abiel." And hence this Kish and Ner were brothers, and Saul
and Abner were first cousins (Compare [Ch1
9:36](../kjv/ch1009.htm#036)).

<span id="008">**Nereus**</span> A Christian at Rome to whom Paul sent
his salutation ([Rom 16:15](../kjv/rom016.htm#015)).

<span id="009">**Nergal**</span> The great dog; that is, lion, one of
the chief gods of the Assyrians and Babylonians ([Kg2
17:30](../kjv/kg2017.htm#030)), the god of war and hunting. He is
connected with Cutha as its tutelary deity.
