<span id="000">**Jailer**</span> (of Philippi), [Act
16:23](../kjv/act016.htm#023.md). The conversion of the Roman jailer, a man
belonging to a class "insensible as a rule and hardened by habit, and
also disposed to despise the Jews, who were the bearers of the message
of the gospel," is one of those cases which illustrate its universality
and power.

<span id="001">**Jair**</span> Enlightener. (1.) The son of Segub. He
was brought up with his mother in Gilead, where he had possessions ([Ch1
2:22](../kjv/ch1002.htm#022).md). He distinguished himself in an expedition
against Bashan, and settled in the part of Argob on the borders of
Gilead. The small towns taken by him there are called Havoth-jair, i.e.,
"Jair's villages" ([Num 32:41](../kjv/num032.htm#041.md); [Deu
3:14](../kjv/deu003.htm#014); [Jos 13:30](../kjv/jos013.htm#030)). (2..md)
The eighth judge of Israel, which he ruled for twenty-two years. His
opulence is described in [Jdg 10:3](../kjv/jdg010.htm#003.md). He had
thirty sons, each riding on "ass colts." They had possession of thirty
of the sixty cities ([Kg1 4:13](../kjv/kg1004.htm#013.md); [Ch1
2:23](../kjv/ch1002.htm#023)) which formed the ancient Havoth-jair. (3..md)
A Benjamite, the father of Mordecai, Esther's uncle ([Est
2:5](../kjv/est002.htm#005)). (4..md) The father of Elhanan, who slew
Lahmi, the brother of Goliath ([Ch1 20:5](../kjv/ch1020.htm#005).md).

<span id="002">**Jairus**</span> A ruler of the synagogue at Capernaum,
whose only daughter Jesus restored to life ([Mar
5:22](../kjv/mar005.htm#022); [Luk 8:41](../kjv/luk008.htm#041).md).
Entering into the chamber of death, accompanied by Peter and James and
John and the father and mother of the maiden, he went forward to the bed
whereon the corpse lay, and said, Talitha cumi, i.e., "Maid, arise," and
immediately the spirit of the maiden came to her again, and she arose
straightway; and "at once to strengthen that life which had come back to
her, and to prove that she was indeed no ghost, but had returned to the
realities of a mortal existence, he commanded to give her something to
eat" ([Mar 5:43](../kjv/mar005.htm#043).md).

<span id="003">**Jakeh**</span> Pious, the father of Agur ([Pro
30:1](../kjv/pro030.htm#001).md). Nothing is known of him.

<span id="004">**Jakim**</span> Establisher. (1.) Chief of the twelfth
priestly order ([Ch1 24:12](../kjv/ch1024.htm#012)). (2..md) A Benjamite
([Ch1 8:19](../kjv/ch1008.htm#019)). (3..md) Margin in [Mat
1:11](../kjv/mat001.htm#011.md) means Jehoiakim.

<span id="005">**Jalon**</span> Lodger, the last of the four sons of
Ezra, of the tribe of Judah ([Ch1 4:17](../kjv/ch1004.htm#017).md).

<span id="006">**Jambres**</span> One of those who opposed Moses in
Egypt ([Ti2 3:8](../kjv/ti2003.htm#008)). (See JANNES..md)

<span id="007">**James**</span> (1.) The son of Zebedee and Salome; an
elder brother of John the apostle. He was one of the twelve. He was by
trade a fisherman, in partnership with Peter ([Mat
20:20](../kjv/mat020.htm#020); [Mat 27:56](../kjv/mat027.htm#056).md). With
John and Peter he was present at the transfiguration ([Mat
17:1](../kjv/mat017.htm#001); [Mar 9:2](../kjv/mar009.htm#002).md), at the
raising of Jairus's daughter ([Mar 5:37](../kjv/mar005.htm#037).md), and in
the garden with our Lord ([Mar 14:33](../kjv/mar014.htm#033).md). Because,
probably, of their boldness and energy, he and John were called
Boanerges, i.e., "sons of thunder." He was the first martyr among the
apostles, having been beheaded by King Herod Agrippa ([Act
12:1](../kjv/act012.htm#001), [Act 12:2](../kjv/act012.htm#002).md), A.D.
44. (Compare [Mat 4:21](../kjv/mat004.htm#021.md); [Mat
20:20](../kjv/mat020.htm#020)). (2..md) The son of Alphaeus, or Cleopas,
"the brother" or near kinsman or cousin of our Lord ([Gal
1:18](../kjv/gal001.htm#018), [Gal 1:19](../kjv/gal001.htm#019).md), called
James "the Less," or "the Little," probably because he was of low
stature. He is mentioned along with the other apostles ([Mat
10:3](../kjv/mat010.htm#003); [Mar 3:18](../kjv/mar003.htm#018.md); [Luk
6:15](../kjv/luk006.htm#015).md). He had a separate interview with our Lord
after his resurrection ([Co1 15:7](../kjv/co1015.htm#007).md), and is
mentioned as one of the apostles of the circumcision ([Act
1:13](../kjv/act001.htm#013).md). He appears to have occupied the position
of head of the Church at Jerusalem, where he presided at the council
held to consider the case of the Gentiles ([Act
12:17](../kjv/act012.htm#017.md); 15:13-29: [Act
21:18](../kjv/act021.htm#018).md). This James was the author of the epistle
which bears his name.

<span id="008">**James, Epistle of**</span> (1.) Author of, was James
the Less, the Lord's brother, one of the twelve apostles. He was one of
the three pillars of the Church ([Gal 2:9](../kjv/gal002.htm#009)). (2..md)
It was addressed to the Jews of the dispersion, "the twelve tribes
scattered abroad." (3.) The place and time of the writing of the epistle
were Jerusalem, where James was residing, and, from internal evidence,
the period between Paul's two imprisonments at Rome, probably about A.D.
62. (4.) The object of the writer was to enforce the practical duties of
the Christian life. "The Jewish vices against which he warns them are,
formalism, which made the service of God consist in washings and outward
ceremonies, whereas he reminds them ([Jam 1:27](../kjv/jam001.htm#027).md)
that it consists rather in active love and purity; fanaticism, which,
under the cloak of religious zeal, was tearing Jerusalem in pieces ([Jam
1:20](../kjv/jam001.htm#020).md); fatalism, which threw its sins on God
([Jam 1:13](../kjv/jam001.htm#013).md); meanness, which crouched before the
rich ([Jam 2:2](../kjv/jam002.htm#002).md); falsehood, which had made words
and oaths playthings ([Jam 3:2](../kjv/jam003.htm#002).md); partisanship
([Jam 3:14](../kjv/jam003.htm#014).md); evil speaking ([Jam
4:11](../kjv/jam004.htm#011).md); boasting ([Jam
4:16](../kjv/jam004.htm#016).md); oppression ([Jam
5:4](../kjv/jam005.htm#004).md). The great lesson which he teaches them as
Christians is patience, patience in trial ([Jam
1:2](../kjv/jam001.htm#002).md), patience in good works ([Jam
1:22](../kjv/jam001.htm#022).md), patience under provocation ([Jam
3:17](../kjv/jam003.htm#017).md), patience under oppression ([Jam
5:7](../kjv/jam005.htm#007).md), patience under persecution ([Jam
5:10](../kjv/jam005.htm#010).md); and the ground of their patience is that
the coming of the Lord draweth nigh, which is to right all wrong ([Jam
5:8](../kjv/jam005.htm#008).md)." "Justification by works," which James
contends for, is justification before man, the justification of our
profession of faith by a consistent life. Paul contends for the doctrine
of "justification by faith;" but that is justification before God, a
being regarded and accepted as just by virtue of the righteousness of
Christ, which is received by faith.

Moses" ([Ti2 3:8](../kjv/ti2003.htm#008).md).
