<span id="000">**Beth-shean**</span> House of security or rest, a city
which belonged to Manasseh ([Ch1 7:29](../kjv/ch1007.htm#029).md), on the
west of Jordan. The bodies of Saul and his sons were fastened to its
walls. In Solomon's time it gave its name to a district ([Kg1
4:12](../kjv/kg1004.htm#012).md). The name is found in an abridged form,
Bethshan, in [Sa1 31:10](../kjv/sa1031.htm#010.md), [Sa1
31:12](../kjv/sa1031.htm#012) and [Sa2 21:12](../kjv/sa2021.htm#012.md). It
is on the road from Jerusalem to Damascus, about 5 miles from the
Jordan, and 14 from the south end of the Lake of Gennesaret. After the
Captivity it was called Scythopolis, i.e., "the city of the Scythians,"
who about 640 B.C. came down from the steppes of Southern Russia and
settled in different places in Syria. It is now called Beisan.

<span id="001">**Beth-shemesh**</span> House of the sun. (1.) A
sacerdotal city in the tribe of Dan ([Jos 21:16](../kjv/jos021.htm#016.md);
[Sa1 6:15](../kjv/sa1006.htm#015).md), on the north border of Judah ([Jos
15:10](../kjv/jos015.htm#010).md). It was the scene of an encounter between
Jehoash, king of Israel, and Amaziah, king of Judah, in which the latter
was made prisoner ([Kg2 14:11](../kjv/kg2014.htm#011.md), [Kg2
14:13](../kjv/kg2014.htm#013).md). It was afterwards taken by the
Philistines ([Ch2 28:18](../kjv/ch2028.htm#018).md). It is the modern
ruined Arabic village 'Ain-shems , on the north-west slopes of the
mountains of Judah, 14 miles west of Jerusalem. (2.) A city between
Dothan and the Jordan, near the southern border of Issachar ([Jos
19:22](../kjv/jos019.htm#022).md), 7 1/2 miles south of Beth-shean. It is
the modern Ain-esh-Shemsiyeh. (3.) One of the fenced cities of Naphtali
([Jos 19:38](../kjv/jos019.htm#038).md), between Mount Tabor and the
Jordan. Now Khurbet Shema, 3 miles west of Safed. But perhaps the same
as No. 2. (4.) An idol sanctuary in Egypt ([Jer
43:13](../kjv/jer043.htm#013).md); called by the Greeks Heliopolis, and by
the Egyptians On (q.v.), [Gen 41:45](../kjv/gen041.htm#045.md).

<span id="002">**Beth-tappuah**</span> House of apples, a town of Judah,
now Tuffuh, 5 miles west of Hebron ([Jos 15:53](../kjv/jos015.htm#053).md).

<span id="003">**Bethuel**</span> Man of God, or virgin of God, or house
of God. (1.) The son of Nahor by Milcah; nephew of Abraham, and father
of Rebekah ([Gen 22:22](../kjv/gen022.htm#022.md), [Gen
22:23](../kjv/gen022.htm#023); [Gen 24:15](../kjv/gen024.htm#015.md), [Gen
24:24](../kjv/gen024.htm#024), [Gen 24:47](../kjv/gen024.htm#047).md). He
appears in person only once ([Gen 24:50](../kjv/gen024.htm#050)). (2..md) A
southern city of Judah ([Ch1 4:30](../kjv/ch1004.htm#030).md); called also
Bethul ([Jos 19:4](../kjv/jos019.htm#004).md) and Bethel ([Jos
12:16](../kjv/jos012.htm#016); [Sa1 30:27](../kjv/sa1030.htm#027).md).

<span id="004">**Bethzur**</span> House of rock, a town in the mountains
of Judah ([Jos 15:58](../kjv/jos015.htm#058).md), about 4 miles to the
north of Hebron. It was built by Rehoboam for the defense of his kingdom
([Ch2 11:7](../kjv/ch2011.htm#007).md). It stood near the modern ed-Dirweh.
Its ruins are still seen on a hill which bears the name of Beit-Sur, and
which commands the road from Beer-sheba and Hebron to Jerusalem from the
south.

<span id="005">**Betroth**</span> To promise "by one's truth." Men and
women were betrothed when they were engaged to be married. This usually
took place a year or more before marriage. From the time of betrothal
the woman was regarded as the lawful wife of the man to whom she was
betrothed ([Deu 28:30](../kjv/deu028.htm#030.md); [Jdg
14:2](../kjv/jdg014.htm#002), [Jdg 14:8](../kjv/jdg014.htm#008.md); [Mat
1:18](../kjv/mat001.htm#018).md). The term is figuratively employed of the
spiritual connection between God and his people ([Hos
2:19](../kjv/hos002.htm#019), [Hos 2:20](../kjv/hos002.htm#020).md).

<span id="006">**Beulah**</span> Married, is used in [Isa
62:4](../kjv/isa062.htm#004.md) metaphorically as the name of Judea: "Thy
land shall be married," i.e., favoured and blessed of the Lord.

<span id="007">**Bewray**</span> To reveal or disclose; an old English
word equivalent to "betray" ([Pro 27:16](../kjv/pro027.htm#016.md); [Pro
29:24](../kjv/pro029.htm#024.md), R.V., "uttereth;" [Isa
16:3](../kjv/isa016.htm#003); [Mat 26:73](../kjv/mat026.htm#073).md).

<span id="008">**Beyond**</span> When used with reference to Jordan,
signifies in the writings of Moses the west side of the river, as he
wrote on the east bank ([Gen 50:10](../kjv/gen050.htm#010.md), [Gen
50:11](../kjv/gen050.htm#011); [Deu 1:1](../kjv/deu001.htm#001.md), [Deu
1:5](../kjv/deu001.htm#005); [Deu 3:8](../kjv/deu003.htm#008.md), [Deu
3:20](../kjv/deu003.htm#020); [Deu 4:46](../kjv/deu004.htm#046).md); but in
the writings of Joshua, after he had crossed the river, it means the
east side ([Jos 5:1](../kjv/jos005.htm#001.md); [Jos
12:7](../kjv/jos012.htm#007); [Jos 22:7](../kjv/jos022.htm#007).md).

<span id="009">**Bezaleel**</span> In the shadow of God; i.e., "under
his protection", the artificer who executed the work of art in
connection with the tabernacle in the wilderness ([Exo
31:2](../kjv/exo031.htm#002); [Exo 35:30](../kjv/exo035.htm#030).md). He
was engaged principally in works of metal, wood, and stone; while
Aholiab, who was associated with him and subordinate to him, had the
charge of the textile fabrics ([Exo 36:1](../kjv/exo036.htm#001.md), [Exo
36:2](../kjv/exo036.htm#002); [Exo 38:22](../kjv/exo038.htm#022).md). He
was of the tribe of Judah, the son of Uri, and grandson of Hur ([Exo
31:2](../kjv/exo031.htm#002).md). Mention is made in [Ezr
10:30](../kjv/ezr010.htm#030.md) of another of the same name.
