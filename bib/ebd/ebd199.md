<span id="000">**Jealousy offering**</span> The name of the offering the
husband was to bring when he charged his wife with adultery ([Num
5:11](../kjv/num005.htm#011)).

<span id="001">**Jealousy, Waters of**</span> Water which the suspected
wife was required to drink, so that the result might prove her guilt or
innocence ([Num 5:12](../kjv/num005.htm#012), [Num
5:27](../kjv/num005.htm#027)). We have no record of this form of trial
having been actually resorted to.

<span id="002">**Jearim**</span> Forests, a mountain on the border of
Judah ([Jos 15:10](../kjv/jos015.htm#010)).

<span id="003">**Jebus**</span> Trodden hard, or fastness, or "the
waterless hill", the name of the Canaanitish city which stood on Mount
Zion ([Jos 15:8](../kjv/jos015.htm#008); [Jos
18:16](../kjv/jos018.htm#016), [Jos 18:28](../kjv/jos018.htm#028)). It
is identified with Jerusalem (q.v.) in [Jdg
19:10](../kjv/jdg019.htm#010), and with the castle or city of David
([Ch1 11:4](../kjv/ch1011.htm#004), [Ch1 11:5](../kjv/ch1011.htm#005)).
It was a place of great natural strength, and its capture was one of
David's most brilliant achievements ([Sa2 5:8](../kjv/sa2005.htm#008)).

<span id="004">**Jebusites**</span> The name of the original inhabitants
of Jebus, mentioned frequently among the seven nations doomed to
destruction ([Gen 10:16](../kjv/gen010.htm#016); [Gen
15:21](../kjv/gen015.htm#021); [Exo 3:8](../kjv/exo003.htm#008), [Exo
3:17](../kjv/exo003.htm#017); [Exo 13:5](../kjv/exo013.htm#005), etc.).
At the time of the arrival of the Israelites in Palestine they were
ruled by Adonizedek ([Jos 10:1](../kjv/jos010.htm#001), [Jos
10:23](../kjv/jos010.htm#023)). They were defeated by Joshua, and their
king was slain; but they were not entirely driven out of Jebus till the
time of David, who made it the capital of his kingdom instead of Hebron.
The site on which the temple was afterwards built belonged to Araunah, a
Jebusite, from whom it was purchased by David, who refused to accept it
as a free gift ([Sa2 24:16](../kjv/sa2024.htm#016); [Ch1
21:24](../kjv/ch1021.htm#024), [Ch1 21:25](../kjv/ch1021.htm#025)).

<span id="005">**Jecoliah**</span> Able through Jehovah, the wife of
King Amaziah, and mother of King Uzziah ([Ch2
26:3](../kjv/ch2026.htm#003)).

<span id="006">**Jedaiah**</span> (1.) Invoker of Jehovah. The son of
Shimri, a chief Simeonite ([Ch1 4:37](../kjv/ch1004.htm#037)). (2.) One
of those who repaired the walls of Jerusalem after the return from
Babylon ([Neh 3:10](../kjv/neh003.htm#010)). (3.) Knowing Jehovah. The
chief of one of the courses of the priests ([Ch1
24:7](../kjv/ch1024.htm#007)). (4.) A priest in Jerusalem after the
Exile ([Ch1 9:10](../kjv/ch1009.htm#010)).

<span id="007">**Jediael**</span> Known by God. (1.) One of the sons of
Benjamin, whose descendants numbered 17,200 warriors ([Ch1
7:6](../kjv/ch1007.htm#006), [Ch1 7:10](../kjv/ch1007.htm#010), [Ch1
7:11](../kjv/ch1007.htm#011)). (2.) A Shimrite, one of David's bodyguard
([Ch1 11:45](../kjv/ch1011.htm#045)). Probably same as in [Jos
12:20](../kjv/jos012.htm#020). (3.) A Korhite of the family of Ebiasaph,
and one of the gate-keepers to the temple ([Ch1
26:2](../kjv/ch1026.htm#002)).

<span id="008">**Jedidiah**</span> Beloved by Jehovah, the name which,
by the mouth of Nathan, the Lord gave to Solomon at his birth as a token
of the divine favour ([Sa2 12:25](../kjv/sa2012.htm#025)).

<span id="009">**Jeduthun**</span> Lauder; praising, a Levite of the
family of Merari, and one of the three masters of music appointed by
David ([Ch1 16:41](../kjv/ch1016.htm#041), [Ch1
16:42](../kjv/ch1016.htm#042); [Ch1 25:1](../kjv/ch1025.htm#001)). He is
called in [Ch2 35:15](../kjv/ch2035.htm#015) "the king's seer." His
descendants are mentioned as singers and players on instruments ([Neh
11:17](../kjv/neh011.htm#017)). He was probably the same as Ethan ([Ch1
15:17](../kjv/ch1015.htm#017), [Ch1 15:19](../kjv/ch1015.htm#019)). In
the superscriptions to [Psa 39:1](../kjv/psa039.htm#001), [Psa
62:1](../kjv/psa062.htm#001), and 77, the words "upon Jeduthun" probably
denote a musical instrument; or they may denote the style or tune
invented or introduced by Jeduthun, or that the psalm was to be sung by
his choir.
