<span id="000">**Physician**</span> Asa, afflicted with some bodily
malady, "sought not to the Lord but to the physicians" ([Ch2
16:12](../kjv/ch2016.htm#012).md). The "physicians" were those who
"practiced heathen arts of magic, disavowing recognized methods of cure,
and dissociating the healing art from dependence on the God of Israel.
The sin of Asa was not, therefore, in seeking medical advice, as we
understand the phrase, but in forgetting Jehovah."

<span id="001">**Pi-beseth**</span> ([Eze
30:17](../kjv/eze030.htm#017).md), supposed to mean. "a cat," or a deity in
the form of a cat, worshipped by the Egyptians. It was called by the
Greeks Bubastis. The hieroglyphic name is "Pe-bast", i.e., the house of
Bast, the Artemis of the Egyptians. The town of Bubasts was situated on
the Pelusian branch, i.e., the easternmost branch, of the Delta. It was
the seat of one of the chief annual festivals of the Egyptians. Its
ruins bear the modern name of Tel-Basta.

<span id="002">**Pieces**</span> (1.) of silver. In [Psa
68:30](../kjv/psa068.htm#030.md) denotes "fragments," and not properly
money. In [Sa1 2:36](../kjv/sa1002.htm#036) (Heb. agorah .md), properly a
"small sum" as wages, weighed rather than coined. [Jos
24:32](../kjv/jos024.htm#032) (Heb. kesitah , q.v..md), supposed by some to
have been a piece of money bearing the figure of a lamb, but rather
simply a certain amount. (Compare [Gen 33:19](../kjv/gen033.htm#019).md).
(2.) The word pieces is omitted in many passages, as [Gen
20:16](../kjv/gen020.htm#016); [Gen 37:28](../kjv/gen037.htm#028.md); [Gen
45:22](../kjv/gen045.htm#022.md), etc. The passage in [Zac
11:12](../kjv/zac011.htm#012), [Zac 11:13](../kjv/zac011.htm#013.md) is
quoted in the Gospel ([Mat 26:15](../kjv/mat026.htm#015).md), and from this
we know that the word to be supplied is "shekels." In all these
omissions we may thus warrantably supply this word. (3.) The "piece of
money" mentioned in [Mat 17:27](../kjv/mat017.htm#027.md) is a stater = a
Hebrew shekel, or four Greek drachmae ; and that in [Luk
15:8](../kjv/luk015.htm#008), [Luk 15:9](../kjv/luk015.htm#009.md), Act
[Luk 19:19](../kjv/luk019.htm#019.md), a Greek drachma = a denarius . (See
PENNY.)

<span id="003">**Piety**</span> Lat. pietas , properly honour and
respect toward parents ([Ti1 5:4](../kjv/ti1005.htm#004).md). In [Act
17:23](../kjv/act017.htm#023.md) the Greek verb is rendered "ye worship,"
as applicable to God.

<span id="004">**Pigeon**</span> Pigeons are mentioned as among the
offerings which, by divine appointment, Abram presented unto the Lord
([Gen 15:9](../kjv/gen015.htm#009).md). They were afterwards enumerated
among the sin-offerings ([Lev 1:14](../kjv/lev001.htm#014.md); [Lev
12:6](../kjv/lev012.htm#006).md), and the law provided that those who could
not offer a lamb might offer two young pigeons ([Lev
5:7](../kjv/lev005.htm#007); compare [Luk 2:24](../kjv/luk002.htm#024).md).
(See DOVE.)

<span id="005">**Pi-hahiroth**</span> Place where the reeds grow (LXX.
and Copt. read "farmstead"), the name of a place in Egypt where the
children of Israel encamped ([Exo 14:2](../kjv/exo014.htm#002.md), [Exo
14:9](../kjv/exo014.htm#009).md), how long is uncertain. Some have
identified it with Ajrud, a fortress between Etham and Suez. The
condition of the Isthmus of Suez at the time of the Exodus is not
exactly known, and hence this, with the other places mentioned as
encampments of Israel in Egypt, cannot be definitely ascertained. The
isthmus has been formed by the Nile deposits. This increase of deposit
still goes on, and so rapidly that within the last fifty years the mouth
of the Nile has advanced northward about four geographical miles. In the
maps of Ptolemy (of the second and third centuries A.D.) the mouths of
the Nile are forty miles further south than at present. (See EXODUS.)

<span id="006">**Pilate, Pontius**</span> Probably connected with the
Roman family of the Pontii, and called "Pilate" from the Latin pileatus
, i.e., "wearing the pileus", which was the "cap or badge of a
manumitted slave," as indicating that he was a "freedman," or the
descendant of one. He was the sixth in the order of the Roman
procurators of Judea (A.D. 26-36). His headquarters were at Caesarea,
but he frequently went up to Jerusalem. His reign extended over the
period of the ministry of John the Baptist and of Jesus Christ, in
connection with whose trial his name comes into prominent notice. Pilate
was a "typical Roman, not of the antique, simple stamp, but of the
imperial period, a man not without some remains of the ancient Roman
justice in his soul, yet pleasure-loving, imperious, and corrupt. He
hated the Jews whom he ruled, and in times of irritation freely shed
their blood. They returned his hatred with cordiality, and accused him
of every crime, mal-administration, cruelty, and robbery. He visited
Jerusalem as seldom as possible; for, indeed, to one accustomed to the
pleasures of Rome, with its theatres, baths, games, and gay society,
Jerusalem, with its religiousness and ever-smouldering revolt, was a
dreary residence. When he did visit it he stayed in the palace of Herod
the Great, it being common for the officers sent by Rome into conquered
countries to occupy the palaces of the displaced sovereigns." After his
trial before the Sanhedrin, Jesus was brought to the Roman procurator,
Pilate, who had come up to Jerusalem as usual to preserve order during
the Passover, and was now residing, perhaps, in the castle of Antonia,
or it may be in Herod's palace. Pilate came forth from his palace and
met the deputation from the Sanhedrin, who, in answer to his inquiry as
to the nature of the accusation they had to prefer against Jesus,
accused him of being a "malefactor." Pilate was not satisfied with this,
and they further accused him (1.) of sedition, (2.) preventing the
payment of the tribute to Caesar, and (3.) of assuming the title of king
([Luk 23:2](../kjv/luk023.htm#002).md). Pilate now withdrew with Jesus into
the palace ([Joh 18:33](../kjv/joh018.htm#033).md) and examined him in
private ([Joh 18:37](../kjv/joh018.htm#037.md), [Joh
18:38](../kjv/joh018.htm#038).md); and then going out to the deputation
still standing before the gate, he declared that he could find no fault
in Jesus ([Luk 23:4](../kjv/luk023.htm#004).md). This only aroused them to
more furious clamour, and they cried that he excited the populace
"throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee." When Pilate heard of
Galilee, he sent the accused to Herod Antipas, who had jurisdiction over
that province, thus hoping to escape the difficulty in which he found
himself. But Herod, with his men of war, set Jesus at naught, and sent
him back again to Pilate, clad in a purple robe of mockery ([Luk
23:11](../kjv/luk023.htm#011), [Luk 23:12](../kjv/luk023.htm#012).md).
Pilate now proposed that as he and Herod had found no fault in him, they
should release Jesus; and anticipating that they would consent to this
proposal, he ascended the judgment-seat as if ready to ratify the
decision ([Mat 27:19](../kjv/mat027.htm#019).md). But at this moment his
wife (Claudia Procula) sent a message to him imploring him to have
nothing to do with the "just person." Pilate's feelings of perplexity
and awe were deepened by this incident, while the crowd vehemently cried
out, "Not this man, but Barabbas." Pilate answered, "What then shall I
do with Jesus?" The fierce cry immediately followed. "Let him be
crucified." Pilate, apparently vexed, and not knowing what to do, said,
"Why, what evil hath he done?" but with yet fiercer fanaticism the crowd
yelled out, "Away with him! crucify him, crucify him!" Pilate yielded,
and sent Jesus away to be scourged. This scourging was usually inflicted
by lictors; but as Pilate was only a procurator he had no lictor, and
hence his soldiers inflicted this terrible punishment. This done, the
soldiers began to deride the sufferer, and they threw around him a
purple robe, probably some old cast-off robe of state ([Mat
27:28](../kjv/mat027.htm#028); [Joh 19:2](../kjv/joh019.htm#002).md), and
putting a reed in his right hand, and a crowd of thorns on his head,
bowed the knee before him in mockery, and saluted him, saying, "Hail,
King of the Jews!" They took also the reed and smote him with it on the
head and face, and spat in his face, heaping upon him every indignity.
Pilate then led forth Jesus from within the Praetorium ([Mat
27:27](../kjv/mat027.htm#027).md) before the people, wearing the crown of
thorns and the purple robe, saying, "Behold the man!" But the sight of
Jesus, now scourged and crowned and bleeding, only stirred their hatred
the more, and again they cried out, "Crucify him, crucify him!" and
brought forth this additional charge against him, that he professed to
be "the Son of God." Pilate heard this accusation with a superstitious
awe, and taking him once more within the Praetorium, asked him, "Whence
art thou?" Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate was irritated by his
continued silence, and said, "Knowest thou not that I have power to
crucify thee?" Jesus, with calm dignity, answered the Roman, "Thou
couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from
above." After this Pilate seemed more resolved than ever to let Jesus
go. The crowd perceiving this cried out, "If thou let this man go, thou
art not Caesar's friend." This settled the matter. He was afraid of
being accused to the emperor. Calling for water, he washed his hands in
the sight of the people, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this
just person." The mob, again scorning his scruples, cried, "His blood be
on us, and on our children." Pilate was stung to the heart by their
insults, and putting forth Jesus before them, said, "Shall I crucify
your King?" The fatal moment had now come. They madly exclaimed, "We
have no king but Caesar;" and now Jesus is given up to them, and led
away to be crucified. By the direction of Pilate an inscription was
placed, according to the Roman custom, over the cross, stating the crime
for which he was crucified. Having ascertained from the centurion that
he was dead, he gave up the body to Joseph of Arimathea to be buried.
Pilate's name now disappears from the Gospel history. References to him,
however, are found in the Acts of the Apostles ([Act
3:13](../kjv/act003.htm#013); [Act 4:27](../kjv/act004.htm#027.md); [Act
13:28](../kjv/act013.htm#028).md), and in [Ti1
6:13](../kjv/ti1006.htm#013.md). In A.D. 36 the governor of Syria brought
serious accusations against Pilate, and he was banished to Vienne in
Gaul, where, according to tradition, he committed suicide.

<span id="007">**Pillar**</span> Used to support a building ([Jdg
16:26](../kjv/jdg016.htm#026), [Jdg 16:29](../kjv/jdg016.htm#029).md); as a
trophy or memorial ([Gen 28:18](../kjv/gen028.htm#018.md); [Gen
35:20](../kjv/gen035.htm#020); [Exo 24:4](../kjv/exo024.htm#004.md); [Sa1
15:12](../kjv/sa1015.htm#012.md), A.V., "place," more correctly "monument,"
or "trophy of victory," as in [Sa2 18:18](../kjv/sa2018.htm#018).md); of
fire, by which the Divine Presence was manifested ([Exo
13:2](../kjv/exo013.htm#002).md). The "plain of the pillar" in [Jdg
9:6](../kjv/jdg009.htm#006.md) ought to be, as in the Revised Version, the
"oak of the pillar", i.e., of the monument or stone set up by Joshua
([Jos 24:26](../kjv/jos024.htm#026).md).

<span id="008">**Pine Tree**</span> Heb. tidhar , mentioned along with
the fir-tree in [Isa 41:19](../kjv/isa041.htm#019.md); [Isa
60:13](../kjv/isa060.htm#013.md). This is probably the cypress; or it may
be the stone-pine, which is common on the northern slopes of Lebanon.
Some suppose that the elm, others that the oak, or holm, or ilex, is
meant by the Hebrew word. In [Neh 8:15](../kjv/neh008.htm#015.md) the
Revised Version has "wild olive" instead of "pine." (See FIR.)

<span id="009">**Pinnacle**</span> A little wing, ([Mat
4:5](../kjv/mat004.htm#005); [Luk 4:9](../kjv/luk004.htm#009).md). On the
southern side of the temple court was a range of porches or cloisters
forming three arcades. At the south-eastern corner the roof of this
cloister was some 300 feet above the Kidron valley. The pinnacle, some
parapet or wing-like projection, was above this roof, and hence at a
great height, probably 350 feet or more above the valley.
