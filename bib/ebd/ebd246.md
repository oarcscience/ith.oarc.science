<span id="000">**Medeba**</span> Waters of quiet, an ancient Moabite
town ([Num 21:30](../kjv/num021.htm#030)). It was assigned to the tribe
of Reuben ([Jos 13:16](../kjv/jos013.htm#016)). Here was fought the
great battle in which Joab defeated the Ammonites and their allies ([Ch1
19:7](../kjv/ch1019.htm#007); compare [Sa2
10:6](../kjv/sa2010.htm#006)). In the time of Isaiah ([Isa
15:2](../kjv/isa015.htm#002)) the Moabites regained possession of it
from the Ammonites. (See HANUN.) The ruins of this important city, now
Madeba or Madiyabah, are seen about 8 miles south-west of Heshbon, and
14 east of the Dead Sea. Among these are the ruins of what must have
been a large temple. and of three cisterns of considerable extent, which
are now dry. These cisterns may have originated the name Medeba, "waters
of quiet." (See OMRI.)

<span id="001">**Media**</span> Heb. Madai , which is rendered in the
Authorized Version (1.) " Madai ," [Gen 10:2](../kjv/gen010.htm#002);
(2.) " Medes ," [Kg2 17:6](../kjv/kg2017.htm#006); [Kg2
18:11](../kjv/kg2018.htm#011); (3.) " Media ," [Est
1:3](../kjv/est001.htm#003); [Est 10:2](../kjv/est010.htm#002); [Isa
21:2](../kjv/isa021.htm#002); [Dan 8:20](../kjv/dan008.htm#020); (4.) "
Mede ," only in [Dan 11:1](../kjv/dan011.htm#001). We first hear of this
people in the Assyrian cuneiform records, under the name of Amada, about
840 B.C.. They appear to have been a branch of the Aryans, who came from
the east bank of the Indus, and were probably the predominant race for a
while in the Mesopotamian valley. They consisted for three or four
centuries of a number of tribes, each ruled by its own chief, who at
length were brought under the Assyrian yoke ([Kg2
17:6](../kjv/kg2017.htm#006)). From this subjection they achieved
deliverance, and formed themselves into an empire under Cyaxares (633
B.C.). This monarch entered into an alliance with the king of Babylon,
and invaded Assyria, capturing and destroying the city of Nineveh (625
B.C.), thus putting an end to the Assyrian monarchy ([Nah
1:8](../kjv/nah001.htm#008); [Nah 2:5](../kjv/nah002.htm#005), [Nah
2:6](../kjv/nah002.htm#006); [Nah 3:13](../kjv/nah003.htm#013), [Nah
3:14](../kjv/nah003.htm#014)). Media now rose to a place of great power,
vastly extending its boundaries. But it did not long exist as an
independent kingdom. It rose with Cyaxares, its first king, and it
passed away with him; for during the reign of his son and successor
Astyages, the Persians waged war against the Medes and conquered them,
the two nations being united under one monarch, Cyrus the Persian (558
B.C.). The "cities of the Medes" are first mentioned in connection with
the deportation of the Israelites on the destruction of Samaria ([Kg2
17:6](../kjv/kg2017.htm#006); [Kg2 18:11](../kjv/kg2018.htm#011)). Soon
afterwards Isaiah ([Isa 13:17](../kjv/isa013.htm#017); [Isa
21:2](../kjv/isa021.htm#002)) speaks of the part taken by the Medes in
the destruction of Babylon (Compare [Jer 51:11](../kjv/jer051.htm#011),
[Jer 51:28](../kjv/jer051.htm#028)). Daniel gives an account of the
reign of Darius the Mede, who was made viceroy by Cyrus (Dan. 6:1-28).
The decree of Cyrus, Ezra informs us ([Ezr 6:2](../kjv/ezr006.htm#002)),
was found in "the palace that is in the province of the Medes," Achmetha
or Ecbatana of the Greeks, which is the only Median city mentioned in
Scripture.

<span id="002">**Mediator**</span> One who intervenes between two
persons who are at variance, with a view to reconcile them. This word is
not found in the Old Testament; but the idea it expresses is found in
[Job 9:33](../kjv/job009.htm#033), in the word "daysman" (q.v.), marg.,
"umpire." This word is used in the New Testament to denote simply an
internuncius, an ambassador, one who acts as a medium of communication
between two contracting parties. In this sense Moses is called a
mediator in [Gal 3:19](../kjv/gal003.htm#019). Christ is the one and
only mediator between God and man ([Ti1 2:5](../kjv/ti1002.htm#005);
[Heb 8:6](../kjv/heb008.htm#006); [Heb 9:15](../kjv/heb009.htm#015);
[Heb 12:24](../kjv/heb012.htm#024)). He makes reconciliation between God
and man by his all-perfect atoning sacrifice. Such a mediator must be at
once divine and human, divine, that his obedience and his sufferings
might possess infinite worth, and that he might possess infinite wisdom
and knowledge and power to direct all things in the kingdoms of
providence and grace which are committed to his hands ([Mat
28:18](../kjv/mat028.htm#018); [Joh 5:22](../kjv/joh005.htm#022), [Joh
5:25](../kjv/joh005.htm#025), [Joh 5:26](../kjv/joh005.htm#026), [Joh
5:27](../kjv/joh005.htm#027)); and human, that in his work he might
represent man, and be capable of rendering obedience to the law and
satisfying the claims of justice ([Heb 2:17](../kjv/heb002.htm#017),
[Heb 2:18](../kjv/heb002.htm#018); [Heb 4:15](../kjv/heb004.htm#015),
[Heb 4:16](../kjv/heb004.htm#016)), and that in his glorified humanity
he might be the head of a glorified Church ([Rom
8:29](../kjv/rom008.htm#029)). This office involves the three functions
of prophet, priest, and king, all of which are discharged by Christ both
in his estate of humiliation and exaltation. These functions are so
inherent in the one office that the quality appertaining to each gives
character to every mediatorial act. They are never separated in the
exercise of the office of mediator.

<span id="003">**Meekness**</span> A calm temper of mind, not easily
provoked ([Jam 3:13](../kjv/jam003.htm#013)). Peculiar promises are made
to the meek ([Mat 5:5](../kjv/mat005.htm#005); [Isa
66:2](../kjv/isa066.htm#002)). The cultivation of this spirit is
enjoined ([Col 3:12](../kjv/col003.htm#012); [Ti1
6:11](../kjv/ti1006.htm#011); [Zep 2:3](../kjv/zep002.htm#003)), and is
exemplified in Christ ([Mat 11:29](../kjv/mat011.htm#029)), Abraham
(Gen. 13; [Gen 16:5](../kjv/gen016.htm#005), [Gen
16:6](../kjv/gen016.htm#006)) Moses ([Num 12:3](../kjv/num012.htm#003)),
David ([Zac 12:8](../kjv/zac012.htm#008); [Sa2
16:10](../kjv/sa2016.htm#010), [Sa2 16:12](../kjv/sa2016.htm#012)), and
Paul ([Co1 9:19](../kjv/co1009.htm#019)).

<span id="004">**Megiddo**</span> Place of troops, originally one of the
royal cities of the Canaanites ([Jos 12:21](../kjv/jos012.htm#021)),
belonged to the tribe of Manasseh ([Jdg 1:27](../kjv/jdg001.htm#027)),
but does not seem to have been fully occupied by the Israelites till the
time of Solomon ([Kg1 4:12](../kjv/kg1004.htm#012); [Kg1
9:15](../kjv/kg1009.htm#015)). The valley or plain of Megiddo was part
of the plain of Esdraelon, the great battle-field of Palestine. It was
here Barak gained a notable victory over Jabin, the king of Hazor, whose
general, Sisera, led on the hostile army. Barak rallied the warriors of
the northern tribes, and under the encouragement of Deborah (q.v.), the
prophetess, attacked the Canaanites in the great plain. The army of
Sisera was thrown into complete confusion, and was engulfed in the
waters of the Kishon, which had risen and overflowed its banks ([Jdg
4:5](../kjv/jdg004.htm#005)). Many years after this (610 B.C.),
Pharaohnecho II., on his march against the king of Assyria, passed
through the plains of Philistia and Sharon; and King Josiah, attempting
to bar his progress in the plain of Megiddo, was defeated by the
Egyptians. He was wounded in battle, and died as they bore him away in
his chariot towards Jerusalem ([Kg2 23:29](../kjv/kg2023.htm#029); [Ch2
35:22](../kjv/ch2035.htm#022)), and all Israel mourned for him. So
general and bitter was this mourning that it became a proverb, to which
Zechariah ([Zac 12:11](../kjv/zac012.htm#011), [Zac
12:12](../kjv/zac012.htm#012)) alludes. Megiddo has been identified with
the modern el-Lejjun, at the head of the Kishon, under the north-eastern
brow of Carmel, on the south-western edge of the plain of Esdraelon, and
9 miles west of Jezreel. Others identify it with Mujedd'a , 4 miles
south-west of Bethshean, but the question of its site is still
undetermined.

<span id="005">**Mehetabeel**</span> Whose benefactor is God, the father
of Delaiah, and grandfather of Shemaiah, who joined Sanballat against
Nehemiah ([Neh 6:10](../kjv/neh006.htm#010)).

<span id="006">**Mehetabel**</span> Wife of Hadad, one of the kings of
Edom ([Gen 36:39](../kjv/gen036.htm#039)).

<span id="007">**Mehujael**</span> Smitten by God, the son of Irad, and
father of Methusael ([Gen 4:18](../kjv/gen004.htm#018)).

<span id="008">**Mehuman**</span> Faithful, one of the eunuchs whom
Ahasuerus (Xerxes) commanded to bring in Vashti ([Est
1:10](../kjv/est001.htm#010)).

<span id="009">**Mehunims**</span> Habitations, ([Ch2
26:7](../kjv/ch2026.htm#007); R.V. "Meunim," Vulg. Ammonitae), a people
against whom Uzziah waged a successful war. This word is in Hebrew the
plural of Ma'on , and thus denotes the Maonites who inhabited the
country on the eastern side of the Wady el-Arabah. They are again
mentioned in [Ch1 4:41](../kjv/ch1004.htm#041) (R.V.), in the reign of
King Hezekiah, as a Hamite people, settled in the eastern end of the
valley of Gedor, in the wilderness south of Palestine. In this passage
the Authorized Version has "habitation," erroneously following the
translation of Luther. They are mentioned in the list of those from whom
the Nethinim were made up ([Ezr 2:50](../kjv/ezr002.htm#050); [Neh
7:52](../kjv/neh007.htm#052)).
