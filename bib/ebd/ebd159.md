<span id="000">**Hagiographa**</span> The holy writings, a term which
came early into use in the Christian church to denote the third division
of the Old Testament scriptures, called by the Jews Kethubim, i.e.,
"Writings." It consisted of five books, viz., Job, Proverbs, and Psalms,
and the two books of Chronicles. The ancient Jews classified their
sacred books as the Law, the Prophets, and the Kethubim, or Writings.
(See BIBLE.) In the New Testament ([Luk 24:44](../kjv/luk024.htm#044).md)
we find three corresponding divisions, viz., the Law, the Prophets, and
the Psalms.

<span id="001">**Hail!**</span> A salutation expressive of a wish for
the welfare of the person addressed; the translation of the Greek Chaire
, "Rejoice" ([Luk 1:8](../kjv/luk001.htm#008).md). Used in mockery in [Mat
27:29](../kjv/mat027.htm#029.md).

<span id="002">**Hail**</span> Frozen rain-drops; one of the plagues of
Egypt ([Exo 9:23](../kjv/exo009.htm#023).md). It is mentioned by Haggai as
a divine judgment ([Hag 2:17](../kjv/hag002.htm#017).md). A hail-storm
destroyed the army of the Amorites when they fought against Joshua ([Jos
10:11](../kjv/jos010.htm#011).md). Ezekiel represents the wall daubed with
untempered mortar as destroyed by great hail-stones ([Eze
13:11](../kjv/eze013.htm#011).md). (See also [Eze
38:22](../kjv/eze038.htm#022); [Rev 8:7](../kjv/rev008.htm#007.md); [Rev
11:19](../kjv/rev011.htm#019); [Rev 16:21](../kjv/rev016.htm#021)..md)

<span id="003">**Hair**</span> (1.) The Egyptians let the hair of their
head and beard grow only when they were in mourning, shaving it off at
other times. "So particular were they on this point that to have
neglected it was a subject of reproach and ridicule; and whenever they
intended to convey the idea of a man of low condition, or a slovenly
person, the artists represented him with a beard." Joseph shaved himself
before going in to Pharoah ([Gen 41:14](../kjv/gen041.htm#014).md). The
women of Egypt wore their hair long and plaited. Wigs were worn by
priests and laymen to cover the shaven skull, and false beards were
common. The great masses of hair seen in the portraits and statues of
kings and priests are thus altogether artificial. (2.) A precisely
opposite practice, as regards men, prevailed among the Assyrians. In
Assyrian sculptures the hair always appears long, and combed closely
down upon the head. The beard also was allowed to grow to its full
length. (3.) Among the Greeks the custom in this respect varied at
different times, as it did also among the Romans. In the time of the
apostle, among the Greeks the men wore short hair, while that of the
women was long ([Co1 11:14](../kjv/co1011.htm#014.md), [Co1
11:15](../kjv/co1011.htm#015).md). Paul reproves the Corinthians for
falling in with a style of manners which so far confounded the
distinction of the sexes and was hurtful to good morals. (See, however,
[Ti1 2:9](../kjv/ti1002.htm#009), and [Pe1 3:3](../kjv/pe1003.htm#003.md),
as regards women.) (4.) Among the Hebrews the natural distinction
between the sexes was preserved by the women wearing long hair ([Luk
7:38](../kjv/luk007.htm#038); [Joh 11:2](../kjv/joh011.htm#002.md); [Co1
11:6](../kjv/co1011.htm#006).md), while the men preserved theirs as a rule
at a moderate length by frequent clipping. Baldness disqualified any one
for the priest's office (Lev. 21). Elijah is called a "hairy man" ([Kg2
1:8](../kjv/kg2001.htm#008).md) from his flowing locks, or more probably
from the shaggy cloak of hair which he wore. His raiment was of camel's
hair. Long hair is especially noticed in the description of Absalom's
person ([Sa2 14:26](../kjv/sa2014.htm#026).md); but the wearing of long
hair was unusual, and was only practiced as an act of religious
observance by Nazarites ([Num 6:5](../kjv/num006.htm#005.md); [Jdg
13:5](../kjv/jdg013.htm#005).md) and others in token of special mercies
([Act 18:18](../kjv/act018.htm#018).md). In times of affliction the hair
was cut off ([Isa 3:17](../kjv/isa003.htm#017.md), [Isa
3:24](../kjv/isa003.htm#024); [Isa 15:2](../kjv/isa015.htm#002.md); [Isa
22:12](../kjv/isa022.htm#012); [Jer 7:29](../kjv/jer007.htm#029.md); [Amo
8:10](../kjv/amo008.htm#010).md). Tearing the hair and letting it go
disheveled were also tokens of grief ([Ezr 9:3](../kjv/ezr009.htm#003).md).
"Cutting off the hair" is a figure of the entire destruction of a people
([Isa 7:20](../kjv/isa007.htm#020).md). The Hebrews anointed the hair
profusely with fragrant ointments ([Rut 3:3](../kjv/rut003.htm#003.md);
[Sa2 14:2](../kjv/sa2014.htm#002); [Psa 23:5](../kjv/psa023.htm#005.md);
[Psa 45:7](../kjv/psa045.htm#007), etc..md), especially in seasons of
rejoicing ([Mat 6:17](../kjv/mat006.htm#017.md); [Luk
7:46](../kjv/luk007.htm#046).md).

<span id="004">**Hakkoz**</span> The thorn, the head of one of the
courses of the priests ([Ch1 24:10](../kjv/ch1024.htm#010).md).

<span id="005">**Halah**</span> A district of Media to which captive
Israelites were transported by the Assyrian kings ([Kg2
17:6](../kjv/kg2017.htm#006); [Kg2 18:11](../kjv/kg2018.htm#011.md); [Ch1
5:26](../kjv/ch1005.htm#026).md). It lay along the banks of the upper
Khabur, from its source to its junction with the Jerujer. Probably the
district called by Ptolemy Chalcitis.

<span id="006">**Halak**</span> Smooth; bald, a hill at the southern
extremity of Canaan ([Jos 11:17](../kjv/jos011.htm#017).md). It is referred
to as if it were a land-mark in that direction, being prominent and
conspicuous from a distance. It has by some been identified with the
modern Jebel el-Madura, on the south frontier of Judah, between the
south end of the Dead Sea and the Wady Gaian.

<span id="007">**Halhul**</span> Full of hollows, a town in the
highlands of Judah ([Jos 15:58](../kjv/jos015.htm#058).md). It is now a
small village of the same name, and is situated about 5 miles north-east
of Hebron on the way to Jerusalem. There is an old Jewish tradition that
Gad, David's seer ([Sa2 24:11](../kjv/sa2024.htm#011).md), was buried here.

<span id="008">**Hall**</span> (Gr. aule , [Luk
22:55](../kjv/luk022.htm#055); R.V., "court".md), the open court or
quadrangle belonging to the high priest's house. In [Mat
26:69](../kjv/mat026.htm#069) and [Mar 14:66](../kjv/mar014.htm#066.md)
this word is incorrectly rendered "palace" in the Authorized Version,
but correctly "court" in the Revised Version. In [Joh
10:1](../kjv/joh010.htm#001), [Joh 10:16](../kjv/joh010.htm#016.md) it
means a "sheep-fold." In [Mat 27:27](../kjv/mat027.htm#027.md) and [Mar
15:16](../kjv/mar015.htm#016) (A.V., "common hall;" R.V., "palace".md) it
refers to the praetorium or residence of the Roman governor at
Jerusalem. The "porch" in [Mat 26:71](../kjv/mat026.htm#071.md) is the
entrance-hall or passage leading into the central court, which is open
to the sky.

<span id="009">**Hallel**</span> Praise, the name given to the group of
Psalms (Ps. 113 - 118), which are preeminently psalms of praise. It is
called "The Egyptian Hallel," because it was chanted in the temple
whilst the Passover lambs were being slain. It was chanted also on other
festival occasions, as at Pentecost, the feast of Tabernacles, and the
feast of Dedication. The Levites, standing before the altar, chanted it
verse by verse, the people responding by repeating the verses or by
intoned hallelujahs. It was also chanted in private families at the
feast of Passover. This was probably the hymn which our Saviour and his
disciples sung at the conclusion of the Passover supper kept by them in
the upper room at Jerusalem ([Mat 26:30](../kjv/mat026.htm#030.md); [Mar
14:26](../kjv/mar014.htm#026).md). There is also another group called "The
Great Hallel," comprehending Psalms Ps. 118 - 136, which was recited on
the first evening at the Passover supper and on occasions of great joy.
