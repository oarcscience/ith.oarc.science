<span id="000">**Fitches**</span> ([Isa 28:25](../kjv/isa028.htm#025),
[Isa 28:27](../kjv/isa028.htm#027)), the rendering of the Hebrew ketsah,
"without doubt the Nigella sativa, a small annual of the order
Ranunculacece, which grows wild in the Mediterranean countries, and is
cultivated in Egypt and Syria for its seed." It is rendered in margin of
the Revised Version "black cummin." The seeds are used as a condiment.
In [Eze 4:9](../kjv/eze004.htm#009) this word is the rendering of the
Hebrew kussemeth (incorrectly rendered "rye" in the Authorized Version
of [Exo 9:32](../kjv/exo009.htm#032) and [Isa
28:25](../kjv/isa028.htm#025), but "spelt" in the Revised Version). The
reading "fitches" here is an error; it should be "spelt."

<span id="001">**Flag**</span> (Heb., or rather Egyptian, ahu, [Job
8:11](../kjv/job008.htm#011)), rendered "meadow" in [Gen
41:2](../kjv/gen041.htm#002), [Gen 41:18](../kjv/gen041.htm#018);
probably the Cyperus esculentus, a species of rush eaten by cattle, the
Nile reed. It also grows in Palestine. In [Exo
2:3](../kjv/exo002.htm#003), [Exo 2:5](../kjv/exo002.htm#005), [Isa
19:6](../kjv/isa019.htm#006), it is the rendering of the Hebrew suph, a
word which occurs frequently in connection with yam; as yam suph, to
denote the "Red Sea" (q.v.) or the sea of weeds (as this word is
rendered, [Jon 2:5](../kjv/jon002.htm#005)). It denotes some kind of
sedge or reed which grows in marshy places. (See PAPER, REED.)

<span id="002">**Flagon**</span> Heb. ashishah , ([Sa2
6:19](../kjv/sa2006.htm#019); [Ch1 16:3](../kjv/ch1016.htm#003); [Sol
2:5](../kjv/sol002.htm#005); [Hos 3:1](../kjv/hos003.htm#001)), meaning
properly "a cake of pressed raisins." "Flagons of wine" of the
Authorized Version should be, as in the Revised Version, "cakes of
raisins" in all these passages. In [Isa 22:24](../kjv/isa022.htm#024) it
is the rendering of the Hebrew nebel, which properly means a bottle or
vessel of skin. (Compare [Sa1 1:24](../kjv/sa1001.htm#024); [Sa1
10:3](../kjv/sa1010.htm#003); [Sa1 25:18](../kjv/sa1025.htm#018); [Sa2
16:1](../kjv/sa2016.htm#001), where the same Hebrew word is used.)

<span id="003">**Flame of Fire**</span> Is the chosen symbol of the
holiness of God ([Exo 3:2](../kjv/exo003.htm#002); [Rev
2:18](../kjv/rev002.htm#018)), as indicating "the intense, all-consuming
operation of his holiness in relation to sin."

<span id="004">**Flax**</span> Heb. pishtah , i.e., "peeled", in
allusion to the fact that the stalks of flax when dried were fact that
the stalks of flax when dried were first split or peeled before being
steeped in water for the purpose of destroying the pulp). This plant was
cultivated from earliest times. The flax of Egypt was destroyed by the
plague of hail when it "was bolled", i.e., was forming pods for seed
([Exo 9:31](../kjv/exo009.htm#031)). It was extensively cultivated both
in Egypt and Palestine. Reference is made in [Jos
2:6](../kjv/jos002.htm#006) to the custom of drying flax-stalks by
exposing them to the sun on the flat roofs of houses. It was much used
in forming articles of clothing such as girdles, also cords and bands
([Lev 13:48](../kjv/lev013.htm#048), [Lev 13:52](../kjv/lev013.htm#052),
[Lev 13:59](../kjv/lev013.htm#059); [Deu 22:11](../kjv/deu022.htm#011)).
(See LINEN.)

<span id="005">**Flea**</span> David at the cave of Adullam thus
addressed his persecutor Saul ([Sa1 24:14](../kjv/sa1024.htm#014)):
"After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue?
after a dead dog, after a flea?" He thus speaks of himself as the poor,
contemptible object of the monarch's pursuit, a "worthy object truly for
an expedition of the king of Israel with his picked troops!" This insect
is in Eastern language the popular emblem of insignificance. In [Sa1
26:20](../kjv/sa1026.htm#020) the LXX. read "come out to seek my life"
instead of "to seek a flea."

<span id="006">**Fleece**</span> The wool of a sheep, whether shorn off
or still attached to the skin ([Deu 18:4](../kjv/deu018.htm#004); [Job
31:20](../kjv/job031.htm#020)). The miracle of Gideon's fleece ([Jdg
6:37](../kjv/jdg006.htm#037)) consisted in the dew having fallen at one
time on the fleece without any on the floor, and at another time in the
fleece remaining dry while the ground was wet with dew.

<span id="007">**Flesh**</span> In the Old Testament denotes (1.) a
particular part of the body of man and animals ([Gen
2:21](../kjv/gen002.htm#021); [Gen 41:2](../kjv/gen041.htm#002); [Psa
102:5](../kjv/psa102.htm#005), marg.); (2.) the whole body ([Psa
16:9](../kjv/psa016.htm#009)); (3.) all living things having flesh, and
particularly humanity as a whole ([Gen 6:12](../kjv/gen006.htm#012),
[Gen 6:13](../kjv/gen006.htm#013)); (4.) mutability and weakness ([Ch2
32:8](../kjv/ch2032.htm#008); compare [Isa 31:3](../kjv/isa031.htm#003);
[Psa 78:39](../kjv/psa078.htm#039)). As suggesting the idea of softness
it is used in the expression "heart of flesh" ([Eze
11:19](../kjv/eze011.htm#019)). The expression "my flesh and bone" ([Jdg
9:2](../kjv/jdg009.htm#002); [Isa 58:7](../kjv/isa058.htm#007)) denotes
relationship. In the New Testament, besides these it is also used to
denote the sinful element of human nature as opposed to the "Spirit"
([Rom 6:19](../kjv/rom006.htm#019); [Mat 16:17](../kjv/mat016.htm#017)).
Being "in the flesh" means being unrenewed ([Rom
7:5](../kjv/rom007.htm#005); [Rom 8:8](../kjv/rom008.htm#008), [Rom
8:9](../kjv/rom008.htm#009)), and to live "according to the flesh" is to
live and act sinfully ([Rom 8:4](../kjv/rom008.htm#004), [Rom
8:5](../kjv/rom008.htm#005), [Rom 8:7](../kjv/rom008.htm#007), [Rom
8:12](../kjv/rom008.htm#012)). This word also denotes the human nature
of Christ ([Joh 1:14](../kjv/joh001.htm#014), "The Word was made flesh."
Compare also [Ti1 3:16](../kjv/ti1003.htm#016); [Rom
1:3](../kjv/rom001.htm#003)).

<span id="008">**Flesh-hook**</span> A many-pronged fork used in the
sacrificial services ([Sa1 2:13](../kjv/sa1002.htm#013), [Sa1
2:14](../kjv/sa1002.htm#014); [Exo 27:3](../kjv/exo027.htm#003); [Exo
38:3](../kjv/exo038.htm#003)) by the priest in drawing away the flesh.
The fat of the sacrifice, together with the breast and shoulder ([Lev
7:29](../kjv/lev007.htm#029)), were presented by the worshipper to the
priest. The fat was burned on the alter ([Lev
3:3](../kjv/lev003.htm#003)), and the breast and shoulder became the
portion of the priests. But Hophni and Phinehas, not content with this,
sent a servant to seize with a flesh-hook a further portion.

<span id="009">**Flint**</span> Abounds in all the plains and valleys of
the wilderness of the forty years' wanderings. In [Isa
50:7](../kjv/isa050.htm#007) and [Eze 3:9](../kjv/eze003.htm#009) the
expressions, where the word is used, means that the "Messiah would be
firm and resolute amidst all contempt and scorn which he would meet;
that he had made up his mind to endure it, and would not shrink from any
kind or degree of suffering which would be necessary to accomplish the
great work in which he was engaged." (Compare [Eze
3:8](../kjv/eze003.htm#008), [Eze 3:9](../kjv/eze003.htm#009).) The
words "like a flint" are used with reference to the hoofs of horses
([Isa 5:28](../kjv/isa005.htm#028)).
