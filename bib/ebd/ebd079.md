<span id="000">**Chephirah**</span> Village, one of the four cities of
the Gibeonitish Hivites with whom Joshua made a league ([Ch1
9:17](../kjv/ch1009.htm#017).md). It belonged to Benjamin. It has been
identified with the modern Kefireh, on the west confines of Benjamin,
about 2 miles west of Ajalon and 11 from Jerusalem.

<span id="001">**Cherethim**</span> ([Eze
25:16](../kjv/eze025.htm#016).md), more frequently Cherethites, the
inhabitants of Southern Philistia, the Philistines ([Zep
2:5](../kjv/zep002.htm#005).md). The Cherethites and the Pelethites were
David's life-guards ([Sa1 30:14](../kjv/sa1030.htm#014.md); [Sa2
8:18](../kjv/sa2008.htm#018); [Sa2 20:7](../kjv/sa2020.htm#007.md), [Sa2
20:23](../kjv/sa2020.htm#023); [Sa2 23:23](../kjv/sa2023.htm#023).md). This
name is by some interpreted as meaning "Cretans," and by others
"executioners," who were ready to execute the king's sentence of death
([Gen 37:36](../kjv/gen037.htm#036.md), marg.; [Kg1
2:25](../kjv/kg1002.htm#025).md).

<span id="002">**Cherith**</span> A cutting; separation; a gorge, a
torrent-bed or winter-stream, a "brook," in whose banks the prophet
Elijah hid himself during the early part of the three years' drought
([Kg1 17:3](../kjv/kg1017.htm#003), [Kg1 17:5](../kjv/kg1017.htm#005).md).
It has by some been identified as the Wady el-Kelt behind Jericho, which
is formed by the junction of many streams flowing from the mountains
west of Jericho. It is dry in summer. Travellers have described it as
one of the wildest ravines of this wild region, and peculiarly fitted to
afford a secure asylum to the persecuted. But if the prophet's interview
with Ahab was in Samaria, and he thence journeyed toward the east, it is
probable that he crossed Jordan and found refuge in some of the ravines
of Gilead. The "brook" is said to have been "before Jordan," which
probably means that it opened toward that river, into which it flowed.
This description would apply to the east as well as to the west of
Jordan. Thus Elijah's hiding-place may have been the Jermuk, in the
territory of the half-tribe of Manasseh.

<span id="003">**Cherub**</span> Plural cherubim, the name of certain
symbolical figures frequently mentioned in Scripture. They are first
mentioned in connection with the expulsion of our first parents from
Eden ([Gen 3:24](../kjv/gen003.htm#024).md). There is no intimation given
of their shape or form. They are next mentioned when Moses was commanded
to provide furniture for the tabernacle ([Exo
25:17](../kjv/exo025.htm#017); [Exo 26:1](../kjv/exo026.htm#001.md), [Exo
26:31](../kjv/exo026.htm#031).md). God promised to commune with Moses "from
between the cherubim" ([Exo 25:22](../kjv/exo025.htm#022).md). This
expression was afterwards used to denote the Divine abode and presence
([Num 7:89](../kjv/num007.htm#089); [Sa1 4:4](../kjv/sa1004.htm#004.md);
[Isa 37:16](../kjv/isa037.htm#016); [Psa 80:1](../kjv/psa080.htm#001.md);
[Psa 99:1](../kjv/psa099.htm#001)). In Ezekiel's vision (Ezek. 10:1-20.md)
they appear as living creatures supporting the throne of God. From
Ezekiel's description of them (Ezek. 1; 10; [Eze
41:18](../kjv/eze041.htm#018), [Eze 41:19](../kjv/eze041.htm#019).md), they
appear to have been compound figures, unlike any real object in nature;
artificial images possessing the features and properties of several
animals. Two cherubim were placed on the mercy-seat of the ark; two of
colossal size overshadowed it in Solomon's temple. Ezekiel ([Eze
1:4](../kjv/eze001.htm#004).md) speaks of four; and this number of "living
creatures" is mentioned in [Rev 4:6](../kjv/rev004.htm#006.md). Those on
the ark are called the "cherubim of glory" ([Heb
9:5](../kjv/heb009.htm#005).md), i.e., of the Shechinah, or cloud of glory,
for on them the visible glory of God rested. They were placed one at
each end of the mercy-seat, with wings stretched upward, and their faces
"toward each other and toward the mercy-seat." They were anointed with
holy oil, like the ark itself and the other sacred furniture. The
cherubim were symbolical. They were intended to represent spiritual
existences in immediate contact with Jehovah. Some have regarded them as
symbolical of the chief ruling power by which God carries on his
operations in providence ([Psa 18:10](../kjv/psa018.htm#010).md). Others
interpret them as having reference to the redemption of men, and as
symbolizing the great rulers or ministers of the church. Many other
opinions have been held regarding them which need not be referred to
here. On the whole, it seems to be most satisfactory to regard the
interpretation of the symbol to be variable, as is the symbol itself.
Their office was, (1.) on the expulsion of our first parents from Eden,
to prevent all access to the tree of life; and (2.) to form the throne
and chariot of Jehovah in his manifestation of himself on earth. He
dwelleth between and sitteth on the cherubim ([Sa1
4:4](../kjv/sa1004.htm#004); [Psa 80:1](../kjv/psa080.htm#001.md); [Eze
1:26](../kjv/eze001.htm#026), [Eze 1:28](../kjv/eze001.htm#028).md).

<span id="004">**Chesalon**</span> Strength; confidence, a place on the
border of Judah, on the side of Mount Jearim ([Jos
15:10](../kjv/jos015.htm#010).md); probably identified with the modern
village of Kesla, on the western mountains of Judah.

<span id="005">**Chesed**</span> Gain, the son of Nahor ([Gen
22:22](../kjv/gen022.htm#022).md).

<span id="006">**Chesil**</span> Ungodly, a town in the south of Judah
([Jos 15:30](../kjv/jos015.htm#030).md); probably the same as Bethul ([Jos
19:4](../kjv/jos019.htm#004).md) and Bethuel ([Ch1
4:30](../kjv/ch1004.htm#030).md); now Khelasa.

<span id="007">**Chest**</span> (Heb. 'aron , generally rendered "ark"),
the coffer into which the contributions for the repair of the temple
were put ([Kg2 12:9](../kjv/kg2012.htm#009.md), [Kg2
12:10](../kjv/kg2012.htm#010); [Ch2 24:8](../kjv/ch2024.htm#008.md), [Ch2
24:10](../kjv/ch2024.htm#010), [Ch2 24:11](../kjv/ch2024.htm#011).md). In
[Gen 50:26](../kjv/gen050.htm#026.md) it is rendered "coffin." In [Eze
27:24](../kjv/eze027.htm#024) a different Hebrew word, genazim (plur..md),
is used. It there means "treasure-chests."

<span id="008">**Chestnut Tree**</span> (Heb. 'armon ; i.e., "naked"),
mentioned in connection with Jacob's artifice regarding the cattle ([Gen
30:37](../kjv/gen030.htm#037).md). It is one of the trees of which, because
of its strength and beauty, the Assyrian empire is likened ([Eze
31:8](../kjv/eze031.htm#008); R.V., "plane trees".md). It is probably the
Oriental plane tree (Platanus orientalis) that is intended. It is a
characteristic of this tree that it annually sheds its outer bark,
becomes "naked." The chestnut tree proper is not a native of Palestine.

<span id="009">**Chesulloth**</span> Fertile places; the loins, a town
of Issachar, on the slopes of some mountain between Jezreel and Shunem
([Jos 19:18](../kjv/jos019.htm#018).md). It has been identified with
Chisloth-tabor, 2 1/2 miles to the west of Mount Tabor, and north of
Jezreel; now Iksal.
