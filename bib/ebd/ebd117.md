<span id="000">**Elika**</span> God is his rejecter, one of David's
thirty-seven distinguished heroes ([Sa2 23:25](../kjv/sa2023.htm#025).md).

<span id="001">**Elim**</span> Trees, ([Exo
15:27](../kjv/exo015.htm#027); [Num 33:9](../kjv/num033.htm#009).md), the
name of the second station where the Israelites encamped after crossing
the Red Sea. It had "twelve wells of water and threescore and ten palm
trees." It has been identified with the Wady Ghurundel, the most noted
of the four wades which descend from the range of et-Tih towards the
sea. Here they probably remained some considerable time. The form of
expression in [Exo 16:1](../kjv/exo016.htm#001.md) seems to imply that the
people proceeded in detachments or companies from Elim, and only for the
first time were assembled as a complete host when they reached the
wilderness of Sin (q.v.).

<span id="002">**Elimelech**</span> God his king, a man of the tribe of
Judah, of the family of the Hezronites, and kinsman of Boaz, who dwelt
in Bethlehem in the days of the judges. In consequence of a great dearth
he, with his wife Naomi and his two sons, went to dwell in the land of
Moab. There he and his sons died ([Rut 1:2](../kjv/rut001.htm#002.md), [Rut
1:3](../kjv/rut001.htm#003); [Rut 2:1](../kjv/rut002.htm#001.md), [Rut
2:3](../kjv/rut002.htm#003); [Rut 4:3](../kjv/rut004.htm#003.md), [Rut
4:9](../kjv/rut004.htm#009).md). Naomi afterwards returned to Palestine
with her daughter Ruth.

<span id="003">**Elioenai**</span> Toward Jehovah are my eyes - the name
of several men mentioned in the Old Testament ([Ch1
7:8](../kjv/ch1007.htm#008); [Ch1 4:36](../kjv/ch1004.htm#036.md); [Ezr
10:22](../kjv/ezr010.htm#022), [Ezr 10:27](../kjv/ezr010.htm#027).md).
Among these was the eldest son of Neariah, son of Shemaiah, of the
descendants of Zerubbabel. His family are the latest mentioned in the
Old Testament ([Ch1 3:23](../kjv/ch1003.htm#023.md), [Ch1
3:24](../kjv/ch1003.htm#024).md).

<span id="004">**Eliphalet**</span> God his deliverance, one of David's
sons ([Sa2 5:16](../kjv/sa2005.htm#016).md); called also Eliphelet ([Ch1
3:8](../kjv/ch1003.htm#008).md).

<span id="005">**Eliphaz**</span> God his strength. (1.) One of Job's
"three friends" who visited him in his affliction ([Job
4:1](../kjv/job004.htm#001).md). He was a "Temanite" - i.e., a native of
Teman, in Idumea. He first enters into debate with Job. His language is
uniformly more delicate and gentle than that of the other two, although
he imputes to Job special sins as the cause of his present sufferings.
He states with remarkable force of language the infinite purity and
majesty of God ([Job 4:12](../kjv/job004.htm#012.md); [Job
15:12](../kjv/job015.htm#012)). (2..md) The son of Esau by his wife Adah,
and father of several Edomitish tribes ([Gen
36:4](../kjv/gen036.htm#004), [Gen 36:10](../kjv/gen036.htm#010.md), [Gen
36:11](../kjv/gen036.htm#011), [Gen 36:16](../kjv/gen036.htm#016).md).

<span id="006">**Elipheleh**</span> God will distinguish him, one of the
porters appointed to play "on the Sheminith" on the occasion of the
bringing up of the ark to the city of David ([Ch1
15:18](../kjv/ch1015.htm#018), [Ch1 15:21](../kjv/ch1015.htm#021).md).

<span id="007">**Eliphelet**</span> God his deliverance. (1.) One of
David's distinguished warriors ([Sa2 23:34](../kjv/sa2023.htm#034).md);
called also Eliphal in [Ch1 11:35](../kjv/ch1011.htm#035). (2..md) One of
the sons of David born at Jerusalem ([Ch1 3:6](../kjv/ch1003.htm#006.md);
[Ch1 14:5](../kjv/ch1014.htm#005).md); called Elpalet in [Ch1
14:5](../kjv/ch1014.htm#005.md). Also another of David's sons ([Ch1
3:8](../kjv/ch1003.htm#008).md); called Eliphalet in [Sa2
5:16](../kjv/sa2005.htm#016); [Ch1 14:7](../kjv/ch1014.htm#007). (3..md) A
descendant of king Saul through Jonathan ([Ch1
8:39](../kjv/ch1008.htm#039).md).

<span id="008">**Elisabeth**</span> God her oath, the mother of John the
Baptist ([Luk 1:5](../kjv/luk001.htm#005).md). She was a descendant of
Aaron. She and her husband Zacharias (q.v.) "were both righteous before
God" ([Luk 1:5](../kjv/luk001.htm#005.md), [Luk
1:13](../kjv/luk001.htm#013).md). Mary's visit to Elisabeth is described in
1:39-63.

<span id="009">**Elisha**</span> God his salvation, the son of Shaphat
of Abel-meholah, who became the attendant and disciple of Elijah ([Kg1
19:16](../kjv/kg1019.htm#016).md). His name first occurs in the command
given to Elijah to anoint him as his successor ([Kg1
19:16](../kjv/kg1019.htm#016).md). This was the only one of the three
commands then given to Elijah which he accomplished. On his way from
Sinai to Damascus he found Elisha at his native place engaged in the
labours of the field, ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen. He went over
to him, threw over his shoulders his rough mantle, and at once adopted
him as a son, and invested him with the prophetical office (compare [Luk
9:61](../kjv/luk009.htm#061), [Luk 9:62](../kjv/luk009.htm#062).md). Elisha
accepted the call thus given (about four years before the death of
Ahab), and for some seven or eight years became the close attendant on
Elijah till he was parted from him and taken up into heaven. During all
these years we hear nothing of Elisha except in connection with the
closing scenes of Elijah's life. After Elijah, Elisha was accepted as
the leader of the sons of the prophets, and became noted in Israel. He
possessed, according to his own request, "a double portion" of Elijah's
spirit ([Kg2 2:9](../kjv/kg2002.htm#009).md); and for the long period of
about sixty years (892-832 B.C.) held the office of "prophet in Israel"
([Kg2 5:8](../kjv/kg2005.htm#008).md). After Elijah's departure, Elisha
returned to Jericho, and there healed the spring of water by casting
salt into it ([Kg2 2:21](../kjv/kg2002.htm#021).md). We next find him at
Bethel ([Kg2 2:23](../kjv/kg2002.htm#023).md), where, with the sternest of
his master, he cursed the youths who came out and scoffed at him as a
prophet of God: "Go up, thou bald head." The judgment at once took
effect, and God terribly visited the dishonour done to his prophet as
dishonour done to himself. We next read of his predicting a fall of rain
when the army of Jehoram was faint from thirst ([Kg2
3:9](../kjv/kg2003.htm#009).md); of the multiplying of the poor widow's
cruse of oil ([Kg2 4:1](../kjv/kg2004.htm#001).md); the miracle of
restoring to life the son of the woman of Shunem (2 Kings 4:18-37); the
multiplication of the twenty loaves of new barley into a sufficient
supply for an hundred men ([Kg2 4:42](../kjv/kg2004.htm#042).md); of the
cure of Naaman the Syrian of his leprosy (2 Kings 5:1-27); of the
punishment of Gehazi for his falsehood and his covetousness; of the
recovery of the axe lost in the waters of the Jordan ([Kg2
6:1](../kjv/kg2006.htm#001).md); of the miracle at Dothan, half-way on the
road between Samaria and Jezreel; of the siege of Samaria by the king of
Syria, and of the terrible sufferings of the people in connection with
it, and Elisha's prophecy as to the relief that would come (2 Kings
6:24-7:2). We then find Elisha at Damascus, to carry out the command
given to his master to anoint Hazael king over Syria ([Kg2
8:7](../kjv/kg2008.htm#007).md); thereafter he directs one of the sons of
the prophets to anoint Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel,
instead of Ahab. Thus the three commands given to Elijah ([Kg2
9:1](../kjv/kg2009.htm#001).md) were at length carried out. We do not again
read of him till we find him on his death-bed in his own house ([Kg2
13:14](../kjv/kg2013.htm#014).md). Joash, the grandson of Jehu, comes to
mourn over his approaching departure, and utters the same words as those
of Elisha when Elijah was taken away: "My father, my father! the chariot
of Israel, and the horsemen thereof." Afterwards when a dead body is
laid in Elisha's grave a year after his burial, no sooner does it touch
the hallowed remains than the man "revived, and stood up on his feet"
([Kg2 13:20](../kjv/kg2013.htm#020).md).
