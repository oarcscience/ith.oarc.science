<span id="000">**Kine**</span> (Heb. sing . parah , i.e., "fruitful"),
mentioned in Pharaoh's dream ([Gen 41:18](../kjv/gen041.htm#018).md). Here
the word denotes "buffaloes," which fed on the reeds and sedge by the
river's brink.

<span id="001">**King**</span> Is in Scripture very generally used to
denote one invested with authority, whether extensive or limited. There
were thirty-one kings in Canaan ([Jos 12:9](../kjv/jos012.htm#009.md), [Jos
12:24](../kjv/jos012.htm#024).md), whom Joshua subdued. Adonibezek subdued
seventy kings ([Jdg 1:7](../kjv/jdg001.htm#007).md). In the New Testament
the Roman emperor is spoken of as a king ([Pe1
2:13](../kjv/pe1002.htm#013), [Pe1 2:17](../kjv/pe1002.htm#017).md); and
Herod Antipas, who was only a tetrarch, is also called a king ([Mat
14:9](../kjv/mat014.htm#009); [Mar 6:22](../kjv/mar006.htm#022).md). This
title is applied to God ([Ti1 1:17](../kjv/ti1001.htm#017).md), and to
Christ, the Son of God ([Ti1 6:15](../kjv/ti1006.htm#015.md), [Ti1
6:16](../kjv/ti1006.htm#016); [Mat 27:11](../kjv/mat027.htm#011).md). The
people of God are also called "kings" ([Dan
7:22](../kjv/dan007.htm#022), [Dan 7:27](../kjv/dan007.htm#027.md); [Mat
19:28](../kjv/mat019.htm#028); [Rev 1:6](../kjv/rev001.htm#006), etc..md).
Death is called the "king of terrors" ([Job
18:14](../kjv/job018.htm#014).md). Jehovah was the sole King of the Jewish
nation ([Sa1 8:7](../kjv/sa1008.htm#007.md); [Isa
33:22](../kjv/isa033.htm#022).md). But there came a time in the history of
that people when a king was demanded, that they might be like other
nations ([Sa1 8:5](../kjv/sa1008.htm#005).md). The prophet Samuel
remonstrated with them, but the people cried out, "Nay, but we will have
a king over us." The misconduct of Samuel's sons was the immediate cause
of this demand. The Hebrew kings did not rule in their own right, nor in
name of the people who had chosen them, but partly as servants and
partly as representatives of Jehovah, the true King of Israel ([Sa1
10:1](../kjv/sa1010.htm#001).md). The limits of the king's power were
prescribed ([Sa1 10:25](../kjv/sa1010.htm#025).md). The officers of his
court were, (1.) the recorder or remembrancer ([Sa2
8:16](../kjv/sa2008.htm#016); [Kg1 4:3](../kjv/kg1004.htm#003)); (2..md)
the scribe ([Sa2 8:17](../kjv/sa2008.htm#017.md); [Sa2
20:25](../kjv/sa2020.htm#025)); (3..md) the officer over the house, the
chief steward ([Isa 22:15](../kjv/isa022.htm#015)); (4..md) the "king's
friend," a confidential companion ([Kg1 4:5](../kjv/kg1004.htm#005).md);
(5.) the keeper of the wardrobe ([Kg2 22:14](../kjv/kg2022.htm#014).md);
(6.) captain of the bodyguard ([Sa2 20:23](../kjv/sa2020.htm#023)); (7..md)
officers over the king's treasures, etc. ([Ch1
27:25](../kjv/ch1027.htm#025)); (8..md) commander-in-chief of the army
([Ch1 27:34](../kjv/ch1027.htm#034)); (9..md) the royal counsellor ([Ch1
27:32](../kjv/ch1027.htm#032); [Sa2 16:20](../kjv/sa2016.htm#020).md). See

<span id="002">**Kingdom of God**</span> ([Mat
6:33](../kjv/mat006.htm#033); [Mar 1:14](../kjv/mar001.htm#014.md), [Mar
1:15](../kjv/mar001.htm#015); [Luk 4:43](../kjv/luk004.htm#043).md) =
"kingdom of Christ" ([Mat 13:41](../kjv/mat013.htm#041.md); [Mat
20:21](../kjv/mat020.htm#021).md) = "kingdom of Christ and of God" ([Eph
5:5](../kjv/eph005.htm#005).md) = "kingdom of David" ([Mar
11:10](../kjv/mar011.htm#010).md) = "the kingdom" ([Mat
8:12](../kjv/mat008.htm#012); [Mat 13:19](../kjv/mat013.htm#019).md) =
"kingdom of heaven" ([Mat 3:2](../kjv/mat003.htm#002.md); [Mat
4:17](../kjv/mat004.htm#017); [Mat 13:41](../kjv/mat013.htm#041).md), all
denote the same thing under different aspects, viz.: (1.) Christ's
mediatorial authority, or his rule on the earth; (2.) the blessings and
advantages of all kinds that flow from this rule; (3.) the subjects of
this kingdom taken collectively, or the Church.

<span id="003">**Kingly Office of Christ**</span> One of the three
special relations in which Christ stands to his people. Christ's office
as mediator comprehends three different functions, viz., those of a
prophet, priest, and king. These are not three distinct offices, but
three functions of the one office of mediator. Christ is King and
sovereign Head over his Church and over all things to his Church ([Eph
1:22](../kjv/eph001.htm#022); [Eph 4:15](../kjv/eph004.htm#015.md); [Col
1:18](../kjv/col001.htm#018); [Col 2:19](../kjv/col002.htm#019).md). He
executes this mediatorial kingship in his Church, and over his Church,
and over all things in behalf of his Church. This royalty differs from
that which essentially belongs to him as God, for it is given to him by
the Father as the reward of his obedience and sufferings ([Phi
2:6](../kjv/phi002.htm#006).md), and has as its especial object the
upbuilding and the glory of his redeemed Church. It attaches, moreover,
not to his divine nature as such, but to his person as God-man. Christ's
mediatorial kingdom may be regarded as comprehending, (1.) his kingdom
of power, or his providential government of the universe; (2.) his
kingdom of grace, which is wholly spiritual in its subjects and
administration; and (3.) his kingdom of glory, which is the consummation
of all his providential and gracious administration. Christ sustained
and exercised the function of mediatorial King as well as of Prophet and
Priest, from the time of the fall of man, when he entered on his
mediatorial work; yet it may be said that he was publicly and formally
enthroned when he ascended up on high and sat down at the Father's right
hand ([Psa 2:6](../kjv/psa002.htm#006.md); [Jer
23:5](../kjv/jer023.htm#005); [Isa 9:6](../kjv/isa009.htm#006).md), after
his work of humiliation and suffering on earth was "finished."

<span id="004">**Kings, The Books of**</span> The two books of Kings
formed originally but one book in the Hebrew Scriptures. The present
division into two books was first made by the LXX., which now, with the
Vulgate, numbers them as the third and fourth books of Kings, the two
books of Samuel being the first and second books of Kings. They contain
the annals of the Jewish commonwealth from the accession of Solomon till
the subjugation of the kingdom by Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians
(apparently a period of about four hundred and fifty-three years). The
books of Chronicles (q.v.) are more comprehensive in their contents than
those of Kings. The latter synchronize with 1 Chr. 28 - 2 Chr. 36:21.
While in the Chronicles greater prominence is given to the priestly or
Levitical office, in the Kings greater prominence is given to the
kingly. The authorship of these books is uncertain. There are some
portions of them and of Jeremiah that are almost identical, e.g., 2
Kings 24:18 - 25 and Jer. 52; [Jer 39:1](../kjv/jer039.htm#001.md);
40:7-41:10. There are also many undesigned coincidences between Jeremiah
and Kings (2 Kings 21 - 23 and [Jer 7:15](../kjv/jer007.htm#015.md); [Jer
15:4](../kjv/jer015.htm#004); [Jer 19:3](../kjv/jer019.htm#003), etc..md),
and events recorded in Kings of which Jeremiah had personal knowledge.
These facts countenance in some degree the tradition that Jeremiah was
the author of the books of Kings. But the more probable supposition is
that Ezra, after the Captivity, compiled them from documents written
perhaps by David, Solomon, Nathan, Gad, and Iddo, and that he arranged
them in the order in which they now exist. In the threefold division of
the Scriptures by the Jews, these books are ranked among the "Prophets."
They are frequently quoted or alluded to by our Lord and his apostles
([Mat 6:29](../kjv/mat006.htm#029); [Mat 12:42](../kjv/mat012.htm#042.md);
[Luk 4:25](../kjv/luk004.htm#025), [Luk 4:26](../kjv/luk004.htm#026.md);
[Luk 10:4](../kjv/luk010.htm#004.md); compare [Kg2
4:29](../kjv/kg2004.htm#029); [Mar 1:6](../kjv/mar001.htm#006.md); compare
[Kg2 1:8](../kjv/kg2001.htm#008); [Mat 3:4](../kjv/mat003.htm#004.md),
etc.). The sources of the narrative are referred to (1.) "the book of
the acts of Solomon" ([Kg1 11:41](../kjv/kg1011.htm#041)); (2..md) the
"book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah" ([Kg1
14:29](../kjv/kg1014.htm#029); [Kg1 15:7](../kjv/kg1015.htm#007.md), [Kg1
15:23](../kjv/kg1015.htm#023), etc.); (3..md) the "book of the chronicles
of the kings of Israel" ([Kg1 14:19](../kjv/kg1014.htm#019.md); [Kg1
15:31](../kjv/kg1015.htm#031); [Kg1 16:14](../kjv/kg1016.htm#014.md), [Kg1
16:20](../kjv/kg1016.htm#020), [Kg1 16:27](../kjv/kg1016.htm#027.md),
etc.). The date of its composition was some time between 561 B.C., the
date of the last chapter (2 Kings 25), when Jehoiachin was released from
captivity by Evil-merodach, and 538 B.C., the date of the decree of
deliverance by Cyrus.

<span id="005">**King's dale**</span> Mentioned only in [Gen
14:17](../kjv/gen014.htm#017); [Sa2 18:18](../kjv/sa2018.htm#018.md), the
name given to "the valley of Shaveh," where the king of Sodom met Abram.

<span id="006">**Kinsman**</span> Heb. goel , from root meaning to
redeem. The goel among the Hebrews was the nearest male blood relation
alive. Certain important obligations devolved upon him toward his next
of kin. (1.) If any one from poverty was unable to redeem his
inheritance, it was the duty of the kinsman to redeem it ([Lev
25:25](../kjv/lev025.htm#025), [Lev 25:28](../kjv/lev025.htm#028.md); [Rut
3:9](../kjv/rut003.htm#009), [Rut 3:12](../kjv/rut003.htm#012).md). He was
also required to redeem his relation who had sold himself into slavery
([Lev 25:48](../kjv/lev025.htm#048.md), [Lev
25:49](../kjv/lev025.htm#049).md). God is the Goel of his people because he
redeems them ([Exo 6:6](../kjv/exo006.htm#006.md); [Isa
43:1](../kjv/isa043.htm#001); [Isa 41:14](../kjv/isa041.htm#014.md); [Isa
44:6](../kjv/isa044.htm#006), [Isa 44:22](../kjv/isa044.htm#022.md); [Isa
48:20](../kjv/isa048.htm#020); [Psa 103:4](../kjv/psa103.htm#004.md); [Job
19:25](../kjv/job019.htm#025), etc.). (2..md) The goel also was the avenger
(q.v.) of blood ([Num 35:21](../kjv/num035.htm#021).md) in the case of the
murder of the next of kin.

<span id="007">**Kir**</span> A wall or fortress, a place to which
Tiglath-pileser carried the Syrians captive after he had taken the city
of Damascus ([Kg2 16:9](../kjv/kg2016.htm#009.md); [Amo
1:5](../kjv/amo001.htm#005); [Amo 9:7](../kjv/amo009.htm#007).md). Isaiah
([Isa 22:6](../kjv/isa022.htm#006).md), who also was contemporary with
these events, mentions it along with Elam. Some have supposed that Kir
is a variant of Cush (Susiana), on the south of Elam.

<span id="008">**Kir of Moab**</span> [Isa 15:1](../kjv/isa015.htm#001.md).
The two strongholds of Moab were Ar and Kir, which latter is probably
the Kir-haraseth ([Isa 16:7](../kjv/isa016.htm#007).md) following.

<span id="009">**Kir-haraseth**</span> Built fortress, a city and
fortress of Moab, the modern Kerak, a small town on the brow of a steep
hill about 6 miles from Rabbath-Moab and 10 miles from the Dead Sea;
called also Kir-haresh, Kir-hareseth, Kir-heres ([Isa
16:7](../kjv/isa016.htm#007), [Isa 16:11](../kjv/isa016.htm#011.md); [Jer
48:31](../kjv/jer048.htm#031), [Jer 48:36](../kjv/jer048.htm#036).md).
After the death of Ahab, Mesha, king of Moab (see MOABITE STONE), threw
off allegiance to the king of Israel, and fought successfully for the
independence of his kingdom. After this Jehoram, king of Israel, in
seeking to regain his supremacy over Moab, entered into an alliance with
Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and with the king of Edom. The three kings
led their armies against Mesha, who was driven back to seek refuge in
Kirharaseth. The Moabites were driven to despair. Mesha then took his
eldest son, who would have reigned in his stead, and offered him as a
burnt-offering on the wall of the fortress in the sight of the allied
armies. "There was great indignation against Israel: and they departed
from him, and returned to their own land." The invaders evacuated the
land of Moab, and Mesha achieved the independence of his country ([Kg2
3:20](../kjv/kg2003.htm#020).md).
