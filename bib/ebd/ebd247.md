<span id="000">**Me-jarkon**</span> Waters of yellowness, or clear
waters, a river in the tribe of Dan ([Jos
19:46](../kjv/jos019.htm#046).md). It has been identified with the river
'Aujeh , which rises at Antipatris.

<span id="001">**Mekonah**</span> A base or foundation, a town in the
south of Judah ([Neh 11:28](../kjv/neh011.htm#028).md), near Ziklag.

<span id="002">**Melchi**</span> My king. (1.) The son of Addi, and
father of Neri ([Luk 3:28](../kjv/luk003.htm#028)). (2..md) [Luk
3:24](../kjv/luk003.htm#024.md).

<span id="003">**Melchizedek**</span> King of righteousness, the king of
Salem (q.v.). All we know of him is recorded in [Gen
14:18](../kjv/gen014.htm#018.md). He is subsequently mentioned only once in
the Old Testament, in [Psa 110:4](../kjv/psa110.htm#004.md). The typical
significance of his history is set forth in detail in the Epistle to the
Hebrews, Heb. 7. The apostle there points out the superiority of his
priesthood to that of Aaron in these several respects, (1.) Even Abraham
paid him tithes; (2.) he blessed Abraham; (3.) he is the type of a
Priest who lives for ever; (4.) Levi, yet unborn, paid him tithes in the
person of Abraham; (5.) the permanence of his priesthood in Christ
implied the abrogation of the Levitical system; (6.) he was made priest
not without an oath; and (7.) his priesthood can neither be transmitted
nor interrupted by death: "this man, because he continueth ever, hath an
unchangeable priesthood." The question as to who this mysterious
personage was has given rise to a great deal of modern speculation. It
is an old tradition among the Jews that he was Shem, the son of Noah,
who may have survived to this time. Melchizedek was a Canaanitish
prince, a worshipper of the true God, and in his peculiar history and
character an instructive type of our Lord, the great High Priest ([Heb
5:6](../kjv/heb005.htm#006), [Heb 5:7](../kjv/heb005.htm#007.md); [Heb
6:20](../kjv/heb006.htm#020).md). One of the Amarna tablets is from
Ebed-Tob, king of Jerusalem, the successor of Melchizedek, in which he
claims the very attributes and dignity given to Melchizedek in the
Epistle to the Hebrews.

<span id="004">**Melea**</span> Fulness, the son of Menan and father of
Eliakim, in the genealogy of our Lord ([Luk
3:31](../kjv/luk003.htm#031).md).

<span id="005">**Melech**</span> King, the second of Micah's four sons
([Ch1 8:35](../kjv/ch1008.htm#035).md), and thus grandson of Mephibosheth.

<span id="006">**Melita**</span> ([Act 27:28](../kjv/act027.htm#028).md),
an island in the Mediterranean, the modern Malta. Here the ship in which
Paul was being conveyed a prisoner to Rome was wrecked. The bay in which
it was wrecked now bears the name of "St. Paul's Bay", "a certain creek
with a shore." It is about 2 miles deep and 1 broad, and the whole
physical condition of the scene answers the description of the shipwreck
given in Acts 28. It was originally colonized by Phoenicians
("barbarians," [Act 28:2](../kjv/act028.htm#002).md). It came into the
possession of the Greeks (736 B.C.), from whom it was taken by the
Carthaginians (528 B.C.). In 242 B.C. it was conquered by the Romans,
and was governed by a Roman propraetor at the time of the shipwreck
([Act 28:7](../kjv/act028.htm#007).md). Since 1800, when the French
garrison surrendered to the English force, it has been a British
dependency. The island is about 17 miles long and 9 wide, and about 60
in circumference After a stay of three months on this island, during
which the "barbarians" showed them no little kindness, Julius procured
for himself and his company a passage in another Alexandrian corn-ship
which had wintered in the island, in which they proceeded on their
voyage to Rome ([Act 28:13](../kjv/act028.htm#013.md), [Act
28:14](../kjv/act028.htm#014).md).

<span id="007">**Melons**</span> Only in [Num
11:5](../kjv/num011.htm#005.md), the translation of the Hebrew abattihim,
the LXX. and Vulgate pepones, Arabic britikh . Of this plant there are
various kinds, the Egyptian melon, the Cucumus chate, which has been
called "the queen of cucumbers;" the water melon, the Cucurbita
citrullus; and the common or flesh melon, the Cucumus melo. "A traveler
in the East who recollects the intense gratitude which a gift of a slice
of melon inspired while journeying over the hot and dry plains, will
readily comprehend the regret with which the Hebrews in the Arabian
desert looked back upon the melons of Egypt" (Kitto).

<span id="008">**Melzar**</span> Probably a Persian word meaning master
of wine, i.e., chief butler; the title of an officer at the Babylonian
court ([Dan 1:11](../kjv/dan001.htm#011.md), [Dan
1:16](../kjv/dan001.htm#016).md) who had charge of the diet of the Hebrew
youths.

<span id="009">**Memphis**</span> Only in [Hos
9:6](../kjv/hos009.htm#006.md), Hebrew Moph. In [Isa
19:13](../kjv/isa019.htm#013); [Jer 2:16](../kjv/jer002.htm#016.md); [Jer
46:14](../kjv/jer046.htm#014), [Jer 46:19](../kjv/jer046.htm#019.md); [Eze
30:13](../kjv/eze030.htm#013), [Eze 30:16](../kjv/eze030.htm#016.md), it is
mentioned under the name Noph. It was the capital of Lower, i.e., of
Northern Egypt. From certain remains found half buried in the sand, the
site of this ancient city has been discovered near the modern village of
Minyet Rahinch, or Mitraheny, about 16 miles above the ancient head of
the Delta, and 9 miles south of Cairo, on the west bank of the Nile. It
is said to have been founded by Menes, the first king of Egypt, and to
have been in circumference about 19 miles. "There are few remains above
ground," says Manning (The Land of the Pharaohs), "of the splendour of
ancient Memphis. The city has utterly disappeared. If any traces yet
exist, they are buried beneath the vast mounds of crumbling bricks and
broken pottery which meet the eye in every direction. Near the village
of Mitraheny is a colossal statue of Rameses the Great. It is apparently
one of the two described by Herodotus and Diodorus as standing in front
of the temple of Ptah. They were originally 50 feet in height. The one
which remains, though mutilated, measures 48 feet. It is finely carved
in limestone, which takes a high polish, and is evidently a portrait. It
lies in a pit, which, during the inundation, is filled with water. As we
gaze on this fallen and battered statue of the mighty conqueror who was
probably contemporaneous with Moses, it is impossible not to remember
the words of the prophet Isaiah, [Isa 19:13](../kjv/isa019.htm#013.md);
[Isa 44:16](../kjv/isa044.htm#016.md), and Jeremiah, [Jer
46:19](../kjv/jer046.htm#019.md)."
