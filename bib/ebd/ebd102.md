<span id="000">**Desert**</span> (1.) Heb. midbar , "pasture-ground;" an
open tract for pasturage; a common ([Joe 2:22](../kjv/joe002.htm#022).md).
The "backside of the desert" ([Exo 3:1](../kjv/exo003.htm#001).md) is the
west of the desert, the region behind a man, as the east is the region
in front. The same Hebrew word is rendered "wilderness," and is used of
the country lying between Egypt and Palestine ([Gen
21:14](../kjv/gen021.htm#014), [Gen 21:21](../kjv/gen021.htm#021.md); [Exo
4:27](../kjv/exo004.htm#027); [Exo 19:2](../kjv/exo019.htm#002.md); [Jos
1:4](../kjv/jos001.htm#004).md), the wilderness of the wanderings. It was a
grazing tract, where the flocks and herds of the Israelites found
pasturage during the whole of their journey to the Promised Land. The
same Hebrew word is used also to denote the wilderness of Arabia, which
in winter and early spring supplies good pasturage to the flocks of the
nomad tribes than roam over it ([Kg1 9:18](../kjv/kg1009.htm#018).md). The
wilderness of Judah is the mountainous region along the western shore of
the Dead Sea, where David fed his father's flocks ([Sa1
17:28](../kjv/sa1017.htm#028); [Sa1 26:2](../kjv/sa1026.htm#002).md). Thus
in both of these instances the word denotes a country without settled
inhabitants and without streams of water, but having good pasturage for
cattle; a country of wandering tribes, as distinguished from that of a
settled people ([Isa 35:1](../kjv/isa035.htm#001.md); [Isa
50:2](../kjv/isa050.htm#002); [Jer 4:11](../kjv/jer004.htm#011).md). Such,
also is the meaning of the word "wilderness" in [Mat
3:3](../kjv/mat003.htm#003); [Mat 15:33](../kjv/mat015.htm#033.md); [Luk
15:4](../kjv/luk015.htm#004). (2..md) The translation of the Hebrew Aribah'
, "an arid tract" ([Isa 35:1](../kjv/isa035.htm#001.md), [Isa
35:6](../kjv/isa035.htm#006); [Isa 40:3](../kjv/isa040.htm#003.md); [Isa
41:19](../kjv/isa041.htm#019); [Isa 51:3](../kjv/isa051.htm#003), etc..md).
The name Arabah is specially applied to the deep valley of the Jordan
(the Ghor of the Arabs), which extends from the lake of Tiberias to the
Elanitic gulf. While midbar denotes properly a pastoral region, arabah
denotes a wilderness. It is also translated "plains;" as "the plains of
Jericho" ([Jos 5:10](../kjv/jos005.htm#010.md); [Kg2
25:5](../kjv/kg2025.htm#005).md), "the plains of Moab" ([Num
22:1](../kjv/num022.htm#001); [Deu 34:1](../kjv/deu034.htm#001.md), [Deu
34:8](../kjv/deu034.htm#008).md), "the plains of the wilderness" ([Sa2
17:16](../kjv/sa2017.htm#016)). (3..md) In the Revised Version of [Num
21:20](../kjv/num021.htm#020.md) the Hebrew word jeshimon is properly
rendered "desert," meaning the waste tracts on both shores of the Dead
Sea. This word is also rendered "desert" in [Psa
78:40](../kjv/psa078.htm#040); [Psa 106:14](../kjv/psa106.htm#014.md); [Isa
43:19](../kjv/isa043.htm#019), [Isa 43:20](../kjv/isa043.htm#020.md). It
denotes a greater extent of uncultivated country than the other words so
rendered. It is especially applied to the desert of the peninsula of
Arabia ([Num 21:20](../kjv/num021.htm#020.md); [Num
23:28](../kjv/num023.htm#028).md), the most terrible of all the deserts
with which the Israelites were acquainted. It is called "the desert" in
[Exo 23:31](../kjv/exo023.htm#031); [Deu 11:24](../kjv/deu011.htm#024.md).
(See JESHIMON.) (4.) A dry place; hence a desolation ([Psa
9:6](../kjv/psa009.htm#006).md), desolate ([Lev
26:34](../kjv/lev026.htm#034).md); the rendering of the Hebrew word horbah'
. It is rendered "desert" only in [Psa 102:6](../kjv/psa102.htm#006.md),
[Isa 48:21](../kjv/isa048.htm#021.md), and [Eze
13:4](../kjv/eze013.htm#004.md), where it means the wilderness of Sinai.
(5.) This word is the symbol of the Jewish church when they had forsaken
God ([Isa 40:3](../kjv/isa040.htm#003).md). Nations destitute of the
knowledge of God are called a "wilderness" ([Isa
32:15](../kjv/isa032.htm#015), midbar.md). It is a symbol of temptation,
solitude, and persecution ([Isa 27:10](../kjv/isa027.htm#010.md), midbar;
[Isa 33:9](../kjv/isa033.htm#009), arabah.md).

<span id="001">**Desire of All Nations**</span> ([Hag
2:7](../kjv/hag002.htm#007).md), usually interpreted as a title of the
Messiah. The Revised Version, however, more correctly renders "the
desirable things of all nations;" i.e., the choicest treasures of the
Gentiles shall be consecrated to the Lord.

<span id="002">**Desolation, Abomination of**</span> ([Mat
24:15](../kjv/mat024.htm#015); [Mar 13:14](../kjv/mar013.htm#014.md); comp
[Luk 21:20](../kjv/luk021.htm#020).md), is interpreted of the eagles, the
standards of the Roman army, which were an abomination to the Jews.
These standards, rising over the site of the temple, were a sign that
the holy place had fallen under the idolatrous Romans. The references
are to [Dan 9:27](../kjv/dan009.htm#027). (See ABOMINATION..md)

<span id="003">**Destroyer**</span> ([Exo
12:23](../kjv/exo012.htm#023).md), the agent employed in the killing of the
first-born; the destroying angel or messenger of God. (Compare [Kg2
19:35](../kjv/kg2019.htm#035); [Sa2 24:15](../kjv/sa2024.htm#015.md), [Sa2
24:16](../kjv/sa2024.htm#016); [Psa 78:49](../kjv/psa078.htm#049.md); [Act
12:23](../kjv/act012.htm#023)..md)

<span id="004">**Destruction**</span> In [Job
26:6](../kjv/job026.htm#006), [Job 28:22](../kjv/job028.htm#022.md) (Heb.
abaddon ) is sheol, the realm of the dead.

<span id="005">**Destruction, City of**</span> ([Isa
19:18](../kjv/isa019.htm#018.md); Heb. Ir-ha-Heres , "city of overthrow,"
because of the evidence it would present of the overthrow of
heathenism), the ideal title of On or Heliopolis (q.v.).

<span id="006">**Deuteronomy**</span> In all the Hebrew manuscripts the
Pentateuch (q.v.) forms one roll or volume divided into larger and
smaller sections called parshioth and sedarim. It is not easy to say
when it was divided into five books. This was probably first done by the
Greek translators of the book, whom the Vulgate follows. The fifth of
these books was called by the Greeks Deuteronomion, i.e., the second
law, hence our name Deuteronomy, or a second statement of the laws
already promulgated. The Jews designated the book by the two first
Hebrew words that occur, 'Elle haddabharim , i.e., "These are the
words." They divided it into eleven parshioth. In the English Bible it
contains thirty-four chapters. It consists chiefly of three discourses
delivered by Moses a short time before his death. They were spoken to
all Israel in the plains of Moab, in the eleventh month of the last year
of their wanderings. The first discourse (Deut. 1-4:40) recapitulates
the chief events of the last forty years in the wilderness, with earnest
exhortations to obedience to the divine ordinances, and warnings against
the danger of forsaking the God of their fathers. The second discourse
(Deut. 5 - 26:19) is in effect the body of the whole book. The first
address is introductory to it. It contains practically a recapitulation
of the law already given by God at Mount Sinai, together with many
admonitions and injunctions as to the course of conduct they were to
follow when they were settled in Canaan. The concluding discourse (Deut.
27 - 30) relates almost wholly to the solemn sanctions of the law, the
blessings to the obedient, and the curse that would fall on the
rebellious. He solemnly adjures them to adhere faithfully to the
covenant God had made with them, and so secure for themselves and their
posterity the promised blessings. These addresses to the people are
followed by what may be called three appendices, namely (1.) a song
which God had commanded Moses to write (Deut. 32:1-47); (2.) the
blessings he pronounced on the separate tribes (Deut. 33); and (3.) the
story of his death ([Deu 32:48](../kjv/deu032.htm#048).md) and burial ([Deu
34:1](../kjv/deu034.htm#001).md), written by some other hand, probably that
of Joshua. These farewell addresses of Moses to the tribes of Israel he
had so long led in the wilderness "glow in each line with the emotions
of a great leader recounting to his contemporaries the marvelous story
of their common experience. The enthusiasm they kindle, even to-day,
though obscured by translation, reveals their matchless adaptation to
the circumstances under which they were first spoken. Confidence for the
future is evoked by remembrance of the past. The same God who had done
mighty works for the tribes since the Exodus would cover their head in
the day of battle with the nations of Palestine, soon to be invaded.
Their great lawgiver stands before us, vigorous in his hoary age, stern
in his abhorrence of evil, earnest in his zeal for God, but mellowed in
all relations to earth by his nearness to heaven. The commanding wisdom
of his enactments, the dignity of his position as the founder of the
nation and the first of prophets, enforce his utterances. But he touches
our deepest emotions by the human tenderness that breathes in all his
words. Standing on the verge of life, he speaks as a father giving his
parting counsels to those he loves; willing to depart and be with God he
has served so well, but fondly lengthening out his last farewell to the
dear ones of earth. No book can compare with Deuteronomy in its mingled
sublimity and tenderness." Geikie, Hours, etc. The whole style and
method of this book, its tone and its peculiarities of conception and
expression, show that it must have come from one hand. That the author
was none other than Moses is established by the following
considerations: (1.) The uniform tradition both of the Jewish and the
Christian Church down to recent times. (2.) The book professes to have
been written by Moses ([Deu 1:1](../kjv/deu001.htm#001.md); [Deu
29:1](../kjv/deu029.htm#001); [Deu 31:1](../kjv/deu031.htm#001.md), [Deu
31:9](../kjv/deu031.htm#009), etc..md), and was obviously intended to be
accepted as his work. (3.) The incontrovertible testimony of our Lord
and his apostles ([Mat 19:7](../kjv/mat019.htm#007.md), [Mat
19:8](../kjv/mat019.htm#008); [Mar 10:3](../kjv/mar010.htm#003.md), [Mar
10:4](../kjv/mar010.htm#004); [Joh 5:46](../kjv/joh005.htm#046.md), [Joh
5:47](../kjv/joh005.htm#047); [Act 3:22](../kjv/act003.htm#022.md); [Act
7:37](../kjv/act007.htm#037); [Rom 10:19](../kjv/rom010.htm#019).md)
establishes the same conclusion. (4.) The frequent references to it in
the later books of the canon ([Jos 8:31](../kjv/jos008.htm#031.md); [Kg1
2:9](../kjv/kg1002.htm#009); [Kg2 14:6](../kjv/kg2014.htm#006.md); [Ch2
23:18](../kjv/ch2023.htm#018); [Ch2 25:4](../kjv/ch2025.htm#004.md); [Ch2
34:14](../kjv/ch2034.htm#014); [Ezr 3:2](../kjv/ezr003.htm#002.md); [Ezr
7:6](../kjv/ezr007.htm#006); [Neh 8:1](../kjv/neh008.htm#001.md); [Dan
9:11](../kjv/dan009.htm#011), [Dan 9:13](../kjv/dan009.htm#013).md) prove
its antiquity; and (5.) the archaisms found in it are in harmony with
the age in which Moses lived. (6.) Its style and allusions are also
strikingly consistent with the circumstances and position of Moses and
of the people at that time. This body of positive evidence cannot be set
aside by the conjectures and reasonings of modern critics, who contended
that the book was somewhat like a forgery, introduced among the Jews
some seven or eight centuries after the Exodus.

<span id="007">**Devil**</span> (Gr. diabolos ), a slanderer, the
arch-enemy of man's spiritual interest ([Job
1:6](../kjv/job001.htm#006); [Rev 2:10](../kjv/rev002.htm#010.md); [Zac
3:1](../kjv/zac003.htm#001).md). He is called also "the accuser of the
brethren" ([Rev 12:10](../kjv/rev012.htm#010).md). In [Lev
17:7](../kjv/lev017.htm#007.md) the word "devil" is the translation of the
Hebrew sair, meaning a "goat" or "satyr" ([Isa
13:21](../kjv/isa013.htm#021); [Isa 34:14](../kjv/isa034.htm#014).md),
alluding to the wood-daemons, the objects of idolatrous worship among
the heathen. In [Deu 32:17](../kjv/deu032.htm#017.md) and [Psa
106:37](../kjv/psa106.htm#037.md) it is the translation of Hebrew shed,
meaning lord, and idol, regarded by the Jews as a "demon," as the word
is rendered in the Revised Version. In the narratives of the Gospels
regarding the "casting out of devils" a different Greek word ( daimon )
is used. In the time of our Lord there were frequent cases of demoniacal
possession ([Mat 12:25](../kjv/mat012.htm#025.md); Mark 5:1-20; [Luk
4:35](../kjv/luk004.htm#035); [Luk 10:18](../kjv/luk010.htm#018), etc..md).

<span id="008">**Dew**</span> "There is no dew properly so called in
Palestine, for there is no moisture in the hot summer air to be chilled
into dew-drops by the coldness of the night. From May till October rain
is unknown, the sun shining with unclouded brightness day after day. The
heat becomes intense, the ground hard, and vegetation would perish but
for the moist west winds that come each night from the sea. The bright
skies cause the heat of the day to radiate very quickly into space, so
that the nights are as cold as the day is the reverse, a peculiarity of
climate from which poor Jacob suffered thousands of years ago ([Gen
31:40](../kjv/gen031.htm#040).md). To this coldness of the night air the
indispensable watering of all plant-life is due. The winds, loaded with
moisture, are robbed of it as they pass over the land, the cold air
condensing it into drops of water, which fall in a gracious rain of mist
on every thirsty blade. In the morning the fog thus created rests like a
sea over the plains, and far up the sides of the hills, which raise
their heads above it like so many islands. At sunrise, however, the
scene speedily changes. By the kindling light the mist is transformed
into vast snow-white clouds, which presently break into separate masses
and rise up the mountain-sides, to disappear in the blue above,
dissipated by the increasing heat. These are 'the morning clouds and the
early dew that go away' of which Hosea ([Hos
6:4](../kjv/hos006.htm#004); [Hos 13:3](../kjv/hos013.htm#003).md) speaks
so touchingly" (Geikie's The Holy Land, etc., i., p. 72). Dew is a
source of great fertility ([Gen 27:28](../kjv/gen027.htm#028.md); [Deu
33:13](../kjv/deu033.htm#013); [Zac 8:12](../kjv/zac008.htm#012).md), and
its withdrawal is regarded as a curse from God ([Sa2
1:21](../kjv/sa2001.htm#021); [Kg1 17:1](../kjv/kg1017.htm#001).md). It is
the symbol of a multitude ([Sa2 17:12](../kjv/sa2017.htm#012.md); [Psa
110:3](../kjv/psa110.htm#003).md); and from its refreshing influence it is
an emblem of brotherly love and harmony ([Psa
133:3](../kjv/psa133.htm#003).md), and of rich spiritual blessings ([Hos
14:5](../kjv/hos014.htm#005).md).

<span id="009">**Diadem**</span> The tiara of a king ([Eze
21:26](../kjv/eze021.htm#026); [Isa 28:5](../kjv/isa028.htm#005.md); [Isa
62:3](../kjv/isa062.htm#003).md); the turban ([Job
29:14](../kjv/job029.htm#014).md). In the New Testament a careful
distinction is drawn between the diadem as a badge of royalty ([Rev
12:3](../kjv/rev012.htm#003); [Rev 13:1](../kjv/rev013.htm#001.md); [Rev
19:12](../kjv/rev019.htm#012).md) and the crown as a mark of distinction in
private life. It is not known what the ancient Jewish "diadem" was. It
was the mark of Oriental sovereigns. (See CROWN.)
