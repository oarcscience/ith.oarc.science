<span id="000">**Ephraim**</span> Double fruitfulness ("for God had made
him fruitful in the land of his affliction"). The second son of Joseph,
born in Egypt ([Gen 41:52](../kjv/gen041.htm#052.md); [Gen
46:20](../kjv/gen046.htm#020).md). The first incident recorded regarding
him is his being placed, along with his brother Manasseh, before their
grandfather, Jacob, that he might bless them ([Gen
48:10](../kjv/gen048.htm#010.md); compare [Gen
27:1](../kjv/gen027.htm#001).md). The intention of Joseph was that the
right hand of the aged patriarch should be placed on the head of the
elder of the two; but Jacob set Ephraim the younger before his brother,
"guiding his hands wittingly." Before Joseph's death, Ephraim's family
had reached the third generation ([Gen 50:23](../kjv/gen050.htm#023).md).

<span id="001">**Ephraim, The Tribe of**</span> Took precedence over
that of Manasseh by virtue of Jacob's blessing ([Gen
41:52](../kjv/gen041.htm#052); [Gen 48:1](../kjv/gen048.htm#001).md). The
descendants of Joseph formed two of the tribes of Israel, whereas each
of the other sons of Jacob was the founder of only one tribe. Thus there
were in reality thirteen tribes; but the number twelve was preserved by
excluding that of Levi when Ephraim and Manasseh are mentioned
separately ([Num 1:32](../kjv/num001.htm#032.md); [Jos
17:14](../kjv/jos017.htm#014), [Jos 17:17](../kjv/jos017.htm#017.md); [Ch1
7:20](../kjv/ch1007.htm#020).md). Territory of. At the time of the first
census in the wilderness this tribe numbered 40,500 ([Num
1:32](../kjv/num001.htm#032), [Num 1:33](../kjv/num001.htm#033).md); forty
years later, when about to take possession of the Promised Land, it
numbered only 32,500. During the march (see CAMP) Ephraim's place was on
the west side of the tabernacle ([Num 2:18](../kjv/num002.htm#018).md).
When the spies were sent out to spy the land, "Oshea the son of Nun" of
this tribe signalized himself. The boundaries of the portion of the land
assigned to Ephraim are given in [Jos 16:1](../kjv/jos016.htm#001.md). It
included most of what was afterwards called Samaria as distinguished
from Judea and Galilee. It thus lay in the centre of all traffic, from
north to south, and from Jordan to the sea, and was about 55 miles long
and 30 broad. The tabernacle and the ark were deposited within its
limits at Shiloh, where it remained for four hundred years. During the
time of the judges and the first stage of the monarchy this tribe
manifested a domineering and haughty and discontented spirit. "For more
than five hundred years, a period equal to that which elapsed between
the Norman Conquest and the War of the Roses, Ephraim, with its two
dependent tribes of Manasseh and Benjamin, exercised undisputed
pre-eminence. Joshua the first conqueror, Gideon the greatest of the
judges, and Saul the first king, belonged to one or other of the three
tribes. It was not till the close of the first period of Jewish history
that God 'refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of
Ephraim, but chose the tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion which he loved'
([Psa 78:67](../kjv/psa078.htm#067.md), [Psa
78:68](../kjv/psa078.htm#068).md). When the ark was removed from Shiloh to
Zion the power of Ephraim was humbled." Among the causes which operated
to bring about the disruption of Israel was Ephraim's jealousy of the
growing power of Judah. From the settlement of Canaan till the time of
David and Solomon, Ephraim had held the place of honour among the
tribes. It occupied the central and fairest portions of the land, and
had Shiloh and Shechem within its borders. But now when Jerusalem became
the capital of the kingdom, and the centre of power and worship for the
whole nation of Israel, Ephraim declined in influence. The discontent
came to a crisis by Rehoboam's refusal to grant certain redresses that
were demanded (1 Kings 12).

<span id="002">**Ephraim, Mount**</span> The central mountainous
district of Palestine occupied by the tribe of Ephraim ([Jos
17:15](../kjv/jos017.htm#015); [Jos 19:50](../kjv/jos019.htm#050.md); [Jos
20:7](../kjv/jos020.htm#007).md), extending from Bethel to the plain of
Jezreel. In Joshua's time ([Jos 17:18](../kjv/jos017.htm#018).md) these
hills were densely wooded. They were intersected by well-watered,
fertile valleys, referred to in [Jer 50:19](../kjv/jer050.htm#019.md).
Joshua was buried at Timnath-heres among the mountains of Ephraim, on
the north side of the hill of Gaash ([Jdg 2:9](../kjv/jdg002.htm#009).md).
This region is also called the "mountains of Israel" ([Jos
11:21](../kjv/jos011.htm#021).md) and the "mountains of Samaria" ([Jer
31:5](../kjv/jer031.htm#005), [Jer 31:6](../kjv/jer031.htm#006.md); [Amo
3:9](../kjv/amo003.htm#009).md).

<span id="003">**Ephraim, Gate of**</span> One of the gates of Jerusalem
([Kg2 14:13](../kjv/kg2014.htm#013.md); [Ch2
25:23](../kjv/ch2025.htm#023).md), on the side of the city looking toward
Ephraim, the north side.

<span id="004">**Ephraim, Wood of**</span> A forest in which a fatal
battle was fought between the army of David and that of Absalom, who was
killed there ([Sa2 18:6](../kjv/sa2018.htm#006.md), [Sa2
18:8](../kjv/sa2018.htm#008).md). It lay on the east of Jordan, not far
from Mahanaim, and was some part of the great forest of Gilead.

<span id="005">**Ephraim in the Wilderness**</span> ([Joh
11:54](../kjv/joh011.htm#054).md), a town to which our Lord retired with
his disciples after he had raised Lazarus, and when the priests were
conspiring against him. It lay in the wild, uncultivated hill-country to
the north-east of Jerusalem, between the central towns and the Jordan
valley.

<span id="006">**Ephratah**</span> Fruitful. (1.) The second wife of
Caleb, the son of Hezron, mother of Hur, and grandmother of Caleb, who
was one of those that were sent to spy the land ([Ch1
2:19](../kjv/ch1002.htm#019), [Ch1 2:50](../kjv/ch1002.htm#050)). (2..md)
The ancient name of Bethlehem in Judah ([Gen
35:16](../kjv/gen035.htm#016), [Gen 35:19](../kjv/gen035.htm#019.md); [Gen
48:7](../kjv/gen048.htm#007)). In [Rut 1:2](../kjv/rut001.htm#002.md) it is
called "Bethlehem-Judah," but the inhabitants are called "Ephrathites;"
in [Mic 5:2](../kjv/mic005.htm#002.md), "Bethlehem -Ephratah;" in [Mat
2:6](../kjv/mat002.htm#006.md), "Bethlehem in the land of Judah." In [Psa
132:6](../kjv/psa132.htm#006.md) it is mentioned as the place where David
spent his youth, and where he heard much of the ark, although he never
saw it till he found it long afterwards at Kirjath-jearim; i.e., the
"city of the wood," or the "forest-town" ([Sa1
7:1](../kjv/sa1007.htm#001); compare [Sa2 6:3](../kjv/sa2006.htm#003.md),
[Sa2 6:4](../kjv/sa2006.htm#004).md).

<span id="007">**Ephrathite**</span> A citizen of Ephratah, the old name
of Bethlehem ([Rut 1:2](../kjv/rut001.htm#002.md); [Sa1
17:12](../kjv/sa1017.htm#012).md), or Bethlehem-Judah.

<span id="008">**Ephron**</span> Fawn-like. (1.) The son of Zohar a
Hittite, the owner of the field and cave of Machpelah (q.v.), which
Abraham bought for 400 shekels of silver ([Gen
23:8](../kjv/gen023.htm#008); [Gen 25:9](../kjv/gen025.htm#009.md); [Gen
49:29](../kjv/gen049.htm#029), [Gen 49:30](../kjv/gen049.htm#030)). (2..md)
A mountain range which formed one of the landmarks on the north boundary
of the tribe of Judah ([Jos 15:9](../kjv/jos015.htm#009).md), probably the
range on the west side of the Wady Beit-Hanina.

<span id="009">**Epicureans**</span> Followers of Epicurus (who died at
Athens 270 B.C.), or adherents of the Epicurean philosophy ([Act
17:18](../kjv/act017.htm#018).md). This philosophy was a system of atheism,
and taught men to seek as their highest aim a pleasant and smooth life.
They have been called the "Sadducees" of Greek paganism. They, with the
Stoics, ridiculed the teaching of Paul ([Act
17:18](../kjv/act017.htm#018).md). They appear to have been greatly
esteemed at Athens.
