------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Vision**</span> ([Luk 1:22](../kjv/luk001.htm#022).md), a
vivid apparition, not a dream (compare [Luk
24:23](../kjv/luk024.htm#023); [Act 26:19](../kjv/act026.htm#019.md); [Co2
12:1](../kjv/co2012.htm#001).md).

<span id="001">**Vows**</span> Voluntary promises which, when once made,
were to be kept if the thing vowed was right. They were made under a
great variety of circumstances ([Gen 28:18](../kjv/gen028.htm#018.md); [Lev
7:16](../kjv/lev007.htm#016); [Num 30:2](../kjv/num030.htm#002.md); [Deu
23:18](../kjv/deu023.htm#018); [Jdg 11:30](../kjv/jdg011.htm#030.md), [Jdg
11:39](../kjv/jdg011.htm#039); [Sa1 1:11](../kjv/sa1001.htm#011.md); [Jon
1:16](../kjv/jon001.htm#016); [Act 18:18](../kjv/act018.htm#018.md); [Act
21:23](../kjv/act021.htm#023).md).

<span id="002">**Vulture**</span> (1.) Heb. da'ah ([Lev
11:14](../kjv/lev011.htm#014).md). In the parallel passage ([Deu
14:13](../kjv/deu014.htm#013).md) the Hebrew word used is ra'ah , rendered
" glede ;" LXX., " gups ;" Vulg., " milvus ." A species of ravenous
bird, distinguished for its rapid flight. "When used without the epithet
'red,' the name is commonly confined to the black kite. The habits of
the bird bear out the allusion in [Isa 34:15](../kjv/isa034.htm#015.md),
for it is, excepting during the winter three months, so numerous
everywhere in Palestine as to be almost gregarious." (See EAGLE.) (2.)
In [Job 28:7](../kjv/job028.htm#007.md) the Heb. 'ayyah is thus rendered.
The word denotes a clamorous and a keen-sighted bird of prey. In [Lev
11:14](../kjv/lev011.htm#014) and [Deu 14:13](../kjv/deu014.htm#013.md) it
is rendered "kite" (q.v.).

<span id="003">**Wafers**</span> Thin cakes ([Exo
16:31](../kjv/exo016.htm#031); [Exo 29:2](../kjv/exo029.htm#002.md), [Exo
29:23](../kjv/exo029.htm#023); [Lev 2:4](../kjv/lev002.htm#004.md); [Lev
7:12](../kjv/lev007.htm#012); [Lev 8:26](../kjv/lev008.htm#026.md); [Num
6:15](../kjv/num006.htm#015), [Num 6:19](../kjv/num006.htm#019).md) used in
various offerings.

<span id="004">**Wages**</span> Rate of (mention only in [Mat
20:2](../kjv/mat020.htm#002).md); to be punctually paid ([Lev
19:13](../kjv/lev019.htm#013); [Deu 24:14](../kjv/deu024.htm#014.md), [Deu
24:15](../kjv/deu024.htm#015).md); judgments threatened against the
withholding of ([Jer 22:13](../kjv/jer022.htm#013.md); [Mal
3:5](../kjv/mal003.htm#005); compare [Jam 5:4](../kjv/jam005.htm#004).md);
paid in money ([Mat 20:1](../kjv/mat020.htm#001).md); to Jacob in kind
([Gen 29:15](../kjv/gen029.htm#015), [Gen 29:20](../kjv/gen029.htm#020.md);
[Gen 30:28](../kjv/gen030.htm#028); [Gen 31:7](../kjv/gen031.htm#007.md),
[Gen 31:8](../kjv/gen031.htm#008), [Gen 31:41](../kjv/gen031.htm#041).md).

<span id="005">**Wagon**</span> Heb. aghalah ; so rendered in [Gen
45:19](../kjv/gen045.htm#019), [Gen 45:21](../kjv/gen045.htm#021.md), [Gen
45:27](../kjv/gen045.htm#027); [Gen 46:5](../kjv/gen046.htm#005.md); [Num
7:3](../kjv/num007.htm#003), [Num 7:7](../kjv/num007.htm#007.md), [Num
7:8](../kjv/num007.htm#008.md), but elsewhere rendered "cart" ([Sa1
6:7](../kjv/sa1006.htm#007), etc..md). This vehicle was used for peaceful
purposes. In [Eze 23:24](../kjv/eze023.htm#024.md), however, it is the
rendering of a different Hebrew word, and denotes a war-chariot.

<span id="006">**Wailing-place, Jews'**</span> A section of the western
wall of the temple area, where the Jews assemble every Friday afternoon
to bewail their desolate condition ([Psa 79:1](../kjv/psa079.htm#001.md),
[Psa 79:4](../kjv/psa079.htm#004), [Psa 79:5](../kjv/psa079.htm#005).md).
The stones in this part of the wall are of great size, and were placed,
as is generally believed, in the position in which they are now found in
the time of Solomon. "The congregation at the wailing-place i one of the
most solemn gatherings left to the Jewish Church, and as the writer
gazed at the motley concourse he experienced a feeling of sorrow that
the remnants of the chosen race should be heartlessly thrust outside the
sacred enclosure of their fathers' holy temple by men of an alien race
and an alien creed. Many of the elders, seated on the ground, with their
backs against the wall, on the west side of the area, and with their
faces turned toward the eternal house, read out of their well-thumbed
Hebrew books passages from the prophetic writings, such as [Isa
64:9](../kjv/isa064.htm#009)" (King's Recent Discoveries, etc..md). The
wailing-place of the Jews, viewed in its past spiritual and historic
relations, is indeed "the saddest nook in this vale of tears." (See
LAMENTATIONS, BOOK OF.)

<span id="007">**Wall**</span> Cities were surrounded by walls, as
distinguished from "unwalled villages" ([Eze
38:11](../kjv/eze038.htm#011); [Lev 25:29](../kjv/lev025.htm#029).md). They
were made thick and strong ([Num 13:28](../kjv/num013.htm#028.md); [Deu
3:5](../kjv/deu003.htm#005).md). Among the Jews walls were built of stone,
some of those in the temple being of great size ([Kg1
6:7](../kjv/kg1006.htm#007); [Kg1 7:9](../kjv/kg1007.htm#009.md); [Kg1
20:30](../kjv/kg1020.htm#030); [Mar 13:1](../kjv/mar013.htm#001.md), [Mar
13:2](../kjv/mar013.htm#002).md). The term is used metaphorically of
security and safety ([Isa 26:1](../kjv/isa026.htm#001.md); [Isa
60:18](../kjv/isa060.htm#018); [Rev 21:12](../kjv/rev021.htm#012).md). (See
FENCE.)

<span id="008">**Wandering**</span> Of the Israelites in the wilderness
in consequence of their rebellious fears to enter the Promised Land
([Num 14:26](../kjv/num014.htm#026).md). They wandered for forty years
before they were permitted to cross the Jordan ([Jos
4:19](../kjv/jos004.htm#019); [Jos 5:6](../kjv/jos005.htm#006).md). The
record of these wanderings is given in Num. 33:1-49. Many of the
stations at which they camped cannot now be identified. Questions of an
intricate nature have been discussed regarding the "Wanderings," but it
is enough for us to take the sacred narrative as it stands, and rest
assured that "He led them forth by the right way" ([Psa
107:1](../kjv/psa107.htm#001), [Psa 107:33](../kjv/psa107.htm#033).md).
(See WILDERNESS.)

<span id="009">**War**</span> The Israelites had to take possession of
the Promised Land by conquest. They had to engage in a long and bloody
war before the Canaanitish tribes were finally subdued. Except in the
case of Jericho and Ai, the war did not become aggressive till after the
death of Joshua. Till then the attack was always first made by the
Canaanites. Now the measure of the iniquity of the Canaanites was full,
and Israel was employed by God to sweep them away from off the face of
the earth. In entering on this new stage of the war, the tribe of Judah,
according to divine direction, took the lead. In the days of Saul and
David the people of Israel engaged in many wars with the nations around,
and after the division of the kingdom into two they often warred with
each other. They had to defend themselves also against the inroads of
the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and the Babylonians. The whole history of
Israel from first to last presents but few periods of peace. The
Christian life is represented as a warfare, and the Christian graces are
also represented under the figure of pieces of armour ([Eph
6:11](../kjv/eph006.htm#011); [Th1 5:8](../kjv/th1005.htm#008.md); [Ti2
2:3](../kjv/ti2002.htm#003), [Ti2 2:4](../kjv/ti2002.htm#004).md). The
final blessedness of believers is attained as the fruit of victory ([Rev
3:21](../kjv/rev003.htm#021).md).
