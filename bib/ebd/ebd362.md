<span id="000">**Tenth Deal**</span> I.e., the tenth part of an ephah
(as in the R.V.), equal to an omer or six pints. The recovered leper, to
complete his purification, was required to bring a trespass, a sin, and
a burnt offering, and to present a meal offering, a tenth deal or an
omer of flour for each, with oil to make it into bread or cakes ([Lev
14:10](../kjv/lev014.htm#010), [Lev 14:21](../kjv/lev014.htm#021.md);
compare [Exo 16:36](../kjv/exo016.htm#036.md); [Exo
29:40](../kjv/exo029.htm#040).md).

<span id="001">**Terah**</span> The wanderer; loiterer, for some unknown
reason emigrated with his family from his native mountains in the north
to the plains of Mesopotamia. He had three sons, Haran, Nahor, and
Abraham, and one daughter, Sarah. He settled in "Ur of the Chaldees,"
where his son Haran died, leaving behind him his son Lot. Nahor settled
at Haran, a place on the way to Ur. Terah afterwards migrated with
Abraham (probably his youngest son) and Lot (his grandson), together
with their families, from Ur, intending to go with them to Canaan; but
he tarried at Haran, where he spent the remainder of his days, and died
at the age of two hundred and five years ([Gen
11:24](../kjv/gen011.htm#024); [Jos 24:2](../kjv/jos024.htm#002).md). What
a wonderful part the descendants of this Chaldean shepherd have played
in the history of the world! See table of descendants: TERAH Haran Nahor
Abraham Iscah Milcah Lot Bethuel (Of Hagar) (Of Sarah) Moab Ammon Leban
Rebekah Ishmael Isaac Leah Rachel Esau Jacob (Of Leah) (Of Bilhah) (Of
Zilpah) (Of Rachel) Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun,
Dinah Dan Naphtali Gad Asher Joseph Benjamin Ephraim Manasseh

<span id="002">**Teraphim**</span> Givers of prosperity, idols in human
shape, large or small, analogous to the images of ancestors which were
revered by the Romans. In order to deceive the guards sent by Saul to
seize David, Michal his wife prepared one of the household teraphim,
putting on it the goat's, hair cap worn by sleepers and invalids, and
laid it in a bed, covering it with a mantle. She pointed it out to the
soldiers, and alleged that David was confined to his bed by a sudden
illness ([Sa1 19:13](../kjv/sa1019.htm#013).md). Thus she gained time for
David's escape. It seems strange to read of teraphim, images of
ancestors, preserved for superstitious purposes, being in the house of
David. Probably they had been stealthily brought by Michal from her
father's house. "Perhaps," says Bishop Wordsworth, "Saul, forsaken by
God and possessed by the evil spirit, had resorted to witchcraft); and
God overruled evil for good, and made his very teraphim (by the hand of
his own daughter) to be an instrument for David's escape.", Deane's
David, p. 32. Josiah attempted to suppress this form of idolatry ([Kg2
23:24](../kjv/kg2023.htm#024).md). The ephod and teraphim are mentioned
together in [Hos 3:4](../kjv/hos003.htm#004.md). It has been supposed by
some (Cheyne's Hosea) that the "ephod" here mentioned, and also in [Jdg
8:24](../kjv/jdg008.htm#024.md), was not the part of the sacerdotal dress
so called ([Exo 28:6](../kjv/exo028.htm#006).md), but an image of Jehovah
overlaid with gold or silver (compare [Jdg 17:1](../kjv/jdg017.htm#001.md),
18; [Sa1 21:9](../kjv/sa1021.htm#009.md); [Sa1
23:6](../kjv/sa1023.htm#006), [Sa1 23:9](../kjv/sa1023.htm#009.md); [Sa1
30:7](../kjv/sa1030.htm#007), [Sa1 30:8](../kjv/sa1030.htm#008).md), and is
thus associated with the teraphim. (See THUMMIM.)

<span id="003">**Terebinth**</span> (R.V. marg. of [Deu
11:30](../kjv/deu011.htm#030), etc..md), the Pistacia terebinthus of
botanists; a tree very common in the south and east of Palestine. (See
OAK.)

<span id="004">**Teresh**</span> Severe, a eunuch or chamberlain in the
palace of Ahasuerus, who conspired with another to murder him. The plot
was detected by Mordecai, and the conspirators were put to death ([Est
2:21](../kjv/est002.htm#021); [Est 6:2](../kjv/est006.htm#002).md).

<span id="005">**Tertius**</span> The third, a Roman Christian whom Paul
employed as his amanuensis in writing his epistle to the Romans ([Rom
16:22](../kjv/rom016.htm#022).md).

<span id="006">**Tertullus**</span> A modification of "Tertius;" a Roman
advocate, whom the Jews employed to state their case against Paul in the
presence of Felix ([Act 24:1](../kjv/act024.htm#001).md). The charges he
adduced against the apostle were, "First, that he created disturbances
among the Romans throughout the empire, an offense against the Roman
government (crimen majestatis). Secondly, that he was a ringleader of
the sect of the Nazarenes; disturbed the Jews in the exercise of their
religion, guaranteed by the state; introduced new gods, a thing
prohibited by the Romans. And thirdly, that he attempted to profane the
temple, a crime which the Jews were permitted to punish."

<span id="007">**Testament**</span> Occurs twelve times in the New
Testament ([Heb 9:15](../kjv/heb009.htm#015), etc..md) as the rendering of
the Gr. diatheke , which is twenty times rendered "covenant" in the
Authorized Version, and always so in the Revised Version. The Vulgate
translates incorrectly by testamentum, whence the names "Old" and "New
Testament," by which we now designate the two sections into which the
Bible is divided. (See BIBLE.)

<span id="008">**Testimony**</span> (1.) Witness or evidence ([Th2
1:10](../kjv/th2001.htm#010)). (2..md) The Scriptures, as the revelation of
God's will ([Kg2 11:12](../kjv/kg2011.htm#012.md); [Psa
19:7](../kjv/psa019.htm#007); [Psa 119:88](../kjv/psa119.htm#088.md); [Isa
8:16](../kjv/isa008.htm#016), [Isa 8:20](../kjv/isa008.htm#020)). (3..md)
The altar raised by the Gadites and Reubenites ([Jos
22:10](../kjv/jos022.htm#010).md).

<span id="009">**Testimony, Tabernacle of**</span> The tabernacle, the
great glory of which was that it contained "the testimony", i.e., the
"two tables" ([Exo 38:21](../kjv/exo038.htm#021).md). The ark in which
these tables were deposited was called the "ark of the testimony" ([Exo
40:3](../kjv/exo040.htm#003).md), and also simply the "testimony" ([Exo
27:21](../kjv/exo027.htm#021); [Exo 30:6](../kjv/exo030.htm#006).md).
