<span id="000">**Ozias**</span> Son of Joram ([Mat
1:8](../kjv/mat001.htm#008).md); called also Uzziah ([Kg2
15:32](../kjv/kg2015.htm#032), [Kg2 15:34](../kjv/kg2015.htm#034).md).

<span id="001">**Ozni**</span> Hearing, one of the sons of Gad; also
called Ezbon ([Gen 46:16](../kjv/gen046.htm#016.md); [Num
26:16](../kjv/num026.htm#016).md).

<span id="002">**Paarai**</span> Opening of the Lord, "the Arbite," one
of David's heroes ([Sa2 23:35](../kjv/sa2023.htm#035).md); called also
Naarai, [Ch1 11:37](../kjv/ch1011.htm#037.md).

<span id="003">**Padan**</span> A plain, occurring only in [Gen
48:7](../kjv/gen048.htm#007.md), where it designates Padan-aram.

<span id="004">**Padan-aram**</span> The plain of Aram, or the plain of
the highlands, ([Gen 25:20](../kjv/gen025.htm#020.md); [Gen
28:2](../kjv/gen028.htm#002), [Gen 28:5](../kjv/gen028.htm#005.md); [Gen
31:18](../kjv/gen031.htm#018), etc..md), commonly regarded as the district
of Mesopotamia (q.v.) lying around Haran.

<span id="005">**Pagiel**</span> God allots, a prince of the tribe of
Asher ([Num 1:13](../kjv/num001.htm#013).md), in the wilderness.

<span id="006">**Pahath-moab**</span> Governor of Moab, a person whose
descendants returned from the Captivity and assisted in rebuilding
Jerusalem ([Ezr 2:6](../kjv/ezr002.htm#006.md); [Ezr
8:4](../kjv/ezr008.htm#004); [Ezr 10:30](../kjv/ezr010.htm#030).md).

<span id="007">**Paint**</span> Jezebel "painted her face" ([Kg2
9:30](../kjv/kg2009.htm#030).md); and the practice of painting the face and
the eyes seems to have been common ([Jer 4:30](../kjv/jer004.htm#030.md);
[Eze 23:40](../kjv/eze023.htm#040).md). An allusion to this practice is
found in the name of Job's daughter ([Job 42:14](../kjv/job042.htm#014).md)
Kerenhappuch (q.v.). Paintings in the modern sense of the word were
unknown to the ancient Jews.

<span id="008">**Palace**</span> Used now only of royal dwellings,
although originally meaning simply (as the Latin word palatium , from
which it is derived, shows) a building surrounded by a fence or a
paling. In the Authorized Version there are many different words so
rendered, presenting different ideas, such as that of citadel or lofty
fortress or royal residence ([Neh 1:1](../kjv/neh001.htm#001.md); [Dan
8:2](../kjv/dan008.htm#002).md). It is the name given to the temple
fortress ([Neh 2:8](../kjv/neh002.htm#008).md) and to the temple itself
([Ch1 29:1](../kjv/ch1029.htm#001).md). It denotes also a spacious building
or a great house ([Dan 1:4](../kjv/dan001.htm#004.md); [Dan
4:4](../kjv/dan004.htm#004), [Dan 4:29](../kjv/dan004.htm#029.md); [Est
1:5](../kjv/est001.htm#005); [Est 7:7](../kjv/est007.htm#007).md), and a
fortified place or an enclosure ([Eze 25:4](../kjv/eze025.htm#004).md).
Solomon's palace is described in [Kg1 7:1](../kjv/kg1007.htm#001.md) as a
series of buildings rather than a single great structure. Thirteen years
were spent in their erection. This palace stood on the eastern hill,
adjoining the temple on the south. In the New Testament it designates
the official residence of Pilate or that of the high priest ([Mat
26:3](../kjv/mat026.htm#003), [Mat 26:58](../kjv/mat026.htm#058.md), [Mat
26:69](../kjv/mat026.htm#069); [Mar 14:54](../kjv/mar014.htm#054.md), [Mar
14:66](../kjv/mar014.htm#066); [Joh 18:15](../kjv/joh018.htm#015).md). In
[Phi 1:13](../kjv/phi001.htm#013.md) this word is the rendering of the
Greek praitorion , meaning the praetorian cohorts at Rome (the
life-guard of the Caesars). Paul was continually chained to a soldier of
that corps ([Act 28:16](../kjv/act028.htm#016).md), and hence his name and
sufferings became known in all the praetorium. The "soldiers that kept"
him would, on relieving one another on guard, naturally spread the
tidings regarding him among their comrades. Some, however, regard the
praetroium (q.v.) as the barrack within the palace (the palatium) of the
Caesars in Rome where a detachment of these praetorian guards was
stationed, or as the camp of the guards placed outside the eastern walls
of Rome. "In the chambers which were occupied as guard-rooms," says Dr.
Manning, "by the praetorian troops on duty in the palace, a number of
rude caricatures are found roughly scratched upon the walls, just such
as may be seen upon barrack walls in every part of the world. Amongst
these is one of a human figure nailed upon a cross. To add to the
'offense of the cross,' the crucified one is represented with the head
of an animal, probably that of an ass. Before it stands the figure of a
Roman legionary with one hand upraised in the attitude of worship.
Underneath is the rude, misspelled, ungrammatical inscription,
Alexamenos worships his god. It can scarcely be doubted that we have
here a contemporary caricature, executed by one of the praetorian guard,
ridiculing the faith of a Christian comrade."

<span id="009">**Palestine**</span> Originally denoted only the
sea-coast of the land of Canaan inhabited by the Philistines ([Exo
15:14](../kjv/exo015.htm#014); [Isa 14:29](../kjv/isa014.htm#029.md), [Isa
14:31](../kjv/isa014.htm#031); [Joe 3:4](../kjv/joe003.htm#004).md), and in
this sense exclusively the Hebrew name Pelesheth (rendered "Philistia"
in [Psa 60:8](../kjv/psa060.htm#008); [Psa 83:7](../kjv/psa083.htm#007.md);
[Psa 87:4](../kjv/psa087.htm#004); [Psa 108:9](../kjv/psa108.htm#009).md)
occurs in the Old Testament. Not till a late period in Jewish history
was this name used to denote "the land of the Hebrews" in general ([Gen
40:15](../kjv/gen040.htm#015).md). It is also called "the holy land" ([Zac
2:12](../kjv/zac002.htm#012).md), the "land of Jehovah" ([Hos
9:3](../kjv/hos009.htm#003); [Psa 85:1](../kjv/psa085.htm#001).md), the
"land of promise" ([Heb 11:9](../kjv/heb011.htm#009).md), because promised
to Abraham ([Gen 12:7](../kjv/gen012.htm#007.md); [Gen
24:7](../kjv/gen024.htm#007).md), the "land of Canaan" ([Gen
12:5](../kjv/gen012.htm#005).md), the "land of Israel" ([Sa1
13:19](../kjv/sa1013.htm#019).md), and the "land of Judah" ([Isa
19:17](../kjv/isa019.htm#017).md). See map, Mountains of Palestine The
territory promised as an inheritance to the seed of Abraham ([Gen
15:18](../kjv/gen015.htm#018); [Num 34:1](../kjv/num034.htm#001).md) was
bounded on the east by the river Euphrates, on the west by the
Mediterranean, on the north by the "entrance of Hamath," and on the
south by the "river of Egypt." This extent of territory, about 60,000
square miles, was at length conquered by David, and was ruled over also
by his son Solomon (2 Sam. 8; 1 Chr. 18; [Kg1
4:1](../kjv/kg1004.htm#001), [Kg1 4:21](../kjv/kg1004.htm#021).md). This
vast empire was the Promised Land; but Palestine was only a part of it,
terminating in the north at the southern extremity of the Lebanon range,
and in the south in the wilderness of Paran, thus extending in all to
about 144 miles in length. Its average breadth was about 60 miles from
the Mediterranean on the west to beyond the Jordan. It has fittingly
been designated "the least of all lands." Western Palestine, on the
south of Gaza, is only about 40 miles in breadth from the Mediterranean
to the Dead Sea, narrowing gradually toward the north, where it is only
20 miles from the sea-coast to the Jordan. Palestine, "set in the midst"
([Eze 5:5](../kjv/eze005.htm#005).md) of all other lands, is the most
remarkable country on the face of the earth. No single country of such
an extent has so great a variety of climate, and hence also of plant and
animal life. Moses describes it as "a good land, a land of brooks of
water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; a
land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a
land of oil olive, and honey; a land wherein thou shalt not eat bread
without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose
stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass" ([Deu
8:7](../kjv/deu008.htm#007).md). See map, Natural Divisions of Palestine
"In the time of Christ the country looked, in all probability, much as
now. The whole land consists of rounded limestone hills, fretted into
countless stony valleys, offering but rarely level tracts, of which
Esdraelon alone, below Nazareth, is large enough to be seen on the map.
The original woods had for ages disappeared, though the slopes were
dotted, as now, with figs, olives, and other fruit-trees where there was
any soil. Permanent streams were even then unknown, the passing rush of
winter torrents being all that was seen among the hills. The autumn and
spring rains, caught in deep cisterns hewn out like huge underground
jars in the soft limestone, with artificial mud-banked ponds still found
near all villages, furnished water. Hills now bare, or at best rough
with stunted growth, were then terraced, so as to grow vines, olives,
and grain. To-day almost desolate, the country then teemed with
population. Wine-presses cut in the rocks, endless terraces, and the
ruins of old vineyard towers are now found amidst solitudes overgrown
for ages with thorns and thistles, or with wild shrubs and poor gnarled
scrub" (Geikie's Life of Christ). From an early period the land was
inhabited by the descendants of Canaan, who retained possession of the
whole land "from Sidon to Gaza" till the time of the conquest by Joshua,
when it was occupied by the twelve tribes. Two tribes and a half had
their allotments given them by Moses on the east of the Jordan ([Deu
3:12](../kjv/deu003.htm#012.md); compare Num. 1:17-46; [Jos
4:12](../kjv/jos004.htm#012).md). The remaining tribes had their portion on
the west of Jordan. From the conquest till the time of Saul, about four
hundred years, the people were governed by judges. For a period of one
hundred and twenty years the kingdom retained its unity while it was
ruled by Saul and David and Solomon. On the death of Solomon, his son
Rehoboam ascended the throne; but his conduct was such that ten of the
tribes revolted, and formed an independent monarchy, called the kingdom
of Israel, or the northern kingdom, the capital of which was first
Shechem and afterwards Samaria. This kingdom was destroyed. The
Israelites were carried captive by Shalmanezer, king of Assyria, 722
B.C., after an independent existence of two hundred and fifty-three
years. The place of the captives carried away was supplied by tribes
brought from the east, and thus was formed the Samaritan nation ([Kg2
17:24](../kjv/kg2017.htm#024).md). Nebuchadnezzar came up against the
kingdom of the two tribes, the kingdom of Judah, the capital of which
was Jerusalem, one hundred and thirty-four years after the overthrow of
the kingdom of Israel. He overthrew the city, plundered the temple, and
carried the people into captivity to Babylon (587 B.C.), where they
remained seventy years. At the close of the period of the Captivity,
they returned to their own land, under the edict of Cyrus ([Ezr
1:1](../kjv/ezr001.htm#001).md). They rebuilt the city and temple, and
restored the old Jewish commonwealth. For a while after the Restoration
the Jews were ruled by Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, and afterwards by
the high priests, assisted by the Sanhedrin. After the death of
Alexander the Great at Babylon (323 B.C.), his vast empire was divided
between his four generals. Egypt, Arabia, Palestine, and Coele-Syria
fell to the lot of Ptolemy Lagus. Ptolemy took possession of Palestine
in 320 B.C., and carried nearly one hundred thousand of the inhabitants
of Jerusalem into Egypt. He made Alexandria the capital of his kingdom,
and treated the Jews with consideration, confirming them in the
enjoyment of many privileges. After suffering persecution at the hands
of Ptolemy's successors, the Jews threw off the Egyptian yoke, and
became subject to Antiochus the Great, the king of Syria. The cruelty
and oppression of the successors of Antiochus at length led to the
revolt under the Maccabees (163 B.C.), when they threw off the Syrian
yoke. In the year B.C. 68, Palestine was reduced by Pompey the Great to
a Roman province. He laid the walls of the city in ruins, and massacred
some twelve thousand of the inhabitants. He left the temple, however,
uninjured. About twenty-five years after this the Jews revolted and cast
off the Roman yoke. They were however, subdued by Herod the Great
(q.v.). The city and the temple were destroyed, and many of the
inhabitants were put to death. About B.C. 20, Herod proceeded to rebuild
the city and restore the ruined temple, which in about nine years and a
half was so far completed that the sacred services could be resumed in
it (Compare [Joh 2:20](../kjv/joh002.htm#020).md). He was succeeded by his
son Archelaus, who was deprived of his power, however, by Augustus, A.D.
6, when Palestine became a Roman province, ruled by Roman governors or
procurators. Pontius Pilate was the fifth of these procurators. He was
appointed to his office A.D. 25. Exclusive of Idumea, the kingdom of
Herod the Great comprehended the whole of the country originally divided
among the twelve tribes, which he divided into four provinces or
districts. This division was recognized so long as Palestine was under
the Roman dominion. These four provinces were, (1.) Judea, the southern
portion of the country; (2.) Samaria, the middle province, the northern
boundary of which ran along the hills to the south of the plain of
Esdraelon; (3.) Galilee, the northern province; and (4.) Peraea (a Greek
name meaning the "opposite country"), the country lying east of the
Jordan and the Dead Sea. This province was subdivided into these
districts, (a.) Peraea proper, lying between the rivers Arnon and
Jabbok; (b.) Galaaditis (Gilead); (c.) Batanaea ; (d.) Gaulonitis
(Jaulan); (e.) Ituraea or Auranitis , the ancient Bashan; (f.)
Trachonitis ; (g.) Abilene ; (h.) Decapolis , i.e., the region of the
ten cities. The whole territory of Palestine, including the portions
allotted to the trans-Jordan tribes, extended to about eleven thousand
square miles. Recent exploration has shown the territory on the west of
Jordan alone to be six thousand square miles in extent, the size of the
principality of Wales.
