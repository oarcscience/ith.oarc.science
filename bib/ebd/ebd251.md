(3.) A priest, father of Hilkiah ([Ch1 9:11](../kjv/ch1009.htm#011.md);
[Neh 11:11](../kjv/neh011.htm#011).md), in the reign of Ammon; called

<span id="002">**Meshullemeth**</span> Friend, the wife of Manasseh, and
the mother of Amon ([Kg2 21:19](../kjv/kg2021.htm#019).md), Kings of Judah.

<span id="003">**Mesopotamia**</span> The country between the two rivers
(Heb. Aram-naharaim ; i.e., "Syria of the two rivers"), the name given
by the Greeks and Romans to the region between the Euphrates and the
Tigris ([Gen 24:10](../kjv/gen024.htm#010.md); [Deu
23:4](../kjv/deu023.htm#004); [Jdg 3:8](../kjv/jdg003.htm#008.md), [Jdg
3:10](../kjv/jdg003.htm#010).md). In the Old Testament it is mentioned also
under the name "Padan-aram;" i.e., the plain of Aram, or Syria ([Gen
25:20](../kjv/gen025.htm#020).md). The northern portion of this fertile
plateau was the original home of the ancestors of the Hebrews (Gen. 11;
[Act 7:2](../kjv/act007.htm#002).md). From this region Isaac obtained his
wife Rebecca ([Gen 24:10](../kjv/gen024.htm#010.md), [Gen
24:15](../kjv/gen024.htm#015).md), and here also Jacob sojourned ([Gen
28:2](../kjv/gen028.htm#002).md) and obtained his wives, and here most of
his sons were born ([Gen 35:26](../kjv/gen035.htm#026.md); [Gen
46:15](../kjv/gen046.htm#015).md). The petty, independent tribes of this
region, each under its own prince, were warlike, and used chariots in
battle. They maintained their independence till after the time of David,
when they fell under the dominion of Assyria, and were absorbed into the
empire ([Kg2 19:13](../kjv/kg2019.htm#013).md).

<span id="004">**Mess**</span> A portion of food given to a guest ([Gen
43:34](../kjv/gen043.htm#034); [Sa2 11:8](../kjv/sa2011.htm#008).md).

<span id="005">**Messenger**</span> (Heb. mal'ak , Gr. angelos ), an
angel, a messenger who runs on foot, the bearer of dispatches ([Job
1:14](../kjv/job001.htm#014); [Sa1 11:7](../kjv/sa1011.htm#007.md); [Ch2
36:22](../kjv/ch2036.htm#022).md); swift of foot ([Kg2
9:18](../kjv/kg2009.htm#018).md).

<span id="006">**Messiah**</span> (Heb. mashiah ), in all the
thirty-nine instances of its occurring in the Old Testament, is rendered
by the LXX. "Christos." It means anointed. Thus priests ([Exo
28:41](../kjv/exo028.htm#041); [Exo 40:15](../kjv/exo040.htm#015.md); [Num
3:3](../kjv/num003.htm#003).md), prophets ([Kg1
19:16](../kjv/kg1019.htm#016).md), and kings ([Sa1
9:16](../kjv/sa1009.htm#016); [Sa1 16:3](../kjv/sa1016.htm#003.md); [Sa2
12:7](../kjv/sa2012.htm#007).md) were anointed with oil, and so consecrated
to their respective offices. The great Messiah is anointed "above his
fellows" ([Psa 45:7](../kjv/psa045.htm#007).md); i.e., he embraces in
himself all the three offices. The Greek form " Messias " is only twice
used in the New Testament, in [Joh 1:41](../kjv/joh001.htm#041.md) and [Joh
4:25](../kjv/joh004.htm#025) (R.V., "Messiah".md), and in the Old Testament
the word Messiah, as the rendering of the Hebrew, occurs only twice
([Dan 9:25](../kjv/dan009.htm#025), [Dan 9:26](../kjv/dan009.htm#026.md);
R.V., "the anointed one"). The first great promise ([Gen
3:15](../kjv/gen003.htm#015).md) contains in it the germ of all the
prophecies recorded in the Old Testament regarding the coming of the
Messiah and the great work he was to accomplish on earth. The prophecies
became more definite and fuller as the ages rolled on; the light shone
more and more unto the perfect day. Different periods of prophetic
revelation have been pointed out, (1.) the patriarchal; (2.) the Mosaic;
(3.) the period of David; (4.) the period of prophetism, i.e., of those
prophets whose works form a part of the Old Testament canon. The
expectations of the Jews were thus kept alive from generation to
generation, till the "fulness of the times," when Messiah came, "made of
a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law." In
him all these ancient prophecies have their fulfillment. Jesus of
Nazareth is the Messiah, the great Deliverer who was to come. (Compare
[Mat 26:54](../kjv/mat026.htm#054); [Mar 9:12](../kjv/mar009.htm#012.md);
[Luk 18:31](../kjv/luk018.htm#031); [Luk 22:37](../kjv/luk022.htm#037.md);
[Joh 5:39](../kjv/joh005.htm#039.md); Acts 2; [Act
16:31](../kjv/act016.htm#031); [Act 26:22](../kjv/act026.htm#022.md), [Act
26:23](../kjv/act026.htm#023)..md)

<span id="007">**Metheg-ammah**</span> Bridle of the mother a figurative
name for a chief city, as in [Sa2 8:1](../kjv/sa2008.htm#001.md), "David
took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines" (R.V., "took the
bridle of the mother-city"); i.e., subdued their capital or strongest
city, viz., Gath ([Ch1 18:1](../kjv/ch1018.htm#001).md).

<span id="008">**Methusael**</span> Champion of El; man of God, a
descendant of Cain ([Gen 4:18](../kjv/gen004.htm#018).md), so called,
perhaps, to denote that even among the descendants of Cain God had not
left himself without a witness.

<span id="009">**Methuselah**</span> Man of the dart, the son of Enoch,
and grandfather of Noah. He was the oldest man of whom we have any
record, dying at the age of nine hundred and sixty-nine years, in the
year of the Flood ([Gen 5:21](../kjv/gen005.htm#021.md); [Ch1
1:3](../kjv/ch1001.htm#003).md).
