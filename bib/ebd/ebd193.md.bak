<span id="000">**Jaasiel**</span> Made by God, one of David's
body-guard, the son of Abner ([Ch1 27:21](../kjv/ch1027.htm#021).md),
called Jasiel in [Ch1 11:47](../kjv/ch1011.htm#047.md).

<span id="001">**Jaaz-aniah**</span> Heard by Jehovah. (1.) The son of
Jeremiah, and one of the chief Rechabites ([Jer
35:3](../kjv/jer035.htm#003)). (2..md) The son of Shaphan ([Eze
8:11](../kjv/eze008.htm#011)). (3..md) The son of Azur, one of the
twenty-five men seen by Ezekiel ([Eze 11:1](../kjv/eze011.htm#001).md) at
the east gate of the temple. (4.) A Maachathite ([Kg2
25:23](../kjv/kg2025.htm#023); [Jer 40:8](../kjv/jer040.htm#008.md); [Jer
42:1](../kjv/jer042.htm#001).md). He is also called Azariah ([Jer
43:2](../kjv/jer043.htm#002).md).

<span id="002">**Jaazer**</span> He (God) helps, a city of the Amorites
on the east of Jordan, and assigned, with neighbouring places in Gilead,
to Gad ([Num 32:1](../kjv/num032.htm#001.md), [Num
32:35](../kjv/num032.htm#035); [Jos 13:25](../kjv/jos013.htm#025).md). It
was allotted to the Merarite Levites ([Jos
21:39](../kjv/jos021.htm#039).md). In David's time it was occupied by the
Hebronites, i.e., the descendants of Kohath ([Ch1
26:31](../kjv/ch1026.htm#031).md). It is mentioned in the "burdens"
proclaimed over Moab ([Isa 16:8](../kjv/isa016.htm#008.md), [Isa
16:9](../kjv/isa016.htm#009); [Jer 48:32](../kjv/jer048.htm#032).md). Its
site is marked by the modern ruin called Sar or Seir, about 10 miles
west of Amman, and 12 from Heshbon. "The vineyards that once covered the
hill-sides are gone; and the wild Bedawin from the eastern desert make
cultivation of any kind impossible."

<span id="003">**Jaaziah**</span> Comforted by Jehovah, a descendant of
Merari the Levite ([Ch1 24:26](../kjv/ch1024.htm#026.md), [Ch1
24:27](../kjv/ch1024.htm#027).md).

<span id="004">**Jaaziel**</span> Comforted by God, a Levitical musician
([Ch1 15:18](../kjv/ch1015.htm#018).md).

<span id="005">**Jabal**</span> A stream, a descendant of Cain, and
brother of Jubal; "the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle"
([Gen 4:20](../kjv/gen004.htm#020).md). This description indicates that he
led a wandering life.

<span id="006">**Jabbok**</span> A pouring out, or a wrestling, one of
the streams on the east of Jordan, into which it falls about midway
between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea, or about 45 miles below the
Sea of Galilee. It rises on the eastern side of the mountains of Gilead,
and runs a course of about 65 miles in a wild and deep ravine. It was
the boundary between the territory of the Ammonites and that of Og, king
of Bashan ([Jos 12:1](../kjv/jos012.htm#001.md); [Num
21:24](../kjv/num021.htm#024).md); also between the tribe of Reuben and the
half tribe of Manasseh ([Num 21:24](../kjv/num021.htm#024.md); [Deu
3:16](../kjv/deu003.htm#016).md). In its course westward across the plains
it passes more than once underground. "The scenery along its banks is
probably the most picturesque in Palestine; and the ruins of town and
village and fortress which stud the surrounding mountain-side render the
country as interesting as it is beautiful." This river is now called the
Zerka, or blue river.

<span id="007">**Jabesh**</span> Dry. (1.) For Jabesh-Gilead ([Sa1
11:3](../kjv/sa1011.htm#003), [Sa1 11:9](../kjv/sa1011.htm#009.md), [Sa1
11:10](../kjv/sa1011.htm#010)). (2..md) The father of Shallum ([Kg2
15:10](../kjv/kg2015.htm#010), [Kg2 15:13](../kjv/kg2015.htm#013.md), [Kg2
15:14](../kjv/kg2015.htm#014).md), who usurped the throne of Israel on the
death of Zachariah.

<span id="008">**Jabesh-Gilead**</span> A town on the east of Jordan, on
the top of one of the green hills of Gilead, within the limits of the
half tribe of Manasseh, and in full view of Beth-shan. It is first
mentioned in connection with the vengeance taken on its inhabitants
because they had refused to come up to Mizpeh to take part with Israel
against the tribe of Benjamin ([Jdg 21:8](../kjv/jdg021.htm#008).md). After
the battles at Gibeah, that tribe was almost extinguished, only six
hundred men remaining. An expedition went against Jabesh-Gilead, the
whole of whose inhabitants were put to the sword, except four hundred
maidens, whom they brought as prisoners and sent to "proclaim peace" to
the Benjamites who had fled to the crag Rimmon. These captives were
given to them as wives, that the tribe might be saved from extinction
(Judg. 21). This city was afterwards taken by Nahash, king of the
Ammonites, but was delivered by Saul, the newly-elected king of Israel.
In gratitude for this deliverance, forty years after this, the men of
Jabesh-Gilead took down the bodies of Saul and of his three sons from
the walls of Beth-shan, and after burning them, buried the bones under a
tree near the city ([Sa1 31:11](../kjv/sa1031.htm#011).md). David thanked
them for this act of piety ([Sa2 2:4](../kjv/sa2002.htm#004).md), and
afterwards transferred the remains to the royal sepulchre ([Sa2
21:14](../kjv/sa2021.htm#014).md). It is identified with the ruins of
ed-Deir, about 6 miles south of Pella, on the north of the Wady Yabis.

<span id="009">**Jabez**</span> Affiction. (1.) A descendant of Judah,
of whom it is recorded that "God granted him that which he requested"
([Ch1 4:9](../kjv/ch1004.htm#009), [Ch1 4:10](../kjv/ch1004.htm#010).md).
(2.) A place inhabited by several families of the scribes ([Ch1
2:55](../kjv/ch1002.htm#055).md).
