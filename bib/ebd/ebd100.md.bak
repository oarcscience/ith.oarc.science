<span id="000">**Debtor**</span> Various regulations as to the relation
between debtor and creditor are laid down in the Scriptures. (1.) The
debtor was to deliver up as a pledge to the creditor what he could most
easily dispense with ([Deu 24:10](../kjv/deu024.htm#010.md), [Deu
24:11](../kjv/deu024.htm#011)). (2..md) A mill, or millstone, or upper
garment, when given as a pledge, could not be kept over night ([Exo
22:26](../kjv/exo022.htm#026), [Exo 22:27](../kjv/exo022.htm#027)). (3..md)
A debt could not be exacted during the Sabbatic year ([Deu
15:1](../kjv/deu015.htm#001).md). For other laws bearing on this relation
see [Lev 25:14](../kjv/lev025.htm#014.md), [Lev
25:32](../kjv/lev025.htm#032), [Lev 25:39](../kjv/lev025.htm#039.md); [Mat
18:25](../kjv/mat018.htm#025), [Mat 18:34](../kjv/mat018.htm#034). (4..md)
A surety was liable in the same way as the original debtor ([Pro
11:15](../kjv/pro011.htm#015); [Pro 17:18](../kjv/pro017.htm#018).md).

<span id="001">**Decalogue**</span> The name given by the Greek fathers
to the ten commandments; "the ten words," as the original is more
literally rendered ([Exo 20:3](../kjv/exo020.htm#003).md). These
commandments were at first written on two stone slabs ([Exo
31:18](../kjv/exo031.htm#018).md), which were broken by Moses throwing them
down on the ground ([Exo 32:19](../kjv/exo032.htm#019).md). They were
written by God a second time ([Exo 34:1](../kjv/exo034.htm#001).md). The
decalogue is alluded to in the New Testament five times ([Mat
5:17](../kjv/mat005.htm#017), [Mat 5:18](../kjv/mat005.htm#018.md), [Mat
5:19](../kjv/mat005.htm#019); [Mar 10:19](../kjv/mar010.htm#019.md); [Luk
18:20](../kjv/luk018.htm#020); [Rom 7:7](../kjv/rom007.htm#007.md), [Rom
7:8](../kjv/rom007.htm#008); [Rom 13:9](../kjv/rom013.htm#009.md); [Ti1
1:9](../kjv/ti1001.htm#009), [Ti1 1:10](../kjv/ti1001.htm#010).md). These
commandments have been divided since the days of Origen the Greek
father, as they stand in the Confession of all the Reformed Churches
except the Lutheran. The division adopted by Luther, and which has ever
since been received in the Lutheran Church, makes the first two
commandments one, and the third the second, and so on to the last, which
is divided into two. "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house" being
ranked as ninth, and "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife," etc.,
the tenth. (See COMMANDMENTS.

<span id="002">**Decapolis**</span> Ten cities = deka, ten, and polis, a
city, a district on the east and south-east of the Sea of Galilee
containing "ten cities," which were chiefly inhabited by Greeks. It
included a portion of Bashan and Gilead, and is mentioned three times in
the New Testament ([Mat 4:25](../kjv/mat004.htm#025.md); [Mar
5:20](../kjv/mar005.htm#020); [Mar 7:31](../kjv/mar007.htm#031).md). These
cities were Scythopolis, i.e., "city of the Scythians", (ancient
Bethshean, the only one of the ten cities on the west of Jordan),
Hippos, Gadara, Pella (to which the Christians fled just before the
destruction of Jerusalem), Philadelphia (ancient Rabbath-ammon), Gerasa,
Dion, Canatha, Raphana, and Damascus. When the Romans conquered Syria
(B.C. 65) they rebuilt, and endowed with certain privileges, these "ten
cities," and the province connected with them they called "Decapolis."

<span id="003">**Decision, Valley of**</span> A name given to the valley
of Jehoshaphat (q.v.) as the vale of the sentence. The scene of
Jehovah's signal inflictions on Zion's enemies ([Joe
3:14](../kjv/joe003.htm#014.md); marg., "valley of concision or
threshing").

<span id="004">**Decrees of God**</span> The decrees of God are his
eternal, unchangeable, holy, wise, and sovereign purpose, comprehending
at once all things that ever were or will be in their causes,
conditions, successions, and relations, and determining their certain
futurition. The several contents of this one eternal purpose are,
because of the limitation of our faculties, necessarily conceived of by
us in partial aspects, and in logical relations, and are therefore
styled Decrees." The decree being the act of an infinite, absolute,
eternal, unchangeable, and sovereign Person, comprehending a plan
including all his works of all kinds, great and small, from the
beginning of creation to an unending eternity; ends as well as means,
causes as well as effects, conditions and instrumentalities as well as
the events which depend upon them, must be incomprehensible by the
finite intellect of man. The decrees are eternal ([Act
15:18](../kjv/act015.htm#018); [Eph 1:4](../kjv/eph001.htm#004.md); [Th2
2:13](../kjv/th2002.htm#013).md), unchangeable ([Psa
33:11](../kjv/psa033.htm#011); [Isa 46:9](../kjv/isa046.htm#009).md), and
comprehend all things that come to pass ([Eph
1:11](../kjv/eph001.htm#011); [Mat 10:29](../kjv/mat010.htm#029.md), [Mat
10:30](../kjv/mat010.htm#030); [Eph 2:10](../kjv/eph002.htm#010.md); [Act
2:23](../kjv/act002.htm#023); [Act 4:27](../kjv/act004.htm#027.md), [Act
4:28](../kjv/act004.htm#028); [Psa 17:13](../kjv/psa017.htm#013.md), [Psa
17:14](../kjv/psa017.htm#014)). The decrees of God are (1..md) efficacious,
as they respect those events he has determined to bring about by his own
immediate agency; or (2.) permissive, as they respect those events he
has determined that free agents shall be permitted by him to effect.
This doctrine ought to produce in our minds "humility, in view of the
infinite greatness and sovereignty of God, and of the dependence of man;
confidence and implicit reliance upon wisdom, righteousness, goodness,
and immutability of God's purpose."

<span id="005">**Dedan**</span> Low ground. (1.) A son of Raamah ([Gen
10:7](../kjv/gen010.htm#007).md). His descendants are mentioned in [Isa
21:13](../kjv/isa021.htm#013), and [Eze 27:15](../kjv/eze027.htm#015.md).
They probably settled among the sons of Cush, on the north-west coast of
the Persian Gulf. (2.) A son of Jokshan, Abraham's son by Keturah ([Ch1
1:32](../kjv/ch1001.htm#032).md). His descendants settled on the Syrian
borders about the territory of Edom. They probably led a pastoral life.

<span id="006">**Dedanim**</span> The descendants of Dedan, the son of
Raamah. They are mentioned in [Isa 21:13](../kjv/isa021.htm#013.md) as
sending out "traveling companies" which lodged "in the forest of
Arabia." They are enumerated also by Ezekiel ([Eze
27:20](../kjv/eze027.htm#020).md) among the merchants who supplied Tyre
with precious things.

<span id="007">**Dedication, Feast of the**</span> ([Joh
10:22](../kjv/joh010.htm#022), [Joh 10:42](../kjv/joh010.htm#042).md),i.e.,
the feast of the renewing. It was instituted 164 B.C. to commemorate the
purging of the temple after its pollution by Antiochus Epiphanes (167
B.C.), and the rebuilding of the altar after the Syrian invaders had
been driven out by Judas Maccabaeus. It lasted for eight days, beginning
on the 25th of the month Chisleu (December), which was often a period of
heavy rains ([Ezr 10:9](../kjv/ezr010.htm#009.md), [Ezr
10:13](../kjv/ezr010.htm#013).md). It was an occasion of much rejoicing and
festivity. But there were other dedications of the temple. (1.) That of
Solomon's temple ([Kg1 8:2](../kjv/kg1008.htm#002.md); [Ch2
5:3](../kjv/ch2005.htm#003)); (2..md) the dedication in the days of
Hezekiah (2 Chr. 29); and (3.) the dedication of the temple after the
Captivity ([Ezr 6:16](../kjv/ezr006.htm#016).md).

<span id="008">**Deep**</span> Used to denote (1.) the grave or the
abyss ([Rom 10:7](../kjv/rom010.htm#007.md); [Luk
8:31](../kjv/luk008.htm#031)); (2..md) the deepest part of the sea ([Psa
69:15](../kjv/psa069.htm#015)); (3..md) the chaos mentioned in [Gen
1:2](../kjv/gen001.htm#002); (4..md) the bottomless pit, hell ([Rev
9:1](../kjv/rev009.htm#001), [Rev 9:2](../kjv/rev009.htm#002.md); [Rev
11:7](../kjv/rev011.htm#007); [Rev 20:13](../kjv/rev020.htm#013).md).

<span id="009">**Degrees, Song of**</span> Song of steps, a title given
to each of these fifteen psalms, Ps. 120-134 inclusive. The probable
origin of this name is the circumstance that these psalms came to be
snug by the people on the ascents or goings up to Jerusalem to attend
the three great festivals ([Deu 16:16](../kjv/deu016.htm#016).md). They
were well fitted for being sung by the way from their peculiar form, and
from the sentiments they express. "They are characterized by brevity, by
a key-word, by epanaphora \[i.e., repetition\], and by their
epigrammatic style...More than half of them are cheerful, and all of
them hopeful." They are sometimes called "Pilgrim Songs." Four of them
were written by David, one ([Psa 127:1](../kjv/psa127.htm#001).md) by
Solomon, and the rest are anonymous.
