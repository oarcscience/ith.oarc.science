<span id="000">**Madmen**</span> Ibid., a Moabite town threatened with
the sword of the Babylonians ([Jer 48:2](../kjv/jer048.htm#002).md).

<span id="001">**Madmenah**</span> Ibid., a town in Benjamin, not far
from Jerusalem, towards the north ([Isa 10:31](../kjv/isa010.htm#031).md).
The same Hebrew word occurs in [Isa 25:10](../kjv/isa025.htm#010.md), where
it is rendered "dunghill." This verse has, however, been interpreted as
meaning "that Moab will be trodden down by Jehovah as teben \[broken
straw\] is trodden to fragments on the threshing-floors of Madmenah."

<span id="002">**Madness**</span> This word is used in its proper sense
in [Deu 28:34](../kjv/deu028.htm#034.md), [Joh
10:20](../kjv/joh010.htm#020), [Co1 14:23](../kjv/co1014.htm#023.md). It
also denotes a reckless state of mind arising from various causes, as
over-study ([Ecc 1:17](../kjv/ecc001.htm#017.md); [Ecc
2:12](../kjv/ecc002.htm#012).md), blind rage ([Luk
6:11](../kjv/luk006.htm#011).md), or a depraved temper ([Ecc
7:25](../kjv/ecc007.htm#025); [Ecc 9:3](../kjv/ecc009.htm#003.md); [Pe2
2:16](../kjv/pe2002.htm#016).md). David feigned madness ([Sa1
21:13](../kjv/sa1021.htm#013).md) at Gath because he "was sore afraid of
Achish."

<span id="003">**Madon**</span> Strife, a Canaanitish city in the north
of Palestine ([Jos 11:1](../kjv/jos011.htm#001.md); [Jos
12:19](../kjv/jos012.htm#019).md), whose king was slain by Joshua; perhaps
the ruin Madin, near Hattin, some 5 miles west of Tiberias.

<span id="004">**Magdala**</span> A tower, a town in Galilee, mentioned
only in [Mat 15:39](../kjv/mat015.htm#039.md). In the parallel passage in
[Mar 8:10](../kjv/mar008.htm#010.md) this place is called Dalmanutha. It
was the birthplace of Mary called the Magdalen, or Mary Magdalene. It
was on the west shore of the Lake of Tiberias, and is now probably the
small obscure village called el-Mejdel, about 3 miles north-west of
Tiberias. In the Talmud this city is called "the city of colour," and a
particular district of it was called "the tower of dyers." The indigo
plant was much cultivated here.

<span id="005">**Magdalene**</span> A surname derived from Magdala, the
place of her nativity, given to one of the Marys of the Gospels to
distinguish her from the other Marys ([Mat
27:56](../kjv/mat027.htm#056), [Mat 27:61](../kjv/mat027.htm#061.md); [Mat
28:1](../kjv/mat028.htm#001), etc..md). A mistaken notion has prevailed
that this Mary was a woman of bad character, that she was the woman who
is emphatically called "a sinner" ([Luk 7:36](../kjv/luk007.htm#036).md).
(See MARY.)

<span id="006">**Magic**</span> The Jews seem early to have consulted
the teraphim (q.v.) for oracular answers ([Jdg
18:5](../kjv/jdg018.htm#005), [Jdg 18:6](../kjv/jdg018.htm#006.md); [Zac
10:2](../kjv/zac010.htm#002).md). There is a remarkable illustration of
this divining by teraphim in [Eze 21:19](../kjv/eze021.htm#019.md). We read
also of the divining cup of Joseph ([Gen 44:5](../kjv/gen044.htm#005).md).
The magicians of Egypt are frequently referred to in the history of the
Exodus. Magic was an inherent part of the ancient Egyptian religion, and
entered largely into their daily life. All magical arts were distinctly
prohibited under penalty of death in the Mosaic law. The Jews were
commanded not to learn the "abomination" of the people of the Promised
Land ([Lev 19:31](../kjv/lev019.htm#031.md); [Deu
18:9](../kjv/deu018.htm#009).md). The history of Saul's consulting the
witch of Endor (1 Sam. 28:3-20) gives no warrant for attributing
supernatural power to magicians. From the first the witch is here only a
bystander. The practice of magic lingered among the people till after
the Captivity, when they gradually abandoned it. It is not much referred
to in the New Testament. The Magi mentioned in [Mat
2:1](../kjv/mat002.htm#001.md) were not magicians in the ordinary sense of
the word. They belonged to a religious caste, the followers of
Zoroaster, the astrologers of the East. Simon, a magician, was found by
Philip at Samaria (Acts 8:9-24); and Paul and Barnabas encountered
Elymas, a Jewish sorcerer, at Paphos ([Act
13:6](../kjv/act013.htm#006).md). At Ephesus there was a great destruction
of magical books ([Act 19:18](../kjv/act019.htm#018.md), [Act
19:19](../kjv/act019.htm#019).md).

<span id="007">**Magicians**</span> Heb. hartumim , ([Dan
1:20](../kjv/dan001.htm#020).md) were sacred scribes who acted as
interpreters of omens, or "revealer of secret things."

<span id="008">**Magistrate**</span> A public civil officer invested
with authority. The Hebrew shophetim, or judges, were magistrates having
authority in the land ([Deu 1:16](../kjv/deu001.htm#016.md), [Deu
1:17](../kjv/deu001.htm#017)). In [Jdg 18:7](../kjv/jdg018.htm#007.md) the
word "magistrate" (A.V.) is rendered in the Revised Version "possessing
authority", i.e., having power to do them harm by invasion. In the time
of Ezra ([Ezr 9:2](../kjv/ezr009.htm#002).md) and Nehemiah ([Neh
2:16](../kjv/neh002.htm#016); [Neh 4:14](../kjv/neh004.htm#014.md); [Neh
13:11](../kjv/neh013.htm#011).md) the Jewish magistrates were called
seganim, properly meaning "nobles." In the New Testament the Greek word
archon , rendered "magistrate" ([Luk 12:58](../kjv/luk012.htm#058.md); [Tit
3:1](../kjv/tit003.htm#001).md), means one first in power, and hence a
prince, as in [Mat 20:25](../kjv/mat020.htm#025.md), [Co1
2:6](../kjv/co1002.htm#006), [Co1 2:8](../kjv/co1002.htm#008.md). This term
is used of the Messiah, "Prince of the kings of the earth" ([Rev
1:5](../kjv/rev001.htm#005)). In [Act 16:20](../kjv/act016.htm#020.md),
[Act 16:22](../kjv/act016.htm#022), [Act 16:35](../kjv/act016.htm#035.md),
[Act 16:36](../kjv/act016.htm#036), [Act 16:38](../kjv/act016.htm#038.md),
the Greek term strategos , rendered "magistrate," properly signifies the
leader of an army, a general, one having military authority. The
strategoi were the duumviri, the two praetors appointed to preside over
the administration of justice in the colonies of the Romans. They were
attended by the sergeants (properly lictors or "rod bearers").

<span id="009">**Magog**</span> Region of Gog, the second of the "sons"
of Japheth ([Gen 10:2](../kjv/gen010.htm#002.md); [Ch1
1:5](../kjv/ch1001.htm#005).md). In Ezekiel ([Eze
38:2](../kjv/eze038.htm#002); [Eze 39:6](../kjv/eze039.htm#006).md) it is
the name of a nation, probably some Scythian or Tartar tribe descended
from Japheth. They are described as skilled horsemen, and expert in the
use of the bow. The Latin father Jerome says that this word denotes
"Scythian nations, fierce and innumerable, who live beyond the Caucasus
and the Lake Maeotis, and near the Caspian Sea, and spread out even
onward to India." Perhaps the name "represents the Assyrian Mat Gugi, or
'country of Gugu,' the Gyges of the Greeks" (Sayce's Races, etc.).
