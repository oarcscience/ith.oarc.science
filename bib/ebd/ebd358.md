<span id="000">**Talitha Cumi**</span> ([Mar
5:41](../kjv/mar005.htm#041)), a Syriac or Aramaic expression, meaning,
"Littlemaid, arise." Peter, who was present when the miracle was
wrought, recalled the actual words used by our Lord, and told them to
Mark.

<span id="001">**Talmai**</span> Abounding in furrows. (1.) One of the
Anakim of Hebron, who were slain by the men of Judah under Caleb ([Num
13:22](../kjv/num013.htm#022); [Jos 15:14](../kjv/jos015.htm#014); [Jdg
1:10](../kjv/jdg001.htm#010)). (2.) A king of Geshur, to whom Absalom
fled after he had put Amnon to death ([Sa2 3:3](../kjv/sa2003.htm#003);
[Sa2 13:37](../kjv/sa2013.htm#037)). His daughter, Maachah, was one of
David's wives, and the mother of Absalom ([Ch1
3:2](../kjv/ch1003.htm#002)).

<span id="002">**Talmon**</span> Oppressed. (1.) A Levite porter ([Ch1
9:17](../kjv/ch1009.htm#017); [Neh 11:19](../kjv/neh011.htm#019)). (2.)
One whose descendants returned with Zerubbabel to Jerusalem ([Ezr
2:42](../kjv/ezr002.htm#042); [Neh 7:45](../kjv/neh007.htm#045));
probably the same as (1.).

<span id="003">**Tamar**</span> Palm. (1.) A place mentioned by Ezekiel
([Eze 47:19](../kjv/eze047.htm#019); [Eze
48:28](../kjv/eze048.htm#028)), on the southeastern border of Palestine.
Some suppose this was "Tadmor" (q.v.). (2.) The daughter-in-law of
Judah, to whose eldest son, Er, she was married ([Gen
38:6](../kjv/gen038.htm#006)). After her husband's death, she was
married to Onan, his brother ([Gen 38:8](../kjv/gen038.htm#008)), and on
his death, Judah promised to her that his third son, Shelah, would
become her husband. This promise was not fulfilled, and hence Tamar's
revenge and Judah's great guilt (Gen. 38:12-30). (3.) A daughter of
David (2 Sam. 13:1-32; [Ch1 3:9](../kjv/ch1003.htm#009)), whom Amnon
shamefully outraged and afterwards "hated exceedingly," thereby
illustrating the law of human nature noticed even by the heathen,
"Proprium humani ingenii est odisse quem laeseris", i.e., "It is the
property of human nature to hate one whom you have injured." (4.) A
daughter of Absalom ([Sa2 14:27](../kjv/sa2014.htm#027)).

<span id="004">**Tamarisk**</span> Heb. 'eshel ([Gen
21:33](../kjv/gen021.htm#033); [Sa1 22:6](../kjv/sa1022.htm#006); [Sa1
31:13](../kjv/sa1031.htm#013), in the R.V.; but in A.V., "grove,"
"tree"); Arab. asal . Seven species of this tree are found in Palestine.
It is a "very graceful tree, with long feathery branches and tufts
closely clad with the minuteness of leaves, and surmounted in spring
with spikes of beautiful pink blossoms, which seem to envelop the whole
tree in one gauzy sheet of colour" (Tristram's Nat. Hist.).

<span id="005">**Tammuz**</span> A corruption of Dumuzi, the Accadian
sun-god (the Adonis of the Greeks), the husband of the goddess Ishtar.
In the Chaldean calendar there was a month set apart in honour of this
god, the month of June to July, the beginning of the summer solstice. At
this festival, which lasted six days, the worshippers, with loud
lamentations, bewailed the funeral of the god, they sat "weeping for
Tammuz" ([Eze 8:14](../kjv/eze008.htm#014)). The name, also borrowed
from Chaldea, of one of the months of the Hebrew calendar.

<span id="006">**Tanhumeth**</span> Consolation, a Netophathite; one of
the captains who supported Gedaliah ([Kg2 25:23](../kjv/kg2025.htm#023);
[Jer 40:8](../kjv/jer040.htm#008)).

<span id="007">**Tanis**</span> ([Eze 30:14](../kjv/eze030.htm#014),
marg.). See ZOAN.

<span id="008">**Tappuah**</span> Apple-region. (1.) A town in the
valley or lowland of Judah; formerly a royal city of the Canaanites
([Jos 12:17](../kjv/jos012.htm#017); [Jos
15:34](../kjv/jos015.htm#034)). It is now called Tuffuh, about 12 miles
west of Jerusalem. (2.) A town on the border of Ephraim ([Jos
16:8](../kjv/jos016.htm#008)). The "land" of Tappuah fell to Manasseh,
but the "city" to Ephraim ([Jos 17:8](../kjv/jos017.htm#008)). (3.)
En-tappuah - The well of the apple probably one of the springs near
Yassuf ([Jos 17:7](../kjv/jos017.htm#007)).

<span id="009">**Tarah**</span> Stopping; station, an encampment of the
Hebrews in the wilderness ([Num 33:27](../kjv/num033.htm#027), [Num
33:28](../kjv/num033.htm#028)).
