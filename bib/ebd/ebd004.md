<span id="000">**Abimelech**</span> My father a king, or father of a
king, a common name of the Philistine kings, as "Pharaoh" was of the
Egyptian kings. (1.) The Philistine king of Gerar in the time of Abraham
(Gen. 20:1-18). By an interposition of Providence, Sarah was delivered
from his harem, and was restored to her husband Abraham. As a mark of
respect he gave to Abraham valuable gifts, and offered him a settlement
in any part of his country; while at the same time he delicately and yet
severely rebuked him for having practiced a deception upon him in
pretending that Sarah was only his sister. Among the gifts presented by
the king were a thousand pieces of silver as a "covering of the eyes"
for Sarah; i.e., either as an atoning gift and a testimony of her
innocence in the sight of all, or rather for the purpose of procuring a
veil for Sarah to conceal her beauty, and thus as a reproof to her for
not having worn a veil which, as a married woman, she ought to have
done. A few years after this Abimelech visited Abraham, who had removed
southward beyond his territory, and there entered into a league of peace
and friendship with him. This league was the first of which we have any
record. It was confirmed by a mutual oath at Beer-sheba ([Gen
21:22](../kjv/gen021.htm#022)). (2..md) A king of Gerar in the time of
Isaac, probably the son of the preceding (Gen. 26:1-22). Isaac sought
refuge in his territory during a famine, and there he acted a part with
reference to his wife Rebekah similar to that of his father Abraham with
reference to Sarah. Abimelech rebuked him for the deception, which he
accidentally discovered. Isaac settled for a while here, and prospered.
Abimelech desired him, however, to leave his territory, which Isaac did.
Abimelech afterwards visited him when he was encamped at Beer-sheba, and
expressed a desire to renew the covenant which had been entered into
between their fathers ([Gen 26:26](../kjv/gen026.htm#026)). (3..md) A son
of Gideon ([Jdg 9:1](../kjv/jdg009.htm#001).md), who was proclaimed king
after the death of his father (Judg. 8:33-9:6). One of his first acts
was to murder his brothers, seventy in number, "on one stone," at
Ophrah. Only one named Jotham escaped. He was an unprincipled, ambitious
ruler, often engaged in war with his own subjects. When engaged in
reducing the town of Thebez, which had revolted, he was struck mortally
on his head by a mill-stone, thrown by the hand of a woman from the wall
above. Perceiving that the wound was mortal, he desired his
armour-bearer to thrust him through with his sword, that it might not be
said he had perished by the hand of a woman ([Jdg
9:50](../kjv/jdg009.htm#050)). (4..md) The son of Abiathar, and high priest
in the time of David ([Ch1 18:16](../kjv/ch1018.htm#016).md). In the
parallel passage, [Sa2 8:17](../kjv/sa2008.htm#017.md), we have the name
Ahimelech, and Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech. This most authorities
consider the more correct reading. (5.) Achish, king of Gath, in the
title of Ps. 34. (Compare [Sa1 21:10](../kjv/sa1021.htm#010)..md)

<span id="001">**Abinadab**</span> Father of nobleness; i.e., "noble."
(1.) A Levite of Kirjath-jearim, in whose house the ark of the covenant
was deposited after having been brought back from the land of the
Philistines ([Sa1 7:1](../kjv/sa1007.htm#001).md). It remained there twenty
years, till it was at length removed by David ([Sa1
7:1](../kjv/sa1007.htm#001), [Sa1 7:2](../kjv/sa1007.htm#002.md); [Ch1
13:7](../kjv/ch1013.htm#007)). (2..md) The second of the eight sons of
Jesse ([Sa1 16:8](../kjv/sa1016.htm#008).md). He was with Saul in the
campaign against the Philistines in which Goliath was slain ([Sa1
17:13](../kjv/sa1017.htm#013)). (3..md) One of Saul's sons, who persisted
with his father in the battle of Gilboa ([Sa1
31:2](../kjv/sa1031.htm#002); [Ch1 10:2](../kjv/ch1010.htm#002)). (4..md)
One of Solomon's officers, who "provided victuals for the king and his
household." He presided, for this purpose, over the district of Dor
([Kg1 4:11](../kjv/kg1004.htm#011).md).

<span id="002">**Abinoam**</span> Father of kindness, the father of
Barak ([Jdg 4:6](../kjv/jdg004.htm#006.md); [Jdg
5:1](../kjv/jdg005.htm#001).md).

<span id="003">**Abiram**</span> Father of height; i.e., "proud." (1.)
One of the sons of Eliab, who joined Korah in the conspiracy against
Moses and Aaron. He and all the conspirators, with their families and
possessions (except the children of Korah), were swallowed up by an
earthquake (Num. 16:1-27; [Num 26:9](../kjv/num026.htm#009.md); [Psa
106:17](../kjv/psa106.htm#017)). (2..md) The eldest son of Hiel the
Bethelite, who perished prematurely in consequence of his father's
undertaking to rebuild Jericho ([Kg1 16:34](../kjv/kg1016.htm#034).md),
according to the words of Joshua ([Kg1 6:26](../kjv/kg1006.htm#026).md).
(See JERICHO.)

<span id="004">**Abishag**</span> Father of (i.e., "given to") error, a
young woman of Shunem, distinguished for her beauty. She was chosen to
minister to David in his old age. She became his wife ([Kg1
1:3](../kjv/kg1001.htm#003), [Kg1 1:4](../kjv/kg1001.htm#004.md), [Kg1
1:15](../kjv/kg1001.htm#015).md). After David's death Adonijah persuaded
Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, to entreat the king to permit him to marry
Abishag. Solomon suspected in this request an aspiration to the throne,
and therefore caused him to be put to death ([Kg1
2:17](../kjv/kg1002.htm#017).md).

<span id="005">**Abishai**</span> Father of (i.e., "desirous of") a
gift, the eldest son of Zeruiah, David's sister. He was the brother of
Joab and Asahel ([Sa2 2:18](../kjv/sa2002.htm#018.md); [Ch1
2:16](../kjv/ch1002.htm#016).md). Abishai was the only one who accompanied
David when he went to the camp of Saul and took the spear and the cruse
of water from Saul's bolster ([Sa1 26:5](../kjv/sa1026.htm#005).md). He had
the command of one of the three divisions of David's army at the battle
with Absalom ([Sa2 18:2](../kjv/sa2018.htm#002.md), [Sa2
18:5](../kjv/sa2018.htm#005), [Sa2 18:12](../kjv/sa2018.htm#012).md). He
slew the Philistine giant Ishbi-benob, who threatened David's life ([Sa2
21:15](../kjv/sa2021.htm#015).md). He was the chief of the second rank of
the three "mighties" ([Sa2 23:18](../kjv/sa2023.htm#018.md), [Sa2
23:19](../kjv/sa2023.htm#019); [Ch1 11:20](../kjv/ch1011.htm#020.md), [Ch1
11:21](../kjv/ch1011.htm#021).md); and on one occasion withstood 300 men,
and slew them with his own spear ([Sa2 23:18](../kjv/sa2023.htm#018).md).
Abishai is the name of the Semitic chief who offers gifts to the lord of
Beni-Hassan.

[Ch1 6:5](../kjv/ch1006.htm#005), [Ch1 6:50](../kjv/ch1006.htm#050.md);
[Ezr 7:5](../kjv/ezr007.htm#005).md).

<span id="007">**Abishur**</span> Father of the wall; i.e., "mason", one
of the two sons of Shammai of the tribe of Judah ([Ch1
