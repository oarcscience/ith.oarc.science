<span id="000">**Kettle**</span> A large pot for cooking. The same
Hebrew word (dud, "boiling") is rendered also "pot" ([Psa
81:6](../kjv/psa081.htm#006).md), "caldron" ([Ch2
35:13](../kjv/ch2035.htm#013).md), "basket" ([Jer
24:2](../kjv/jer024.htm#002).md). It was used for preparing the
peace-offerings ([Sa1 2:13](../kjv/sa1002.htm#013.md), [Sa1
2:14](../kjv/sa1002.htm#014).md).

<span id="001">**Keturah**</span> Incense, the wife of Abraham, whom he
married probably after Sarah's death ([Gen
25:1](../kjv/gen025.htm#001).md), by whom he had six sons, whom he sent
away into the east country. Her nationality is unknown. She is styled
"Abraham's concubine" ([Ch1 1:32](../kjv/ch1001.htm#032).md). Through the
offshoots of the Keturah line Abraham became the "father of many
nations."

<span id="002">**Key**</span> Frequently mentioned in Scripture. It is
called in Hebrew maphteah, i.e., the opener ([Jdg
3:25](../kjv/jdg003.htm#025).md); and in the Greek New Testament kleis ,
from its use in shutting ([Mat 16:19](../kjv/mat016.htm#019.md); [Luk
11:52](../kjv/luk011.htm#052); [Rev 1:18](../kjv/rev001.htm#018), etc..md).
Figures of ancient Egyptian keys are frequently found on the monuments,
also of Assyrian locks and keys of wood, and of a large size (Compare
[Isa 22:22](../kjv/isa022.htm#022).md). The word is used figuratively of
power or authority or office ([Isa 22:22](../kjv/isa022.htm#022.md); [Rev
3:7](../kjv/rev003.htm#007); [Rev 1:8](../kjv/rev001.htm#008.md); compare
[Rev 9:1](../kjv/rev009.htm#001); [Rev 20:1](../kjv/rev020.htm#001.md);
compare also [Mat 16:19](../kjv/mat016.htm#019.md); [Mat
18:18](../kjv/mat018.htm#018).md). The "key of knowledge" ([Luk
11:52](../kjv/luk011.htm#052.md); compare [Mat
23:13](../kjv/mat023.htm#013).md) is the means of attaining the knowledge
regarding the kingdom of God. The "power of the keys" is a phrase in
general use to denote the extent of ecclesiastical authority.

<span id="003">**Kezia**</span> Cassia, the name of Job's second
daughter ([Job 42:14](../kjv/job042.htm#014).md), born after prosperity had
returned to him.

<span id="004">**Keziz**</span> Abrupt; cut off, a city of the tribe of
Benjamin ([Jos 18:21](../kjv/jos018.htm#021).md).

<span id="005">**Kibroth-hattaavah**</span> The graves of the longing or
of lust, one of the stations of the Israelites in the wilderness. It was
probably in the Wady Murrah, and has been identified with the Erweis
el-Ebeirig, where the remains of an ancient encampment have been found,
about 30 miles north-east of Sinai, and exactly a day's journey from
'Ain Hudherah . "Here began the troubles of the journey. First,
complaints broke out among the people, probably at the heat, the toil,
and the privations of the march; and then God at once punished them by
lightning, which fell on the hinder part of the camp, and killed many
persons, but ceased at the intercession of Moses ([Num
11:1](../kjv/num011.htm#001), [Num 11:2](../kjv/num011.htm#002).md). Then a
disgust fell on the multitude at having nothing to eat but the manna day
after day, no change, no flesh, no fish, no high-flavoured vegetables,
no luscious fruits... The people loathed the 'light food,' and cried out
to Moses, 'Give us flesh, give us flesh, that we may eat.'". In this
emergency Moses, in despair, cried unto God. An answer came. God sent "a
prodigious flight of quails, on which the people satiated their
gluttonous appetite for a full month. Then punishment fell on them: they
loathed the food which they had desired; it bred disease in them; the
divine anger aggravated the disease into a plague, and a heavy mortality
was the consequence. The dead were buried without the camp; and in
memory of man's sin and of the divine wrath this name,
Kibroth-hattaavah, the Graves of Lust, was given to the place of their
sepulchre" ([Num 11:34](../kjv/num011.htm#034.md), [Num
11:35](../kjv/num011.htm#035); [Num 33:16](../kjv/num033.htm#016.md), [Num
33:17](../kjv/num033.htm#017); [Deu 9:22](../kjv/deu009.htm#022.md);
compare [Psa 78:30](../kjv/psa078.htm#030.md), [Psa
78:31](../kjv/psa078.htm#031).md). Rawlinson's Moses, p. 175. From this
encampment they journeyed in a north-eastern direction to Hazeroth.

<span id="006">**Kibzaim**</span> Two heaps, a city of Ephraim, assigned
to the Kohathite Levites, and appointed as a city of refuge ([Jos
21:22](../kjv/jos021.htm#022).md). It is also called Jokmeam ([Ch1
6:68](../kjv/ch1006.htm#068).md).

<span id="007">**Kid**</span> The young of the goat. It was much used
for food ([Gen 27:9](../kjv/gen027.htm#009.md); [Gen
38:17](../kjv/gen038.htm#017); [Jdg 6:19](../kjv/jdg006.htm#019.md); [Jdg
14:6](../kjv/jdg014.htm#006).md). The Mosaic law forbade to dress a kid in
the milk of its dam, a law which is thrice repeated ([Exo
23:19](../kjv/exo023.htm#019); [Exo 34:26](../kjv/exo034.htm#026.md); [Deu
14:21](../kjv/deu014.htm#021).md). Among the various reasons assigned for
this law, that appears to be the most satisfactory which regards it as
"a protest against cruelty and outraging the order of nature." A kid
cooked in its mother's milk is "a gross, unwholesome dish, and
calculated to kindle animal and ferocious passions, and on this account
Moses may have forbidden it. Besides, it is even yet associated with
immoderate feasting; and originally, I suspect," says Dr. Thomson (Land
and the Book), "was connected with idolatrous sacrifices."

<span id="008">**Kidron**</span> =Kedron=Cedron Turbid, the winter
torrent which flows through the Valley of Jehoshaphat, on the eastern
side of Jerusalem, between the city and the Mount of Olives. This valley
is known in Scripture only by the name "the brook Kidron." David crossed
this brook bare-foot and weeping, when fleeing from Absalom ([Sa2
15:23](../kjv/sa2015.htm#023), [Sa2 15:30](../kjv/sa2015.htm#030).md), and
it was frequently crossed by our Lord in his journeying to and fro ([Joh
18:1](../kjv/joh018.htm#001).md). Here Asa burned the obscene idols of his
mother ([Kg1 15:13](../kjv/kg1015.htm#013).md), and here Athaliah was
executed ([Kg2 11:16](../kjv/kg2011.htm#016).md). It afterwards became the
receptacle for all manner of impurities ([Ch2
29:16](../kjv/ch2029.htm#016); [Ch2 30:14](../kjv/ch2030.htm#014).md); and
in the time of Josiah this valley was the common cemetery of the city
([Kg2 23:6](../kjv/kg2023.htm#006.md); compare [Jer
26:23](../kjv/jer026.htm#023).md). Through this mountain ravine no water
runs, except after heavy rains in the mountains round about Jerusalem.
Its length from its head to en-Rogel is 23/4 miles. Its precipitous,
rocky banks are filled with ancient tombs, especially the left bank
opposite the temple area. The greatest desire of the Jews is to be
buried there, from the idea that the Kidron is the "valley of
Jehoshaphat" mentioned in [Joe 3:2](../kjv/joe003.htm#002.md). Below
en-Rogel the Kidron has no historical or sacred interest. It runs in a
winding course through the wilderness of Judea to the north-western
shore of the Dead Sea. Its whole length, in a straight line, is only
some 20 miles, but in this space its descent is about 3,912 feet. (See
KEDRON.) Recent excavations have brought to light the fact that the old
bed of the Kidron is about 40 feet lower than its present bed, and about
70 feet nearer the sanctuary wall.

<span id="009">**Kinah**</span> An elegy, a city in the extreme south of
Judah ([Jos 15:22](../kjv/jos015.htm#022).md). It was probably not far from
the Dead Sea, in the Wady Fikreh.
