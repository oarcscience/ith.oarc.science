<span id="000">**Jezreel, Day of**</span> The time predicted for the
execution of vengeance for the deeds of blood committed there ([Hos
1:5](../kjv/hos001.htm#005).md).

<span id="001">**Jezreel, Ditch of**</span> ([Kg1
21:23](../kjv/kg1021.htm#023.md); compare [Kg1
21:13](../kjv/kg1021.htm#013).md), the fortification surrounding the city,
outside of which Naboth was executed.

<span id="002">**Jezreel, Fountain of**</span> Where Saul encamped
before the battle of Gilboa ([Sa1 29:1](../kjv/sa1029.htm#001).md). In the
valley under Zerin there are two considerable springs, one of which,
perhaps that here referred to, "flows from under a sort of cavern in the
wall of conglomerate rock which here forms the base of Gilboa. The water
is excellent; and issuing from crevices in the rocks, it spreads out at
once into a fine limpid pool forty or fifty feet in diameter, full of
fish" (Robinson). This may be identical with the "well of Harod" ([Jdg
7:1](../kjv/jdg007.htm#001.md); compare [Sa2
23:25](../kjv/sa2023.htm#025).md), probably the 'Ain Jalud , i.e., the
"spring of Goliath."

<span id="003">**Jezreel, Portion of**</span> The field adjoining the
city ([Kg2 9:10](../kjv/kg2009.htm#010.md), [Kg2
9:21](../kjv/kg2009.htm#021), [Kg2 9:36](../kjv/kg2009.htm#036.md), [Kg2
9:37](../kjv/kg2009.htm#037).md). Here Naboth was stoned to death ([Kg1
21:13](../kjv/kg1021.htm#013).md).

<span id="004">**Jezreel, Tower of**</span> One of the turrets which
guarded the entrance to the city ([Kg2 9:17](../kjv/kg2009.htm#017).md).

<span id="005">**Jezreel, Valley of**</span> Lying on the northern side
of the city, between the ridges of Gilboa and Moreh, an offshoot of
Esdraelon, running east to the Jordan ([Jos
17:16](../kjv/jos017.htm#016); [Jdg 6:33](../kjv/jdg006.htm#033.md); [Hos
1:5](../kjv/hos001.htm#005).md). It was the scene of the signal victory
gained by the Israelites under Gideon over the Midianites, the
Amalekites, and the "children of the east" ([Jdg
6:3](../kjv/jdg006.htm#003).md). Two centuries after this the Israelites
were here defeated by the Philistines, and Saul and Jonathan, with the
flower of the army of Israel, fell ([Sa1 31:1](../kjv/sa1031.htm#001).md).
This name was in after ages extended to the whole of the plain of
Esdraelon (q.v.). It was only this plain of Jezreel and that north of
Lake Huleh that were then accessible to the chariots of the Canaanites
(compare [Kg2 9:21](../kjv/kg2009.htm#021.md); [Kg2
10:15](../kjv/kg2010.htm#015).md).

<span id="006">**Joab**</span> Jehovah is his father. (1.) One of the
three sons of Zeruiah, David's sister, and "captain of the host" during
the whole of David's reign ([Sa2 2:13](../kjv/sa2002.htm#013.md); [Sa2
10:7](../kjv/sa2010.htm#007); [Sa2 11:1](../kjv/sa2011.htm#001.md); [Kg1
11:15](../kjv/kg1011.htm#015).md). His father's name is nowhere mentioned,
although his sepulchre at Bethlehem is mentioned ([Sa2
2:32](../kjv/sa2002.htm#032).md). His two brothers were Abishai and Asahel,
the swift of foot, who was killed by Abner (2 Sam. 2:13-32), whom Joab
afterwards treacherously murdered ([Sa2 3:22](../kjv/sa2003.htm#022).md).
He afterwards led the assault at the storming of the fortress on Mount
Zion, and for this service was raised to the rank of "prince of the
king's army" ([Sa2 5:6](../kjv/sa2005.htm#006.md); [Ch1
27:34](../kjv/ch1027.htm#034).md). His chief military achievements were,
(a.) against the allied forces of Syria and Ammon; (b.) against Edom
([Kg1 11:15](../kjv/kg1011.htm#015.md), [Kg1
11:16](../kjv/kg1011.htm#016)); and (c..md) against the Ammonites ([Sa2
10:7](../kjv/sa2010.htm#007); [Sa2 11:1](../kjv/sa2011.htm#001.md), [Sa2
11:11](../kjv/sa2011.htm#011).md). His character is deeply stained by the
part he willingly took in the murder of Uriah ([Sa2
11:14](../kjv/sa2011.htm#014).md). He acted apparently from a sense of duty
in putting Absalom to death ([Sa2 18:1](../kjv/sa2018.htm#001).md). David
was unmindful of the many services Joab had rendered to him, and
afterwards gave the command of the army to Amasa, Joab's cousin ([Sa2
20:1](../kjv/sa2020.htm#001); [Sa2 19:13](../kjv/sa2019.htm#013).md). When
David was dying Joab espoused the cause of Adonijah in preference to
that of Solomon. He was afterwards slain by Benaiah, by the command of
Solomon, in accordance with his father's injunction ([Sa2
3:29](../kjv/sa2003.htm#029); [Sa2 20:5](../kjv/sa2020.htm#005).md), at the
altar to which he had fled for refuge. Thus this hoary conspirator died
without one to lift up a voice in his favour. He was buried in his own
property in the "wilderness," probably in the north-east of Jerusalem
([Kg1 2:5](../kjv/kg1002.htm#005), [Kg1 2:28](../kjv/kg1002.htm#028).md).
Benaiah succeeded him as commander-in-chief of the army. (2.) [Ch1
4:14](../kjv/ch1004.htm#014). (3.) [Ezr 2:6](../kjv/ezr002.htm#006.md).

<span id="007">**Joah**</span> Jehovah his brother; i.e., helper. (1.)
One of the sons of Obed-edom ([Ch1 26:4](../kjv/ch1026.htm#004).md), a
Korhite porter. (2.) A Levite of the family of Gershom ([Ch1
6:21](../kjv/ch1006.htm#021).md), probably the same as Ethan ([Ch1
6:42](../kjv/ch1006.htm#042)). (3..md) The son of Asaph, and "recorder"
(q.v.) or chronicler to King Hezekiah ([Kg2
18:18](../kjv/kg2018.htm#018), [Kg2 18:26](../kjv/kg2018.htm#026.md), [Kg2
18:37](../kjv/kg2018.htm#037)). (4..md) Son of Joahaz, and "recorder"
(q.v.) or keeper of the state archives under King Josiah ([Ch2
34:8](../kjv/ch2034.htm#008).md).

<span id="008">**Joahaz**</span> ([Ch2 34:8](../kjv/ch2034.htm#008).md), a
contracted form of Jehoahaz (q.v.).

<span id="009">**Joanna**</span> Whom Jehovah has graciously given. (1.)
The grandson of Zerubbabel, in the lineage of Christ ([Luk
3:27](../kjv/luk003.htm#027).md); the same as Hananiah ([Ch1
3:19](../kjv/ch1003.htm#019)). (2..md) The wife of Chuza, the steward of
Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee ([Luk 8:3](../kjv/luk008.htm#003).md).
She was one of the women who ministered to our Lord, and to whom he
appeared after his resurrection ([Luk 8:3](../kjv/luk008.htm#003.md); [Luk
24:10](../kjv/luk024.htm#010).md).
