<span id="000">**Nophah**</span> Blast, a city of Moab which was
occupied by the Amorites ([Num 21:30](../kjv/num021.htm#030).md).

<span id="001">**North Country**</span> A general name for the countries
that lay north of Palestine. Most of the invading armies entered
Palestine from the north ([Isa 41:25](../kjv/isa041.htm#025.md); [Jer
1:14](../kjv/jer001.htm#014), [Jer 1:15](../kjv/jer001.htm#015.md); [Jer
50:3](../kjv/jer050.htm#003), [Jer 50:9](../kjv/jer050.htm#009.md), [Jer
50:41](../kjv/jer050.htm#041); [Jer 51:48](../kjv/jer051.htm#048.md); [Eze
26:7](../kjv/eze026.htm#007).md).

<span id="002">**Northward**</span> (Heb. tsaphon ), a "hidden" or "dark
place," as opposed to the sunny south ([Deu
3:27](../kjv/deu003.htm#027).md). A Hebrew in speaking of the points of the
compass was considered as always having his face to the east, and hence
"the left hand" ([Gen 14:15](../kjv/gen014.htm#015.md); [Job
23:9](../kjv/job023.htm#009).md) denotes the north. The "kingdoms of the
north" are Chaldea, Assyria, Media, etc.

<span id="003">**Nose-jewels**</span> Only mentioned in [Isa
3:21](../kjv/isa003.htm#021.md), although referred to in [Gen
24:47](../kjv/gen024.htm#047), [Pro 11:22](../kjv/pro011.htm#022.md), [Hos
2:13](../kjv/hos002.htm#013.md). They were among the most valued of ancient
female ornaments. They "were made of ivory or metal, and occasionally
jeweled. They were more than an inch in diameter, and hung upon the
mouth. Eliezer gave one to Rebekah which was of gold and weighed half a
shekel... At the present day the women in the country and in the desert
wear these ornaments in one of the sides of the nostrils, which droop
like the ears in consequence."

<span id="004">**Numbering of the People**</span> Besides the numbering
of the tribes mentioned in the history of the wanderings in the
wilderness, we have an account of a general census of the whole nation
from Dan to Beersheba, which David gave directions to Joab to make ([Ch1
21:1](../kjv/ch1021.htm#001).md). Joab very reluctantly began to carry out
the king's command. This act of David in ordering a numbering of the
people arose from pride and a self-glorifying spirit. It indicated a
reliance on his part on an arm of flesh, an estimating of his power not
by the divine favour but by the material resources of his kingdom. He
thought of military achievement and of conquest, and forgot that he was
God's vicegerent. In all this he sinned against God. While Joab was
engaged in the census, David's heart smote him, and he became deeply
conscious of his fault; and in profound humiliation he confessed, "I
have sinned greatly in what I have done." The prophet Gad was sent to
him to put before him three dreadful alternatives ([Sa2
24:13](../kjv/sa2024.htm#013.md); for "seven years" in this verse, the LXX.
and [Ch1 21:12](../kjv/ch1021.htm#012) have "three years".md), three of
Jehovah's four sore judgments ([Eze 14:21](../kjv/eze014.htm#021).md). Two
of these David had already experienced. He had fled for some months
before Absalom, and had suffered three years' famine on account of the
slaughter of the Gibeonites. In his "strait" David said, "Let me fall
into the hands of the Lord." A pestilence broke out among the people,
and in three days swept away 70,000. At David's intercession the plague
was stayed, and at the threshing-floor of Araunah (q.v.), where the
destroying angel was arrested in his progress, David erected an altar,
and there offered up sacrifices to God ([Ch2
3:1](../kjv/ch2003.htm#001).md). The census, so far as completed, showed
that there were at least 1,300,000 fighting men in the kingdom,
indicating at that time a population of about six or seven millions in
all. (See CENSUS.)

<span id="005">**Numbers, Book of**</span> The fourth of the books of
the Pentateuch, called in the Hebrew be-midbar, i.e., "in the
wilderness." In the LXX. version it is called "Numbers," and this name
is now the usual title of the book. It is so called because it contains
a record of the numbering of the people in the wilderness of Sinai (Num.
1 - 4), and of their numbering afterwards on the plain of Moab (Num.
26). This book is of special historical interest as furnishing us with
details as to the route of the Israelites in the wilderness and their
principal encampments. It may be divided into three parts:, 1. The
numbering of the people at Sinai, and preparations for their resuming
their march (Num. 1 - 10:10). The sixth chapter gives an account of the
vow of a Nazarite. 2. An account of the journey from Sinai to Moab, the
sending out of the spies and the report they brought back, and the
murmurings (eight times) of the people at the hardships by the way (Num.
10:11 - 21:20). 3. The transactions in the plain of Moab before crossing
the Jordan (Num. 21:21 - Num. 36). The period comprehended in the
history extends from the second month of the second year after the
Exodus to the beginning of the eleventh month of the fortieth year, in
all about thirty-eight years and ten months; a dreary period of
wanderings, during which that disobedient generation all died in the
wilderness. They were fewer in number at the end of their wanderings
than when they left the land of Egypt. We see in this history, on the
one hand, the unceasing care of the Almighty over his chosen people
during their wanderings; and, on the other hand, the murmurings and
rebellions by which they offended their heavenly Protector, drew down
repeated marks of his displeasure, and provoked him to say that they
should "not enter into his rest" because of their unbelief ([Heb
3:19](../kjv/heb003.htm#019).md). This, like the other books of the
Pentateuch, bears evidence of having been written by Moses. The
expression "the book of the wars of the Lord," occurring in [Num
21:14](../kjv/num021.htm#014.md), has given rise to much discussion. But,
after all, "what this book was is uncertain, whether some writing of
Israel not now extant, or some writing of the Amorites which contained
songs and triumphs of their king Sihon's victories, out of which Moses
may cite this testimony, as Paul sometimes does out of heathen poets
([Act 17:28](../kjv/act017.htm#028.md); [Tit
1:12](../kjv/tit001.htm#012).md)."

<span id="006">**Nun**</span> Beyond the fact that he was the father of
Joshua nothing more is known of him ([Exo
33:11](../kjv/exo033.htm#011).md).

<span id="007">**Nuts**</span> Were among the presents Jacob sent into
Egypt for the purpose of conciliating Joseph ([Gen
43:11](../kjv/gen043.htm#011).md). This was the fruit of the pistachio
tree, which resembles the sumac. It is of the size of an olive. In [Sol
6:11](../kjv/sol006.htm#011) a different Hebrew word ( 'egoz .md), which
means "walnuts," is used.

<span id="008">**Nymphas**</span> Nymph, saluted by Paul in his Epistle
to the Colossians as a member of the church of Laodicea ([Col
4:15](../kjv/col004.htm#015).md).

<span id="009">**Oak**</span> There are six Hebrew words rendered "oak."
(1.) 'El occurs only in the word El-paran ([Gen
14:6](../kjv/gen014.htm#006).md). The LXX. renders by "terebinth." In the
plural form this word occurs in [Isa 1:29](../kjv/isa001.htm#029.md); [Isa
57:5](../kjv/isa057.htm#005) (A.V. marg. and R.V., "among the oaks".md);
[Isa 61:3](../kjv/isa061.htm#003) ("trees".md). The word properly means
strongly, mighty, and hence a strong tree. (2.) 'Elah , [Gen
35:4](../kjv/gen035.htm#004.md), "under the oak which was by Shechem" (R.V.
marg., "terebinth"). [Isa 6:13](../kjv/isa006.htm#013.md), A.V.,
"teil-tree;" R.V., "terebinth." [Isa 1:30](../kjv/isa001.htm#030.md), R.V.
marg., "terebinth." Absalom in his flight was caught in the branches of
a "great oak" ([Sa2 18:9](../kjv/sa2018.htm#009.md); R.V. marg.,
"terebinth"). (3.) 'Elon , [Jdg 4:11](../kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md); [Jdg
9:6](../kjv/jdg009.htm#006.md) (R.V., "oak;" A.V., following the Targum,
"plain") properly the deciduous species of oak shedding its foliage in
autumn. (4.) 'Elan , only in [Dan 4:11](../kjv/dan004.htm#011.md), [Dan
4:14](../kjv/dan004.htm#014), [Dan 4:20](../kjv/dan004.htm#020.md),
rendered "tree" in Nebuchadnezzar's dream. Probably some species of the
oak is intended. (5.) 'Allah , [Jos 24:26](../kjv/jos024.htm#026.md). The
place here referred to is called Allon-moreh ("the oak of Moreh," as in
R.V.) in [Gen 12:6](../kjv/gen012.htm#006.md) and [Gen
35:4](../kjv/gen035.htm#004). (6..md) 'Allon , always rendered "oak."
Probably the evergreen oak (called also ilex and holm oak) is intended.
The oak woods of Bashan are frequently alluded to ([Isa
2:13](../kjv/isa002.htm#013); [Eze 27:6](../kjv/eze027.htm#006).md). Three
species of oaks are found in Palestine, of which the "prickly evergreen
oak" (Quercus coccifera) is the most abundant. "It covers the rocky
hills of Palestine with a dense brushwood of trees from 8 to 12 feet
high, branching from the base, thickly covered with small evergreen
rigid leaves, and bearing acorns copiously." The so-called Abraham's oak
at Hebron is of this species. Tristram says that this oak near Hebron
"has for several centuries taken the place of the once renowned
terebinth which marked the site of Mamre on the other side of the city.
The terebinth existed at Mamre in the time of Vespasian, and under it
the captive Jews were sold as slaves. It disappeared about A.D.330, and
no tree now marks the grove of Mamre. The present oak is the noblest
tree in Southern Palestine, being 23 feet in girth, and the diameter of
the foliage, which is un-symmetrical, being about 90 feet." (See HEBRON;
TEIL-TREE.)
