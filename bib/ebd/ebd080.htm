<P><A NAME="000"><B>Chezib</B></A>     Deceitful, a town where Shelah, the son of Judah, was born (<A HREF="../kjv/gen038.htm#005">Gen 38:5</A>). Probably the same as Achzib (q.v.). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Chidon</B></A>     Dart, the name of the threshing-floor at which the death of Uzzah took place (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1013.htm#009">Ch1 13:9</A>). In the parallel passage in Samuel (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2006.htm#006">Sa2 6:6</A>) it is called &quot;Nachon's threshing-floor.&quot; It was a place not far north-west from Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Chiefs of Asia</B></A>     Asiarchs,&quot; the title given to certain wealthy persons annually appointed to preside over the religious festivals and games in the various cities of proconsular Asia (<A HREF="../kjv/act019.htm#031">Act 19:31</A>). Some of these officials appear to have been Paul's friends. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Chief of the Three</B></A>     A title given to Adino the Eznite, one of David's greatest heroes (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2023.htm#008">Sa2 23:8</A>); also called Jashobeam (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1011.htm#011">Ch1 11:11</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Chief Priest</B></A>     See PRIEST. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Child</B></A>     This word has considerable latitude of meaning in Scripture. Thus Joseph is called a child at the time when he was probably about sixteen years of age (<A HREF="../kjv/gen037.htm#003">Gen 37:3</A>); and Benjamin is so called when he was above thirty years (<A HREF="../kjv/gen044.htm#020">Gen 44:20</A>). Solomon called himself a little child when he came to the kingdom (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1003.htm#007">Kg1 3:7</A>). The descendants of a man, however remote, are called his children; as, &quot;the children of Edom,&quot; &quot;the children of Moab,&quot; &quot;the children of Israel.&quot; In the earliest times mothers did not wean their children till they were from thirty months to three years old; and the day on which they were weaned was kept as a festival day (<A HREF="../kjv/gen021.htm#008">Gen 21:8</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/exo002.htm#007">Exo 2:7</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/exo002.htm#009">Exo 2:9</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa1001.htm#022">Sa1 1:22</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat021.htm#016">Mat 21:16</A>). At the age of five, children began to learn the arts and duties of life under the care of their fathers (<A HREF="../kjv/deu006.htm#020">Deu 6:20</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/deu011.htm#019">Deu 11:19</A>). To have a numerous family was regarded as a mark of divine favour (<A HREF="../kjv/gen011.htm#030">Gen 11:30</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gen030.htm#001">Gen 30:1</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa1002.htm#005">Sa1 2:5</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa2006.htm#023">Sa2 6:23</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa127.htm#003">Psa 127:3</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa128.htm#003">Psa 128:3</A>). Figuratively the name is used for those who are ignorant or narrow-minded (<A HREF="../kjv/mat011.htm#016">Mat 11:16</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/luk007.htm#032">Luk 7:32</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/co1013.htm#011">Co1 13:11</A>). &quot;When I was a child, I spake as a child.&quot; &quot;Brethren, be not children in understanding&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/co1014.htm#020">Co1 14:20</A>). &quot;That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/eph004.htm#014">Eph 4:14</A>). Children are also spoken of as representing simplicity and humility (<A HREF="../kjv/mat019.htm#013">Mat 19:13</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mar010.htm#013">Mar 10:13</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/luk018.htm#015">Luk 18:15</A>). Believers are &quot;children of light&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/luk016.htm#008">Luk 16:8</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/th1005.htm#005">Th1 5:5</A>) and &quot;children of obedience&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/pe1001.htm#014">Pe1 1:14</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Chileab</B></A>     Protected by the father, David's second son by Abigail (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2003.htm#003">Sa2 3:3</A>); called also Daniel (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1003.htm#001">Ch1 3:1</A>). He seems to have died when young. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Chilion</B></A>     The pining one, the younger son of Elimelech and Naomi, and husband of Orpah, Ruth's sister (<A HREF="../kjv/rut001.htm#002">Rut 1:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/rut004.htm#009">Rut 4:9</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Chilmad</B></A>     A place or country unknown which, along with Sheba and Asshur, traded with Tyre (<A HREF="../kjv/eze027.htm#023">Eze 27:23</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Chimham</B></A>     Pining, probably the youngest son of Barzillai the Gileadite (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2019.htm#037">Sa2 19:37</A>). The &quot;habitation of Chimham&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/jer041.htm#017">Jer 41:17</A>) was probably an inn or khan, which is the proper meaning of the Hebrew geruth, rendered &quot;habitation&quot;, established in later times in his possession at Bethlehem, which David gave to him as a reward for his loyalty in accompanying him to Jerusalem after the defeat of Absalom (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1002.htm#007">Kg1 2:7</A>). It has been supposed that, considering the stationary character of Eastern institutions, it was in the stable of this inn or caravanserai that our Saviour was born (<A HREF="../kjv/luk002.htm#007">Luk 2:7</A>). 
</P>
