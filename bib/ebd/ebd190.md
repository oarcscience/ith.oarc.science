<span id="000">**Iscariot**</span> (See JUDAS.)

<span id="001">**Ishbak**</span> Leaving, one of Abraham's sons by
Keturah ([Gen 25:2](../kjv/gen025.htm#002).md).

<span id="002">**Ishbi-benob**</span> My seat at Nob, one of the
Rephaim, whose spear was three hundred shekels in weight. He was slain
by Abishai ([Sa2 21:16](../kjv/sa2021.htm#016.md), [Sa2
21:17](../kjv/sa2021.htm#017).md).

<span id="003">**Ish-bosheth**</span> Man of shame or humiliation, the
youngest of Saul's four sons, and the only one who survived him (2 Sam.
2-4). His name was originally Eshbaal ([Ch1
8:33](../kjv/ch1008.htm#033); [Ch1 9:39](../kjv/ch1009.htm#039).md). He was
about forty years of age when his father and three brothers fell at the
battle of Gilboa, Through the influence of Abner, Saul's cousin, he was
acknowledge as successor to the throne of Saul, and ruled over all
Israel, except the tribe of Judah (over whom David was king), for two
years, having Mahanaim, on the east of Jordan, as his capital ([Sa2
2:9](../kjv/sa2002.htm#009).md). After a troubled and uncertain reign he
was murdered by his guard, who stabbed him while he was asleep on his
couch at mid-day ([Sa2 4:5](../kjv/sa2004.htm#005).md); and having cut off
his head, presented it to David, who sternly rebuked them for this
cold-blooded murder, and ordered them to be immediately executed ([Sa2
4:9](../kjv/sa2004.htm#009).md).

<span id="004">**Ishi**</span> My husband, a symbolical name used in
[Hos 2:16](../kjv/hos002.htm#016) (See BAALI..md)

<span id="005">**Ishmael**</span> God hears. (1.) Abraham's eldest son,
by Hagar the concubine ([Gen 16:15](../kjv/gen016.htm#015.md); [Gen
17:23](../kjv/gen017.htm#023).md). He was born at Mamre, when Abraham was
eighty-six years of age, eleven years after his arrival in Canaan ([Gen
16:3](../kjv/gen016.htm#003); [Gen 21:5](../kjv/gen021.htm#005).md). At the
age of thirteen he was circumcised ([Gen 17:25](../kjv/gen017.htm#025).md).
He grew up a true child of the desert, wild and wayward. On the occasion
of the weaning of Isaac his rude and wayward spirit broke out in
expressions of insult and mockery ([Gen 21:9](../kjv/gen021.htm#009.md),
[Gen 21:10](../kjv/gen021.htm#010).md); and Sarah, discovering this, said
to Abraham, "Expel this slave and her son." Influenced by a divine
admonition, Abraham dismissed Hagar and her son with no more than a skin
of water and some bread. The narrative describing this act is one of the
most beautiful and touching incidents of patriarchal life ([Gen
21:14](../kjv/gen021.htm#014)). (See HAGAR..md) Ishmael settled in the land
of Paran, a region lying between Canaan and the mountains of Sinai; and
"God was with him, and he became a great archer" ([Gen
21:9](../kjv/gen021.htm#009).md). He became a great desert chief, but of
his history little is recorded. He was about ninety years of age when
his father Abraham died, in connection with whose burial he once more
for a moment reappears. On this occasion the two brothers met after
being long separated. "Isaac with his hundreds of household slaves,
Ishmael with his troops of wild retainers and half-savage allies, in all
the state of a Bedouin prince, gathered before the cave of Machpelah, in
the midst of the men of Heth, to pay the last duties to the 'father of
the faithful,' would make a notable subject for an artist" ([Gen
25:9](../kjv/gen025.htm#009).md). Of the after events of his life but
little is known. He died at the age of one hundred and thirty-seven
years, but where and when are unknown ([Gen
25:17](../kjv/gen025.htm#017).md). He had twelve sons, who became the
founders of so many Arab tribes or colonies, the Ishmaelites, who spread
over the wide desert spaces of Northern Arabia from the Red Sea to the
Euphrates ([Gen 37:25](../kjv/gen037.htm#025.md), [Gen
37:27](../kjv/gen037.htm#027), [Gen 37:28](../kjv/gen037.htm#028.md); [Gen
39:1](../kjv/gen039.htm#001).md), "their hand against every man, and every
man's hand against them." (2.) The son of Nethaniah, "of the seed royal"
([Jer 40:8](../kjv/jer040.htm#008), [Jer 40:15](../kjv/jer040.htm#015).md).
He plotted against Gedaliah, and treacherously put him and others to
death. He carried off many captives, "and departed to go over to the
Ammonites."

<span id="006">**Ishmaiah**</span> Heard by Jehovah. (1.) A Gibeonite
who joined David at Ziklag, "a hero among the thirty and over the
thirty" ([Ch1 12:4](../kjv/ch1012.htm#004)). (2..md) Son of Obadiah, and
viceroy of Zebulun under David and Solomon ([Ch1
27:19](../kjv/ch1027.htm#019).md).

<span id="007">**Ishmeelites**</span> ([Gen
37:28](../kjv/gen037.htm#028); [Gen 39:1](../kjv/gen039.htm#001), A.V..md)
should be "Ishmaelites," as in the Revised Version.

<span id="008">**Ishtob**</span> Man of Tob, one of the small Syrian
kingdoms which together constituted Aram ([Sa2
10:6](../kjv/sa2010.htm#006), [Sa2 10:8](../kjv/sa2010.htm#008).md).

<span id="009">**Island**</span> (Heb. 'i , "dry land," as opposed to
water) occurs in its usual signification ([Isa
42:4](../kjv/isa042.htm#004), [Isa 42:10](../kjv/isa042.htm#010.md), [Isa
42:12](../kjv/isa042.htm#012), [Isa 42:15](../kjv/isa042.htm#015.md),
compare [Jer 47:4](../kjv/jer047.htm#004).md), but more frequently simply
denotes a maritime region or sea-coast ([Isa
20:6](../kjv/isa020.htm#006.md), R.V.," coastland;" [Isa
23:2](../kjv/isa023.htm#002), [Isa 23:6](../kjv/isa023.htm#006.md); [Jer
2:10](../kjv/jer002.htm#010); [Eze 27:6](../kjv/eze027.htm#006.md), [Eze
27:7](../kjv/eze027.htm#007)). (See CHITTIM..md) The shores of the
Mediterranean are called the "islands of the sea" ([Isa
11:11](../kjv/isa011.htm#011).md), or the "isles of the Gentiles" ([Gen
10:5](../kjv/gen010.htm#005).md), and sometimes simply "isles" ([Psa
72:10](../kjv/psa072.htm#010)); [Eze 26:15](../kjv/eze026.htm#015.md), [Eze
26:18](../kjv/eze026.htm#018); [Eze 27:3](../kjv/eze027.htm#003.md), [Eze
27:35](../kjv/eze027.htm#035); [Dan 11:18](../kjv/dan011.htm#018).md).
