<span id="000">**Mezahab**</span> Water of gold, the father of Matred
([Gen 36:39](../kjv/gen036.htm#039); [Ch1 1:50](../kjv/ch1001.htm#050).md),
and grandfather of Mehetabel, wife of Hadar, the last king of Edom.

<span id="001">**Miamin**</span> =Mijamin, from the right hand. (1.) The
head of one of the divisions of the priests ([Ch1
24:9](../kjv/ch1024.htm#009)). (2..md) A chief priest who returned from
Babylon with Zerubbabel ([Neh 12:5](../kjv/neh012.htm#005).md), called
Mijamin ([Neh 10:7](../kjv/neh010.htm#007).md) and Miniamin ([Neh
12:17](../kjv/neh012.htm#017).md).

<span id="002">**Mibhar**</span> Choice, a Hagarene, one of David's
warriors ([Ch1 11:38](../kjv/ch1011.htm#038).md); called also Bani the
Gadite ([Sa2 23:36](../kjv/sa2023.htm#036).md).

<span id="003">**Mibsam**</span> Fragrance. (1.) One of Ishmael's twelve
sons, and head of an Arab tribe ([Gen 25:13](../kjv/gen025.htm#013).md).
(2.) A son of Simeon ([Ch1 4:25](../kjv/ch1004.htm#025).md).

<span id="004">**Mibzar**</span> Fortress, one of the Edomitish "dukes"
descended from Esau ([Gen 36:42](../kjv/gen036.htm#042.md); [Ch1
1:53](../kjv/ch1001.htm#053).md).

<span id="005">**Micah**</span> A shortened form of Micaiah, who is like
Jehovah? (1.) A man of Mount Ephraim, whose history so far is introduced
in [Jdg 17:1](../kjv/jdg017.htm#001.md), apparently for the purpose of
leading to an account of the settlement of the tribe of Dan in Northern
Palestine, and for the purpose also of illustrating the lawlessness of
the times in which he lived (Judg. 18; 19:1-29; [Jdg
21:25](../kjv/jdg021.htm#025)). (2..md) The son of Merib-baal
(Mephibosheth), [Ch1 8:34](../kjv/ch1008.htm#034.md), [Ch1
8:35](../kjv/ch1008.htm#035). (3..md) The first in rank of the priests of
the family of Kohathites ([Ch1 23:20](../kjv/ch1023.htm#020)). (4..md) A
descendant of Joel the Reubenite ([Ch1 5:5](../kjv/ch1005.htm#005).md).
(5.) "The Morasthite," so called to distinguish him from Micaiah, the
son of Imlah ([Kg1 22:8](../kjv/kg1022.htm#008).md). He was a prophet of
Judah, a contemporary of Isaiah ([Mic 1:1](../kjv/mic001.htm#001).md), a
native of Moresheth of Gath ([Mic 1:14](../kjv/mic001.htm#014.md), [Mic
1:15](../kjv/mic001.htm#015).md). Very little is known of the circumstances
of his life (Compare [Jer 26:18](../kjv/jer026.htm#018.md), [Jer
26:19](../kjv/jer026.htm#019).md).

<span id="006">**Micah, Book of**</span> The sixth in order of the
so-called minor prophets. The superscription to this book states that
the prophet exercised his office in the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and
Hezekiah. If we reckon from the beginning of Jotham's reign to the end
of Hezekiah's (759-698 B.C.), then he ministered for about fifty-nine
years; but if we reckon from the death of Jotham to the accession of
Hezekiah (743-726 B.C.), his ministry lasted only sixteen years. It has
been noticed as remarkable that this book commences with the last words
of another prophet, "Micaiah the son of Imlah" ([Kg1
22:28](../kjv/kg1022.htm#028).md): "Hearken, O people, every one of you."
The book consists of three sections, each commencing with a rebuke,
"Hear ye," etc., and closing with a promise, (1.) Micah 1; [Mic
2:1](../kjv/mic002.htm#001); (2..md) Micah 3 - 5, especially addressed to
the princes and heads of the people; (3.) Micah 6 - 7, in which Jehovah
is represented as o the holding a controversy with his people: the whole
concluding with a song of triumph at the great deliverance which the
Lord will achieve for his people. The closing verse is quoted in the
song of Zacharias ([Luk 1:72](../kjv/luk001.htm#072.md), [Luk
1:73](../kjv/luk001.htm#073).md). The prediction regarding the place "where
Christ should be born," one of the most remarkable Messianic prophecies
([Mic 5:2](../kjv/mic005.htm#002).md), is quoted in [Mat
2:6](../kjv/mat002.htm#006.md). There are the following references to this
book in the New Testament: [Mic 5:2](../kjv/mic005.htm#002.md) (compare
[Mat 2:6](../kjv/mat002.htm#006); [Joh 7:42](../kjv/joh007.htm#042).md),
[Mic 7:6](../kjv/mic007.htm#006.md) (compare [Mat
10:21](../kjv/mat010.htm#021), [Mat 10:35](../kjv/mat010.htm#035.md), [Mat
10:36](../kjv/mat010.htm#036)), [Mic 7:20](../kjv/mic007.htm#020.md)
(compare [Luk 1:72](../kjv/luk001.htm#072.md), [Luk
1:73](../kjv/luk001.htm#073).md).

<span id="007">**Micaiah**</span> Who is like Jehovah?, the son of
Imlah, a faithful prophet of Samaria (1 Kings 22:8-28). Three years
after the great battle with Ben-hadad ([Kg1
20:29](../kjv/kg1020.htm#029).md), Ahab proposed to Jehoshaphat, king of
Judah, that they should go up against Ramoth-Gilead to do battle again
with Ben-hadad. Jehoshaphat agreed, but suggested that inquiry should be
first made "at the word of Jehovah." Ahab's prophets approved of the
expedition; but Jehoshaphat, still dissatisfied, asked if there was no
other prophet besides the four hundred that had appeared, and was
informed of this Micaiah. He was sent for from prison, where he had been
confined, probably on account of some prediction disagreeable to Ahab;
and he condemned the expedition, and prophesied that it would end, as it
did, in disaster. We hear nothing further of this prophet. Some have
supposed that he was the unnamed prophet referred to in [Kg1
20:35](../kjv/kg1020.htm#035.md).

<span id="008">**Micha**</span> (1.) [Sa2 9:12](../kjv/sa2009.htm#012.md) =
MICAH (2). (2.) The son of Zabdi, a Levite of the family of Asaph ([Neh
11:17](../kjv/neh011.htm#017), [Neh 11:22](../kjv/neh011.htm#022).md).

<span id="009">**Michael**</span> Who is like God? (1.) The title given
to one of the chief angels ([Dan 10:13](../kjv/dan010.htm#013.md), [Dan
10:21](../kjv/dan010.htm#021); [Dan 12:1](../kjv/dan012.htm#001).md). He
had special charge of Israel as a nation. He disputed with Satan ([Jde
1:9](../kjv/jde001.htm#009).md) about the body of Moses. He is also
represented as warning against "that old serpent, called the Devil, and
Satan, which deceiveth the whole world" ([Rev
12:7](../kjv/rev012.htm#007)). (2..md) The father of Sethur, the spy
selected to represent Asher ([Num 13:13](../kjv/num013.htm#013)). (3..md)
[Ch1 7:3](../kjv/ch1007.htm#003), a chief of the tribe of Issachar. (4..md)
[Ch1 8:16](../kjv/ch1008.htm#016), a Benjamite. (5..md) A chief Gadite in
Bashan ([Ch1 5:13](../kjv/ch1005.htm#013)). (6..md) A Manassite, "a captain
of thousands" who joined David at Ziklag ([Ch1
12:20](../kjv/ch1012.htm#020)). (7..md) A Gershonite Levite ([Ch1
6:40](../kjv/ch1006.htm#040)). (8..md) The father of Omri ([Ch1
27:18](../kjv/ch1027.htm#018)). (9..md) One of the sons of king Jehoshaphat
([Ch2 21:2](../kjv/ch2021.htm#002), [Ch2 21:4](../kjv/ch2021.htm#004).md).
He was murdered by his brother Jehoram.
