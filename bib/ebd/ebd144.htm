<P><A NAME="000"><B>Gath-hepher</B></A>     Wine-press of the well a town of Lower Galilee, about 5 miles from Nazareth; the birthplace of Jonah (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2014.htm#025">Kg2 14:25</A>); the same as Gittah-hepher (<A HREF="../kjv/jos019.htm#013">Jos 19:13</A>). It has been identified with the modern el-Meshed, a village on the top of a rocky hill. Here the supposed tomb of Jonah, Neby Yunas, is still pointed out. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Gath-rimmon</B></A>     Press of the pomegranate.     (1.) A Levitical city in the tribe of Dan (<A HREF="../kjv/jos019.htm#045">Jos 19:45</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jos021.htm#024">Jos 21:24</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch1006.htm#069">Ch1 6:69</A>). (2.) Another city of the same name in Manasseh, west of the Jordan (<A HREF="../kjv/jos021.htm#025">Jos 21:25</A>), called also Bileam (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1006.htm#070">Ch1 6:70</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Gaulanitis</B></A>     A name derived from &quot;Golan&quot; (q.v.), one of the cities of refuge in the territory of Manasseh (<A HREF="../kjv/jos020.htm#008">Jos 20:8</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jos021.htm#027">Jos 21:27</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/deu004.htm#043">Deu 4:43</A>). This was one of the provinces ruled by Herod Antipas. It lay to the east of the Lake of Galilee, and included among its towns Bethsaida-Julias (<A HREF="../kjv/mar008.htm#022">Mar 8:22</A>) and Seleucia. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Gaza</B></A>     Called also Azzah, which is its Hebrew name (<A HREF="../kjv/deu002.htm#023">Deu 2:23</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/kg1004.htm#024">Kg1 4:24</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer025.htm#020">Jer 25:20</A>) strong, a city on the Mediterranean shore, remarkable for its early importance as the chief centre of a great commercial traffic with Egypt. It is one of the oldest cities of the world (<A HREF="../kjv/gen010.htm#019">Gen 10:19</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#047">Jos 15:47</A>). Its earliest inhabitants were the Avims, who were conquered and displaced by the Caphtorims (<A HREF="../kjv/deu002.htm#023">Deu 2:23</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jos013.htm#002">Jos 13:2</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/jos013.htm#003">Jos 13:3</A>), a Philistine tribe. In the division of the land it fell to the lot of Judah (<A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#047">Jos 15:47</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jdg001.htm#018">Jdg 1:18</A>). It was the southernmost of the five great Philistine cities which gave each a golden emerod as a trespass-offering unto the Lord (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1006.htm#017">Sa1 6:17</A>). Its gates were carried away by Samson (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg016.htm#001">Jdg 16:1</A>). Here he was afterwards a prisoner, and &quot;did grind in the prison house.&quot; Here he also pulled down the temple of Dagon, and slew &quot;all the lords of the Philistines,&quot; himself also perishing in the ruin (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg016.htm#021">Jdg 16:21</A>). The prophets denounce the judgments of God against it (<A HREF="../kjv/jer025.htm#020">Jer 25:20</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer047.htm#005">Jer 47:5</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/amo001.htm#006">Amo 1:6</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/amo001.htm#007">Amo 1:7</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/zep002.htm#004">Zep 2:4</A>). It is referred to in <A HREF="../kjv/act008.htm#026">Act 8:26</A>. Philip is here told to take the road from Jerusalem to Gaza (about 6 miles south-west of Jerusalem), &quot;which is desert&quot;, i.e., the &quot;desert road,&quot; probably by Hebron, through the desert hills of Southern Judea. (See SAMSON.) It is noticed on monuments as early as 1600 B.C.. Its small port is now called el-Mineh.

<P><A NAME="004"><B>Geba</B></A>     The hill, (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2005.htm#025">Sa2 5:25</A> [<A HREF="../kjv/ch1014.htm#016">Ch1 14:16</A>, &quot;Gibeon&quot;]; <A HREF="../kjv/kg2023.htm#008">Kg2 23:8</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/neh011.htm#031">Neh 11:31</A>), a Levitical city of Benjamin (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1015.htm#022">Kg1 15:22</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa1013.htm#016">Sa1 13:16</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa1014.htm#005">Sa1 14:5</A>, wrongly &quot;Gibeah&quot; in the A.V.), on the north border of Judah near Gibeah (<A HREF="../kjv/isa010.htm#029">Isa 10:29</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jos018.htm#024">Jos 18:24</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/jos018.htm#028">Jos 18:28</A>). &quot;From Geba to Beersheba&quot; expressed the whole extent of the kingdom of Judah, just as &quot;from Dan to Beersheba&quot; described the whole length of Palestine (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2023.htm#008">Kg2 23:8</A>). It has been identified with Gaba (<A HREF="../kjv/jos018.htm#024">Jos 18:24</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ezr002.htm#026">Ezr 2:26</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/neh007.htm#030">Neh 7:30</A>), now  Jeb'a , about 5 1/2 miles north of Jerusalem.

<P><A NAME="005"><B>Gebal</B></A>     A line (or natural boundary, as a mountain range).     (1.) A tract in the land of Edom south of the Dead Sea (<A HREF="../kjv/psa083.htm#007">Psa 83:7</A>); now called Djebal. (2.) A Phoenician city, not far from the sea coast, to the north of Beirut (<A HREF="../kjv/eze027.htm#009">Eze 27:9</A>); called by the Greeks Byblos. Now Jibeil. Mentioned in the Amarna tablets.    An important Phoenician text, referring to the temple of Baalath, on a monument of Yehu-melek, its king (probably 600 B.C.), has been discovered. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Gebalites</B></A>     <A HREF="../kjv/kg1005.htm#018">Kg1 5:18</A> R.V., in A.V. incorrectly rendered, after the Targum, &quot;stone-squarers,&quot; but marg. &quot;Giblites&quot;), the inhabitants of Gebal (2). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Geber</B></A>     A valiant man, (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1004.htm#019">Kg1 4:19</A>), one of Solomon's purveyors, having jurisdiction over a part of Gilead, comprising all the kingdom of Sihon and part of the kingdom of Og (<A HREF="../kjv/deu002.htm#031">Deu 2:31</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Gebim</B></A>     Cisterns, (rendered &quot;pits,&quot; <A HREF="../kjv/jer014.htm#003">Jer 14:3</A>; &quot;locusts,&quot; <A HREF="../kjv/isa033.htm#004">Isa 33:4</A>), a small place north of Jerusalem, whose inhabitants fled at the approach of the Assyrian army (<A HREF="../kjv/isa010.htm#031">Isa 10:31</A>). It is probably the modern el-Isawiyeh. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Gedaliah</B></A>     Made great by Jehovah.     (1.) The son of Jeduthum (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1025.htm#003">Ch1 25:3</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/ch1025.htm#009">Ch1 25:9</A>). (2.) The grandfather of the prophet Zephaniah, and the father of Cushi (<A HREF="../kjv/zep001.htm#001">Zep 1:1</A>). (3.) One of the Jewish nobles who conspired against Jeremiah (<A HREF="../kjv/jer038.htm#001">Jer 38:1</A>). (4.) The son of Ahikam, and grandson of Shaphan, secretary of king Josiah (<A HREF="../kjv/jer026.htm#024">Jer 26:24</A>). After the destruction of Jerusalem (see ZEDEKIAH), Nebuchadnezzar left him to govern the country as tributary to him (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2025.htm#022">Kg2 25:22</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer040.htm#005">Jer 40:5</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer052.htm#016">Jer 52:16</A>). Ishmael, however, at the head of a party of the royal family, &quot;Jewish irreconcilable&quot;, rose against him, and slew him and &quot;all the Jews that were with him&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/jer041.htm#002">Jer 41:2</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/jer041.htm#003">Jer 41:3</A>) at Mizpah about three months after the destruction of Jerusalem. He and his band also plundered the town of Mizpah, and carried off many captives. He was, however, overtaken by Johanan and routed. He fled with such of his followers as escaped to the Ammonites (<A HREF="../kjv/jer041.htm#015">Jer 41:15</A>). The little remnant of the Jews now fled to Egypt.
