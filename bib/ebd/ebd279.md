<span id="000">**Onesiphorus**</span> Bringing profit, an Ephesian
Christian who showed great kindness to Paul at Rome. He served him in
many things, and had oft refreshed him. Paul expresses a warm interest
in him and his household ([Ti2 1:16](../kjv/ti2001.htm#016); [Ti2
4:19](../kjv/ti2004.htm#019)).

<span id="001">**Onion**</span> The Israelites in the wilderness longed
for the "onions and garlic of Egypt" ([Num
11:5](../kjv/num011.htm#005)). This was the betsel of the Hebrews, the
Allium cepe of botanists, of which it is said that there are some thirty
or forty species now growing in Palestine. The onion is "the 'undivided'
leek, unio , unus , one."

<span id="002">**Ono**</span> A town of Benjamin, in the "plain of Ono"
([Ch1 8:12](../kjv/ch1008.htm#012); [Ezr 2:33](../kjv/ezr002.htm#033));
now Kefr 'Ana , 5 miles north of Lydda, and about 30 miles north-west of
Jerusalem. Not succeeding in their attempts to deter Nehemiah from
rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem, Sanballat and Tobiah resorted to
stratagem, and pretending to wish a conference with him, they invited
him to meet them at Ono. Four times they made the request, and every
time Nehemiah refused to come. Their object was to take him prisoner.

<span id="003">**Onycha**</span> A nail; claw; hoof, (Heb. sheheleth ;
[Exo 30:34](../kjv/exo030.htm#034)), a Latin word applied to the
operculum, i.e., the claw or nail of the strombus or wing-shell, a
univalve common in the Red Sea. The opercula of these shell-fish when
burned emit a strong odour "like castoreum." This was an ingredient in
the sacred incense.

<span id="004">**Onyx**</span> A hail; claw; hoof, (Heb. shoham ), a
precious stone adorning the breast-plate of the high priest and the
shoulders of the ephod ([Exo 28:9](../kjv/exo028.htm#009), [Exo
28:20](../kjv/exo028.htm#020); [Exo 35:27](../kjv/exo035.htm#027); [Job
28:16](../kjv/job028.htm#016); [Eze 28:13](../kjv/eze028.htm#013)). It
was found in the land of Havilah ([Gen 2:12](../kjv/gen002.htm#012)).
The LXX. translates the Hebrew word by smaragdos, an emerald. Some think
that the sardonyx is meant. But the onyx differs from the sardonyx in
this, that while the latter has two layers (black and white) the former
has three (black, white, and red).

<span id="005">**Open place**</span> [Gen 38:14](../kjv/gen038.htm#014),
[Gen 38:21](../kjv/gen038.htm#021), mar. Enaim; the same probably as
Enam ([Jos 15:34](../kjv/jos015.htm#034)), a city in the lowland or
Shephelah.

<span id="006">**Ophel**</span> Hill; mound, the long, narrow, rounded
promontory on the southern slope of the temple hill, between the
Tyropoeon and the Kedron valley ([Ch2 27:3](../kjv/ch2027.htm#003); [Ch2
33:14](../kjv/ch2033.htm#014); [Neh 3:26](../kjv/neh003.htm#026), [Neh
3:27](../kjv/neh003.htm#027)). It was surrounded by a separate wall, and
was occupied by the Nethinim after the Captivity. This wall has been
discovered by the engineers of the Palestine Exploration Fund at the
south-eastern angle of the temple area. It is 4 feet below the present
surface. In [Kg2 5:24](../kjv/kg2005.htm#024) this word is translated
"tower" (R.V., "hill"), denoting probably some eminence near Elisha's
house.

<span id="007">**Ophir**</span> (1.) One of the sons of Joktan ([Gen
10:29](../kjv/gen010.htm#029)). (2.) Some region famous for its gold
([Kg1 9:28](../kjv/kg1009.htm#028); [Kg1 10:11](../kjv/kg1010.htm#011);
[Kg1 22:48](../kjv/kg1022.htm#048); [Job 22:24](../kjv/job022.htm#024);
[Job 28:16](../kjv/job028.htm#016); [Isa 13:12](../kjv/isa013.htm#012)).
In the LXX. this word is rendered "Sophir," and "Sofir" is the Coptic
name for India, which is the rendering of the Arabic version, as also of
the Vulgate. Josephus has identified it with the Golden Chersonese,
i.e., the Malay peninsula. It is now generally identified with Abhira,
at the mouth of the Indus. Much may be said, however, in favour of the
opinion that it was somewhere in Arabia.

<span id="008">**Ophni**</span> Mouldy, a city of Benjamin ([Jos
18:24](../kjv/jos018.htm#024)).

<span id="009">**Ophrah**</span> (1.) A fawn. [Ch1
4:14](../kjv/ch1004.htm#014). Id. (2.) A city of Benjamin ([Jos
18:23](../kjv/jos018.htm#023)); probably identical with Ephron ([Ch2
13:19](../kjv/ch2013.htm#019)) and Ephraim ([Joh
11:54](../kjv/joh011.htm#054)). (3.) "Of the Abi-ezrites." A city of
Manasseh, 6 miles south-west of Shechem, the residence of Gideon ([Jdg
6:11](../kjv/jdg006.htm#011); [Jdg 8:27](../kjv/jdg008.htm#027), [Jdg
8:32](../kjv/jdg008.htm#032)). After his great victory over the
Midianites, he slew at this place the captive kings ([Jdg
8:18](../kjv/jdg008.htm#018)). He then assumed the function of high
priest, and sought to make Ophrah what Shiloh should have been. This
thing "became a snare" to Gideon and his house. After Gideon's death his
family resided here till they were put to death by Abimelech ([Jdg
9:5](../kjv/jdg009.htm#005)). It is identified with Ferata.
