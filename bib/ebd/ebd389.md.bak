<span id="000">**Zebudah**</span> Given, the wife of Josiah and mother
of Jehoiakim ([Kg2 23:36](../kjv/kg2023.htm#036).md).

<span id="001">**Zebul**</span> Habitation, the governor of Shechem
under Abimelech ([Jdg 9:28](../kjv/jdg009.htm#028.md), [Jdg
9:30](../kjv/jdg009.htm#030), [Jdg 9:36](../kjv/jdg009.htm#036).md). He
informed his master of the intention of the people of Shechem to
transfer their allegiance to the Hivite tribe of Hamor. This led to
Abimelech's destroying the city, when he put its entire population to
the sword, and sowed the ruins with salt (Judg. 9:28-45).

<span id="002">**Zebulonite**</span> The designation of Elon, the judge
who belonged to the tribe of Zebulun ([Jdg
12:11](../kjv/jdg012.htm#011), [Jdg 12:12](../kjv/jdg012.htm#012).md).

<span id="003">**Zebulun**</span> Dwelling, the sixth and youngest son
of Jacob and Leah ([Gen 30:20](../kjv/gen030.htm#020).md). Little is known
of his personal history. He had three sons ([Gen
46:14](../kjv/gen046.htm#014).md).

<span id="004">**Zebulun, Tribe of**</span> Numbered at Sinai ([Num
1:31](../kjv/num001.htm#031).md) and before entering Canaan ([Num
26:27](../kjv/num026.htm#027).md). It was one of the tribes which did not
drive out the Canaanites, but only made them tributary ([Jdg
1:30](../kjv/jdg001.htm#030).md). It took little interest in public
affairs. It responded, however, readily to the summons of Gideon ([Jdg
6:35](../kjv/jdg006.htm#035).md), and afterwards assisted in enthroning
David at Hebron ([Ch1 12:33](../kjv/ch1012.htm#033.md), [Ch1
12:40](../kjv/ch1012.htm#040).md). Along with the other northern tribes,
Zebulun was carried away into the land of Assyria by Tiglath-pileser
([Kg2 15:29](../kjv/kg2015.htm#029).md). In Deborah's song the words, "Out
of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer" ([Jdg
5:14](../kjv/jdg005.htm#014).md) has been rendered in the R.V., "They that
handle the marshal's staff." This is a questionable rendering. "The word
sopher ('scribe' or 'writer') defines the word shebhet ('rod' or 'pen')
with which it is conjoined. The 'rod of the scribe' on the Assyrian
monuments was the stylus of wood or metal, with the help of which the
clay tablet was engraved, or the papyrus inscribed with characters. The
scribe who wielded it was the associate and assistant of the
'lawgivers.'" (Sayce).

<span id="005">**Zebulun, Lot of**</span> In Galilee, to the north of
Issachar and south of Asher and Naphtali ([Jos
19:10](../kjv/jos019.htm#010).md), and between the Sea of Galilee and the
Mediterranean. According to ancient prophecy this part of Galilee
enjoyed a large share of our Lord's public ministry ([Isa
9:1](../kjv/isa009.htm#001), [Isa 9:2](../kjv/isa009.htm#002.md); [Mat
4:12](../kjv/mat004.htm#012).md).

<span id="006">**Zechariah**</span> Jehovah is renowned or remembered.
(1.) A prophet of Judah, the eleventh of the twelve minor prophets. Like
Ezekiel, he was of priestly extraction. He describes himself ([Zac
1:1](../kjv/zac001.htm#001).md) as "the son of Berechiah." In [Ezr
5:1](../kjv/ezr005.htm#001) and [Ezr 6:14](../kjv/ezr006.htm#014.md) he is
called "the son of Iddo," who was properly his grandfather. His
prophetical career began in the second year of Darius (520 B.C.), about
sixteen years after the return of the first company from exile. He was
contemporary with Haggai ([Ezr 5:1](../kjv/ezr005.htm#001).md). His book
consists of two distinct parts, [Hag 1:1](../kjv/hag001.htm#001.md) to 8,
inclusive, and 9 to the end. It begins with a preface ([Zac
1:1](../kjv/zac001.htm#001).md), which recalls the nation's past history,
for the purpose of presenting a solemn warning to the present
generation. Then follows a series of eight visions (Zech. 1:7 - 6:8),
succeeding one another in one night, which may be regarded as a
symbolical history of Israel, intended to furnish consolation to the
returned exiles and stir up hope in their minds. The symbolical action,
the crowning of Joshua ([Zac 6:9](../kjv/zac006.htm#009).md), describes how
the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of God's Christ. [Zac
7:1](../kjv/zac007.htm#001.md) and 8, delivered two years later, are an
answer to the question whether the days of mourning for the destruction
of the city should be any longer kept, and an encouraging address to the
people, assuring them of God's presence and blessing. The second part of
the book (Zech. 9 - 14) bears no date. It is probable that a
considerable interval separates it from the first part. It consists of
two burdens. The first burden (Zech. 9 - 11) gives an outline of the
course of God's providential dealings with his people down to the time
of the Advent. The second burden (Zech. 12 - 14) points out the glories
that await Israel in "the latter day", the final conflict and triumph of
God's kingdom. (2.) The son or grandson of Jehoiada, the high priest in
the times of Ahaziah and Joash. After the death of Jehoiada he boldly
condemned both the king and the people for their rebellion against God
([Ch2 24:20](../kjv/ch2024.htm#020).md), which so stirred up their
resentment against him that at the king's commandment they stoned him
with stones, and he died "in the court of the house of the Lord" ([Ch2
24:21](../kjv/ch2024.htm#021).md). Christ alludes to this deed of murder in
[Mat 23:35](../kjv/mat023.htm#035), [Luk 11:51](../kjv/luk011.htm#051.md).
(See ZACHARIAS \[2\].) (3.) A prophet, who had "understanding in the
seeing of God," in the time of Uzziah, who was much indebted to him for
his wise counsel ([Ch2 26:5](../kjv/ch2026.htm#005).md). Besides these,
there is a large number of persons mentioned in Scripture bearing this
name of whom nothing is known. (4.) One of the chiefs of the tribe of
Reuben ([Ch1 5:7](../kjv/ch1005.htm#007)). (5..md) One of the porters of
the tabernacle ([Ch1 9:21](../kjv/ch1009.htm#021)). (6..md) [Ch1
9:37](../kjv/ch1009.htm#037). (7..md) A Levite who assisted at the bringing
up of the ark from the house of Obededom ([Ch1
15:20](../kjv/ch1015.htm#020)). (8..md) A Kohathite Levite ([Ch1
24:25](../kjv/ch1024.htm#025)). (9..md) A Merarite Levite ([Ch1
27:21](../kjv/ch1027.htm#021)). (10..md) The father of Iddo ([Ch1
27:21](../kjv/ch1027.htm#021)). (11..md) One who assisted in teaching the
law to the people in the time of Jehoshaphat ([Ch2
17:7](../kjv/ch2017.htm#007)). (12..md) A Levite of the sons of Asaph ([Ch2
20:14](../kjv/ch2020.htm#014)). (13..md) One of Jehoshaphat's sons ([Ch2
21:2](../kjv/ch2021.htm#002)). (14..md) The father of Abijah, who was the
mother of Hezekiah ([Ch2 29:1](../kjv/ch2029.htm#001)). (15..md) One of the
sons of Asaph ([Ch2 29:13](../kjv/ch2029.htm#013)). (16..md) One of the
"rulers of the house of God" ([Ch2 35:8](../kjv/ch2035.htm#008)). (17..md)
A chief of the people in the time of Ezra, who consulted him about the
return from captivity ([Ezr 8:16](../kjv/ezr008.htm#016).md); probably the
same as mentioned in [Neh 8:4](../kjv/neh008.htm#004), (18..md) [Neh
11:12](../kjv/neh011.htm#012). (19.) [Neh 12:16](../kjv/neh012.htm#016.md).
(20.) [Neh 12:35](../kjv/neh012.htm#035.md), [Neh
12:41](../kjv/neh012.htm#041). (21.) [Isa 8:2](../kjv/isa008.htm#002.md).

<span id="007">**Zedad**</span> Side; sloping place, a town in the north
of Palestine, near Hamath ([Num 34:8](../kjv/num034.htm#008.md); [Eze
47:15](../kjv/eze047.htm#015).md). It has been identified with the ruins of
Sudud, between Emesa (Hums) and Baalbec, but that is uncertain.

<span id="008">**Zedekiah**</span> Righteousness of Jehovah. (1.) The
last king of Judah. He was the third son of Josiah, and his mother's
name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah, and hence he was
the brother of Jehoahaz ([Kg2 23:31](../kjv/kg2023.htm#031.md); [Kg2
24:17](../kjv/kg2024.htm#017), [Kg2 24:18](../kjv/kg2024.htm#018).md). His
original name was Mattaniah; but when Nebuchadnezzar placed him on the
throne as the successor to Jehoiachin he changed his name to Zedekiah.
The prophet Jeremiah was his counsellor, yet "he did evil in the sight
of the Lord" ([Kg2 24:19](../kjv/kg2024.htm#019.md), [Kg2
24:20](../kjv/kg2024.htm#020); [Jer 52:2](../kjv/jer052.htm#002.md), [Jer
52:3](../kjv/jer052.htm#003).md). He ascended the throne at the age of
twenty-one years. The kingdom was at that time tributary to
Nebuchadnezzar; but, despite the strong remonstrances of Jeremiah and
others, as well as the example of Jehoiachin, he threw off the yoke of
Babylon, and entered into an alliance with Hophra, king of Egypt. This
brought up Nebuchadnezzar, "with all his host" ([Kg2
25:1](../kjv/kg2025.htm#001).md), against Jerusalem. During this siege,
which lasted about eighteen months, "every worst woe befell the devoted
city, which drank the cup of God's fury to the dregs" ([Kg2
25:3](../kjv/kg2025.htm#003); [Lam 4:4](../kjv/lam004.htm#004.md), [Lam
4:5](../kjv/lam004.htm#005), [Lam 4:10](../kjv/lam004.htm#010).md). The
city was plundered and laid in ruins. Zedekiah and his followers,
attempting to escape, were made captive and taken to Riblah. There,
after seeing his own children put to death, his own eyes were put out,
and, being loaded with chains, he was carried captive (588 B.C.) to
Babylon ([Kg2 25:1](../kjv/kg2025.htm#001.md); [Ch2
36:12](../kjv/ch2036.htm#012); [Jer 32:4](../kjv/jer032.htm#004.md), [Jer
32:5](../kjv/jer032.htm#005); [Jer 34:2](../kjv/jer034.htm#002.md), [Jer
34:3](../kjv/jer034.htm#003); [Jer 39:1](../kjv/jer039.htm#001.md); [Jer
52:4](../kjv/jer052.htm#004); [Eze 12:12](../kjv/eze012.htm#012).md), where
he remained a prisoner, how long is unknown, to the day of his death.
After the fall of Jerusalem, Nebuzaraddan was sent to carry out its
complete destruction. The city was razed to the ground. Only a small
number of vinedressers and husbandman were permitted to remain in the
land ([Jer 52:16](../kjv/jer052.htm#016).md). Gedaliah, with a Chaldean
guard stationed at Mizpah, ruled over Judah ([Kg2
25:22](../kjv/kg2025.htm#022), [Kg2 25:24](../kjv/kg2025.htm#024.md); [Jer
40:1](../kjv/jer040.htm#001), [Jer 40:2](../kjv/jer040.htm#002.md), [Jer
40:5](../kjv/jer040.htm#005), [Jer 40:6](../kjv/jer040.htm#006)). (2..md)
The son of Chenaanah, a false prophet in the days of Ahab ([Kg1
22:11](../kjv/kg1022.htm#011), [Kg1 22:24](../kjv/kg1022.htm#024.md); [Ch2
18:10](../kjv/ch2018.htm#010), [Ch2 18:23](../kjv/ch2018.htm#023)). (3..md)
The son of Hananiah, a prince of Judah in the days of Jehoiakim ([Jer
36:12](../kjv/jer036.htm#012).md).

<span id="009">**Zeeb**</span> The wolf, one of the two leaders of the
great Midianite host which invaded Israel and was utterly routed by
Gideon. The division of that host, which attempted to escape across the
Jordan, under Oreb and Zeeb, was overtaken by the Ephraimites, who, in a
great battle, completely vanquished them, their leaders being taken and
slain ([Jdg 7:25](../kjv/jdg007.htm#025.md); [Psa
83:11](../kjv/psa083.htm#011); [Isa 10:26](../kjv/isa010.htm#026).md).
