<span id="000">**Oath**</span> A solemn appeal to God, permitted on
fitting occasions ([Deu 6:13](../kjv/deu006.htm#013.md); [Jer
4:2](../kjv/jer004.htm#002).md), in various forms ([Gen
16:5](../kjv/gen016.htm#005); [Sa2 12:5](../kjv/sa2012.htm#005.md); [Rut
1:17](../kjv/rut001.htm#017); [Hos 4:15](../kjv/hos004.htm#015.md); [Rom
1:9](../kjv/rom001.htm#009).md), and taken in different ways ([Gen
14:22](../kjv/gen014.htm#022); [Gen 24:2](../kjv/gen024.htm#002.md); [Ch2
6:22](../kjv/ch2006.htm#022).md). God is represented as taking an oath
([Heb 6:16](../kjv/heb006.htm#016).md), so also Christ ([Mat
26:64](../kjv/mat026.htm#064).md), and Paul ([Rom
9:1](../kjv/rom009.htm#001); [Gal 1:20](../kjv/gal001.htm#020.md); [Phi
1:8](../kjv/phi001.htm#008).md). The precept, "Swear not at all," refers
probably to ordinary conversation between man and man ([Mat
5:34](../kjv/mat005.htm#034), [Mat 5:37](../kjv/mat005.htm#037).md). But if
the words are taken as referring to oaths, then their intention may have
been to show "that the proper state of Christians is to require no
oaths; that when evil is expelled from among them every yea and nay will
be as decisive as an oath, every promise as binding as a vow."

<span id="001">**Obadiah**</span> Servant of the Lord. (1.) An Israelite
who was chief in the household of King Ahab ([Kg1
18:3](../kjv/kg1018.htm#003).md). Amid great spiritual degeneracy he
maintained his fidelity to God, and interposed to protect The Lord's
prophets, an hundred of whom he hid at great personal risk in a cave
([Kg1 18:4](../kjv/kg1018.htm#004), [Kg1 18:13](../kjv/kg1018.htm#013).md).
Ahab seems to have held Obadiah in great honour, although he had no
sympathy with his piety ([Kg1 18:5](../kjv/kg1018.htm#005.md), [Kg1
18:6](../kjv/kg1018.htm#006), [Kg1 18:7](../kjv/kg1018.htm#007).md). The
last notice of him is his bringing back tidings to Ahab that Elijah,
whom he had so long sought for, was at hand ([Kg1
18:9](../kjv/kg1018.htm#009).md). "Go," said Elijah to him, when he met him
in the way, "go tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here." (2.) A chief of
the tribe of Issachar ([Ch1 7:3](../kjv/ch1007.htm#003)). (3..md) A
descendant of Saul ([Ch1 8:38](../kjv/ch1008.htm#038)). (4..md) A Levite,
after the Captivity ([Ch1 9:16](../kjv/ch1009.htm#016)). (5..md) A Gadite
who joined David at Ziklag ([Ch1 12:9](../kjv/ch1012.htm#009)). (6..md) A
prince of Zebulun in the time of David ([Ch1
27:19](../kjv/ch1027.htm#019)). (7..md) One of the princes sent by
Jehoshaphat to instruct the people in the law ([Ch2
17:7](../kjv/ch2017.htm#007)). (8..md) A Levite who superintended the
repairs of the temple under Josiah ([Ch2 34:12](../kjv/ch2034.htm#012).md).
(9.) One who accompanied Ezra on the return from Babylon ([Ezr
8:9](../kjv/ezr008.htm#009)). (10..md) A prophet, fourth of the minor
prophets in the Hebrew canon, and fifth in the LXX. He was probably
contemporary with Jeremiah and Ezekiel. Of his personal history nothing
is known.

<span id="002">**Obadiah, Book of**</span> Consists of one chapter,
"concerning Edom," its impending doom (Obad. 1-16), and the restoration
of Israel ([Oba 1:17](../kjv/oba001.htm#017).md). This is the shortest book
of the Old Testament. There are on record the account of four captures
of Jerusalem, (1.) by Shishak in the reign of Rehoboam ([Kg1
14:25](../kjv/kg1014.htm#025)); (2..md) by the Philistines and Arabians in
the reign of Jehoram ([Ch2 21:16](../kjv/ch2021.htm#016)); (3..md) by
Joash, the king of Israel, in the reign of Amaziah ([Kg2
14:13](../kjv/kg2014.htm#013)); and (4..md) by the Babylonians, when
Jerusalem was taken and destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar (586 B.C.). Obadiah
([Oba 1:11](../kjv/oba001.htm#011).md) speaks of this capture as a thing
past. He sees the calamity as having already come on Jerusalem, and the
Edomites as joining their forces with those of the Chaldeans in bringing
about the degradation and ruin of Israel. We do not indeed read that the
Edomites actually took part with the Chaldeans, but the probabilities
are that they did so, and this explains the words of Obadiah in
denouncing against Edom the judgments of God. The date of his prophecies
was thus in or about the year of the destruction of Jerusalem. Edom is
the type of Israel's and of God's last foe ([Isa
63:1](../kjv/isa063.htm#001).md). These will finally all be vanquished, and
the kingdom will be the Lord's (Compare [Psa
22:28](../kjv/psa022.htm#028).md).

<span id="003">**Obal**</span> Stripped, the eight son of Joktan ([Gen
10:28](../kjv/gen010.htm#028).md); called also Ebal ([Ch1
1:22](../kjv/ch1001.htm#022).md).

<span id="004">**Obed**</span> Serving; worshipping. (1.) A son of Boaz
and Ruth ([Rut 4:21](../kjv/rut004.htm#021.md), [Rut
4:22](../kjv/rut004.htm#022).md), and the grandfather of David ([Mat
1:5](../kjv/mat001.htm#005)). (2.) [Ch1 2:34](../kjv/ch1002.htm#034.md).
(3.) [Ch1 26:7](../kjv/ch1026.htm#007). (4..md) [Ch2
23:1](../kjv/ch2023.htm#001.md).

<span id="005">**Obed-Edom**</span> Servant of Edom. (1.) "The Gittite"
(probably so called because he was a native of Gath-rimmon), a Levite of
the family of the Korhites ([Ch1 26:1](../kjv/ch1026.htm#001.md), [Ch1
26:4](../kjv/ch1026.htm#004).md), to whom was specially entrusted the
custody of the ark ([Ch1 15:18](../kjv/ch1015.htm#018).md). When David was
bringing up the ark "from the house of Abinadab, that was in Gibeah"
(probably some hill or eminence near Kirjath-jearim), and had reached
Nachon's threshing-floor, he became afraid because of the "breach upon
Uzzah," and carried it aside into the house of Obededom ([Sa2
6:1](../kjv/sa2006.htm#001).md). There it remained for six months, and was
to him and his house the occasion of great blessing. David then removed
it with great rejoicing to Jerusalem, and set it in the midst of the
tabernacle he had pitched for it. (2.) A Merarite Levite, a temple
porter, who with his eight sons guarded the southern gate ([Ch1
15:18](../kjv/ch1015.htm#018), [Ch1 15:21](../kjv/ch1015.htm#021.md); [Ch1
26:4](../kjv/ch1026.htm#004), [Ch1 26:8](../kjv/ch1026.htm#008.md), [Ch1
26:15](../kjv/ch1026.htm#015)). (3..md) One who had charge of the temple
treasures ([Ch2 25:24](../kjv/ch2025.htm#024).md).

<span id="006">**Obeisance**</span> Homage or reverence to any one ([Gen
37:7](../kjv/gen037.htm#007); [Gen 43:28](../kjv/gen043.htm#028).md).

<span id="007">**Obil**</span> A keeper of camels, an Ishmaelite who was
"over the camels" in the time of David ([Ch1
27:30](../kjv/ch1027.htm#030).md).

<span id="008">**Oboth**</span> Bottles, an encampment of the Israelites
during the wanderings in the wilderness ([Num
33:43](../kjv/num033.htm#043).md), the first after the setting up of the
brazen serpent.

<span id="009">**Oded**</span> Restoring, or setting up. (1.) Father of
the prophet Azariah ([Ch2 15:1](../kjv/ch2015.htm#001.md), [Ch2
15:8](../kjv/ch2015.htm#008)). (2..md) A prophet in the time of Ahaz and
Pekah ([Ch2 28:9](../kjv/ch2028.htm#009).md).
