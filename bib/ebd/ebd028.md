<span id="000">**Arad**</span> (1.) Now Tell Arad, a Canaanite city,
about 20 miles south of Hebron. The king of Arad "fought against Israel
and took of them prisoners" when they were retreating from the confines
of Edom ([Num 21:1](../kjv/num021.htm#001); [Num
33:40](../kjv/num033.htm#040); [Jdg 1:16](../kjv/jdg001.htm#016)). It
was finally subdued by Joshua ([Jos 12:14](../kjv/jos012.htm#014)). (2.)
One of the sons of Beriah ([Ch1 8:15](../kjv/ch1008.htm#015)).

<span id="001">**Aram**</span> The son of Shem ([Gen
10:22](../kjv/gen010.htm#022)); according to [Gen
22:21](../kjv/gen022.htm#021), a grandson of Nahor. In [Mat
1:3](../kjv/mat001.htm#003), [Mat 1:4](../kjv/mat001.htm#004), and [Luk
3:33](../kjv/luk003.htm#033), this word is the Greek form of Ram, the
father of Amminadab ([Ch1 2:10](../kjv/ch1002.htm#010)). The word means
high, or highlands, and as the name of a country denotes that elevated
region extending from the northeast of Palestine to the Euphrates. It
corresponded generally with the Syria and Mesopotamia of the Greeks and
Romans. In [Gen 25:20](../kjv/gen025.htm#020); [Gen
31:20](../kjv/gen031.htm#020), [Gen 31:24](../kjv/gen031.htm#024); [Deu
26:5](../kjv/deu026.htm#005), the word "Syrian" is properly "Aramean"
(R.V., marg.). Damascus became at length the capital of the several
smaller kingdoms comprehended under the designation "Aram" or "Syria."

<span id="002">**Aram-naharaim**</span> Aram of the two rivers, is
Mesopotamia (as it is rendered in [Gen 24:10](../kjv/gen024.htm#010)),
the country enclosed between the Tigris on the east and the Euphrates on
the west ([Psa 60:1](../kjv/psa060.htm#001), title); called also the
"field of Aram" ([Hos 12:12](../kjv/hos012.htm#012), R.V.) i.e., the
open country of Aram; in the Authorized Version, "country of Syria."
Padan-aram (q.v.) was a portion of this country.

<span id="003">**Aram-zobah**</span> ([Psa 60:1](../kjv/psa060.htm#001),
title), probably the region between the Euphrates and the Orontes.

<span id="004">**Aran**</span> Wild goat, a descendant of Seir the
Horite ([Gen 36:28](../kjv/gen036.htm#028)).

<span id="005">**Ararat**</span> Sacred land or high land, the name of a
country on one of the mountains of which the ark rested after the Flood
subsided ([Gen 8:4](../kjv/gen008.htm#004)). The "mountains" mentioned
were probably the Kurdish range of South Armenia. In [Kg2
19:37](../kjv/kg2019.htm#037); [Isa 37:38](../kjv/isa037.htm#038), the
word is rendered "Armenia" in the Authorized Version, but in the Revised
Version, "Land of Ararat." In [Jer 51:27](../kjv/jer051.htm#027), the
name denotes the central or southern portion of Armenia. It is, however,
generally applied to a high and almost inaccessible mountain which rises
majestically from the plain of the Araxes. It has two conical peaks,
about 7 miles apart, the one 14,300 feet and the other 10,300 feet above
the level of the plain. Three thousand feet of the summit of the higher
of these peaks is covered with perpetual snow. It is called Kuh-i-nuh,
i.e., "Noah's mountain", by the Persians. This part of Armenia was
inhabited by a people who spoke a language unlike any other now known,
though it may have been related to the modern Georgian. About 900 B.C.
they borrowed the cuneiform characters of Nineveh, and from this time we
have inscriptions of a line of kings who at times contended with
Assyria. At the close of the seventh century B.C. the kingdom of Ararat
came to an end, and the country was occupied by a people who are
ancestors of the Armenians of the present day.

<span id="006">**Araunah**</span> Agile; also called Ornan [Ch1
21:15](../kjv/ch1021.htm#015), a Jebusite who dwelt in Jerusalem before
it was taken by the Israelites. The destroying angel, sent to punish
David for his vanity in taking a census of the people, was stayed in his
work of destruction near a threshing-floor belonging to Araunah which
was situated on Mount Moriah. Araunah offered it to David as a free
gift, together with the oxen and the threshing instruments; but the king
insisted on purchasing it at its full price ([Sa2
24:24](../kjv/sa2024.htm#024); [Ch1 21:24](../kjv/ch1021.htm#024), [Ch1
21:25](../kjv/ch1021.htm#025)), for, according to the law of sacrifices,
he could not offer to God what cost him nothing. On the same place
Solomon afterwards erected the temple ([Sa2
24:16](../kjv/sa2024.htm#016); [Ch2 3:1](../kjv/ch2003.htm#001)). (See
ALTAR.)

<span id="007">**Arba**</span> Four, a giant, father of Anak. From him
the city of Hebron derived its name of Kirjath-arba, i.e., the city of
Araba ([Jos 14:15](../kjv/jos014.htm#015); [Jos
15:13](../kjv/jos015.htm#013); [Jos 21:11](../kjv/jos021.htm#011); [Gen
13:18](../kjv/gen013.htm#018); [Gen 23:2](../kjv/gen023.htm#002)). (See
HEBRON.)

<span id="008">**Arbathite**</span> A name given to Abi-albon, or, as
elsewhere called, Abiel, one of David's warriors ([Sa2
23:31](../kjv/sa2023.htm#031); [Ch1 11:32](../kjv/ch1011.htm#032)),
probably as being an inhabitant of Arabah ([Jos
15:61](../kjv/jos015.htm#061)), a town in the wilderness of Judah.

<span id="009">**Archangel**</span> ([Th1 4:16](../kjv/th1004.htm#016);
[Jde 1:9](../kjv/jde001.htm#009)), the prince of the angels.
