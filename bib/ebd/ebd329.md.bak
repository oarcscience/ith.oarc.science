<span id="000">**Serpent, Fiery**</span> (LXX. "deadly," Vulg.
"burning"), [Num 21:6](../kjv/num021.htm#006.md), probably the naja haje of
Egypt; some swift-springing, deadly snake ([Isa
14:29](../kjv/isa014.htm#029).md). After setting out from their encampment
at Ezion-gaber, the Israelites entered on a wide sandy desert, which
stretches from the mountains of Edom as far as the Persian Gulf. While
traversing this region, the people began to murmur and utter loud
complaints against Moses. As a punishment, the Lord sent serpents among
them, and much people of Israel died. Moses interceded on their behalf,
and by divine direction he made a "brazen serpent," and raised it on a
pole in the midst of the camp, and all the wounded Israelites who looked
on it were at once healed. (Compare [Joh 3:14](../kjv/joh003.htm#014.md),
[Joh 3:15](../kjv/joh003.htm#015).) (See ASP..md) This "brazen serpent" was
preserved by the Israelites till the days of Hezekiah, when it was
destroyed ([Kg2 18:4](../kjv/kg2018.htm#004)). (See BRASS..md)

<span id="001">**Serug**</span> Branch, the father of Nahor ([Gen
11:20](../kjv/gen011.htm#020).md); called Saruch in [Luk
3:35](../kjv/luk003.htm#035.md).

<span id="002">**Servitor**</span> Occurs only in [Kg2
4:43](../kjv/kg2004.htm#043), Authorized Version (R.V., "servant".md). The
Hebrew word there rendered "servitor" is elsewhere rendered "minister,"
"servant" ([Exo 24:13](../kjv/exo024.htm#013.md); [Exo
33:11](../kjv/exo033.htm#011).md). Probably Gehazi, the personal attendant
on Elisha, is here meant.

<span id="003">**Seth**</span> Appointed; a substitute, the third son of
Adam and Eve ([Gen 4:25](../kjv/gen004.htm#025.md); [Gen
5:3](../kjv/gen005.htm#003).md). His mother gave him this name, "for God,"
said she, "hath appointed me \[i.e., compensated me with\] another seed
instead of Abel, whom Cain slew."

<span id="004">**Sethur**</span> Hidden, one of the spies sent to search
the Promised Land. He was of the tribe of Asher ([Num
13:13](../kjv/num013.htm#013).md).

<span id="005">**Seven**</span> This number occurs frequently in
Scripture, and in such connections as lead to the supposition that it
has some typical meaning. On the seventh day God rested, and hallowed it
([Gen 2:2](../kjv/gen002.htm#002), [Gen 2:3](../kjv/gen002.htm#003).md).
The division of time into weeks of seven days each accounts for many
instances of the occurrence of this number. This number has been called
the symbol of perfection, and also the symbol of rest. "Jacob's seven
years' service to Laban; Pharaoh's seven fat oxen and seven lean ones;
the seven branches of the golden candlestick; who sounded them; the
seven days' siege of Jericho; the seven churches, seven spirits, seven
stars, seven seals, seven vials, and many others, sufficiently prove the
importance of this sacred number" (see [Lev
25:4](../kjv/lev025.htm#004); [Sa1 2:5](../kjv/sa1002.htm#005.md); [Psa
12:6](../kjv/psa012.htm#006); [Psa 79:12](../kjv/psa079.htm#012.md); [Pro
26:16](../kjv/pro026.htm#016); [Isa 4:1](../kjv/isa004.htm#001.md); [Mat
18:21](../kjv/mat018.htm#021), [Mat 18:22](../kjv/mat018.htm#022.md); [Luk
17:4](../kjv/luk017.htm#004).md). The feast of Passover ([Exo
12:15](../kjv/exo012.htm#015), [Exo 12:16](../kjv/exo012.htm#016).md), the
feast of Weeks ([Deu 16:9](../kjv/deu016.htm#009).md), of Tabernacles ([Deu
13:15](../kjv/deu013.htm#015).md), and the Jubilee ([Lev
25:8](../kjv/lev025.htm#008).md), were all ordered by seven. Seven is the
number of sacrifice ([Ch2 29:21](../kjv/ch2029.htm#021.md); [Job
42:8](../kjv/job042.htm#008).md), of purification and consecration ([Lev
4:6](../kjv/lev004.htm#006), [Lev 4:17](../kjv/lev004.htm#017.md); [Lev
8:11](../kjv/lev008.htm#011), [Lev 8:33](../kjv/lev008.htm#033.md); [Lev
14:9](../kjv/lev014.htm#009), [Lev 14:51](../kjv/lev014.htm#051).md), of
forgiveness ([Mat 18:21](../kjv/mat018.htm#021.md), [Mat
18:22](../kjv/mat018.htm#022); [Luk 17:4](../kjv/luk017.htm#004).md), of
reward ([Deu 28:7](../kjv/deu028.htm#007.md); [Sa1
2:5](../kjv/sa1002.htm#005).md), and of punishment ([Lev
26:21](../kjv/lev026.htm#021), [Lev 26:24](../kjv/lev026.htm#024.md), [Lev
26:28](../kjv/lev026.htm#028); [Deu 28:25](../kjv/deu028.htm#025).md). It
is used for any round number in such passages as [Job
5:19](../kjv/job005.htm#019); [Pro 26:16](../kjv/pro026.htm#016.md), [Pro
26:25](../kjv/pro026.htm#025); [Isa 4:1](../kjv/isa004.htm#001.md); [Mat
12:45](../kjv/mat012.htm#045.md). It is used also to mean "abundantly"
([Gen 4:15](../kjv/gen004.htm#015), [Gen 4:24](../kjv/gen004.htm#024.md);
[Lev 26:24](../kjv/lev026.htm#024); [Psa 79:12](../kjv/psa079.htm#012).md).

<span id="006">**Seventy Weeks**</span> A prophetic period mentioned in
[Dan 9:24](../kjv/dan009.htm#024.md), and usually interpreted on the
"year-day" theory, i.e., reckoning each day for a year. This period will
thus represent 490 years. This is regarded as the period which would
elapse till the time of the coming of the Messiah, dating "from the
going forth of the commandment to restore and rebuild Jerusalem" i.e.,
from the close of the Captivity.

<span id="007">**Shaalabbin**</span> Or Shaalbim, a place of foxes, a
town of the tribe of Dan ([Jos 19:42](../kjv/jos019.htm#042.md); [Jdg
1:35](../kjv/jdg001.htm#035).md). It was one of the chief towns from which
Solomon drew his supplies ([Kg1 4:9](../kjv/kg1004.htm#009).md). It is
probably the modern village of Selbit, 3 miles north of Ajalon.

<span id="008">**Shaaraim**</span> Two gates. (1.) A city in the plain
of Judah ([Sa1 17:52](../kjv/sa1017.htm#052).md); called also Sharaim ([Jos
15:36](../kjv/jos015.htm#036)). (2..md) A town in Simeon ([Ch1
4:31](../kjv/ch1004.htm#031).md).

<span id="009">**Shaashgaz**</span> Servant of the beautiful, a chief
eunuch in the second house of the harem of king Ahasuerus ([Est
2:14](../kjv/est002.htm#014).md).
