<span id="000">**Beeves**</span> (An old English plural of the word
beef), a name applicable to all ruminating animals except camels, and
especially to the Bovidce, or horned cattle ([Lev
22:19](../kjv/lev022.htm#019), [Lev 22:21](../kjv/lev022.htm#021.md); [Num
31:28](../kjv/num031.htm#028), [Num 31:30](../kjv/num031.htm#030.md), [Num
31:33](../kjv/num031.htm#033), [Num 31:38](../kjv/num031.htm#038.md), [Num
31:44](../kjv/num031.htm#044).md).

<span id="001">**Beg**</span> That the poor existed among the Hebrews we
have abundant evidence ([Exo 23:11](../kjv/exo023.htm#011.md); [Deu
15:11](../kjv/deu015.htm#011).md), but there is no mention of beggars
properly so called in the Old Testament. The poor were provided for by
the law of Moses ([Lev 19:10](../kjv/lev019.htm#010.md); [Deu
12:12](../kjv/deu012.htm#012); [Deu 14:29](../kjv/deu014.htm#029).md). It
is predicted of the seed of the wicked that they shall be beggars ([Psa
37:25](../kjv/psa037.htm#025); [Psa 109:10](../kjv/psa109.htm#010).md). In
the New Testament we find not seldom mention made of beggars ([Mar
10:46](../kjv/mar010.htm#046); [Luk 16:20](../kjv/luk016.htm#020.md), [Luk
16:21](../kjv/luk016.htm#021); [Act 3:2](../kjv/act003.htm#002).md), yet
there is no mention of such a class as vagrant beggars, so numerous in
the East. "Beggarly," in [Gal 4:9](../kjv/gal004.htm#009.md), means
worthless.

<span id="002">**Behead**</span> A method of taking away life practiced
among the Egyptians ([Gen 40:17](../kjv/gen040.htm#017).md). There are
instances of this mode of punishment also among the Hebrews ([Sa2
4:8](../kjv/sa2004.htm#008); [Sa2 20:21](../kjv/sa2020.htm#021.md), [Sa2
20:22](../kjv/sa2020.htm#022); [Kg2 10:6](../kjv/kg2010.htm#006).md). It is
also mentioned in the New Testament ([Mat 14:8](../kjv/mat014.htm#008.md);
[Act 12:2](../kjv/act012.htm#002).md).

<span id="003">**Behemoth**</span> ([Job 40:15](../kjv/job040.htm#015).md).
Some have supposed this to be an Egyptian word meaning a "water-ox." The
Revised Version has here in the margin "hippopotamus," which is probably
the correct rendering of the word. The word occurs frequently in
Scripture, but, except here, always as a common name, and translated
"beast" or "cattle."

<span id="004">**Bekah**</span> Both the name and its explanation, "a
half shekel," are given in [Exo 38:26](../kjv/exo038.htm#026.md). The word
properly means a "division," a "part." (R.V., "beka.")

<span id="005">**Bel**</span> The Aramaic form of Baal, the national god
of the Babylonians ([Isa 46:1](../kjv/isa046.htm#001.md); [Jer
50:2](../kjv/jer050.htm#002); [Jer 51:44](../kjv/jer051.htm#044).md). It
signifies "lord." (See BAAL.)

<span id="006">**Bela**</span> A thing swallowed. (1.) A city on the
shore of the Dead Sea, not far from Sodom, called also Zoar. It was the
only one of the five cities that was spared at Lot's intercession ([Gen
19:20](../kjv/gen019.htm#020), [Gen 19:23](../kjv/gen019.htm#023).md). It
is first mentioned in [Gen 14:2](../kjv/gen014.htm#002.md), [Gen
14:8](../kjv/gen014.htm#008). (2..md) The eldest son of Benjamin ([Num
26:38](../kjv/num026.htm#038.md); "Belah," [Gen
46:21](../kjv/gen046.htm#021)). (3..md) The son of Beor, and a king of Edom
([Gen 36:32](../kjv/gen036.htm#032), [Gen 36:33](../kjv/gen036.htm#033.md);
[Ch1 1:43](../kjv/ch1001.htm#043)) (4..md) A son of Azaz ([Ch1
5:8](../kjv/ch1005.htm#008).md).

<span id="007">**Belial**</span> Worthlessness, frequently used in the
Old Testament as a proper name. It is first used in [Deu
13:13](../kjv/deu013.htm#013.md). In the New Testament it is found only in
[Co2 6:15](../kjv/co2006.htm#015.md), where it is used as a name of Satan,
the personification of all that is evil. It is translated "wicked" in
[Deu 15:9](../kjv/deu015.htm#009); [Psa 41:8](../kjv/psa041.htm#008.md)
(R.V. marg.); [Psa 101:3](../kjv/psa101.htm#003.md); [Pro
6:12](../kjv/pro006.htm#012.md), etc. The expression "son" or "man of
Belial" means simply a worthless, lawless person ([Jdg
19:22](../kjv/jdg019.htm#022); [Jdg 20:13](../kjv/jdg020.htm#013.md); [Sa1
1:16](../kjv/sa1001.htm#016); [Sa1 2:12](../kjv/sa1002.htm#012).md).

<span id="008">**Bell**</span> The bells first mentioned in Scripture
are the small golden bells attached to the hem of the high priest's
ephod ([Exo 28:33](../kjv/exo028.htm#033.md), [Exo
28:34](../kjv/exo028.htm#034), [Exo 28:35](../kjv/exo028.htm#035).md). The
"bells of the horses" mentioned by Zechariah ([Zac
14:20](../kjv/zac014.htm#020).md) were attached to the bridles or belts
round the necks of horses trained for war, so as to accustom them to
noise and tumult.

<span id="009">**Bellows**</span> Occurs only in [Jer
6:29](../kjv/jer006.htm#029.md), in relation to the casting of metal.
Probably they consisted of leather bags similar to those common in
Egypt.
