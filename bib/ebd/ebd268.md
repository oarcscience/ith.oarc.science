<span id="000">**Neapolis**</span> New city, a town in Thrace at which
Paul first landed in Europe ([Act 16:11](../kjv/act016.htm#011).md). It was
the sea-port of the inland town of Philippi, which was distant about 10
miles. From this port Paul embarked on his last journey to Jerusalem
([Act 20:6](../kjv/act020.htm#006).md). It is identified with the modern
Turco-Grecian Kavalla.

<span id="001">**Nebaioth**</span> Height. (1.) Ishmael's eldest son
([Gen 25:13](../kjv/gen025.htm#013).md), and the prince of an Israelitish
tribe ([Gen 25:16](../kjv/gen025.htm#016).md). He had a sister, Mahalath,
who was one of Esau's wives ([Gen 28:9](../kjv/gen028.htm#009.md); [Gen
36:3](../kjv/gen036.htm#003)). (2..md) The name of the Ishmaelite tribe
descended from the above ([Gen 25:13](../kjv/gen025.htm#013.md), [Gen
25:18](../kjv/gen025.htm#018).md). The "rams of Nebaioth" ([Isa
60:7](../kjv/isa060.htm#007).md) are the gifts which these wandering tribes
of the desert would consecrate to God.

<span id="002">**Neballat**</span> Wickedness in secret, ([Neh
11:34](../kjv/neh011.htm#034).md), probably the village of Beit Nebala,
about 4 miles north of Lydda.

<span id="003">**Nebat**</span> Sight; aspect, the father of Jeroboam,
the king of Israel ([Kg1 11:26](../kjv/kg1011.htm#026), etc..md).

<span id="004">**Nebo**</span> Proclaimer; prophet. (1.) A Chaldean god
whose worship was introduced into Assyria by Pul ([Isa
46:1](../kjv/isa046.htm#001); [Jer 48:1](../kjv/jer048.htm#001).md). To
this idol was dedicated the great temple whose ruins are still seen at
Birs Nimrud. A statue of Nebo found at Calah, where it was set up by
Pul, king of Assyria, is now in the British Museum. (2.) A mountain in
the land of Moab from which Moses looked for the first and the last time
on the Promised Land ([Deu 32:49](../kjv/deu032.htm#049.md); [Deu
34:1](../kjv/deu034.htm#001).md). It has been identified with Jebel Nebah,
on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea, near its northern end, and about 5
miles south-west of Heshbon. It was the summit of the ridge of Pisgah
(q.v.), which was a part of the range of the "mountains of Abarim." It
is about 2,643 feet in height, but from its position it commands a view
of Western Palestine. Close below it are the plains of Moab, where
Balaam, and afterwards Moses, saw the tents of Israel spread along. (3.)
A town on the east of Jordan which was taken possession of and rebuilt
by the tribe of Reuben ([Num 32:3](../kjv/num032.htm#003.md), [Num
32:38](../kjv/num032.htm#038); [Ch1 5:8](../kjv/ch1005.htm#008).md). It was
about 8 miles south of Heshbon. (4.) The "children of Nebo" ([Ezr
2:29](../kjv/ezr002.htm#029); [Neh 7:33](../kjv/neh007.htm#033).md) were of
those who returned from Babylon. It was a town in Benjamin, probably the
modern Beit Nubah, about 7 miles north-west of Hebron.

<span id="005">**Nebuchadnezzar**</span> In the Babylonian orthography
Nabu-kudur-uzur, which means "Nebo, protect the crown!" or the
"frontiers." In an inscription he styles himself "Nebo's favourite." He
was the son and successor of Nabopolassar, who delivered Babylon from
its dependence on Assyria and laid Nineveh in ruins. He was the greatest
and most powerful of all the Babylonian kings. He married the daughter
of Cyaxares, and thus the Median and Babylonian dynasties were united.
Necho II., the king of Egypt, gained a victory over the Assyrians at
Carchemish. (See JOSIAH; MEGIDDO.) This secured to Egypt the possession
of the Syrian provinces of Assyria, including Palestine. The remaining
provinces of the Assyrian empire were divided between Babylonia and
Media. But Nabopolassar was ambitious of reconquering from Necho the
western provinces of Syria, and for this purpose he sent his son with a
powerful army westward ([Dan 1:1](../kjv/dan001.htm#001).md). The Egyptians
met him at Carchemish, where a furious battle was fought, resulting in
the complete rout of the Egyptians, who were driven back ([Jer
46:2](../kjv/jer046.htm#002).md), and Syria and Phoenicia brought under the
sway of Babylon (606 B.C.). From that time "the king of Egypt came not
again any more out of his land" ([Kg2 24:7](../kjv/kg2024.htm#007).md).
Nebuchadnezzar also subdued the whole of Palestine, and took Jerusalem,
carrying away captive a great multitude of the Jews, among whom were
Daniel and his companions ([Dan 1:1](../kjv/dan001.htm#001.md), [Dan
1:2](../kjv/dan001.htm#002); [Jer 27:19](../kjv/jer027.htm#019.md); [Jer
40:1](../kjv/jer040.htm#001).md). Three years after this, Jehoiakim, who
had reigned in Jerusalem as a Babylonian vassal, rebelled against the
oppressor, trusting to help from Egypt ([Kg2
24:1](../kjv/kg2024.htm#001).md). This led Nebuchadnezzar to march an army
again to the conquest of Jerusalem, which at once yielded to him (598
B.C.). A third time he came against it, and deposed Jehoiachin, whom he
carried into Babylon, with a large portion of the population of the
city, and the sacred vessels of the temple, placing Zedekiah on the
throne of Judah in his stead. He also, heedless of the warnings of the
prophet, entered into an alliance with Egypt, and rebelled against
Babylon. This brought about the final siege of the city, which was at
length taken and utterly destroyed (586 B.C.). Zedekiah was taken
captive, and had his eyes put out by order of the king of Babylon, who
made him a prisoner for the remainder of his life. An onyx cameo, now in
the museum of Florence, bears on it an arrow-headed inscription, which
is certainly ancient and genuine. The helmeted profile is said
(Schrader) to be genuine also, but it is more probable that it is the
portrait of a usurper in the time of Darius (Hystaspes), called
Nidinta-Bel, who took the name of "Nebuchadrezzar." The inscription has
been thus translated: "In honour of Merodach, his lord, Nebuchadnezzar,
king of Babylon, in his lifetime had this made." A clay tablet, now in
the British Museum, bears the following inscription, the only one as yet
found which refers to his wars: "In the thirty-seventh year of
Nebuchadnezzar, king of the country of Babylon, he went to Egypt
\[Misr\] to make war. Amasis, king of Egypt, collected \[his army\], and
marched and spread abroad." Thus were fulfilled the words of the prophet
([Jer 46:13](../kjv/jer046.htm#013); Ezek. 29:2-20.md). Having completed
the subjugation of Phoenicia, and inflicted chastisement on Egypt,
Nebuchadnezzar now set himself to rebuild and adorn the city of Babylon
([Dan 4:30](../kjv/dan004.htm#030).md), and to add to the greatness and
prosperity of his kingdom by constructing canals and aqueducts and
reservoirs surpassing in grandeur and magnificence everything of the
kind mentioned in history ([Dan 2:37](../kjv/dan002.htm#037).md). He is
represented as a "king of kings," ruling over a vast kingdom of many
provinces, with a long list of officers and rulers under him, "princes,
governors, captains," etc. ([Dan 3:2](../kjv/dan003.htm#002.md), [Dan
3:3](../kjv/dan003.htm#003), [Dan 3:27](../kjv/dan003.htm#027).md). He may,
indeed, be said to have created the mighty empire over which he ruled.
"Modern research has shown that Nebuchadnezzar was the greatest monarch
that Babylon, or perhaps the East generally, ever produced. He must have
possessed an enormous command of human labour, nine-tenths of Babylon
itself, and nineteen-twentieths of all the other ruins that in almost
countless profusion cover the land, are composed of bricks stamped with
his name. He appears to have built or restored almost every city and
temple in the whole country. His inscriptions give an elaborate account
of the immense works which he constructed in and about Babylon itself,
abundantly illustrating the boast, 'Is not this great Babylon which I
have build?'" Rawlinson, Hist. Illustrations. After the incident of the
"burning fiery furnace" (Dan. 3) into which the three Hebrew confessors
were cast, Nebuchadnezzar was afflicted with some peculiar mental
aberration as a punishment for his pride and vanity, probably the form
of madness known as lycanthropy (i.e., "the change of a man into a
wolf"). A remarkable confirmation of the Scripture narrative is afforded
by the recent discovery of a bronze door-step, which bears an
inscription to the effect that it was presented by Nebuchadnezzar to the
great temple at Borsippa as a votive offering on account of his recovery
from a terrible illness. (See DANIEL.) He survived his recovery for some
years, and died 562 B.C., in the eighty-third or eighty-fourth year of
his age, after a reign of forty-three years, and was succeeded by his
son Evil-merodach, who, after a reign of two years, was succeeded by
Neriglissar (559-555), who was succeeded by Nabonadius (555-538), at the
close of whose reign (less than a quarter of a century after the death
of Nebuchadnezzar) Babylon fell under Cyrus at the head of the combined
armies of Media and Persia. "I have examined," says Sir H. Rawlinson,
"the bricks belonging perhaps to a hundred different towns and cities in
the neighbourhood of Baghdad, and I never found any other legend than
that of Nebuchadnezzar, son of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon."
Nine-tenths of all the bricks amid the ruins of Babylon are stamped with
his name.

<span id="006">**Nebuchadrezzar**</span> =Nebuchadnezzar ([Jer
21:2](../kjv/jer021.htm#002), [Jer 21:7](../kjv/jer021.htm#007.md); [Jer
22:25](../kjv/jer022.htm#025); [Jer 24:1](../kjv/jer024.htm#001), etc..md),
a nearer approach to the correct spelling of the word.

<span id="007">**Nebushasban**</span> Adorer of Nebo, or Nebo saves me,
the "Rabsaris," or chief chamberlain, of the court of Babylon. He was
one of those whom the king sent to release Jeremiah from prison in
Jerusalem ([Jer 39:13](../kjv/jer039.htm#013).md).

<span id="008">**Nebuzaradan**</span> "The captain of the guard," in
rank next to the king, who appears prominent in directing affairs at the
capture of Jerusalem ([Kg2 25:8](../kjv/kg2025.htm#008.md); [Jer
39:11](../kjv/jer039.htm#011); [Jer 40:2](../kjv/jer040.htm#002).md). He
showed kindness toward Jeremiah, as commanded by Nebuchadnezzar ([Jer
40:1](../kjv/jer040.htm#001).md). Five years after this he again came to
Jerusalem and carried captive seven hundred and forty-five more Jews.

<span id="009">**Necho II**</span> An Egyptian king, the son and
successor of Psammetichus (610-594 B.C.), the contemporary of Josiah,
king of Judah. For some reason he proclaimed war against the king of
Assyria. He led forth a powerful army and marched northward, but was met
by the king of Judah at Megiddo, who refused him a passage through his
territory. Here a fierce battle was fought and Josiah was slain ([Ch2
35:20](../kjv/ch2035.htm#020).md). Possibly, as some suppose, Necho may
have brought his army by sea to some port to the north of Dor (Compare
[Jos 11:2](../kjv/jos011.htm#002); [Jos 12:23](../kjv/jos012.htm#023).md),
a Phoenician town at no great distance from Megiddo. After this battle
Necho marched on to Carchemish (q.v.), where he met and conquered the
Assyrian army, and thus all the Syrian provinces, including Palestine,
came under his dominion. On his return march he deposed Jehoahaz, who
had succeeded his father Josiah, and made Eliakim, Josiah's eldest son,
whose name he changed into Jehoiakim, king. Jehoahaz he carried down
into Egypt, where he died ([Kg2 23:31](../kjv/kg2023.htm#031.md); [Ch2
36:1](../kjv/ch2036.htm#001).md). Four years after this conquest Necho
again marched to the Euphrates; but here he was met and his army routed
by the Chaldeans (606 B.C.) under Nebuchadnezzar, who drove the
Egyptians back, and took from them all the territory they had conquered,
from the Euphrates unto the "river of Egypt" ([Jer
46:2](../kjv/jer046.htm#002); [Kg2 24:7](../kjv/kg2024.htm#007.md), [Kg2
24:8](../kjv/kg2024.htm#008).md). Soon after this Necho died, and was
succeeded by his son, Psammetichus II. (See NEBUCHADNEZZAR.)
