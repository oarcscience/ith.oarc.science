<P><A NAME="000"><B>Pallu</B></A>     Separated, the second son of Reuben (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1005.htm#003">Ch1 5:3</A>); called Phallu, <A HREF="../kjv/gen046.htm#009">Gen 46:9</A>. He was the father of the Phalluites (<A HREF="../kjv/exo006.htm#014">Exo 6:14</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/num026.htm#005">Num 26:5</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/num026.htm#008">Num 26:8</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Palm Tree</B></A>     (Heb.  tamar ), the date-palm characteristic of Palestine. It is described as &quot;flourishing&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/psa092.htm#012">Psa 92:12</A>), tall (<A HREF="../kjv/sol007.htm#007">Sol 7:7</A>), &quot;upright&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/jer010.htm#005">Jer 10:5</A>). Its branches are a symbol of victory (<A HREF="../kjv/rev007.htm#009">Rev 7:9</A>). &quot;Rising with slender stem 40 or 50, at times even 80, feet aloft, its only branches, the feathery, snow-like, pale-green fronds from 6 to 12 feet long, bending from its top, the palm attracts the eye wherever it is seen.&quot; The whole land of Palestine was called by the Greeks and Romans Phoenicia, i.e., &quot;the land of palms.&quot; Tadmor in the desert was called by the Greeks and Romans Palmyra, i.e., &quot;the city of palms.&quot; The finest specimens of this tree grew at Jericho (<A HREF="../kjv/deu034.htm#003">Deu 34:3</A>) and Engedi and along the banks of the Jordan. Branches of the palm tree were carried at the feast of Tabernacles (<A HREF="../kjv/lev023.htm#040">Lev 23:40</A>). At our Lord's triumphal entrance into Jerusalem the crowds took palm branches, and went forth to meet him, crying, &quot;Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/mat021.htm#008">Mat 21:8</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/joh012.htm#013">Joh 12:13</A>). (See DATE.) 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Palm Trees, The City of</B></A>     The name given to Jericho (q.v.), <A HREF="../kjv/deu034.htm#003">Deu 34:3</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jdg001.htm#016">Jdg 1:16</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jdg003.htm#013">Jdg 3:13</A>. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Palmer-worm</B></A>     (Heb.  gazam ). The English word may denote either a caterpillar (as rendered by the LXX.), which wanders like a palmer or pilgrim, or which travels like pilgrims in bands (<A HREF="../kjv/joe001.htm#004">Joe 1:4</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/joe002.htm#025">Joe 2:25</A>), the wingless locusts, or the migratory locust in its larva state. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Palsy</B></A>     A shorter form of &quot;paralysis.&quot; Many persons thus afflicted were cured by our Lord (<A HREF="../kjv/mat004.htm#024">Mat 4:24</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat008.htm#005">Mat 8:5</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat009.htm#002">Mat 9:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mar002.htm#003">Mar 2:3</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/luk007.htm#002">Luk 7:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/joh005.htm#005">Joh 5:5</A>) and the apostles (<A HREF="../kjv/act008.htm#007">Act 8:7</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/act009.htm#033">Act 9:33</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/act009.htm#034">Act 9:34</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Palti</B></A>     Deliverance from the Lord, one of the spies representing the tribe of Benjamin (<A HREF="../kjv/num013.htm#009">Num 13:9</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Paltiel</B></A>     Deliverance of God, the prince of Issachar who assisted &quot;to divide the land by inheritance&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/num034.htm#026">Num 34:26</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Paltite</B></A>     The designation of one of David's heroes (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2023.htm#026">Sa2 23:26</A>); called also the Pelonite (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1011.htm#027">Ch1 11:27</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Pamphylia</B></A>     Paul and his company, loosing from Paphos, sailed north-west and came to Perga, the capital of Pamphylia (<A HREF="../kjv/act013.htm#013">Act 13:13</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/act013.htm#014">Act 13:14</A>), a province about the middle of the southern sea-board of Asia Minor. It lay between Lycia on the west and Cilicia on the east. There were strangers from Pamphylia at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (<A HREF="../kjv/act002.htm#010">Act 2:10</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Pan</B></A>     A vessel of metal or earthenware used in culinary operations; a cooking-pan or frying-pan frequently referred to in the Old Testament (<A HREF="../kjv/lev002.htm#005">Lev 2:5</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/lev006.htm#021">Lev 6:21</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/num011.htm#008">Num 11:8</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa1002.htm#014">Sa1 2:14</A>, etc.). The &quot;ash-pans&quot; mentioned in <A HREF="../kjv/exo027.htm#003">Exo 27:3</A> were made of copper, and were used in connection with the altar of burnt-offering. The &quot;iron pan&quot; mentioned in <A HREF="../kjv/eze004.htm#003">Eze 4:3</A> (marg., &quot;flat plate &quot; or &quot;slice&quot;) was probably a mere plate of iron used for baking. The &quot;fire-pans&quot; of <A HREF="../kjv/exo027.htm#003">Exo 27:3</A> were fire-shovels used for taking up coals. The same Hebrew word is rendered &quot;snuff-dishes&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/exo025.htm#038">Exo 25:38</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/exo037.htm#023">Exo 37:23</A>) and &quot;censers&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/lev010.htm#001">Lev 10:1</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/lev016.htm#012">Lev 16:12</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/num004.htm#014">Num 4:14</A>, etc.). These were probably simply metal vessels employed for carrying burning embers from the brazen altar to the altar of incense. The &quot;frying-pan&quot; mentioned in <A HREF="../kjv/lev002.htm#007">Lev 2:7</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/lev007.htm#009">Lev 7:9</A> was a pot for boiling.
