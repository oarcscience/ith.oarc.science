<span id="000">**Epaphras**</span> Lovely spoken of by Paul ([Col
1:7](../kjv/col001.htm#007); [Col 4:12](../kjv/col004.htm#012).md) as "his
dear fellow-servant," and "a faithful minister of Christ." He was thus
evidently with him at Rome when he wrote to the Colossians. He was a
distinguished disciple, and probably the founder of the Colossian
church. He is also mentioned in the Epistle to [Plm
1:23](../kjv/plm001.htm#023.md), where he is called by Paul his
"fellow-prisoner."

<span id="001">**Epaphroditus**</span> Fair, graceful; belonging to
Aphrodite or Venus the messenger who came from Phillipi to the apostle
when he was a prisoner at Rome ([Phi 2:25](../kjv/phi002.htm#025.md); [Phi
4:10](../kjv/phi004.htm#010).md). Paul mentions him in words of esteem and
affection. On his return to Philippi he was the bearer of Paul's letter
to the church there.

<span id="002">**Epaenetus**</span> Commendable, a Christian at Rome to
whom Paul sent his salutation ([Rom 16:5](../kjv/rom016.htm#005).md). He is
spoken of as "the first fruits of Achaia" (R.V., "of Asia", i.e., of
Proconsular Asia, which is probably the correct reading). As being the
first convert in that region, he was peculiarly dear to the apostle. He
calls him his "well beloved."

<span id="003">**Ephah**</span> (1.) Gloom - (a.) One of the five sons
of Midian, and grandson of Abraham ([Gen 25:4](../kjv/gen025.htm#004).md).
The city of Ephah, to which he gave his name, is mentioned [Isa
60:6](../kjv/isa060.htm#006), [Isa 60:7](../kjv/isa060.htm#007.md). This
city, with its surrounding territory, formed part of Midian, on the east
shore of the Dead Sea. It abounded in dromedaries and camels ([Jdg
6:5](../kjv/jdg006.htm#005)). (b.) [Ch1 2:46](../kjv/ch1002.htm#046.md), a
concubine of Caleb. (c.) [Ch1 2:47](../kjv/ch1002.htm#047.md), a descendant
of Judah. (2.) A word of Egyptian origin, meaning measure; a grain
measure containing "three seahs or ten omers," and equivalent to the
bath for liquids ([Exo 16:36](../kjv/exo016.htm#036.md); [Sa1
17:17](../kjv/sa1017.htm#017); [Zac 5:6](../kjv/zac005.htm#006).md). The
double ephah in [Pro 20:10](../kjv/pro020.htm#010.md) (marg., "an ephah and
an ephah"), [Deu 25:14](../kjv/deu025.htm#014.md), means two ephahs, the
one false and the other just.

<span id="004">**Epher**</span> A calf. (1.) One of the sons of Midian,
who was Abraham's son by Keturah ([Gen 25:4](../kjv/gen025.htm#004).md).
(2.) The head of one of the families of trans-Jordanic Manasseh who were
carried captive by Tiglath-pileser ([Ch1 5:24](../kjv/ch1005.htm#024).md).

<span id="005">**Ephes-dammim**</span> Boundary of blood, a place in the
tribe of Judah where the Philistines encamped when David fought with
Goliath ([Sa1 17:1](../kjv/sa1017.htm#001).md). It was probably so called
as having been the scene of frequent sanguinary conflicts between Israel
and the Philistines. It is called Pas-dammim ([Ch1
11:13](../kjv/ch1011.htm#013).md). It has been identified with the modern
Beit Fased, i.e., "house of bleeding", near Shochoh (q.v.).

<span id="006">**Ephesians, Epistle to**</span> Was written by Paul at
Rome about the same time as that to the Colossians, which in many points
it resembles. Contents of. The Epistle to the Colossians is mainly
polemical, designed to refute certain theosophic errors that had crept
into the church there. That to the Ephesians does not seem to have
originated in any special circumstances, but is simply a letter
springing from Paul's love to the church there, and indicative of his
earnest desire that they should be fully instructed in the profound
doctrines of the gospel. It contains (1.) the salutation ([Eph
1:1](../kjv/eph001.htm#001), [Eph 1:2](../kjv/eph001.htm#002)); (2..md) a
general description of the blessings the gospel reveals, as to their
source, means by which they are attained, purpose for which they are
bestowed, and their final result, with a fervent prayer for the further
spiritual enrichment of the Ephesians (Eph. 1:3 - 2:10); (3.) "a record
of that marked change in spiritual position which the Gentile believers
now possessed, ending with an account of the writer's selection to and
qualification for the apostolate of heathendom, a fact so considered as
to keep them from being dispirited, and to lead him to pray for enlarged
spiritual benefactions on his absent sympathizers" (Eph. 2:12 - 3:21);
(4.) a chapter on unity as undisturbed by diversity of gifts (Eph.
4:1-16); (5.) special injunctions bearing on ordinary life (Eph. 4:17 -
6:10); (6.) the imagery of a spiritual warfare, mission of Tychicus, and
valedictory blessing ([Eph 6:11](../kjv/eph006.htm#011).md). Planting of
the church at Ephesus. Paul's first and hurried visit for the space of
three months to Ephesus is recorded in [Act
18:19](../kjv/act018.htm#019.md). The work he began on this occasion was
carried forward by Apollos ([Act 18:24](../kjv/act018.htm#024).md) and
Aquila and Priscilla. On his second visit, early in the following year,
he remained at Ephesus "three years," for he found it was the key to the
western provinces of Asia Minor. Here "a great door and effectual" was
opened to him ([Co1 16:9](../kjv/co1016.htm#009).md), and the church was
established and strengthened by his assiduous labours there ([Act
20:20](../kjv/act020.htm#020), [Act 20:31](../kjv/act020.htm#031).md). From
Ephesus as a centre the gospel spread abroad "almost throughout all
Asia" ([Act 19:26](../kjv/act019.htm#026).md). The word "mightily grew and
prevailed" despite all the opposition and persecution he encountered. On
his last journey to Jerusalem the apostle landed at Miletus, and
summoning together the elders of the church from Ephesus, delivered to
them his remarkable farewell charge (Acts 20:18-35), expecting to see
them no more. The following parallels between this epistle and the
Milesian charge may be traced:- (1.) [Act 20:19](../kjv/act020.htm#019.md)
= [Eph 4:2](../kjv/eph004.htm#002.md). The phrase "lowliness of mind"
occurs nowhere else. (2.) [Act 20:27](../kjv/act020.htm#027.md) = [Eph
1:11](../kjv/eph001.htm#011.md). The word "counsel," as denoting the divine
plan, occurs only here and [Heb 6:17](../kjv/heb006.htm#017). (3..md) [Act
20:32](../kjv/act020.htm#032) = [Eph 3:20](../kjv/eph003.htm#020.md). The
divine ability. (4.) [Act 20:32](../kjv/act020.htm#032.md) = [Eph
2:20](../kjv/eph002.htm#020). The building upon the foundation. (5..md)
[Act 20:32](../kjv/act020.htm#032) = [Eph 1:14](../kjv/eph001.htm#014.md),
[Eph 1:18](../kjv/eph001.htm#018.md). "The inheritance of the saints."
Place and date of the writing of the letter. It was evidently written
from Rome during Paul's first imprisonment ([Eph
3:1](../kjv/eph003.htm#001); [Eph 4:1](../kjv/eph004.htm#001.md); [Eph
6:20](../kjv/eph006.htm#020).md), and probably soon after his arrival
there, about the year 62, four years after he had parted with the
Ephesian elders at Miletus. The subscription of this epistle is correct.
There seems to have been no special occasion for the writing of this
letter, as already noted. Paul's object was plainly not polemical. No
errors had sprung up in the church which he sought to point out and
refute. The object of the apostle is "to set forth the ground, the
cause, and the aim and end of the church of the faithful in Christ. He
speaks to the Ephesians as a type or sample of the church universal."
The church's foundations, its course, and its end, are his theme.
"Everywhere the foundation of the church is the will of the Father; the
course of the church is by the satisfaction of the Son; the end of the
church is the life in the Holy Spirit." In the Epistle to the Romans,
Paul writes from the point of view of justification by the imputed
righteousness of Christ; here he writes from the point of view specially
of union to the Redeemer, and hence of the oneness of the true church of
Christ. "This is perhaps the profoundest book in existence." It is a
book "which sounds the lowest depths of Christian doctrine, and scales
the loftiest heights of Christian experience;" and the fact that the
apostle evidently expected the Ephesians to understand it is an evidence
of the "proficiency which Paul's converts had attained under his
preaching at Ephesus." Relation between this epistle and that to the
Colossians (q.v.). "The letters of the apostle are the fervent outburst
of pastoral zeal and attachment, written without reserve and in
unaffected simplicity; sentiments come warm from the heart, without the
shaping out, pruning, and punctilious arrangement of a formal discourse.
There is such a fresh and familiar transcription of feeling, so frequent
an introduction of colloquial idiom, and so much of conversational
frankness and vivacity, that the reader associates the image of the
writer with every paragraph, and the ear seems to catch and recognize
the very tones of living address." "It is then any matter of amazement
that one letter should resemble another, or that two written about the
same time should have so much in common and so much that is peculiar?
The close relation as to style and subject between the epistles to
Colosse and Ephesus must strike every reader. Their precise relation to
each other has given rise to much discussion. The great probability is
that the epistle to Colosse was first written; the parallel passages in
Ephesians, which amount to about forty-two in number, having the
appearance of being expansions from the epistle to Colosse. See table
comparison: Compare with [Eph 1:7](../kjv/eph001.htm#007.md) [Col
1:14](../kjv/col001.htm#014) [Eph 1:10](../kjv/eph001.htm#010.md) [Col

5:22 - 6:9 Colossians 3:18 - 4:1 "The style of this epistle is
exceedingly animated, and corresponds with the state of the apostle's
mind at the account which their messenger had brought him of their faith
and holiness ([Eph 1:15](../kjv/eph001.htm#015).md), and transported with
the consideration of the unsearchable wisdom of God displayed in the
work of man's redemption, and of his astonishing love towards the
Gentiles in making them partakers through faith of all the benefits of
Christ's death, he soars high in his sentiments on those grand subjects,
and gives his thoughts utterance in sublime and copious expression."

<span id="007">**Ephesus**</span> The capital of proconsular Asia, which
was the western part of Asia Minor. It was colonized principally from
Athens. In the time of the Romans it bore the title of "the first and
greatest metropolis of Asia." It was distinguished for the Temple of
Diana (q.v.), who there had her chief shrine; and for its theatre, which
was the largest in the world, capable of containing 50,000 spectators.
It was, like all ancient theatres, open to the sky. Here were exhibited
the fights of wild beasts and of men with beasts. (Compare [Co1
4:9](../kjv/co1004.htm#009); [Co1 9:24](../kjv/co1009.htm#024.md), [Co1
9:25](../kjv/co1009.htm#025); [Co1 15:32](../kjv/co1015.htm#032)..md) Many
Jews took up their residence in this city, and here the seeds of the
gospel were sown immediately after Pentecost ([Act
2:9](../kjv/act002.htm#009); [Act 6:9](../kjv/act006.htm#009).md). At the
close of his second missionary journey (about A.D. 51), when Paul was
returning from Greece to Syria ([Act 18:18](../kjv/act018.htm#018).md), he
first visited this city. He remained, however, for only a short time, as
he was hastening to keep the feast, probably of Pentecost, at Jerusalem;
but he left Aquila and Priscilla behind him to carry on the work of
spreading the gospel. During his third missionary journey Paul reached
Ephesus from the "upper coasts" ([Act 19:1](../kjv/act019.htm#001).md),
i.e., from the inland parts of Asia Minor, and tarried here for about
three years; and so successful and abundant were his labours that "all
they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and
Greeks" ([Act 19:10](../kjv/act019.htm#010).md). Probably during this
period the seven churches of the Apocalypse were founded, not by Paul's
personal labours, but by missionaries whom he may have sent out from
Ephesus, and by the influence of converts returning to their homes. On
his return from his journey, Paul touched at Miletus, some 30 miles
south of Ephesus ([Act 20:15](../kjv/act020.htm#015).md), and sending for
the presbyters of Ephesus to meet him there, he delivered to them that
touching farewell charge which is recorded in Acts 20:18-35. Ephesus is
not again mentioned till near the close of Paul's life, when he writes
to Timothy exhorting him to "abide still at Ephesus" ([Ti1
1:3](../kjv/ti1001.htm#003).md). Two of Paul's companions, Trophimus and
Tychicus, were probably natives of Ephesus ([Act
20:4](../kjv/act020.htm#004); [Act 21:29](../kjv/act021.htm#029.md); [Ti2
4:12](../kjv/ti2004.htm#012).md). In his second epistle to Timothy, Paul
speaks of Onesiphorus as having served him in many things at Ephesus
([Ti2 1:18](../kjv/ti2001.htm#018).md). He also "sent Tychicus to Ephesus"
([Ti2 4:12](../kjv/ti2004.htm#012).md), probably to attend to the interests
of the church there. Ephesus is twice mentioned in the Apocalypse ([Rev
1:11](../kjv/rev001.htm#011); [Rev 2:1](../kjv/rev002.htm#001).md). The
apostle John, according to tradition, spent many years in Ephesus, where
he died and was buried. A part of the site of this once famous city is
now occupied by a small Turkish village, Ayasaluk, which is regarded as
a corruption of the two Greek words, hagios theologos ; i.e., "the holy
divine."

<span id="008">**Ephod**</span> Something girt, a sacred vestment worn
originally by the high priest ([Exo 28:4](../kjv/exo028.htm#004).md),
afterwards by the ordinary priest ([Sa1 22:18](../kjv/sa1022.htm#018).md),
and characteristic of his office ([Sa1 2:18](../kjv/sa1002.htm#018.md),
[Sa1 2:28](../kjv/sa1002.htm#028); [Sa1 14:3](../kjv/sa1014.htm#003).md).
It was worn by Samuel, and also by David ([Sa2
6:14](../kjv/sa2006.htm#014).md). It was made of fine linen, and consisted
of two pieces, which hung from the neck, and covered both the back and
front, above the tunic and outer garment ([Exo
28:31](../kjv/exo028.htm#031).md). That of the high priest was embroidered
with divers colours. The two pieces were joined together over the
shoulders (hence in Latin called superhumerale ) by clasps or buckles of
gold or precious stones, and fastened round the waist by a "curious
girdle of gold, blue, purple, and fine twined linen" ([Exo
28:6](../kjv/exo028.htm#006).md). The breastplate, with the Urim and
Thummim, was attached to the ephod.

<span id="009">**Ephphatha**</span> The Greek form of a Syro-Chaldaic or
Aramaic word, meaning "Be opened," uttered by Christ when healing the
man who was deaf and dumb ([Mar 7:34](../kjv/mar007.htm#034).md). It is one
of the characteristics of Mark that he uses the very Aramaic words which
fell from our Lord's lips. (See [Mar 3:17](../kjv/mar003.htm#017.md); [Mar
5:41](../kjv/mar005.htm#041); [Mar 7:11](../kjv/mar007.htm#011.md); [Mar
14:36](../kjv/mar014.htm#036); [Mar 15:34](../kjv/mar015.htm#034)..md)
