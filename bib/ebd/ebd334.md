the sons of Noah ([Gen 5:32](../kjv/gen005.htm#032); [Gen
6:10](../kjv/gen006.htm#010)). He was probably the eldest of Noah's
sons. The words "brother of Japheth the elder" in [Gen
10:21](../kjv/gen010.htm#021) are more correctly rendered "the elder

the age of six hundred years, having been for many years contemporary
with Abraham, according to the usual chronology. The Israelitish nation
sprang from him (Gen. 11:10-26; [Ch1 1:24](../kjv/ch1001.htm#024)). See
