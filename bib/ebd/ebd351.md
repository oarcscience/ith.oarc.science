<span id="000">**Steel**</span> The "bow of steel" in (A.V.) [Sa2
22:35](../kjv/sa2022.htm#035); [Job 20:24](../kjv/job020.htm#024); [Psa
18:34](../kjv/psa018.htm#034) is in the Revised Version "bow of brass"
(Heb. kesheth-nehushah ). In [Jer 15:12](../kjv/jer015.htm#012) the same
word is used, and is also rendered in the Revised Version "brass." But
more correctly it is copper (q.v.), as brass in the ordinary sense of
the word (an alloy of copper and zinc) was not known to the ancients.

<span id="001">**Stephanas**</span> Crown, a member of the church at
Corinth, whose family were among those the apostle had baptized ([Co1
1:16](../kjv/co1001.htm#016); [Co1 16:15](../kjv/co1016.htm#015), [Co1
16:17](../kjv/co1016.htm#017)). He has been supposed by some to have
been the "jailer of Philippi" (compare [Act
16:33](../kjv/act016.htm#033)). The First Epistle to the Corinthians was
written from Philippi some six years after the jailer's conversion, and
he was with the apostle there at that time.

<span id="002">**Stephen**</span> One of the seven deacons, who became a
preacher of the gospel. He was the first Christian martyr. His personal
character and history are recorded in [Act 6:1](../kjv/act006.htm#001).
"He fell asleep" with a prayer for his persecutors on his lips ([Act
7:60](../kjv/act007.htm#060)). Devout men carried him to his grave ([Act
8:2](../kjv/act008.htm#002)). It was at the feet of the young Pharisee,
Saul of Tarsus, that those who stoned him laid their clothes (compare
[Deu 17:5](../kjv/deu017.htm#005)) before they began their cruel work.
The scene which Saul then witnessed and the words he heard appear to
have made a deep and lasting impression on his mind ([Act
22:19](../kjv/act022.htm#019), [Act 22:20](../kjv/act022.htm#020)). The
speech of Stephen before the Jewish ruler is the first apology for the
universalism of the gospel as a message to the Gentiles as well as the
Jews. It is the longest speech contained in the Acts, a place of
prominence being given to it as a defense.

<span id="003">**Stoics**</span> A sect of Greek philosophers at Athens,
so called from the Greek word stoa i.e., a "porch" or "portico," where
they have been called "the Pharisees of Greek paganism." The founder of
the Stoics was Zeno, who flourished about 300 B.C.. He taught his
disciples that a man's happiness consisted in bringing himself into
harmony with the course of the universe. They were trained to bear evils
with indifference, and so to be independent of externals. Materialism,
pantheism, fatalism, and pride were the leading features of this
philosophy.

<span id="004">**Stomacher**</span> ([Isa 3:24](../kjv/isa003.htm#024)),
an article of female attire, probably some sort of girdle around the
breast.

<span id="005">**Stone**</span> Stones were commonly used for buildings,
also as memorials of important events ([Gen
28:18](../kjv/gen028.htm#018); [Jos 24:26](../kjv/jos024.htm#026), [Jos
24:27](../kjv/jos024.htm#027); [Sa1 7:12](../kjv/sa1007.htm#012), etc.).
They were gathered out of cultivated fields ([Isa
5:2](../kjv/isa005.htm#002); compare [Kg2 3:19](../kjv/kg2003.htm#019)).
This word is also used figuratively of believers ([Pe1
2:4](../kjv/pe1002.htm#004), [Pe1 2:5](../kjv/pe1002.htm#005)), and of
the Messiah ([Psa 118:22](../kjv/psa118.htm#022); [Isa
28:16](../kjv/isa028.htm#016); [Mat 21:42](../kjv/mat021.htm#042); [Act
4:11](../kjv/act004.htm#011), etc.). In [Dan
2:45](../kjv/dan002.htm#045) it refers also to the Messiah. He is there
described as "cut out of the mountain." (See ROCK.) A "heart of stone"
denotes great insensibility ([Sa1 25:37](../kjv/sa1025.htm#037)). Stones
were set up to commemorate remarkable events, as by Jacob at Bethel
([Gen 28:18](../kjv/gen028.htm#018)), at Padan-aram ([Gen
35:4](../kjv/gen035.htm#004)), and on the occasion of parting with Laban
([Gen 31:45](../kjv/gen031.htm#045)); by Joshua at the place on the
banks of the Jordan where the people first "lodged" after crossing the
river ([Jos 6:8](../kjv/jos006.htm#008)), and also in "the midst of
Jordan," where he erected another set of twelve stones ([Jos
4:1](../kjv/jos004.htm#001)); and by Samuel at "Ebenezer" ([Sa1
7:12](../kjv/sa1007.htm#012)).

<span id="006">**Stones, Precious**</span> Frequently referred to ([Kg1
10:2](../kjv/kg1010.htm#002); [Ch2 3:6](../kjv/ch2003.htm#006); [Ch2
9:10](../kjv/ch2009.htm#010); [Rev 18:16](../kjv/rev018.htm#016); [Rev
21:19](../kjv/rev021.htm#019)). There are about twenty different names
of such stones in the Bible. They are figuratively introduced to denote
value, beauty, durability ([Sol 5:14](../kjv/sol005.htm#014); [Isa
54:11](../kjv/isa054.htm#011), [Isa 54:12](../kjv/isa054.htm#012); [Lam
4:7](../kjv/lam004.htm#007)).

<span id="007">**Stork**</span> Heb. hasidah , meaning "kindness,"
indicating thus the character of the bird, which is noted for its
affection for its young. It is in the list of birds forbidden to be
eaten by the Levitical law ([Lev 11:19](../kjv/lev011.htm#019); [Deu
14:18](../kjv/deu014.htm#018)). It is like the crane, but larger in
size. Two species are found in Palestine, the white, which are dispersed
in pairs over the whole country; and the black, which live in marshy
places and in great flocks. They migrate to Palestine periodically
(about the 22nd of March). Jeremiah alludes to this ([Jer
8:7](../kjv/jer008.htm#007)). At the appointed time they return with
unerring sagacity to their old haunts, and re-occupy their old nests.
"There is a well-authenticated account of the devotion of a stork which,
at the burning of the town of Delft, after repeated and unsuccessful
attempts to carry off her young, chose rather to remain and perish with
them than leave them to their fate. Well might the Romans call it the
pia avis!" In [Job 39:13](../kjv/job039.htm#013) (A.V.), instead of the
expression "or wings and feathers unto the ostrich" (marg., "the
feathers of the stork and ostrich"), the Revised Version has "are her
pinions and feathers kindly" (marg., instead of "kindly," reads "like
the stork's"). The object of this somewhat obscure verse seems to be to
point out a contrast between the stork, as distinguished for her
affection for her young, and the ostrich, as distinguished for her
indifference. Zechariah ([Zac 5:9](../kjv/zac005.htm#009)) alludes to
the beauty and power of the stork's wings.

<span id="008">**Strain at**</span> Simply a misprint for "strain out"
([Mat 23:24](../kjv/mat023.htm#024)).

<span id="009">**Stranger**</span> This word generally denotes a person
from a foreign land residing in Palestine. Such persons enjoyed many
privileges in common with the Jews, but still were separate from them.
The relation of the Jews to strangers was regulated by special laws
([Deu 23:3](../kjv/deu023.htm#003); [Deu 24:14](../kjv/deu024.htm#014);
[Deu 25:5](../kjv/deu025.htm#005); [Deu 26:10](../kjv/deu026.htm#010)).
A special signification is also sometimes attached to this word. In [Gen
23:4](../kjv/gen023.htm#004) it denotes one resident in a foreign land;
[Exo 23:9](../kjv/exo023.htm#009), one who is not a Jew; [Num
3:10](../kjv/num003.htm#010), one who is not of the family of Aaron;
[Psa 69:8](../kjv/psa069.htm#008), an alien or an unknown person. The
Jews were allowed to purchase strangers as slaves ([Lev
25:44](../kjv/lev025.htm#044), [Lev 25:45](../kjv/lev025.htm#045)), and
to take usury from them ([Deu 23:20](../kjv/deu023.htm#020)).
