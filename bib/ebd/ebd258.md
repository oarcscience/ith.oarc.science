<span id="000">**Mizpah**</span> Or Mizpeh, watch-tower; the look-out.
(1.) A place in Gilead, so named by Laban, who overtook Jacob at this
spot ([Gen 31:49](../kjv/gen031.htm#049)) on his return to Palestine
from Padan-aram. Here Jacob and Laban set up their memorial cairn of
stones. It is the same as Ramath-mizpeh ([Jos
13:26](../kjv/jos013.htm#026)). (2.) A town in Gilead, where Jephthah
resided, and where he assumed the command of the Israelites in a time of
national danger. Here he made his rash vow; and here his daughter
submitted to her mysterious fate ([Jdg 10:17](../kjv/jdg010.htm#017);
[Jdg 11:11](../kjv/jdg011.htm#011), [Jdg 11:34](../kjv/jdg011.htm#034)).
It may be the same as Ramoth-Gilead ([Jos 20:8](../kjv/jos020.htm#008)),
but it is more likely that it is identical with the foregoing, the
Mizpeh of [Gen 31:23](../kjv/gen031.htm#023), [Gen
31:25](../kjv/gen031.htm#025), [Gen 31:48](../kjv/gen031.htm#048), [Gen
31:49](../kjv/gen031.htm#049). (3.) Another place in Gilead, at the foot
of Mount Hermon, inhabited by Hivites ([Jos
11:3](../kjv/jos011.htm#003), [Jos 11:8](../kjv/jos011.htm#008)). The
name in Hebrew here has the article before it, "the Mizpeh," "the
watch-tower." The modern village of Metullah, meaning also "the
look-out," probably occupies the site so called. (4.) A town of Moab to
which David removed his parents for safety during his persecution by
Saul ([Sa1 22:3](../kjv/sa1022.htm#003)). This was probably the citadel
known as Kir-Moab, now Kerak. While David resided here he was visited by
the prophet Gad, here mentioned for the first time, who was probably
sent by Samuel to bid him leave the land of Moab and betake himself to
the land of Judah. He accordingly removed to the forest of Hareth
(q.v.), on the edge of the mountain chain of Hebron. (5.) A city of
Benjamin, "the watch-tower", where the people were accustomed to meet in
great national emergencies ([Jos 18:26](../kjv/jos018.htm#026); [Jdg
20:1](../kjv/jdg020.htm#001), [Jdg 20:3](../kjv/jdg020.htm#003); [Jdg
21:1](../kjv/jdg021.htm#001), [Jdg 21:5](../kjv/jdg021.htm#005); [Sa1
7:5](../kjv/sa1007.htm#005)). It has been supposed to be the same as Nob
([Sa1 21:1](../kjv/sa1021.htm#001); [Sa1 22:9](../kjv/sa1022.htm#009)).
It was some 4 miles north-west of Jerusalem, and was situated on the
loftiest hill in the neighbourhood, some 600 feet above the plain of
Gibeon. This village has the modern name of Neby Samwil, i.e., the
prophet Samuel, from a tradition that Samuel's tomb is here. (See NOB.)
Samuel inaugurated the reformation that characterized his time by
convening a great assembly of all Israel at Mizpeh, now the
politico-religious centre of the nation. There, in deep humiliation on
account of their sins, they renewed their vows and entered again into
covenant with the God of their fathers. It was a period of great
religious awakening and of revived national life. The Philistines heard
of this assembly, and came up against Israel. The Hebrews charged the
Philistine host with great fury, and they were totally routed. Samuel
commemorated this signal victory by erecting a memorial-stone, which he
called "Ebenezer" (q.v.), saying, "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us"
([Sa1 7:7](../kjv/sa1007.htm#007)).

<span id="001">**Mizpar**</span> Number, one of the Jews who accompanied
Zerubbabel from Babylon ([Ezr 2:2](../kjv/ezr002.htm#002)); called also
Mispereth ([Neh 7:7](../kjv/neh007.htm#007)).

<span id="002">**Mizraim**</span> The dual form of matzor, meaning a
"mound" or "fortress," the name of a people descended from Ham ([Gen
10:6](../kjv/gen010.htm#006), [Gen 10:13](../kjv/gen010.htm#013); [Ch1
1:8](../kjv/ch1001.htm#008), [Ch1 1:11](../kjv/ch1001.htm#011)). It was
the name generally given by the Hebrews to the land of Egypt (q.v.), and
may denote the two Egypts, the Upper and the Lower. The modern Arabic
name for Egypt is Muzr .

<span id="003">**Mizzah**</span> Despair, one of the four sons of Reuel,
the son of Esau ([Gen 36:13](../kjv/gen036.htm#013), [Gen
36:17](../kjv/gen036.htm#017)).

<span id="004">**Mnason**</span> Reminding, or remembrancer a Christian
of Jerusalem with whom Paul lodged ([Act 21:16](../kjv/act021.htm#016)).
He was apparently a native of Cyprus, like Barnabas ([Act
11:19](../kjv/act011.htm#019), [Act 11:20](../kjv/act011.htm#020)), and
was well known to the Christians of Caesarea ([Act
4:36](../kjv/act004.htm#036)). He was an "old disciple" (R.V., "early
disciple"), i.e., he had become a Christian in the beginning of the
formation of the Church in Jerusalem.

<span id="005">**Moab**</span> The seed of the father, or, according to
others, the desirable land, the eldest son of Lot ([Gen
19:37](../kjv/gen019.htm#037)), of incestuous birth. (2.) Used to denote
the people of Moab ([Num 22:3](../kjv/num022.htm#003); [Jdg
3:30](../kjv/jdg003.htm#030); [Sa2 8:2](../kjv/sa2008.htm#002); [Jer
48:11](../kjv/jer048.htm#011), [Jer 48:13](../kjv/jer048.htm#013)). (3.)
The land of Moab ([Jer 48:24](../kjv/jer048.htm#024)), called also the
"country of Moab" ([Rut 1:2](../kjv/rut001.htm#002), [Rut
1:6](../kjv/rut001.htm#006); [Rut 2:6](../kjv/rut002.htm#006)), on the
east of Jordan and the Dead Sea, and south of the Arnon ([Num
21:13](../kjv/num021.htm#013), [Num 21:26](../kjv/num021.htm#026)). In a
wider sense it included the whole region that had been occupied by the
Amorites. It bears the modern name of Kerak. In the Plains of Moab,
opposite Jericho ([Num 22:1](../kjv/num022.htm#001); [Num
26:63](../kjv/num026.htm#063); [Jos 13:32](../kjv/jos013.htm#032)), the
children of Israel had their last encampment before they entered the
land of Canaan. It was at that time in the possession of the Amorites
([Num 21:22](../kjv/num021.htm#022)). "Moses went up from the plains of
Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah," and "died there
in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord" ([Deu
34:5](../kjv/deu034.htm#005), [Deu 34:6](../kjv/deu034.htm#006)).
"Surely if we had nothing else to interest us in the land of Moab, the
fact that it was from the top of Pisgah, its noblest height, this
mightiest of the prophets looked out with eye undimmed upon the Promised
Land; that it was here on Nebo, its loftiest mountain, that he died his
solitary death; that it was here, in the valley over against Beth-peor,
he found his mysterious sepulchre, we have enough to enshrine the memory
in our hearts."

<span id="006">**Moabite**</span> The designation of a tribe descended
from Moab, the son of Lot ([Gen 19:37](../kjv/gen019.htm#037)). From
Zoar, the cradle of this tribe, on the south-eastern border of the Dead
Sea, they gradually spread over the region on the east of Jordan.
Rameses II., the Pharaoh of the Oppression, enumerates Moab (Muab) among
his conquests. Shortly before the Exodus, the warlike Amorites crossed
the Jordan under Sihon their king and drove the Moabites ([Num
21:26](../kjv/num021.htm#026)) out of the region between the Arnon and
the Jabbok, and occupied it, making Heshbon their capital. They were
then confined to the territory to the south of the Arnon. On their
journey the Israelites did not pass through Moab, but through the
"wilderness" to the east ([Deu 2:8](../kjv/deu002.htm#008); [Jdg
11:18](../kjv/jdg011.htm#018)), at length reaching the country to the
north of the Arnon. Here they remained for some time till they had
conquered Bashan (see SIHON; OG). The Moabites were alarmed, and their
king, Balak, sought aid from the Midianites ([Num
22:2](../kjv/num022.htm#002)). It was while they were here that the
visit of Balaam (q.v.) to Balak took place. (See MOSES.) After the
Conquest, the Moabites maintained hostile relations with the Israelites,
and frequently harassed them in war (Judg. 3:12-30; 1 Sam. 14). The
story of Ruth, however, shows the existence of friendly relations
between Moab and Bethlehem. By his descent from Ruth, David may be said
to have had Moabite blood in his veins. Yet there was war between David
and the Moabites ([Sa2 8:2](../kjv/sa2008.htm#002); [Sa2
23:20](../kjv/sa2023.htm#020); [Ch1 18:2](../kjv/ch1018.htm#002)), from
whom he took great spoil ([Sa2 8:2](../kjv/sa2008.htm#002), [Sa2
8:11](../kjv/sa2008.htm#011), [Sa2 8:12](../kjv/sa2008.htm#012); [Ch1
11:22](../kjv/ch1011.htm#022); [Ch1 18:11](../kjv/ch1018.htm#011)).
During the one hundred and fifty years which followed the defeat of the
Moabites, after the death of Ahab (see MESHA), they regained,
apparently, much of their former prosperity. At this time Isaiah ([Isa
15:1](../kjv/isa015.htm#001)) delivered his "burden of Moab," predicting
the coming of judgment on that land (Compare [Kg2
17:3](../kjv/kg2017.htm#003); [Kg2 18:9](../kjv/kg2018.htm#009); [Ch1
5:25](../kjv/ch1005.htm#025), [Ch1 5:26](../kjv/ch1005.htm#026)).
Between the time of Isaiah and the commencement of the Babylonian
captivity we have very seldom any reference to Moab ([Jer
25:21](../kjv/jer025.htm#021); [Jer 27:3](../kjv/jer027.htm#003); [Jer
40:11](../kjv/jer040.htm#011); [Zep 2:8](../kjv/zep002.htm#008)). After
the Return, it was Sanballat, a Moabite, who took chief part in seeking
to prevent the rebuilding of Jerusalem ([Neh
2:19](../kjv/neh002.htm#019); [Neh 4:1](../kjv/neh004.htm#001); [Neh
6:1](../kjv/neh006.htm#001)).

<span id="007">**Moabite Stone**</span> A basalt stone, bearing an
inscription by King Mesha, which was discovered at Dibon by Klein, a
German missionary at Jerusalem, in 1868. It was 3 1/2 feet high and 2 in
breadth and in thickness, rounded at the top. It consisted of
thirty-four lines, written in Hebrew-Phoenician characters. It was set
up by Mesha as a record and memorial of his victories. It records (1.)
Mesha's wars with Omri, (2.) his public buildings, and (3.) his wars
against Horonaim. This inscription in a remarkable degree supplements
and corroborates the history of King Mesha recorded in 2 Kings 3:4-27.
With the exception of a very few variations, the Moabite language in
which the inscription is written is identical with the Hebrew. The form
of the letters here used supplies very important and interesting
information regarding the history of the formation of the alphabet, as
well as, incidentally, regarding the arts of civilized life of those
times in the land of Moab. This ancient monument, recording the heroic
struggles of King Mesha with Omri and Ahab, was erected about 900 B.C..
Here "we have the identical slab on which the workmen of the old world
carved the history of their own times, and from which the eye of their
contemporaries read thousands of years ago the record of events of which
they themselves had been the witnesses." It is the oldest inscription
written in alphabetic characters, and hence is, apart from its value in
the domain of Hebrew antiquities, of great linguistic importance.

<span id="008">**Moladah**</span> Birth, a city in the south of Judah
which fell to Simeon ([Jos 15:21](../kjv/jos015.htm#021); [Jos
19:2](../kjv/jos019.htm#002)). It has been identified with the modern
el, Milh, 10 miles east of Beersheba.

<span id="009">**Mole**</span> Heb. tinshameth ([Lev
11:30](../kjv/lev011.htm#030)), probably signifies some species of
lizard (rendered in R.V., "chameleon"). In [Lev
11:18](../kjv/lev011.htm#018), [Deu 14:16](../kjv/deu014.htm#016), it is
rendered, in Authorized Version, "swan" (R.V., "horned owl"). The Heb.
holed ([Lev 11:29](../kjv/lev011.htm#029)), rendered "weasel," was
probably the mole-rat. The true mole (Talpa Europoea) is not found in
Palestine. The mole-rat (Spalax typhlus) "is twice the size of our mole,
with no external eyes, and with only faint traces within of the
rudimentary organ; no apparent ears, but, like the mole, with great
internal organs of hearing; a strong, bare snout, and with large gnawing
teeth; its colour a pale slate; its feet short, and provided with strong
nails; its tail only rudimentary." In [Isa 2:20](../kjv/isa002.htm#020),
this word is the rendering of two words haphar peroth , which are
rendered by Gesenius "into the digging of rats", i.e., rats' holes. But
these two Hebrew words ought probably to be combined into one
(lahporperoth) and translated "to the moles", i.e., the rat-moles. This
animal "lives in underground communities, making large subterranean
chambers for its young and for storehouses, with many runs connected
with them, and is decidedly partial to the loose debris among ruins and
stone-heaps, where it can form its chambers with least trouble."
