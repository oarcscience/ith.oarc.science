<span id="000">**Jeroboam**</span> Increase of the people. (1.) The son
of Nebat ([Kg1 11:26](../kjv/kg1011.htm#026)), "an Ephrathite," the
first king of the ten tribes, over whom he reigned twenty-two years
(976-945 B.C.). He was the son of a widow of Zereda, and while still
young was promoted by Solomon to be chief superintendent of the
"burden", i.e., of the bands of forced labourers. Influenced by the
words of the prophet Ahijah, he began to form conspiracies with the view
of becoming king of the ten tribes; but these having been discovered, he
fled to Egypt ([Kg1 11:29](../kjv/kg1011.htm#029)), where he remained
for a length of time under the protection of Shishak I. On the death of
Solomon, the ten tribes, having revolted, sent to invite him to become
their king. The conduct of Rehoboam favoured the designs of Jeroboam,
and he was accordingly proclaimed "king of Israel" (1 Kings 12:1-20). He
rebuilt and fortified Shechem as the capital of his kingdom. He at once
adopted means to perpetuate the division thus made between the two parts
of the kingdom, and erected at Dan and Bethel, the two extremities of
his kingdom, "golden calves," which he set up as symbols of Jehovah,
enjoining the people not any more to go up to worship at Jerusalem, but
to bring their offerings to the shrines he had erected. Thus he became
distinguished as the man "who made Israel to sin." This policy was
followed by all the succeeding kings of Israel. While he was engaged in
offering incense at Bethel, a prophet from Judah appeared before him
with a warning message from the Lord. Attempting to arrest the prophet
for his bold words of defiance, his hand was "dried up," and the altar
before which he stood was rent asunder. At his urgent entreaty his "hand
was restored him again" ([Kg1 13:1](../kjv/kg1013.htm#001), [Kg1
13:9](../kjv/kg1013.htm#009); compare [Kg2
23:15](../kjv/kg2023.htm#015)); but the miracle made no abiding
impression on him. His reign was one of constant war with the house of
Judah. He died soon after his son Abijah (1 Kings 14:1-18). (2.)
Jeroboam II., the son and successor of Jehoash, and the fourteenth king
of Israel, over which he ruled for forty-one years, 825-784 B.C. ([Kg2
14:23](../kjv/kg2014.htm#023)). He followed the example of the first
Jeroboam in keeping up the worship of the golden calves ([Kg2
14:24](../kjv/kg2014.htm#024)). His reign was contemporary with those of
Amaziah ([Kg2 14:23](../kjv/kg2014.htm#023)) and Uzziah ([Kg2
15:1](../kjv/kg2015.htm#001)), kings of Judah. He was victorious over
the Syrians ([Kg2 13:4](../kjv/kg2013.htm#004); [Kg2
14:26](../kjv/kg2014.htm#026), [Kg2 14:27](../kjv/kg2014.htm#027)), and
extended Israel to its former limits, from "the entering of Hamath to
the sea of the plain" ([Kg2 14:25](../kjv/kg2014.htm#025); [Amo
6:14](../kjv/amo006.htm#014)). His reign of forty-one years was the most
prosperous that Israel had ever known as yet. With all this outward
prosperity, however, iniquity widely prevailed in the land ([Amo
2:6](../kjv/amo002.htm#006); [Amo 4:1](../kjv/amo004.htm#001); [Amo
6:6](../kjv/amo006.htm#006); [Hos 4:12](../kjv/hos004.htm#012)). The
prophets Hosea ([Hos 1:1](../kjv/hos001.htm#001)), Joel ([Joe
3:16](../kjv/joe003.htm#016); [Amo 1:1](../kjv/amo001.htm#001), [Amo
1:2](../kjv/amo001.htm#002)), Amos ([Amo 1:1](../kjv/amo001.htm#001)),
and Jonah ([Kg2 14:25](../kjv/kg2014.htm#025)) lived during his reign.
He died, and was buried with his ancestors ([Kg2
14:29](../kjv/kg2014.htm#029)). He was succeeded by his son Zachariah
(q.v.). His name occurs in Scripture only in [Kg2
13:13](../kjv/kg2013.htm#013); [Kg2 14:16](../kjv/kg2014.htm#016), [Kg2
14:23](../kjv/kg2014.htm#023), [Kg2 14:27](../kjv/kg2014.htm#027), [Kg2
14:28](../kjv/kg2014.htm#028), [Kg2 14:29](../kjv/kg2014.htm#029); [Kg2
15:1](../kjv/kg2015.htm#001), [Kg2 15:8](../kjv/kg2015.htm#008); [Ch1
5:17](../kjv/ch1005.htm#017); [Hos 1:1](../kjv/hos001.htm#001); [Amo
1:1](../kjv/amo001.htm#001); [Amo 7:9](../kjv/amo007.htm#009), [Amo
7:10](../kjv/amo007.htm#010), [Amo 7:11](../kjv/amo007.htm#011). In all
other passages it is Jeroboam the son of Nebat that is meant.

<span id="001">**Jeroham**</span> Cherished; who finds mercy. (1.)
Father of Elkanah, and grandfather of the prophet Samuel ([Sa1
1:1](../kjv/sa1001.htm#001)). (2.) The father of Azareel, the "captain"
of the tribe of Dan ([Ch1 27:22](../kjv/ch1027.htm#022)). (3.) [Ch1
12:7](../kjv/ch1012.htm#007); a Benjamite. (4.) [Ch2
23:1](../kjv/ch2023.htm#001); one whose son assisted in placing Joash on
the throne. (5.) [Ch1 9:8](../kjv/ch1009.htm#008); a Benjamite. (6.)
[Ch1 9:12](../kjv/ch1009.htm#012); a priest, perhaps the same as in [Neh
11:12](../kjv/neh011.htm#012).

<span id="002">**Jerubbaal**</span> Contender with Baal; or, let Baal
plead, a surname of Gideon; a name given to him because he destroyed the
altar of Baal ([Jdg 6:32](../kjv/jdg006.htm#032); [Jdg
7:1](../kjv/jdg007.htm#001); [Jdg 8:29](../kjv/jdg008.htm#029); [Sa1
12:11](../kjv/sa1012.htm#011)).

<span id="003">**Jerubbesheth**</span> Contender with the shame; i.e.,
idol, a surname also of Gideon ([Sa2 11:21](../kjv/sa2011.htm#021)).

<span id="004">**Jeruel**</span> Founded by God, a "desert" on the
ascent from the valley of the Dead Sea towards Jerusalem. It lay beyond
the wilderness of Tekoa, in the direction of Engedi ([Ch2
20:16](../kjv/ch2020.htm#016), [Ch2 20:20](../kjv/ch2020.htm#020)). It
corresponds with the tract of country now called el-Hasasah.

<span id="005">**Jerusalem**</span> Called also Salem, Ariel, Jebus, the
"city of God," the "holy city;" by the modern Arabs el-Khuds, meaning
"the holy;" once "the city of Judah" ([Ch2
25:28](../kjv/ch2025.htm#028)). This name is in the original in the dual
form, and means "possession of peace," or "foundation of peace." The
dual form probably refers to the two mountains on which it was built,
viz., Zion and Moriah; or, as some suppose, to the two parts of the
city, the "upper" and the "lower city." Jerusalem is a "mountain city
enthroned on a mountain fastness" (compare [Psa
68:15](../kjv/psa068.htm#015), [Psa 68:16](../kjv/psa068.htm#016); [Psa
87:1](../kjv/psa087.htm#001); [Psa 125:2](../kjv/psa125.htm#002); [Psa
76:1](../kjv/psa076.htm#001), [Psa 76:2](../kjv/psa076.htm#002); [Psa
122:3](../kjv/psa122.htm#003)). It stands on the edge of one of the
highest table-lands in Palestine, and is surrounded on the
south-eastern, the southern, and the western sides by deep and
precipitous ravines. It is first mentioned in Scripture under the name
Salem ([Gen 14:18](../kjv/gen014.htm#018); compare [Psa
76:2](../kjv/psa076.htm#002)). When first mentioned under the name
Jerusalem, Adonizedek was its king ([Jos 10:1](../kjv/jos010.htm#001)).
It is afterwards named among the cities of Benjamin ([Jdg
19:10](../kjv/jdg019.htm#010); [Ch1 11:4](../kjv/ch1011.htm#004)); but
in the time of David it was divided between Benjamin and Judah. After
the death of Joshua the city was taken and set on fire by the men of
Judah ([Jdg 1:1](../kjv/jdg001.htm#001)); but the Jebusites were not
wholly driven out of it. The city is not again mentioned till we are
told that David brought the head of Goliath thither ([Sa1
17:54](../kjv/sa1017.htm#054)). David afterwards led his forces against
the Jebusites still residing within its walls, and drove them out,
fixing his own dwelling on Zion, which he called "the city of David"
([Sa2 5:5](../kjv/sa2005.htm#005); [Ch1 11:4](../kjv/ch1011.htm#004)).
Here he built an altar to the Lord on the threshing-floor of Araunah the
Jebusite ([Sa2 24:15](../kjv/sa2024.htm#015)), and thither he brought up
the ark of the covenant and placed it in the new tabernacle which he had
prepared for it. Jerusalem now became the capital of the kingdom. After
the death of David, Solomon built the temple, a house for the name of
the Lord, on Mount Moriah (1010 B.C.). He also greatly strengthened and
adorned the city, and it became the great centre of all the civil and
religious affairs of the nation ([Deu 12:5](../kjv/deu012.htm#005);
compare [Deu 12:14](../kjv/deu012.htm#014); [Deu
14:23](../kjv/deu014.htm#023); [Deu 16:11](../kjv/deu016.htm#011); [Psa
122:1](../kjv/psa122.htm#001)). After the disruption of the kingdom on
the accession to the throne of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, Jerusalem
became the capital of the kingdom of the two tribes. It was subsequently
often taken and retaken by the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and by the
kings of Israel ([Kg2 14:13](../kjv/kg2014.htm#013), [Kg2
14:14](../kjv/kg2014.htm#014); [Kg2 18:15](../kjv/kg2018.htm#015), [Kg2
18:16](../kjv/kg2018.htm#016); [Kg2 23:33](../kjv/kg2023.htm#033); [Kg2
24:14](../kjv/kg2024.htm#014); [Ch2 12:9](../kjv/ch2012.htm#009); [Ch2
26:9](../kjv/ch2026.htm#009); [Ch2 27:3](../kjv/ch2027.htm#003), [Ch2
27:4](../kjv/ch2027.htm#004); [Ch2 29:3](../kjv/ch2029.htm#003); [Ch2
32:30](../kjv/ch2032.htm#030); [Ch2 33:11](../kjv/ch2033.htm#011)), till
finally, for the abounding iniquities of the nation, after a siege of
three years, it was taken and utterly destroyed, its walls razed to the
ground, and its temple and palaces consumed by fire, by Nebuchadnezzar,
the king of Babylon (2 Kings 25; 2 Chr. 36; Jer. 39), 588 B.C.. The
desolation of the city and the land was completed by the retreat of the
principal Jews into Egypt (Jer. 40-44), and by the final carrying
captive into Babylon of all that still remained in the land ([Jer
52:3](../kjv/jer052.htm#003)), so that it was left without an inhabitant
(582 B.C.). Compare the predictions, Deut. 28; Lev. 26:14-39. But the
streets and walls of Jerusalem were again to be built, in troublous
times ([Dan 9:16](../kjv/dan009.htm#016), [Dan
9:19](../kjv/dan009.htm#019), [Dan 9:25](../kjv/dan009.htm#025)), after
a captivity of seventy years. This restoration was begun 536 B.C., "in
the first year of Cyrus" ([Ezr 1:2](../kjv/ezr001.htm#002), [Ezr
1:3](../kjv/ezr001.htm#003), [Ezr 1:5](../kjv/ezr001.htm#005)). The
Books of Ezra and Nehemiah contain the history of the re-building of the
city and temple, and the restoration of the kingdom of the Jews,
consisting of a portion of all the tribes. The kingdom thus constituted
was for two centuries under the dominion of Persia, till 331 B.C.; and
thereafter, for about a century and a half, under the rulers of the
Greek empire in Asia, till 167 B.C.. For a century the Jews maintained
their independence under native rulers, the Asmonean princes. At the
close of this period they fell under the rule of Herod and of members of
his family, but practically under Rome, till the time of the destruction
of Jerusalem, A.D. 70. The city was then laid in ruins. The modern
Jerusalem by-and-by began to be built over the immense beds of rubbish
resulting from the overthrow of the ancient city; and whilst it occupies
certainly the same site, there are no evidences that even the lines of
its streets are now what they were in the ancient city. Till A.D. 131
the Jews who still lingered about Jerusalem quietly submitted to the
Roman sway. But in that year the emperor (Hadrian), in order to hold
them in subjection, rebuilt and fortified the city. The Jews, however,
took possession of it, having risen under the leadership of one
Bar-Chohaba (i.e., "the son of the star") in revolt against the Romans.
Some four years afterwards (A.D. 135), however, they were driven out of
it with great slaughter, and the city was again destroyed; and over its
ruins was built a Roman city called Aelia Capitolina, a name which it
retained till it fell under the dominion of the Mohammedans, when it was
called el-Khuds, i.e., "the holy." In A.D. 326 Helena, mother of the
emperor Constantine, made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem with the view of
discovering the places mentioned in the life of our Lord. She caused a
church to be built on what was then supposed to be the place of the
nativity at Bethlehem. Constantine, animated by her example, searched
for the holy sepulchre, and built over the supposed site a magnificent
church, which was completed and dedicated A.D. 335. He relaxed the laws
against the Jews till this time in force, and permitted them once a year
to visit the city and wail over the desolation of "the holy and
beautiful house." In A.D. 614 the Persians, after defeating the Roman
forces of the emperor Heraclius, took Jerusalem by storm, and retained
it till A.D. 637, when it was taken by the Arabians under the Khalif
Omar. It remained in their possession till it passed, in A.D. 960, under
the dominion of the Fatimite khalifs of Egypt, and in A.D. 1073 under
the Turcomans. In A.D. 1099 the crusader Godfrey of Bouillon took the
city from the Moslems with great slaughter, and was elected king of
Jerusalem. He converted the Mosque of Omar into a Christian cathedral.
During the eighty-eight years which followed, many churches and convents
were erected in the holy city. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was
rebuilt during this period, and it alone remains to this day. In A.D.
1187 the sultan Saladin wrested the city from the Christians. From that
time to the present day, with few intervals, Jerusalem has remained in
the hands of the Moslems. It has, however, during that period been again
and again taken and retaken, demolished in great part and rebuilt, no
city in the world having passed through so many vicissitudes. In the
year 1850 the Greek and Latin monks residing in Jerusalem had a fierce
dispute about the guardianship of what are called the "holy places." In
this dispute the emperor Nicholas of Russia sided with the Greeks, and
Louis Napoleon, the emperor of the French, with the Latins. This led the
Turkish authorities to settle the question in a way unsatisfactory to
Russia. Out of this there sprang the Crimean War, which was protracted
and sanguinary, but which had important consequences in the way of
breaking down the barriers of Turkish exclusiveness. Modern Jerusalem
"lies near the summit of a broad mountain-ridge, which extends without
interruption from the plain of Esdraelon to a line drawn between the
southern end of the Dead Sea and the southeastern corner of the
Mediterranean." This high, uneven table-land is everywhere from 20 to 25
geographical miles in breadth. It was anciently known as the mountains
of Ephraim and Judah. "Jerusalem is a city of contrasts, and differs
widely from Damascus, not merely because it is a stone town in
mountains, whilst the latter is a mud city in a plain, but because while
in Damascus Moslem religion and Oriental custom are unmixed with any
foreign element, in Jerusalem every form of religion, every nationality
of East and West, is represented at one time." Jerusalem is first
mentioned under that name in the Book of Joshua, and the Tell-el-Amarna
collection of tablets includes six letters from its Amorite king to
Egypt, recording the attack of the Abiri about 1480 B.C.. The name is
there spelt Uru-Salim ("city of peace"). Another monumental record in
which the Holy City is named is that of Sennacherib's attack in 702
B.C.. The "camp of the Assyrians" was still shown about A.D. 70, on the
flat ground to the north-west, included in the new quarter of the city.
The city of David included both the upper city and Millo, and was
surrounded by a wall built by David and Solomon, who appear to have
restored the original Jebusite fortifications. The name Zion (or Sion)
appears to have been, like Ariel ("the hearth of God"), a poetical term
for Jerusalem, but in the Greek age was more specially used of the
Temple hill. The priests' quarter grew up on Ophel, south of the Temple,
where also was Solomon's Palace outside the original city of David. The
walls of the city were extended by Jotham and Manasseh to include this
suburb and the Temple ([Ch2 27:3](../kjv/ch2027.htm#003); [Ch2
33:14](../kjv/ch2033.htm#014)). Jerusalem is now a town of some 50,000
inhabitants, with ancient mediaeval walls, partly on the old lines, but
extending less far to the south. The traditional sites, as a rule, were
first shown in the 4th and later centuries A.D., and have no authority.
The results of excavation have, however, settled most of the disputed
questions, the limits of the Temple area, and the course of the old
walls having been traced. limits of the Temple area, and the course of
the old walls having been traced.
