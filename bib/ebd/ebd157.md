<span id="000">**Hadad**</span> Adod , brave(?), the name of a Syrian
god. (1.) An Edomite king who defeated the Midianites ([Gen
36:35](../kjv/gen036.htm#035); [Ch1 1:46](../kjv/ch1001.htm#046)). (2.)
Another Edomite king ([Ch1 1:50](../kjv/ch1001.htm#050), [Ch1
1:51](../kjv/ch1001.htm#051)), called also Hadar ([Gen
36:39](../kjv/gen036.htm#039); [Ch1 1:51](../kjv/ch1001.htm#051)). (3.)
One of "the king's seed in Edom." He fled into Egypt, where he married
the sister of Pharaoh's wife ([Kg1 11:14](../kjv/kg1011.htm#014)). He
became one of Solomon's adversaries. (4.) Sharp, (a different name in
Hebrew from the preceding), one of the sons of Ishmael ([Ch1
1:30](../kjv/ch1001.htm#030)). Called also Hadar ([Gen
25:15](../kjv/gen025.htm#015)).

<span id="001">**Hadadezer**</span> Hadad is help; called also
Hadarezer, Adod is his help, the king of Zobah. Hanun, the king of the
Ammonites, hired among others the army of Hadadezer to assist him in his
war against David. Joab, who was sent against this confederate host,
found them in double battle array, the Ammonities toward their capital
of Rabbah, and the Syrian mercenaries near Medeba. In the battle which
was fought the Syrians were scattered, and the Ammonites in alarm fled
into their capital. After this Hadadezer went north "to recover his
border" ([Sa2 8:3](../kjv/sa2008.htm#003), A.V.); but rather, as the
Revised Version renders, "to recover his dominion", i.e., to recruit his
forces. Then followed another battle with the Syrian army thus
recruited, which resulted in its being totally routed at Helam ([Sa2
10:17](../kjv/sa2010.htm#017)). Shobach, the leader of the Syrian army,
died on the field of battle. The Syrians of Damascus, who had come to
help Hadadezer, were also routed, and Damascus was made tributary to
David. All the spoils taken in this war, "shields of gold" and "very
much brass," from which afterwards the "brazen sea, and the pillars, and
the vessels of brass" for the temple were made ([Ch1
18:8](../kjv/ch1018.htm#008)), were brought to Jerusalem and dedicated
to Jehovah. Thus the power of the Ammonites and the Syrians was finally
broken, and David's empire extended to the Euphrates ([Sa2
10:15](../kjv/sa2010.htm#015); [Ch1 19:15](../kjv/ch1019.htm#015)).

<span id="002">**Hadad-rimmon**</span> Composed of the names of two
Syrian idols), the name of a place in the valley of Megiddo. It is
alluded to by the prophet Zechariah ([Zac 12:11](../kjv/zac012.htm#011))
in a proverbial expression derived from the lamentation for Josiah, who
was mortally wounded near this place ([Ch2
35:22](../kjv/ch2035.htm#022)). It has been identified with the modern
Rummaneh, a village "at the foot of the Megiddo hills, in a notch or
valley about an hour and a half south of Tell Metzellim."

<span id="003">**Hadar**</span> Adod, brave(?). (1.) A son of Ishmael
([Gen 25:15](../kjv/gen025.htm#015)); in [Ch1
1:30](../kjv/ch1001.htm#030) written Hadad. (2.) One of the Edomitish
kings ([Gen 36:39](../kjv/gen036.htm#039)) about the time of Saul.
Called also Hadad ([Ch1 1:50](../kjv/ch1001.htm#050), [Ch1
1:51](../kjv/ch1001.htm#051)). It is probable that in these cases Hadar
may be an error simply of transcription for Hadad.

<span id="004">**Hadarezer**</span> Adod is his help, the name given to
Hadadezer ([Sa2 8:3](../kjv/sa2008.htm#003)) in 2 Sam. 10.

<span id="005">**Hadashah**</span> New, a city in the valley of Judah
([Jos 15:37](../kjv/jos015.htm#037)).

<span id="006">**Hadassah**</span> Myrtle, the Jewish name of Esther
(q.v.), [Est 2:7](../kjv/est002.htm#007).

<span id="007">**Hadattah**</span> New, one of the towns in the extreme
south of Judah ([Jos 15:25](../kjv/jos015.htm#025)).

<span id="008">**Hades**</span> That which is out of sight, a Greek word
used to denote the state or place of the dead. All the dead alike go
into this place. To be buried, to go down to the grave, to descend into
Hades, are equivalent expressions. In the LXX. this word is the usual
rendering of the Hebrew sheol, the common receptacle of the departed
([Gen 42:38](../kjv/gen042.htm#038); [Psa 139:8](../kjv/psa139.htm#008);
[Hos 13:14](../kjv/hos013.htm#014); [Isa 14:9](../kjv/isa014.htm#009)).
This term is of comparatively rare occurrence in the Greek New
Testament. Our Lord speaks of Capernaum as being "brought down to hell"
(Hades), i.e., simply to the lowest debasement, ([Mat
11:23](../kjv/mat011.htm#023)). It is contemplated as a kind of kingdom
which could never overturn the foundation of Christ's kingdom ([Mat
16:18](../kjv/mat016.htm#018)), i.e., Christ's church can never die. In
[Luk 16:23](../kjv/luk016.htm#023) it is most distinctly associated with
the doom and misery of the lost. In [Act 2:27](../kjv/act002.htm#027)
Peter quotes the LXX. version of [Psa 16:8](../kjv/psa016.htm#008),
plainly for the purpose of proving our Lord's resurrection from the
dead. David was left in the place of the dead, and his body saw
corruption. Not so with Christ. According to ancient prophecy ([Psa
30:3](../kjv/psa030.htm#003)) he was recalled to life.

<span id="009">**Hadid**</span> Pointed, a place in the tribe of
Benjamin near Lydda, or Lod, and Ono ([Ezr 2:33](../kjv/ezr002.htm#033);
[Neh 7:37](../kjv/neh007.htm#037)). It is identified with the modern
el-Haditheh, 3 miles east of Lydda.
