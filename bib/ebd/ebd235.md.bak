<span id="000">**Maaziah**</span> Strength or consolation of Jehovah.
(1.) The head of the twenty-fourth priestly course ([Ch1
24:18](../kjv/ch1024.htm#018)) in David's reign. (2..md) A priest ([Neh
10:8](../kjv/neh010.htm#008).md).

<span id="001">**Maccabees**</span> This word does not occur in
Scripture. It was the name given to the leaders of the national party
among the Jews who suffered in the persecution under Antiochus
Epiphanes, who succeeded to the Syrian throne 175 B.C.. It is supposed
to have been derived from the Hebrew word (makkabah) meaning "hammer,"
as suggestive of the heroism and power of this Jewish family, who are,
however, more properly called Asmoneans or Hasmonaeans, the origin of
which is much disputed. After the expulsion of Antiochus Epiphanes from
Egypt by the Romans, he gave vent to his indignation on the Jews, great
numbers of whom he mercilessly put to death in Jerusalem. He oppressed
them in every way, and tried to abolish altogether the Jewish worship.
Mattathias, and aged priest, then residing at Modin, a city to the west
of Jerusalem, became now the courageous leader of the national party;
and having fled to the mountains, rallied round him a large band of men
prepared to fight and die for their country and for their religion,
which was now violently suppressed. In 1 Macc. 2:60 is recorded his
dying counsels to his sons with reference to the war they were now to
carry on. His son Judas, "the Maccabee," succeeded him (166 B.C.) as the
leader in directing the war of independence, which was carried on with
great heroism on the part of the Jews, and was terminated in the defeat
of the Syrians.

<span id="002">**Maccabees, Books of the**</span> There were originally
five books of the Maccabees. The first contains a history of the war of
independence, commencing (175 B.C.) in a series of patriotic struggles
against the tyranny of Antiochus Epiphanes, and terminating 135 B.C.. It
became part of the Vulgate Version of the Bible, and was thus retained
among the Apocrypha. The second gives a history of the Maccabees'
struggle from 176 to 161 B.C.. Its object is to encourage and admonish
the Jews to be faithful to the religion of their fathers. The third does
not hold a place in the Apocrypha, but is read in the Greek Church. Its
design is to comfort the Alexandrian Jews in their persecution. Its
writer was evidently an Alexandrian Jew. The fourth was found in the
Library of Lyons, but was afterwards burned. The fifth contains a
history of the Jews from 184 to 86 B.C.. It is a compilation made by a
Jew after the destruction of Jerusalem, from ancient memoirs, to which
he had access. It need scarcely be added that none of these books has
any divine authority.

<span id="003">**Macedonia**</span> In New Testament times, was a Roman
province lying north of Greece. It was governed by a propraetor with the
title of proconsul. Paul was summoned by the vision of the "man of
Macedonia" to preach the gospel there ([Act
16:9](../kjv/act016.htm#009).md). Frequent allusion is made to this event
([Act 18:5](../kjv/act018.htm#005); [Act 19:21](../kjv/act019.htm#021.md);
[Rom 15:26](../kjv/rom015.htm#026); [Co2 1:16](../kjv/co2001.htm#016.md);
[Co2 11:9](../kjv/co2011.htm#009); [Phi 4:15](../kjv/phi004.htm#015).md).
The history of Paul's first journey through Macedonia is given in detail
in Acts 16:10 - 17:15. At the close of this journey he returned from
Corinth to Syria. He again passed through this country ([Act
20:1](../kjv/act020.htm#001).md), although the details of the route are not
given. After many years he probably visited it for a third time ([Phi
2:24](../kjv/phi002.htm#024); [Ti1 1:3](../kjv/ti1001.htm#003).md). The
first convert made by Paul in Europe was ([Act
16:13](../kjv/act016.htm#013)) Lydia (q.v..md), a "seller of purple,"
residing in Philippi, the chief city of the eastern division of
Macedonia.

<span id="004">**Machaerus**</span> The Black Fortress, was built by
Herod the Great in the gorge of Callirhoe, one of the wadies 9 miles
east of the Dead Sea, as a frontier rampart against Arab marauders. John
the Baptist was probably cast into the prison connected with this castle
by Herod Antipas, whom he had reproved for his adulterous marriage with
Herodias. Here Herod "made a supper" on his birthday. He was at this
time marching against Aretas, king of Perea, to whose daughter he had
been married. During the revelry of the banquet held in the border
fortress, to please Salome, who danced before him, he sent an
executioner, who beheaded John, and "brought his head in a charger, and
gave it to the damsel" (Mark 6:14-29). This castle stood "starkly bold
and clear" 3,860 feet above the Dead Sea, and 2,546 above the
Mediterranean. Its ruins, now called MEkhaur, are still visible on the
northern end of Jebel Attarus.

<span id="005">**Machbanai**</span> Clad with a mantle, or bond of the
Lord, one of the Gadite heroes who joined David in the wilderness ([Ch1
12:13](../kjv/ch1012.htm#013).md).

<span id="006">**Machir**</span> Sold. (1.) Manasseh's oldest son ([Jos
17:1](../kjv/jos017.htm#001).md), or probably his only son (see [Ch1
7:14](../kjv/ch1007.htm#014), [Ch1 7:15](../kjv/ch1007.htm#015.md); compare
[Num 26:29](../kjv/num026.htm#029); [Jos 13:31](../kjv/jos013.htm#031).md).
His descendants are referred to under the name of Machirites, being the
offspring of Gilead ([Num 26:29](../kjv/num026.htm#029).md). They settled
in land taken from the Amorites ([Num 32:39](../kjv/num032.htm#039.md),
[Num 32:40](../kjv/num032.htm#040); [Deu 3:15](../kjv/deu003.htm#015).md)
by a special enactment ([Num 36:1](../kjv/num036.htm#001.md); [Jos
17:3](../kjv/jos017.htm#003), [Jos 17:4](../kjv/jos017.htm#004).md). He is
once mentioned as the representative of the tribe of Manasseh east of
Jordan ([Jdg 5:14](../kjv/jdg005.htm#014)). (2..md) A descendant of the
preceding, residing at Lo-debar, where he maintained Jonathan's son
Mephibosheth till he was taken under the care of David ([Sa2
9:4](../kjv/sa2009.htm#004).md), and where he afterwards gave shelter to
David himself when he was a fugitive ([Sa2
17:27](../kjv/sa2017.htm#027).md).

<span id="007">**Machpelah**</span> Portion; double cave, the cave which
Abraham bought, together with the field in which it stood, from Ephron
the Hittite, for a family burying-place (Gen. 23). It is one of those
Bible localities about the identification of which there can be no
doubt. It was on the slope of a hill on the east of Hebron, "before
Mamre." Here were laid the bodies of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and
Rebekah, Jacob and Leah ([Gen 23:19](../kjv/gen023.htm#019.md); [Gen
25:9](../kjv/gen025.htm#009); [Gen 49:31](../kjv/gen049.htm#031.md); [Gen
50:13](../kjv/gen050.htm#013).md). Over the cave an ancient Christian
church was erected, probably in the time of Justinian, the Roman
emperor. This church has been converted into a Mohammedan mosque. The
whole is surrounded by the el-Haram i.e., "the sacred enclosure," about
200 feet long, 115 broad, and of an average height of about 50. This
building, from the immense size of some of its stones, and the manner in
which they are fitted together, is supposed by some to have been erected
in the days of David or of Solomon, while others ascribe it to the time
of Herod. It is looked upon as the most ancient and finest relic of
Jewish architecture. On the floor of the mosque are erected six large
cenotaphs as monuments to the dead who are buried in the cave beneath.
Between the cenotaphs of Isaac and Rebekah there is a circular opening
in the floor into the cavern below, the cave of Machpelah. Here it may
be that the body of Jacob, which was embalmed in Egypt, is still
preserved (much older embalmed bodies have recently been found in the
cave of Deir elBahari in Egypt, see PHARAOH), though those of the others
there buried may have long ago mouldered into dust. The interior of the
mosque was visited by the Prince of Wales in 1862 by a special favour of
the Mohammedan authorities. An interesting account of this visit is
given in Dean Stanley's Lectures on the Jewish Church. It was also
visited in 1866 by the Marquis of Bute, and in 1869 by the late Emperor
(Frederick) of Germany, then the Crown Prince of Prussia. In 1881 it was
visited by the two sons of the Prince of Wales, accompanied by Sir C.
Wilson and others. (See Palestine Quarterly Statement, October 1882).

<span id="008">**Madai**</span> Middle land, the third "son" of Japheth
([Gen 10:2](../kjv/gen010.htm#002).md), the name by which the Medes are
known on the Assyrian monuments.

<span id="009">**Madmannah**</span> Dunghill, the modern el-Minyay, 15
miles south-south-west of Gaza ([Jos 15:31](../kjv/jos015.htm#031.md); [Ch1
2:49](../kjv/ch1002.htm#049).md), in the south of Judah. The Pal. Mem.,
however, suggest Umm Deimneh, 12 miles north-east of Beersheba, as the
site.
