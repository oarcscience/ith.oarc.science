<span id="000">**Flood**</span> An event recorded in Gen. 7 and 8. (See
DELUGE.) In [Jos 24:2](../kjv/jos024.htm#002.md), [Jos
24:3](../kjv/jos024.htm#003), [Jos 24:14](../kjv/jos024.htm#014.md), [Jos
24:15](../kjv/jos024.htm#015), the word "flood" (R.V., "river".md) means
the river Euphrates. In [Psa 66:6](../kjv/psa066.htm#006.md), this word
refers to the river Jordan.

<span id="001">**Flour**</span> Grain reduced to the form of meal is
spoken of in the time of Abraham ([Gen 18:6](../kjv/gen018.htm#006).md). As
baking was a daily necessity, grain was also ground daily at the mills
([Jer 25:10](../kjv/jer025.htm#010).md). The flour mingled with water was
kneaded in kneading-troughs, and sometimes leaven ([Exo
12:34](../kjv/exo012.htm#034).md) was added and sometimes omitted ([Gen
19:3](../kjv/gen019.htm#003).md). The dough was then formed into thin cakes
nine or ten inches in diameter and baked in the oven. Fine flour was
offered by the poor as a sin-offering ([Lev
5:11](../kjv/lev005.htm#011).md), and also in connection with other
sacrifices ([Num 15:3](../kjv/num015.htm#003); 28:7-29.md).

<span id="002">**Flowers**</span> Very few species of flowers are
mentioned in the Bible although they abounded in Palestine. It has been
calculated that in Western Syria and Palestine from two thousand to two
thousand five hundred plants are found, of which about five hundred
probably are British wild-flowers. Their beauty is often alluded to
([Sol 2:12](../kjv/sol002.htm#012); [Mat 6:28](../kjv/mat006.htm#028).md).
They are referred to as affording an emblem of the transitory nature of
human life ([Job 14:2](../kjv/job014.htm#002.md); [Psa
103:15](../kjv/psa103.htm#015); [Isa 28:1](../kjv/isa028.htm#001.md); [Isa
40:6](../kjv/isa040.htm#006); [Jam 1:10](../kjv/jam001.htm#010).md).
Gardens containing flowers and fragrant herbs are spoken of ([Sol
4:16](../kjv/sol004.htm#016); [Sol 6:2](../kjv/sol006.htm#002).md).

<span id="003">**Flute**</span> A musical instrument, probably composed
of a number of pipes, mentioned [Dan 3:5](../kjv/dan003.htm#005.md), [Dan
3:7](../kjv/dan003.htm#007), [Dan 3:10](../kjv/dan003.htm#010.md), [Dan
3:15](../kjv/dan003.htm#015). In [Mat 9:23](../kjv/mat009.htm#023.md), [Mat
9:24](../kjv/mat009.htm#024.md), notice is taken of players on the flute,
here called "minstrels" (but in R.V. "flute-players"). Flutes were in
common use among the ancient Egyptians.

<span id="004">**Fly**</span> Heb. zebub , ([Ecc
10:1](../kjv/ecc010.htm#001); [Isa 7:18](../kjv/isa007.htm#018).md). This
fly was so grievous a pest that the Phoenicians invoked against it the
aid of their god Baal-zebub (q.v.). The prophet Isaiah ([Isa
7:18](../kjv/isa007.htm#018).md) alludes to some poisonous fly which was
believed to be found on the confines of Egypt, and which would be called
by the Lord. Poisonous flies exist in many parts of Africa, for
instance, the different kinds of tsetse. Heb. 'arob , the name given to
the insects sent as a plague on the land of Egypt ([Exo
8:21](../kjv/exo008.htm#021); [Psa 78:45](../kjv/psa078.htm#045.md); [Psa
105:31](../kjv/psa105.htm#031).md). The LXX. render this by a word which
means the "dog-fly," the cynomuia. The Jewish commentators regarded the
Hebrew word here as connected with the word 'arab , which means
"mingled;" and they accordingly supposed the plague to consist of a
mixed multitude of animals, beasts, reptiles, and insects. But there is
no doubt that "the 'arab " denotes a single definite species. Some
interpreters regard it as the Blatta orientalis, the cockroach, a
species of beetle. These insects "inflict very painful bites with their
jaws; gnaw and destroy clothes, household furniture, leather, and
articles of every kind, and either consume or render unavailable all
eatables."

<span id="005">**Foam**</span> ([Hos 10:7](../kjv/hos010.htm#007).md), the
rendering of ketseph, which properly means twigs or splinters (as
rendered in the LXX. and marg. R.V.). The expression in Hosea may
therefore be read, "as a chip on the face of the water," denoting the
helplessness of the piece of wood as compared with the irresistible
current.

<span id="006">**Fodder**</span> Heb. belil , ([Job
6:5](../kjv/job006.htm#005).md), meaning properly a mixture or medley (Lat.
farrago ), "made up of various kinds of grain, as wheat, barley,
vetches, and the like, all mixed together, and then sown or given to
cattle" ([Job 24:6](../kjv/job024.htm#006.md), A.V. "corn," R.V.
"provender;" [Isa 30:24](../kjv/isa030.htm#024), provender".md).

<span id="007">**Fold**</span> An enclosure for flocks to rest together
([Isa 13:20](../kjv/isa013.htm#020).md). Sheep-folds are mentioned [Num
32:16](../kjv/num032.htm#016), [Num 32:24](../kjv/num032.htm#024.md), [Num
32:36](../kjv/num032.htm#036); [Sa2 7:8](../kjv/sa2007.htm#008.md); [Zep
2:6](../kjv/zep002.htm#006); [Joh 10:1](../kjv/joh010.htm#001.md), etc. It
was prophesied of the cities of Ammon ([Eze
25:5](../kjv/eze025.htm#005).md), Aroer ([Isa
17:2](../kjv/isa017.htm#002).md), and Judea, that they would be folds or
couching-places for flocks. "Among the pots," of the Authorized Version
([Psa 68:13](../kjv/psa068.htm#013).md), is rightly in the Revised Version,
"among the sheepfolds."

<span id="008">**Food**</span> Originally the Creator granted the use of
the vegetable world for food to man ([Gen 1:29](../kjv/gen001.htm#029).md),
with the exception mentioned ([Gen 2:17](../kjv/gen002.htm#017).md). The
use of animal food was probably not unknown to the antediluvians. There
is, however, a distinct law on the subject given to Noah after the
Deluge ([Gen 9:2](../kjv/gen009.htm#002).md). Various articles of food used
in the patriarchal age are mentioned in [Gen
18:6](../kjv/gen018.htm#006); [Gen 25:34](../kjv/gen025.htm#034.md); [Gen
27:3](../kjv/gen027.htm#003), [Gen 27:4](../kjv/gen027.htm#004.md); [Gen
43:11](../kjv/gen043.htm#011.md). Regarding the food of the Israelites in
Egypt, see [Exo 16:3](../kjv/exo016.htm#003.md); [Num
11:5](../kjv/num011.htm#005.md). In the wilderness their ordinary food was
miraculously supplied in the manna. They had also quails ([Exo
16:11](../kjv/exo016.htm#011); [Num 11:31](../kjv/num011.htm#031).md). In
the law of Moses there are special regulations as to the animals to be
used for food (Lev. 11; Deut. 14:3-21). The Jews were also forbidden to
use as food anything that had been consecrated to idols ([Exo
34:15](../kjv/exo034.htm#015).md), or animals that had died of disease or
had been torn by wild beasts ([Exo 22:31](../kjv/exo022.htm#031.md); [Lev
22:8](../kjv/lev022.htm#008).md). (See also for other restrictions [Exo
23:19](../kjv/exo023.htm#019); [Exo 29:13](../kjv/exo029.htm#013.md); [Lev
3:4](../kjv/lev003.htm#004); [Lev 9:18](../kjv/lev009.htm#018.md), [Lev
9:19](../kjv/lev009.htm#019); [Lev 22:8](../kjv/lev022.htm#008.md); [Deu
14:21](../kjv/deu014.htm#021)..md) But beyond these restrictions they had a
large grant from God ([Deu 14:26](../kjv/deu014.htm#026.md); [Deu
32:13](../kjv/deu032.htm#013), [Deu 32:14](../kjv/deu032.htm#014).md). Food
was prepared for use in various ways. The cereals were sometimes eaten
without any preparation ([Lev 23:14](../kjv/lev023.htm#014.md); [Deu
23:25](../kjv/deu023.htm#025); [Kg2 4:42](../kjv/kg2004.htm#042).md).
Vegetables were cooked by boiling ([Gen 25:30](../kjv/gen025.htm#030.md),
[Gen 25:34](../kjv/gen025.htm#034); [Kg2 4:38](../kjv/kg2004.htm#038.md),
[Kg2 4:39](../kjv/kg2004.htm#039).md), and thus also other articles of food
were prepared for use ([Gen 27:4](../kjv/gen027.htm#004.md); [Pro
23:3](../kjv/pro023.htm#003); [Eze 24:10](../kjv/eze024.htm#010.md); [Luk
24:42](../kjv/luk024.htm#042); [Joh 21:9](../kjv/joh021.htm#009).md). Food
was also prepared by roasting ([Exo 12:8](../kjv/exo012.htm#008.md); [Lev
2:14](../kjv/lev002.htm#014)). (See COOK..md)

<span id="009">**Footstool**</span> Connected with a throne ([Ch2
9:18](../kjv/ch2009.htm#018).md). Jehovah symbolically dwelt in the holy
place between the cherubim above the ark of the covenant. The ark was
his footstool ([Ch1 28:2](../kjv/ch1028.htm#002.md); [Psa
99:5](../kjv/psa099.htm#005); [Psa 132:7](../kjv/psa132.htm#007).md). And
as heaven is God's throne, so the earth is his footstool ([Psa
110:1](../kjv/psa110.htm#001); [Isa 66:1](../kjv/isa066.htm#001.md); [Mat
5:35](../kjv/mat005.htm#035).md).
