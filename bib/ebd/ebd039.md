<span id="000">**Baale of Judah**</span> Lords of Judah, a city in the
tribe of Judah from which David brought the ark into Jerusalem ([Sa2
6:2](../kjv/sa2006.htm#002)). Elsewhere ([Ch1
13:6](../kjv/ch1013.htm#006)) called Kirjath-jearim. (SEE BAALAH.)

<span id="001">**Baal-gad**</span> Lord of fortune, or troop of Baal, a
Canaanite city in the valley of Lebanon at the foot of Hermon, hence
called Baal-hermon ([Jdg 3:3](../kjv/jdg003.htm#003); [Ch1
5:23](../kjv/ch1005.htm#023)), near the source of the Jordan ([Jos
13:5](../kjv/jos013.htm#005); [Jos 11:17](../kjv/jos011.htm#017); [Jos
12:7](../kjv/jos012.htm#007)). It was the most northern point to which
Joshua's conquests extended. It probably derived its name from the
worship of Baal. Its modern representative is Banias. Some have supposed
it to be the same as Baalbec.

<span id="002">**Baal-hamon**</span> Place of a multitude, a place where
Solomon had an extensive vineyard ([Sol 8:11](../kjv/sol008.htm#011)).
It has been supposed to be identical with Baal-gad, and also with Hammon
in the tribe of Asher ([Jos 19:28](../kjv/jos019.htm#028)). Others
identify it with Belamon, in Central Palestine, near Dothaim.

<span id="003">**Baal-hanan**</span> Lord of grace. (1.) A king of Edom,
son of Achbor ([Gen 36:38](../kjv/gen036.htm#038), [Gen
36:39](../kjv/gen036.htm#039); [Ch1 1:49](../kjv/ch1001.htm#049), [Ch1
1:50](../kjv/ch1001.htm#050)). (2.) An overseer of "the olive trees and
sycomore trees in the low plains" (the Shephelah) under David ([Ch1
27:28](../kjv/ch1027.htm#028)).

<span id="004">**Baal-hazor**</span> Having a courtyard, or Baal's
village, the place on the borders of Ephraim and Benjamin where Absalom
held the feast of sheep-shearing when Amnon was assassinated ([Sa2
13:23](../kjv/sa2013.htm#023)). Probably it is the same with Hazor ([Neh
11:33](../kjv/neh011.htm#033)), now Tell' Asur , 5 miles north-east of
Bethel.

<span id="005">**Baal-hermon**</span> Lord of Hermon. (1.) A city near
Mount Hermon inhabited by the Ephraimites ([Ch1
5:23](../kjv/ch1005.htm#023)). Probably identical with Baal-gad ([Jos
11:17](../kjv/jos011.htm#017)). (2.) A mountain east of Lebanon ([Jdg
3:3](../kjv/jdg003.htm#003)). Probably it may be the same as Mount
Hermon, or one of its three peaks.

<span id="006">**Baali**</span> My lord, a title the prophet ([Hos
2:16](../kjv/hos002.htm#016)) reproaches the Jewish church for applying
to Jehovah, instead of the more endearing title Ishi, meaning "my
husband."

<span id="007">**Baalim**</span> Plural of Baal; images of the god Baal
([Jdg 2:11](../kjv/jdg002.htm#011); [Sa1 7:4](../kjv/sa1007.htm#004)).

<span id="008">**Baalis**</span> King of the Ammonites at the time of
the Babylonian captivity ([Jer 40:14](../kjv/jer040.htm#014)). He hired
Ishmael to slay Gedaliah who had been appointed governor over the cities
of Judah.

<span id="009">**Baal-meon**</span> Lord of dwelling, a town of Reuben
([Num 32:38](../kjv/num032.htm#038)), called also Bethmeon ([Jer
48:23](../kjv/jer048.htm#023)) and Beth-baal-meon ([Jos
13:17](../kjv/jos013.htm#017)). It is supposed to have been the
birth-place of Elisha. It is identified with the modern M'ain , about 3
miles south-east of Heshbon.
