<span id="000">**Milk**</span> (1.) Hebrew halabh, "new milk", milk in
its fresh state ([Jdg 4:19](../kjv/jdg004.htm#019).md). It is frequently
mentioned in connection with honey ([Exo 3:8](../kjv/exo003.htm#008.md);
[Exo 13:5](../kjv/exo013.htm#005); [Jos 5:6](../kjv/jos005.htm#006.md);
[Isa 7:15](../kjv/isa007.htm#015), [Isa 7:22](../kjv/isa007.htm#022.md);
[Jer 11:5](../kjv/jer011.htm#005).md). Sheep ([Deu
32:14](../kjv/deu032.htm#014).md) and goats ([Pro
27:27](../kjv/pro027.htm#027).md) and camels ([Gen
32:15](../kjv/gen032.htm#015).md), as well as cows, are made to give their
milk for the use of man. Milk is used figuratively as a sign of
abundance ([Gen 49:12](../kjv/gen049.htm#012.md); [Eze
25:4](../kjv/eze025.htm#004); [Joe 3:18](../kjv/joe003.htm#018).md). It is
also a symbol of the rudiments of doctrine ([Co1
3:2](../kjv/co1003.htm#002); [Heb 5:12](../kjv/heb005.htm#012.md), [Heb
5:13](../kjv/heb005.htm#013).md), and of the unadulterated word of God
([Pe1 2:2](../kjv/pe1002.htm#002)). (2..md) Heb. hem'ah , always rendered
"butter" in the Authorized Version. It means "butter," but also more
frequently "cream," or perhaps, as some think, "curdled milk," such as
that which Abraham set before the angels ([Gen
18:8](../kjv/gen018.htm#008).md), and which Jael gave to Sisera ([Jdg
5:25](../kjv/jdg005.htm#025).md). In this state milk was used by travelers
([Sa2 17:29](../kjv/sa2017.htm#029).md). If kept long enough, it acquired a
slightly intoxicating or soporific power. This Hebrew word is also
sometimes used for milk in general ([Deu 32:14](../kjv/deu032.htm#014.md);
[Job 20:17](../kjv/job020.htm#017).md).

<span id="001">**Mill**</span> For grinding corn, mentioned as used in
the time of Abraham ([Gen 18:6](../kjv/gen018.htm#006).md). That used by
the Hebrews consisted of two circular stones, each 2 feet in diameter
and half a foot thick, the lower of which was called the "nether
millstone" ([Job 41:24](../kjv/job041.htm#024).md) and the upper the
"rider." The upper stone was turned round by a stick fixed in it as a
handle. There were then no public mills, and thus each family required
to be provided with a hand-mill. The corn was ground daily, generally by
the women of the house ([Isa 47:1](../kjv/isa047.htm#001.md), [Isa
47:2](../kjv/isa047.htm#002); [Mat 24:41](../kjv/mat024.htm#041).md). It
was with the upper stone of a hand-mill that "a certain woman" at Thebez
broke Abimelech's skull ([Jdg 9:53](../kjv/jdg009.htm#053.md), "a piece of
a millstone;" literally, "a millstone rider", i.e., the "runner," the
stone which revolves. Compare [Sa2 11:21](../kjv/sa2011.htm#021).md).
Millstones could not be pledged ([Deu 24:6](../kjv/deu024.htm#006).md), as
they were necessary in every family.

<span id="002">**Millennium**</span> A thousand years; the name given to
the era mentioned in [Rev 20:1](../kjv/rev020.htm#001.md). Some maintain
that Christ will personally appear on earth for the purpose of
establishing his kingdom at the beginning of this millennium. Those
holding this view are usually called "millenarians." On the other hand,
it is maintained, more in accordance with the teaching of Scripture, we
think, that Christ's second advent will not be pre-millennial, and that
the right conception of the prospects and destiny of his kingdom is that
which is taught, e.g., in the parables of the leaven and the
mustard-seed. The triumph of the gospel, it is held, must be looked for
by the wider and more efficient operation of the very forces that are
now at work in extending the gospel; and that Christ will only come
again at the close of this dispensation to judge the world at the "last
day." The millennium will thus precede his coming.

<span id="003">**Millet**</span> (Heb. dohan ; only in [Eze
4:9](../kjv/eze004.htm#009).md), a small grain, the produce of the Panicum
miliaceum of botanists. It is universally cultivated in the East as one
of the smaller corn-grasses. This seed is the cenchros of the Greeks. It
is called in India warree, and by the Arabs dukhan, and is extensively
used for food, being often mixed with other grain. In this country it is
only used for feeding birds.

<span id="004">**Millo**</span> (Heb. always with the article, "the"
Millo). (1.) Probably the Canaanite name of some fortification,
consisting of walls filled in with earth and stones, which protected
Jerusalem on the north as its outer-most defense. It is always rendered
Akra i.e., "the citadel", in the LXX. It was already existing when David
conquered Jerusalem ([Sa2 5:9](../kjv/sa2005.htm#009).md). He extended it
to the right and left, thus completing the defense of the city. It was
rebuilt by Solomon ([Kg1 9:15](../kjv/kg1009.htm#015.md), [Kg1
9:24](../kjv/kg1009.htm#024); [Kg1 11:27](../kjv/kg1011.htm#027).md) and
repaired by Hezekiah ([Ch2 32:5](../kjv/ch2032.htm#005)). (2..md) In [Jdg
9:6](../kjv/jdg009.htm#006), [Jdg 9:20](../kjv/jdg009.htm#020.md) it is the
name of a rampart in Shechem, probably the "tower of Shechem" ([Jdg
9:46](../kjv/jdg009.htm#046), [Jdg 9:49](../kjv/jdg009.htm#049).md).

<span id="005">**Mincing**</span> (Heb. taphoph , [Isa
3:16](../kjv/isa003.htm#016).md), taking affectedly short and quick steps.
Luther renders the word by "wag" or "waggle," thus representing "the
affected gait of coquettish females."

<span id="006">**Mine**</span> The process of mining is described in
[Job 28:1](../kjv/job028.htm#001.md). Moses speaks of the mineral wealth of
Palestine ([Deu 8:9](../kjv/deu008.htm#009).md). [Job
28:4](../kjv/job028.htm#004.md) is rightly thus rendered in the Revised
Version, "He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn; they are
forgotten of the foot \[that passeth by\]; they hang afar from men, they
swing to and fro." These words illustrate ancient mining operations.

<span id="007">**Minister**</span> One who serves, as distinguished from
the master. (1.) Heb. meshereth , applied to an attendant on one of
superior rank, as to Joshua, the servant of Moses ([Exo
33:11](../kjv/exo033.htm#011).md), and to the servant of Elisha ([Kg2
4:43](../kjv/kg2004.htm#043).md). This name is also given to attendants at
court ([Ch2 22:8](../kjv/ch2022.htm#008).md), and to the priests and
Levites ([Jer 33:21](../kjv/jer033.htm#021.md); [Eze
44:11](../kjv/eze044.htm#011)). (2..md) Heb. pelah ([Ezr
7:24](../kjv/ezr007.htm#024).md), a "minister" of religion. Here used of
that class of sanctuary servants called "Solomon's servants" in [Ezr
2:55](../kjv/ezr002.htm#055) and [Neh 7:57](../kjv/neh007.htm#057). (3..md)
Greek leitourgos , a subordinate public administrator, and in this sense
applied to magistrates ([Rom 13:6](../kjv/rom013.htm#006).md). It is
applied also to our Lord ([Heb 8:2](../kjv/heb008.htm#002).md), and to Paul
in relation to Christ ([Rom 15:16](../kjv/rom015.htm#016)). (4..md) Greek
hyperetes (literally, "under-rower"), a personal attendant on a
superior, thus of the person who waited on the officiating priest in the
synagogue ([Luk 4:20](../kjv/luk004.htm#020).md). It is applied also to
John Mark, the attendant on Paul and Barnabas ([Act
13:5](../kjv/act013.htm#005)). (5..md) Greek diaconos , usually a
subordinate officer or assistant employed in relation to the ministry of
the gospel, as to Paul and Apollos ([Co1 3:5](../kjv/co1003.htm#005).md),
Tychicus ([Eph 6:21](../kjv/eph006.htm#021).md), Epaphras ([Col
1:7](../kjv/col001.htm#007).md), Timothy ([Th1
3:2](../kjv/th1003.htm#002).md), and also to Christ ([Rom
15:8](../kjv/rom015.htm#008).md).

<span id="008">**Minni**</span> Only in [Jer
51:27](../kjv/jer051.htm#027.md), as the name of a province in Armenia,
which was at this time under the Median kings. Armenia is regarded by
some as = Har-minni i.e., the mountainous country of Minni. (See
ARMENIA.)

<span id="009">**Minnith**</span> Distribution, an Ammonitish town ([Jdg
11:33](../kjv/jdg011.htm#033).md) from which wheat was exported to Tyre
([Eze 27:17](../kjv/eze027.htm#017).md). It was probably somewhere in the
Mishor or table-land on the east of Jordan. There is a gentle valley
running for about 4 miles east of Dhiban called Kurm Dhiban, "the
vineyards of Dibon." Tristram supposes that this may be the "vineyards"
mentioned in Judg. (l.c.).
