<span id="000">**Ark**</span> Noah's ark, a building of gopher-wood, and
covered with pitch, 300 cubits long, 50 cubits broad, and 30 cubits high
([Gen 6:14](../kjv/gen006.htm#014)); an oblong floating house of three
stories, with a door in the side and a window in the roof. It was 100
years in building ([Gen 5:32](../kjv/gen005.htm#032); [Gen
7:6](../kjv/gen007.htm#006)). It was intended to preserve certain
persons and animals from the deluge which God was about to bring over
the earth. It contained eight persons ([Gen
7:13](../kjv/gen007.htm#013); [Pe2 2:5](../kjv/pe2002.htm#005)), and of
all "clean" animals seven pairs, and of "unclean" one pair, and of birds
seven pairs of each sort ([Gen 7:2](../kjv/gen007.htm#002), [Gen
7:3](../kjv/gen007.htm#003)). It was in the form of an oblong square,
with flat bottom and sloping roof. Traditions of the Deluge, by which
the race of man was swept from the earth, and of the ark of Noah have
been found existing among all nations. The ark of bulrushes in which the
infant Moses was laid ([Exo 2:3](../kjv/exo002.htm#003)) is called in
the Hebrew teebah, a word derived from the Egyptian teb, meaning "a
chest." It was daubed with slime and with pitch. The bulrushes of which
it was made were the papyrus reed. The sacred ark is designated by a
different Hebrew word, 'aron', which is the common name for a chest or
coffer used for any purpose ([Gen 50:26](../kjv/gen050.htm#026); [Kg2
12:9](../kjv/kg2012.htm#009), [Kg2 12:10](../kjv/kg2012.htm#010)). It is
distinguished from all others by such titles as the "ark of God" ([Sa1
3:3](../kjv/sa1003.htm#003)), "ark of the covenant" ([Jos
3:6](../kjv/jos003.htm#006); [Heb 9:4](../kjv/heb009.htm#004)), "ark of
the testimony" ([Exo 25:22](../kjv/exo025.htm#022)). It was made of
acacia or shittim wood, a cubit and a half broad and high and two cubits
long, and covered all over with the purest gold. Its upper surface or
lid, the mercy-seat, was surrounded with a rim of gold; and on each of
the two sides were two gold rings, in which were placed two gold-covered
poles by which the ark could be carried ([Num
7:9](../kjv/num007.htm#009); [Num 10:21](../kjv/num010.htm#021); [Num
4:5](../kjv/num004.htm#005), [Num 4:19](../kjv/num004.htm#019), [Num
4:20](../kjv/num004.htm#020); [Kg1 8:3](../kjv/kg1008.htm#003), [Kg1
8:6](../kjv/kg1008.htm#006)). Over the ark, at the two extremities, were
two cherubim, with their faces turned toward each other ([Lev
16:2](../kjv/lev016.htm#002); [Num 7:89](../kjv/num007.htm#089)). Their
outspread wings over the top of the ark formed the throne of God, while
the ark itself was his footstool ([Exo 25:10](../kjv/exo025.htm#010);
[Exo 37:1](../kjv/exo037.htm#001)). The ark was deposited in the "holy
of holies," and was so placed that one end of the poles by which it was
carried touched the veil which separated the two apartments of the
tabernacle ([Kg1 8:8](../kjv/kg1008.htm#008)). The two tables of stone
which constituted the "testimony" or evidence of God's covenant with the
people ([Deu 31:26](../kjv/deu031.htm#026)), the "pot of manna" ([Exo
16:33](../kjv/exo016.htm#033)), and "Aaron's rod that budded" ([Num
17:10](../kjv/num017.htm#010)), were laid up in the ark ([Heb
9:4](../kjv/heb009.htm#004)). (See TABERNACLE.) The ark and the
sanctuary were "the beauty of Israel" ([Lam
2:1](../kjv/lam002.htm#001)). During the journeys of the Israelites the
ark was carried by the priests in advance of the host ([Num
4:5](../kjv/num004.htm#005), [Num 4:6](../kjv/num004.htm#006); [Num
10:33](../kjv/num010.htm#033); [Psa 68:1](../kjv/psa068.htm#001); [Psa
132:8](../kjv/psa132.htm#008)). It was borne by the priests into the bed
of the Jordan, which separated, opening a pathway for the whole of the
host to pass over ([Jos 3:15](../kjv/jos003.htm#015), [Jos
3:16](../kjv/jos003.htm#016); [Jos 4:7](../kjv/jos004.htm#007), [Jos
4:10](../kjv/jos004.htm#010), [Jos 4:11](../kjv/jos004.htm#011), [Jos
4:17](../kjv/jos004.htm#017), [Jos 4:18](../kjv/jos004.htm#018)). It was
borne in the procession round Jericho ([Jos 6:4](../kjv/jos006.htm#004),
[Jos 6:6](../kjv/jos006.htm#006), [Jos 6:8](../kjv/jos006.htm#008), [Jos
6:11](../kjv/jos006.htm#011), [Jos 6:12](../kjv/jos006.htm#012)). When
carried it was always wrapped in the veil, the badgers' skins, and blue
cloth, and carefully concealed even from the eyes of the Levites who
carried it. After the settlement of Israel in Palestine the ark remained
in the tabernacle at Gilgal for a season, and was then removed to Shiloh
till the time of Eli, between 300 and 400 years ([Jer
7:12](../kjv/jer007.htm#012)), when it was carried into the field of
battle so as to secure, as they supposed, victory to the Hebrews, and
was taken by the Philistines ([Sa1 4:3](../kjv/sa1004.htm#003)), who
sent it back after retaining it seven months ([Sa1
5:7](../kjv/sa1005.htm#007), [Sa1 5:8](../kjv/sa1005.htm#008)). It
remained then at Kirjath-jearim ([Sa1 7:1](../kjv/sa1007.htm#001), [Sa1
7:2](../kjv/sa1007.htm#002)) till the time of David (twenty years), who
wished to remove it to Jerusalem; but the proper mode of removing it
having been neglected, Uzzah was smitten with death for putting "forth
his hand to the ark of God," and in consequence of this it was left in
the house of Obed-edom in Gath-rimmon for three months ([Sa2
6:1](../kjv/sa2006.htm#001)), at the end of which time David removed it
in a grand procession to Jerusalem, where it was kept till a place was
prepared for it ([Sa2 6:12](../kjv/sa2006.htm#012)). It was afterwards
deposited by Solomon in the temple ([Kg1 8:6](../kjv/kg1008.htm#006)).
When the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and plundered the temple, the
ark was probably taken away by Nebuchadnezzar and destroyed, as no trace
of it is afterwards to be found. The absence of the ark from the second
temple was one of the points in which it was inferior to the first
temple.

<span id="001">**Arkite**</span> ([Gen 10:17](../kjv/gen010.htm#017);
[Ch1 1:15](../kjv/ch1001.htm#015)), a designation of certain descendants
from the Phoenicians or Sidonians, the inhabitants of Arka, 12 miles
north of Tripoli, opposite the northern extremity of Lebanon.

<span id="002">**Arm**</span> Used to denote power ([Psa
10:15](../kjv/psa010.htm#015); [Eze 30:21](../kjv/eze030.htm#021); [Jer
48:25](../kjv/jer048.htm#025)). It is also used of the omnipotence of
God ([Exo 15:16](../kjv/exo015.htm#016); [Psa
89:13](../kjv/psa089.htm#013); [Psa 98:1](../kjv/psa098.htm#001); [Psa
77:15](../kjv/psa077.htm#015); [Isa 53:1](../kjv/isa053.htm#001); [Joh
12:38](../kjv/joh012.htm#038); [Act 13:17](../kjv/act013.htm#017))

<span id="003">**Armageddon**</span> Occurs only in [Rev
16:16](../kjv/rev016.htm#016) (R.V., "Har-Magedon"), as symbolically
designating the place where the "battle of that great day of God
Almighty" ([Rev 16:14](../kjv/rev016.htm#014)) shall be fought. The
world properly means the "mount of Megiddo." It is the scene of the
final conflict between Christ and Antichrist. The idea of such a scene
was suggested by the Old Testament great battle-field, the plain of
Esdraelon (q.v.).

<span id="004">**Armenia**</span> High land, occurs only in Authorized
Version, [Kg2 19:37](../kjv/kg2019.htm#037); in Revised Version,
"Ararat," which is the Hebrew word. A country in western Asia lying
between the Caspian and the Black Sea. Here the ark of Noah rested after
the Deluge ([Gen 8:4](../kjv/gen008.htm#004)). It is for the most part
high table-land, and is watered by the Aras, the Kur, the Euphrates, and
the Tigris. Ararat was properly the name of a part of ancient Armenia.
Three provinces of Armenia are mentioned in [Jer
51:27](../kjv/jer051.htm#027), Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz. Some,
however, think Minni a contraction for Armenia. (See ARARAT.)

<span id="005">**Armoni**</span> Inhabitant of a fortress, the
first-named of the two sons of Saul and Rizpah. He was delivered up to
the Gibeonites by David, and hanged by them ([Sa2
21:8](../kjv/sa2021.htm#008), [Sa2 21:9](../kjv/sa2021.htm#009)).

<span id="006">**Armour**</span> Is employed in the English Bible to
denote military equipment, both offensive and defensive. (1.) The
offensive weapons were different at different periods of history. The
"rod of iron" ([Psa 2:9](../kjv/psa002.htm#009)) is supposed to mean a
mace or crowbar, an instrument of great power when used by a strong arm.
The "maul" ([Pro 25:18](../kjv/pro025.htm#018); cognate Hebrew word
rendered "battle-axe" in [Jer 51:20](../kjv/jer051.htm#020), and
"slaughter weapon" in [Eze 9:2](../kjv/eze009.htm#002)) was a war-hammer
or martel. The "sword" is the usual translation of hereb, which properly
means "poniard." The real sword, as well as the dirk-sword (which was
always double-edged), was also used ([Sa1 17:39](../kjv/sa1017.htm#039);
[Sa2 20:8](../kjv/sa2020.htm#008); [Kg1 20:11](../kjv/kg1020.htm#011)).
The spear was another offensive weapon ([Jos
8:18](../kjv/jos008.htm#018); [Sa1 17:7](../kjv/sa1017.htm#007)). The
javelin was used by light troops ([Num 25:7](../kjv/num025.htm#007),
[Num 25:8](../kjv/num025.htm#008); [Sa1 13:22](../kjv/sa1013.htm#022)).
Saul threw a javelin at David ([Sa1 19:9](../kjv/sa1019.htm#009), [Sa1
19:10](../kjv/sa1019.htm#010)), and so virtually absolved him from his
allegiance. The bow was, however, the chief weapon of offense. The
arrows were carried in a quiver, the bow being always unbent till the
moment of action ([Gen 27:3](../kjv/gen027.htm#003); [Gen
48:22](../kjv/gen048.htm#022); [Psa 18:34](../kjv/psa018.htm#034)). The
sling was a favorite weapon of the Benjamites ([Sa1
17:40](../kjv/sa1017.htm#040); [Ch1 12:2](../kjv/ch1012.htm#002).
Compare [Sa1 25:29](../kjv/sa1025.htm#029)). (2.) Of the defensive
Armour a chief place is assigned to the shield or buckler. There were
the great shield or target (the tzinnah), for the protection of the
whole person ([Gen 15:1](../kjv/gen015.htm#001); [Psa
47:9](../kjv/psa047.htm#009); [Sa1 17:7](../kjv/sa1017.htm#007); [Pro
30:5](../kjv/pro030.htm#005)), and the buckler (Heb. mageen ) or small
shield ([Kg1 10:17](../kjv/kg1010.htm#017); [Eze
26:8](../kjv/eze026.htm#008)). In [Psa 91:4](../kjv/psa091.htm#004)
"buckler" is properly a roundel appropriated to archers or slingers. The
helmet ([Eze 27:10](../kjv/eze027.htm#010); [Sa1
17:38](../kjv/sa1017.htm#038)), a covering for the head; the coat of
mail or corselet ([Sa1 17:5](../kjv/sa1017.htm#005)), or habergeon (Neh.
4; 16), harness or breast-plate ([Rev 9:9](../kjv/rev009.htm#009)), for
the covering of the back and breast and both upper arms ([Isa
59:17](../kjv/isa059.htm#017); [Eph 6:14](../kjv/eph006.htm#014)). The
cuirass and corselet, composed of leather or quilted cloth, were also
for the covering of the body. Greaves, for the covering of the legs,
were worn in the time of David ([Sa1 17:6](../kjv/sa1017.htm#006)).
Reference is made by Paul ([Eph 6:14](../kjv/eph006.htm#014)) to the
panoply of a Roman soldier. The shield here is the thureon, a door-like
oblong shield above all, i.e., covering the whole person, not the small
round shield. There is no armour for the back, but only for the front.

<span id="007">**Armour-bearer**</span> An officer selected by kings and
generals because of his bravery, not only to bear their armour, but also
to stand by them in the time of danger. They were the adjutants of our
modern armies ([Jdg 9:54](../kjv/jdg009.htm#054); [Sa1
14:7](../kjv/sa1014.htm#007); [Sa1 16:21](../kjv/sa1016.htm#021); [Sa1
31:6](../kjv/sa1031.htm#006)).

<span id="008">**Armoury**</span> The place in which armour was
deposited when not used ([Neh 3:19](../kjv/neh003.htm#019); [Jer
50:25](../kjv/jer050.htm#025)). At first each man of the Hebrews had his
own arms, because all went to war. There were no arsenals or magazines
for arms till the time of David, who had a large collection of arms,
which he consecrated to the Lord in his tabernacle ([Sa1
21:9](../kjv/sa1021.htm#009); [Sa2 8:7](../kjv/sa2008.htm#007); [Ch1
26:26](../kjv/ch1026.htm#026), [Ch1 26:27](../kjv/ch1026.htm#027)).

<span id="009">**Army**</span> The Israelites marched out of Egypt in
military order ([Exo 13:18](../kjv/exo013.htm#018), "harnessed;" marg.,
"five in a rank"). Each tribe formed a battalion, with its own banner
and leader ([Num 2:2](../kjv/num002.htm#002); [Num
10:14](../kjv/num010.htm#014)). In war the army was divided into
thousands and hundreds under their several captains ([Num
31:14](../kjv/num031.htm#014)), and also into families ([Num
2:34](../kjv/num002.htm#034); [Ch2 25:5](../kjv/ch2025.htm#005); [Ch2
26:12](../kjv/ch2026.htm#012)). From the time of their entering the land
of Canaan to the time of the kings, the Israelites made little progress
in military affairs, although often engaged in warfare. The kings
introduced the custom of maintaining a bodyguard (the Gibborim; i.e.,
"heroes"), and thus the nucleus of a standing army was formed. Saul had
an army of 3,000 select warriors ([Sa1 13:2](../kjv/sa1013.htm#002);
[Sa1 14:52](../kjv/sa1014.htm#052); [Sa1 24:2](../kjv/sa1024.htm#002)).
David also had a band of soldiers around him ([Sa1
23:13](../kjv/sa1023.htm#013); [Sa1 25:13](../kjv/sa1025.htm#013)). To
this band he afterwards added the Cherethites and the Pelethites ([Sa2
15:18](../kjv/sa2015.htm#018); [Sa2 20:7](../kjv/sa2020.htm#007)). At
first the army consisted only of infantry ([Sa1
4:10](../kjv/sa1004.htm#010); [Sa1 15:4](../kjv/sa1015.htm#004)), as the
use of horses was prohibited ([Deu 17:16](../kjv/deu017.htm#016)); but
chariots and horses were afterwards added ([Sa2
8:4](../kjv/sa2008.htm#004); [Kg1 10:26](../kjv/kg1010.htm#026), [Kg1
10:28](../kjv/kg1010.htm#028), [Kg1 10:29](../kjv/kg1010.htm#029); [Kg1
9:19](../kjv/kg1009.htm#019)). In [Kg1 9:22](../kjv/kg1009.htm#022)
there is given a list of the various gradations of rank held by those
who composed the army. The equipment and maintenance of the army were at
the public expense ([Sa2 17:28](../kjv/sa2017.htm#028), [Sa2
17:29](../kjv/sa2017.htm#029); [Kg1 4:27](../kjv/kg1004.htm#027); [Kg1
10:16](../kjv/kg1010.htm#016), [Kg1 10:17](../kjv/kg1010.htm#017); [Jdg
20:10](../kjv/jdg020.htm#010)). At the Exodus the number of males above
twenty years capable of bearing arms was 600,000 ([Exo
12:37](../kjv/exo012.htm#037)). In David's time it mounted to the number
of 1,300,000 ([Sa2 24:9](../kjv/sa2024.htm#009)).
