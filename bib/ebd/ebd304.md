<span id="000">**Quiver**</span> The sheath for arrows. The Hebrew word
(aspah) thus commonly rendered is found in [Job
39:23](../kjv/job039.htm#023); [Psa 127:5](../kjv/psa127.htm#005); [Isa
22:6](../kjv/isa022.htm#006); [Isa 49:2](../kjv/isa049.htm#002); [Jer
5:16](../kjv/jer005.htm#016); [Lam 3:13](../kjv/lam003.htm#013). In [Gen
27:3](../kjv/gen027.htm#003) this word is the rendering of the Hebrew
teli, which is supposed rather to mean a suspended weapon, literally
"that which hangs from one", i.e., is suspended from the shoulder or
girdle.

<span id="001">**Quotations**</span> From the Old Testament in the New,
which are very numerous, are not made according to any uniform method.
When the New Testament was written, the Old was not divided, as it now
is, into chapters and verses, and hence such peculiarities as these:
When Luke ([Luk 20:37](../kjv/luk020.htm#037)) refers to [Exo
3:6](../kjv/exo003.htm#006), he quotes from "Moses at the bush", i.e.,
the section containing the record of Moses at the bush. So also Mark
([Mar 2:26](../kjv/mar002.htm#026)) refers to [Sa1
21:1](../kjv/sa1021.htm#001), in the words, "in the days of Abiathar;"
and Paul ([Rom 11:2](../kjv/rom011.htm#002)) refers to 1 Kings 17 - 19,
in the words, "in Elias", i.e., in the portion of the history regarding
Elias. In general, the New Testament writers quote from the Septuagint
(q.v.) version of the Old Testament, as it was then in common use among
the Jews. But it is noticeable that these quotations are not made in any
uniform manner. Sometimes, e.g., the quotation does not agree literally
either with the LXX. or the Hebrew text. This occurs in about one
hundred instances. Sometimes the LXX. is literally quoted (in about
ninety instances), and sometimes it is corrected or altered in the
quotations (in over eighty instances). Quotations are sometimes made
also directly from the Hebrew text ([Mat 4:15](../kjv/mat004.htm#015),
[Mat 4:16](../kjv/mat004.htm#016); [Joh 19:37](../kjv/joh019.htm#037);
[Co1 15:54](../kjv/co1015.htm#054)). Besides the quotations made
directly, there are found numberless allusions, more or less distinct,
showing that the minds of the New Testament writers were filled with the
expressions and ideas as well as historical facts recorded in the Old.
There are in all two hundred and eighty-three direct quotations from the
Old Testament in the New, but not one clear and certain case of
quotation from the Apocrypha (q.v.). Besides quotations in the New from
the Old Testament, there are in Paul's writings three quotations from
certain Greek poets, [Act 17:28](../kjv/act017.htm#028); [Co1
15:33](../kjv/co1015.htm#033); [Tit 1:12](../kjv/tit001.htm#012). These
quotations are memorials of his early classical education.

<span id="002">**Raamah**</span> Thunder. (1.) One of the sons of Cush
([Gen 10:7](../kjv/gen010.htm#007)). (2.) A country which traded with
Tyre ([Eze 27:22](../kjv/eze027.htm#022)).

<span id="003">**Raamiah**</span> Thunder of the Lord, one of the
princes who returned from the Exile ([Neh 7:7](../kjv/neh007.htm#007));
called also Reelaiah ([Ezr 2:2](../kjv/ezr002.htm#002)).

<span id="004">**Raamses**</span> ([Exo 1:11](../kjv/exo001.htm#011)).
(See RAMESES.)

<span id="005">**Rabbah**</span> Or Rabbath, great. (1.) "Rabbath of the
children of Ammon," the chief city of the Ammonites, among the eastern
hills, some 20 miles east of the Jordan, on the southern of the two
streams which united with the Jabbok. Here the bedstead of Og was
preserved ([Deu 3:11](../kjv/deu003.htm#011)), perhaps as a trophy of
some victory gained by the Ammonites over the king of Bashan. After
David had subdued all their allies in a great war, he sent Joab with a
strong force to take their city. For two years it held out against its
assailants. It was while his army was engaged in this protracted siege
that David was guilty of that deed of shame which left a blot on his
character and cast a gloom over the rest of his life. At length, having
taken the "royal city" (or the "city of waters," [Sa2
12:27](../kjv/sa2012.htm#027), i.e., the lower city on the river, as
distinguished from the citadel), Joab sent for David to direct the final
assault ([Sa2 11:1](../kjv/sa2011.htm#001); [Sa2
12:26](../kjv/sa2012.htm#026)). The city was given up to plunder, and
the people were ruthlessly put to death, and "thus did he with all the
cities of the children of Ammon." The destruction of Rabbath was the
last of David's conquests. His kingdom now reached its farthest limits
([Sa2 8:1](../kjv/sa2008.htm#001); [Ch1 18:1](../kjv/ch1018.htm#001)).
The capture of this city is referred to by Amos ([Amo
1:14](../kjv/amo001.htm#014)), Jeremiah ([Jer
49:2](../kjv/jer049.htm#002), [Jer 49:3](../kjv/jer049.htm#003)), and
Ezekiel ([Eze 21:20](../kjv/eze021.htm#020); [Eze
25:5](../kjv/eze025.htm#005)). (2.) A city in the hill country of Judah
([Jos 15:60](../kjv/jos015.htm#060)), possibly the ruin Rubba, six miles
north-east of Beit-Jibrin.

<span id="006">**Rabbi**</span> My master, a title of dignity given by
the Jews to their doctors of the law and their distinguished teachers.
It is sometimes applied to Christ ([Mat 23:7](../kjv/mat023.htm#007),
[Mat 23:8](../kjv/mat023.htm#008); [Mar 9:5](../kjv/mar009.htm#005)
(R.V.); [Joh 1:38](../kjv/joh001.htm#038), [Joh
1:49](../kjv/joh001.htm#049); [Joh 3:2](../kjv/joh003.htm#002); [Joh
6:25](../kjv/joh006.htm#025), etc.); also to John ([Joh
3:26](../kjv/joh003.htm#026)).

<span id="007">**Rabboni**</span> (id.) occurs only twice in the New
Testament ([Mar 10:51](../kjv/mar010.htm#051), A.V., "Lord," R.V.,
"Rabboni;" [Joh 20:16](../kjv/joh020.htm#016)). It was the most
honourable of all the titles.

<span id="008">**Rabmag**</span> Assyrian Rab-mugi, "chief physician,"
"who was attached to the king ([Jer 39:3](../kjv/jer039.htm#003), [Jer
39:13](../kjv/jer039.htm#013)), the title of one of Sennacherib's
officers sent with messages to Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem (2
Kings 18:17 - 19:13; Isa. 36:12 - 37:13) demanding the surrender of the
city. He was accompanied by a "great army;" but his mission was
unsuccessful.

<span id="009">**Rabsaris**</span> Chief of the Heads, one of the three
officers whom Sennacherib sent from Lachish with a threatening message
to Jerusalem ([Kg2 18:17](../kjv/kg2018.htm#017); [Jer
39:3](../kjv/jer039.htm#003), [Jer 39:13](../kjv/jer039.htm#013)).
