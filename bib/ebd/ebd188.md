<span id="000">**Imputation**</span> Is used to designate any action or
word or thing as reckoned to a person. Thus in doctrinal language (1.)
the sin of Adam is imputed to all his descendants, i.e., it is reckoned
as theirs, and they are dealt with therefore as guilty; (2.) the
righteousness of Christ is imputed to them that believe in him, or so
attributed to them as to be considered their own; and (3.) our sins are
imputed to Christ, i.e., he assumed our "law-place," undertook to answer
the demands of justice for our sins. In all these cases the nature of
imputation is the same ([Rom 5:12](../kjv/rom005.htm#012.md); compare [Plm
1:18](../kjv/plm001.htm#018), [Plm 1:19](../kjv/plm001.htm#019).md).

<span id="001">**Incarnation**</span> That act of grace whereby Christ
took our human nature into union with his Divine Person, became man.
Christ is both God and man. Human attributes and actions are predicated
of him, and he of whom they are predicated is God. A Divine Person was
united to a human nature ([Act 20:28](../kjv/act020.htm#028.md); [Rom
8:32](../kjv/rom008.htm#032); [Co1 2:8](../kjv/co1002.htm#008.md); [Heb
2:11](../kjv/heb002.htm#011); [Ti1 3:16](../kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md); [Gal
4:4](../kjv/gal004.htm#004), etc..md). The union is hypostatical, i.e., is
personal; the two natures are not mixed or confounded, and it is
perpetual.

<span id="002">**Incense**</span> A fragrant composition prepared by the
"art of the apothecary." It consisted of four ingredients "beaten small"
([Exo 30:34](../kjv/exo030.htm#034).md). That which was not thus prepared
was called "strange incense" ([Exo 30:9](../kjv/exo030.htm#009).md). It was
offered along with every meat-offering; and besides was daily offered on
the golden altar in the holy place, and on the great day of atonement
was burnt by the high priest in the holy of holies ([Exo
30:7](../kjv/exo030.htm#007), [Exo 30:8](../kjv/exo030.htm#008).md). It was
the symbol of prayer ([Psa 141:1](../kjv/psa141.htm#001.md), [Psa
141:2](../kjv/psa141.htm#002); [Rev 5:8](../kjv/rev005.htm#008.md); [Rev
8:3](../kjv/rev008.htm#003), [Rev 8:4](../kjv/rev008.htm#004).md).

<span id="003">**India**</span> Occurs only in [Est
1:1](../kjv/est001.htm#001) and [Est 8:9](../kjv/est008.htm#009.md), where
the extent of the dominion of the Persian king is described. The country
so designated here is not the peninsula of Hindustan, but the country
surrounding the Indus, the Punjab. The people and the products of India
were well known to the Jews, who seem to have carried on an active trade
with that country ([Eze 27:15](../kjv/eze027.htm#015.md), [Eze
27:24](../kjv/eze027.htm#024).md).

<span id="004">**Inn**</span> In the modern sense, unknown in the East.
The khans or caravanserais, which correspond to the European inn, are
not alluded to in the Old Testament. The "inn" mentioned in [Exo
4:24](../kjv/exo004.htm#024.md) was just the halting-place of the caravan.
In later times khans were erected for the accommodation of travelers. In
[Luk 2:7](../kjv/luk002.htm#007.md) the word there so rendered denotes a
place for loosing the beasts of their burdens. It is rendered
"guest-chamber" in [Mar 14:14](../kjv/mar014.htm#014.md) and [Luk
22:11](../kjv/luk022.htm#011). In [Luk 10:34](../kjv/luk010.htm#034.md) the
word so rendered is different. That inn had an "inn-keeper," who
attended to the wants of travelers.

<span id="005">**Inkhorn**</span> The Hebrew word so rendered means
simply a round vessel or cup for containing ink, which was generally
worn by writers in the girdle ([Eze 9:2](../kjv/eze009.htm#002.md), [Eze
9:3](../kjv/eze009.htm#003), [Eze 9:11](../kjv/eze009.htm#011).md). The
word "inkhorn" was used by the translators, because in former times in
this country horns were used for containing ink.

<span id="006">**Inspiration**</span> That extraordinary or supernatural
divine influence vouchsafed to those who wrote the Holy Scriptures,
rendering their writings infallible. "All scripture is given by
inspiration of God" (R.V., "Every scripture inspired of God"), [Ti2
3:16](../kjv/ti2003.htm#016.md). This is true of all the "sacred writings,"
not in the sense of their being works of genius or of supernatural
insight, but as "theopneustic," i.e., "breathed into by God" in such a
sense that the writers were supernaturally guided to express exactly
what God intended them to express as a revelation of his mind and will.
The testimony of the sacred writers themselves abundantly demonstrates
this truth; and if they are infallible as teachers of doctrine, then the
doctrine of plenary inspiration must be accepted. There are no errors in
the Bible as it came from God none have been proved to exist.
Difficulties and phenomena we cannot explain are not errors. All these
books of the Old and New Testaments are inspired. We do not say that
they contain, but that they are, the Word of God. The gift of
inspiration rendered the writers the organs of God, for the infallible
communication of his mind and will, in the very manner and words in
which it was originally given. As to the nature of inspiration we have
no information. This only we know, it rendered the writers infallible.
They were all equally inspired, and are all equally infallible. The
inspiration of the sacred writers did not change their characters. They
retained all their individual peculiarities as thinkers or writers. (See
BIBLE; WORD OF GOD.)

<span id="007">**Intercession of Christ**</span> Christ's priestly
office consists of these two parts, (1.) the offering up of himself as a
sacrifice, and (2.) making continual intercession for us. When on earth
he made intercession for his people ([Luk 23:34](../kjv/luk023.htm#034.md);
[Joh 17:20](../kjv/joh017.htm#020); [Heb 5:7](../kjv/heb005.htm#007).md);
but now he exercises this function of his priesthood in heaven, where he
is said to appear in the presence of God for us ([Heb
9:12](../kjv/heb009.htm#012), [Heb 9:24](../kjv/heb009.htm#024).md). His
advocacy with the Father for his people rests on the basis of his own
all-perfect sacrifice. Thus he pleads for and obtains the fulfillment of
all the promises of the everlasting covenant ([Jo1
2:1](../kjv/jo1002.htm#001); [Joh 17:24](../kjv/joh017.htm#024.md); [Heb
7:25](../kjv/heb007.htm#025).md). He can be "touched with the feeling of
our infirmities," and is both a merciful and a faithful high priest
([Heb 2:17](../kjv/heb002.htm#017), [Heb 2:18](../kjv/heb002.htm#018.md);
[Heb 4:15](../kjv/heb004.htm#015), [Heb 4:16](../kjv/heb004.htm#016).md).
This intercession is an essential part of his mediatorial work. Through
him we have "access" to the Father ([Joh 14:6](../kjv/joh014.htm#006.md);
[Eph 2:18](../kjv/eph002.htm#018); [Eph 3:12](../kjv/eph003.htm#012).md).
"The communion of his people with the Father will ever be sustained
through him as mediatorial Priest" ([Psa 110:4](../kjv/psa110.htm#004.md);
[Rev 7:17](../kjv/rev007.htm#017).md).

<span id="008">**Intercession of the Spirit**</span> ([Rom
8:26](../kjv/rom008.htm#026), [Rom 8:27](../kjv/rom008.htm#027.md); [Joh
14:26](../kjv/joh014.htm#026).md). "Christ is a royal Priest ([Zac
6:13](../kjv/zac006.htm#013).md). From the same throne, as King, he
dispenses his Spirit to all the objects of his care, while as Priest he
intercedes for them. The Spirit acts for him, taking only of his things.
They both act with one consent, Christ as principal, the Spirit as his
agent. Christ intercedes for us, without us, as our advocate in heaven,
according to the provisions of the everlasting covenant. The Holy Spirit
works upon our minds and hearts, enlightening and quickening, and thus
determining our desires 'according to the will of God,' as our advocate
within us. The work of the one is complementary to that of the other,
and together they form a complete whole." Hodge's Outlines of Theology.

tribe of Benjamin ([Ch1 8:25](../kjv/ch1008.htm#025).md).
