<span id="000">**Malcam**</span> [Sa2 12:30](../kjv/sa2012.htm#030.md),
Heb., R.V., "their king;" [Jer 49:1](../kjv/jer049.htm#001.md), [Jer
49:3](../kjv/jer049.htm#003), R.V.; [Zep 1:5](../kjv/zep001.htm#005).md),
the national idol of the Ammonites. When Rabbah was taken by David, the
crown of this idol was among the spoils. The weight is said to have been
"a talent of gold" (above 100 lb.). The expression probably denotes its
value rather than its weight. It was adorned with precious stones.

<span id="001">**Malchiah**</span> Jehovah's king. (1.) The head of the
fifth division of the priests in the time of David ([Ch1
24:9](../kjv/ch1024.htm#009)). (2..md) A priest, the father of Pashur ([Ch1
9:12](../kjv/ch1009.htm#012); [Jer 38:1](../kjv/jer038.htm#001)). (3..md)
One of the priests appointed as musicians to celebrate the completion of
the walls of Jerusalem ([Neh 12:42](../kjv/neh012.htm#042)). (4..md) A
priest who stood by Ezra when he "read in the book of the law of God"
([Neh 8:4](../kjv/neh008.htm#004)). (5..md) [Neh
3:11](../kjv/neh003.htm#011). (6.) [Neh 3:31](../kjv/neh003.htm#031.md).
(7.) [Neh 3:14](../kjv/neh003.htm#014.md).

<span id="002">**Malchi-shua**</span> King of help, one of the four sons
of Saul ([Ch1 8:33](../kjv/ch1008.htm#033).md). He perished along with his
father in the battle of Gilboa ([Sa1 31:2](../kjv/sa1031.htm#002).md).

<span id="003">**Malchus**</span> Reigning, the personal servant or
slave of the high priest Caiaphas. He is mentioned only by John. Peter
cut off his right ear in the garden of Gethsemane ([Joh
18:10](../kjv/joh018.htm#010).md). But our Lord cured it with a touch ([Mat
26:51](../kjv/mat026.htm#051); [Mar 14:47](../kjv/mar014.htm#047.md); [Luk
22:51](../kjv/luk022.htm#051).md). This was the last miracle of bodily cure
wrought by our Lord. It is not mentioned by John.

<span id="004">**Mallothi**</span> My fulness, a Kohathite Levite, one
of the sons of Heman the Levite ([Ch1 25:4](../kjv/ch1025.htm#004).md), and
chief of the nineteenth division of the temple musicians ([Ch1
25:26](../kjv/ch1025.htm#026).md).

<span id="005">**Mallows**</span> Occurs only in [Job
30:4](../kjv/job030.htm#004) (R.V., "saltwort".md). The word so rendered
(malluah, from melah, "salt") most probably denotes the Atriplex halimus
of Linnaeus, a species of sea purslane found on the shores of the Dead
Sea, as also of the Mediterranean, and in salt marshes. It is a tall
shrubby orach, growing to the height sometimes of 10 feet. Its buds and
leaves, with those of other saline plants, are eaten by the poor in
Palestine.

<span id="006">**Malluch**</span> Reigned over, or reigning. (1.) A
Levite of the family of Merari ([Ch1 6:44](../kjv/ch1006.htm#044)). (2..md)
A priest who returned from Babylon ([Neh 12:2](../kjv/neh012.htm#002).md).
(3.) [Ezr 10:29](../kjv/ezr010.htm#029). (4..md) [Ezr
10:32](../kjv/ezr010.htm#032.md)

<span id="007">**Mammon**</span> A Chaldee or Syriac word meaning
"wealth" or "riches" ([Luk 16:9](../kjv/luk016.htm#009).md); also, by
personification, the god of riches ([Mat 6:24](../kjv/mat006.htm#024.md);
[Luk 16:9](../kjv/luk016.htm#009).md).

<span id="008">**Mamre**</span> Manliness. (1.) An Amoritish chief in
alliance with Abraham ([Gen 14:13](../kjv/gen014.htm#013.md), [Gen
14:24](../kjv/gen014.htm#024)). (2..md) The name of the place in the
neighbourhood of Hebron (q.v.) where Abraham dwelt ([Gen
23:17](../kjv/gen023.htm#017), [Gen 23:19](../kjv/gen023.htm#019.md); [Gen
35:27](../kjv/gen035.htm#027).md); called also in Authorized Version ([Gen
13:18](../kjv/gen013.htm#018).md) the "plain of Mamre," but in Revised
Version more correctly "the oaks \[marg., 'terebinths'\] of Mamre." The
name probably denotes the "oak grove" or the "wood of Mamre," thus
designated after Abraham's ally. This "grove" must have been within
sight of or "facing" Machpelah (q.v.). The site of Mamre has been
identified with Ballatet Selta, i.e., "the oak of rest", where there is
a tree called "Abraham's oak, about a mile and a half west of Hebron.
Others identify it with er-Rameh, 2 miles north of Hebron.

<span id="009">**Man**</span> (1.) Heb. 'Adam , used as the proper name
of the first man. The name is derived from a word meaning "to be red,"
and thus the first man was called Adam because he was formed from the
red earth. It is also the generic name of the human race ([Gen
1:26](../kjv/gen001.htm#026), [Gen 1:27](../kjv/gen001.htm#027.md); [Gen
5:2](../kjv/gen005.htm#002); [Gen 8:21](../kjv/gen008.htm#021.md); [Deu
8:3](../kjv/deu008.htm#003).md). Its equivalents are the Latin homo and the
Greek anthropos ([Mat 5:13](../kjv/mat005.htm#013.md), [Mat
5:16](../kjv/mat005.htm#016).md). It denotes also man in opposition to
woman ([Gen 3:12](../kjv/gen003.htm#012.md); [Mat
19:10](../kjv/mat019.htm#010)). (2..md) Heb. 'ish , like the Latin vir and
Greek aner , denotes properly a man in opposition to a woman ([Sa1
17:33](../kjv/sa1017.htm#033); [Mat 14:21](../kjv/mat014.htm#021).md); a
husband ([Gen 3:16](../kjv/gen003.htm#016.md); [Hos
2:16](../kjv/hos002.htm#016).md); man with reference to excellent mental
qualities. (3.) Heb. 'enosh , man as mortal, transient, perishable ([Ch2
14:11](../kjv/ch2014.htm#011); [Isa 8:1](../kjv/isa008.htm#001.md); [Job
15:14](../kjv/job015.htm#014); [Psa 8:4](../kjv/psa008.htm#004.md); [Psa
9:19](../kjv/psa009.htm#019), [Psa 9:20](../kjv/psa009.htm#020.md); [Psa
103:15](../kjv/psa103.htm#015).md). It is applied to women ([Jos
8:25](../kjv/jos008.htm#025)). (4..md) Heb. geber , man with reference to
his strength, as distinguished from women ([Deu
22:5](../kjv/deu022.htm#005).md) and from children ([Exo
12:37](../kjv/exo012.htm#037).md); a husband ([Pro
6:34](../kjv/pro006.htm#034)). (5..md) Heb. methim , men as mortal ([Isa
41:14](../kjv/isa041.htm#014).md), and as opposed to women and children
([Deu 3:6](../kjv/deu003.htm#006); [Job 11:3](../kjv/job011.htm#003.md);
[Isa 3:25](../kjv/isa003.htm#025).md). Man was created by the immediate
hand of God, and is generically different from all other creatures ([Gen
1:26](../kjv/gen001.htm#026), [Gen 1:27](../kjv/gen001.htm#027.md); [Gen
2:7](../kjv/gen002.htm#007).md). His complex nature is composed of two
elements, two distinct substances, viz., body and soul ([Gen
2:7](../kjv/gen002.htm#007); [Ecc 12:7](../kjv/ecc012.htm#007.md); [Co2
5:1](../kjv/co2005.htm#001).md). The words translated "spirit" and "soul,"
in [Th1 5:23](../kjv/th1005.htm#023), [Heb 4:12](../kjv/heb004.htm#012.md),
are habitually used interchangeably ([Mat 10:28](../kjv/mat010.htm#028.md);
[Mat 16:26](../kjv/mat016.htm#026); [Pe1 1:22](../kjv/pe1001.htm#022).md).
The "spirit" (Gr. pneuma ) is the soul as rational; the "soul" (Gr.
psuche ) is the same, considered as the animating and vital principle of
the body. Man was created in the likeness of God as to the perfection of
his nature, in knowledge ([Col 3:10](../kjv/col003.htm#010).md),
righteousness, and holiness ([Eph 4:24](../kjv/eph004.htm#024).md), and as
having dominion over all the inferior creatures ([Gen
1:28](../kjv/gen001.htm#028).md). He had in his original state God's law
written on his heart, and had power to obey it, and yet was capable of
disobeying, being left to the freedom of his own will. He was created
with holy dispositions, prompting him to holy actions; but he was
fallible, and did fall from his integrity ([Gen
3:1](../kjv/gen003.htm#001)). (See FALL..md)
