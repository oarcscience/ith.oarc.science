<span id="000">**Ashes**</span> The ashes of a red heifer burned entire
([Num 19:5](../kjv/num019.htm#005).md) when sprinkled on the unclean made
them ceremonially clean ([Heb 9:13](../kjv/heb009.htm#013).md). To cover
the head with ashes was a token of self-abhorrence and humiliation ([Sa2
13:19](../kjv/sa2013.htm#019); [Est 4:3](../kjv/est004.htm#003.md); [Jer
6:26](../kjv/jer006.htm#026), etc..md). To feed on ashes ([Isa
44:20](../kjv/isa044.htm#020).md), means to seek that which will prove to
be vain and unsatisfactory, and hence it denotes the unsatisfactory
nature of idol-worship. (Compare [Hos 12:1](../kjv/hos012.htm#001).md).

<span id="001">**Ashkelon**</span> =Askelon = Ascalon was one of the
five cities of the Philistines ([Jos 13:3](../kjv/jos013.htm#003.md); [Sa1
6:17](../kjv/sa1006.htm#017).md). It stood on the shore of the
Mediterranean, 12 miles north of Gaza. It is mentioned on an inscription
at Karnak in Egypt as having been taken by king Rameses II., the
oppressor of the Hebrews. In the time of the judges ([Jdg
1:18](../kjv/jdg001.htm#018).md) it fell into the possession of the tribe
of Judah; but it was soon after retaken by the Philistines ([Sa2
1:20](../kjv/sa2001.htm#020).md), who were not finally dispossessed till
the time of Alexander the Great. Samson went down to this place from
Timnath, and slew thirty men and took their spoil. The prophets foretold
its destruction ([Jer 25:20](../kjv/jer025.htm#020.md); [Jer
47:5](../kjv/jer047.htm#005), [Jer 47:7](../kjv/jer047.htm#007).md). It
became a noted place in the Middle Ages, having been the scene of many a
bloody battle between the Saracens and the Crusaders. It was besieged
and taken by Richard the Lion-hearted, and "within its walls and towers
now standing he held his court." Among the Tell Amarna tablets (see
EGYPT) are found letters or official dispatches from Yadaya, "captain of
horse and dust of the king's feet," to the "great king" of Egypt, dated
from Ascalon. It is now called 'Askalan'.

<span id="002">**Ashkenaz**</span> One of the three sons of Gomer ([Gen
10:3](../kjv/gen010.htm#003).md), and founder of one of the tribes of the
Japhetic race. They are mentioned in connection with Minni and Ararat,
and hence their original seat must have been in Armenia ([Jer
51:27](../kjv/jer051.htm#027).md), probably near the Black Sea, which, from
their founder, was first called Axenus, and afterwards the Euxine.

<span id="003">**Ashpenaz**</span> The master of the eunuchs of
Nebuchadnezzar ([Dan 1:3](../kjv/dan001.htm#003).md), the "Rabsaris" of the
court. His position was similar to that of the Kislar-aga of the modern
Turkish sultans.

<span id="004">**Ashtaroth**</span> A city of Bashan, in the kingdom of
Og ([Deu 1:4](../kjv/deu001.htm#004); [Jos 12:4](../kjv/jos012.htm#004.md);
[Jos 13:12](../kjv/jos013.htm#012); [Jos 9:10](../kjv/jos009.htm#010).md).
It was in the half-tribe of Manasseh ([Jos
13:12](../kjv/jos013.htm#012).md), and as a Levitical city was given to the
Gershonites ([Ch1 6:71](../kjv/ch1006.htm#071).md). Uzzia, one of David's
valiant men ([Ch1 11:44](../kjv/ch1011.htm#044).md), is named as of this
city. It is identified with Tell Ashterah, in the Hauran, and is noticed
on monuments 1700-1500 B.C.. The name Beesh-terah ([Jos
21:27](../kjv/jos021.htm#027).md) is a contraction for Beth-eshterah, i.e.,
"the house of Ashtaroth."

<span id="005">**Ashteroth Karnaim**</span> Ashteroth of the two horns,
the abode of the Rephaim ([Gen 14:5](../kjv/gen014.htm#005).md). It may be
identified with Ashtaroth preceding; called "Karnaim", i.e., the
"two-horned" (the crescent moon). The Samaritan version renders the word
by "Sunamein," the present es-Sunamein, 28 miles south of Damascus.

<span id="006">**Ashtoreth**</span> The moon goddess of the Phoenicians,
representing the passive principle in nature, their principal female
deity; frequently associated with the name of Baal, the sun-god, their
chief male deity ([Jdg 10:6](../kjv/jdg010.htm#006.md); [Sa1
7:4](../kjv/sa1007.htm#004); [Sa1 12:10](../kjv/sa1012.htm#010).md). These
names often occur in the plural (Ashtaroth, Baalim), probably as
indicating either different statues or different modifications of the
deities. This deity is spoken of as Ashtoreth of the Zidonians. She was
the Ishtar of the Accadians and the Astarte of the Greeks ([Jer
44:17](../kjv/jer044.htm#017); [Kg1 11:5](../kjv/kg1011.htm#005.md), [Kg1
11:33](../kjv/kg1011.htm#033); [Kg2 23:13](../kjv/kg2023.htm#013).md).
There was a temple of this goddess among the Philistines in the time of
Saul ([Sa1 31:10](../kjv/sa1031.htm#010).md). Under the name of Ishtar, she
was one of the great deities of the Assyrians. The Phoenicians called
her Astarte. Solomon introduced the worship of this idol ([Kg1
11:33](../kjv/kg1011.htm#033).md). Jezebel's 400 priests were probably
employed in its service ([Kg1 18:19](../kjv/kg1018.htm#019).md). It was
called the "queen of heaven" ([Jer 44:25](../kjv/jer044.htm#025).md).

<span id="007">**Ashurites**</span> Mentioned among those over whom
Ish-bosheth was made king ([Sa2 2:9](../kjv/sa2002.htm#009).md).

<span id="008">**Asia**</span> Is used to denote Proconsular Asia, a
Roman province which embraced the western parts of Asia Minor, and of
which Ephesus was the capital, in [Act 2:9](../kjv/act002.htm#009.md); [Act
6:9](../kjv/act006.htm#009); [Act 16:6](../kjv/act016.htm#006.md); [Act
19:10](../kjv/act019.htm#010), [Act 19:22](../kjv/act019.htm#022.md); [Act
20:4](../kjv/act020.htm#004), [Act 20:16](../kjv/act020.htm#016.md), [Act
20:18](../kjv/act020.htm#018.md), etc., and probably Asia Minor in [Act
19:26](../kjv/act019.htm#026), [Act 19:27](../kjv/act019.htm#027.md); [Act
21:27](../kjv/act021.htm#027); [Act 24:18](../kjv/act024.htm#018.md); [Act
27:2](../kjv/act027.htm#002.md). See map, Proconsular Asia and the Seven
Churches Proconsular Asia contained the seven churches of the Apocalypse
([Rev 1:11](../kjv/rev001.htm#011).md). The "chiefs of Asia" ([Act
19:31](../kjv/act019.htm#031).md) were certain wealthy citizens who were
annually elected to preside over the games and religious festivals of
the several cities to which they belonged. Some of these "Asiarchs" were
Paul's friends.

<span id="009">**Asnapper**</span> Probably the same as Assurbani-pal
(Sardanapalos of the Greeks), styled the "great and noble" ([Ezr
4:10](../kjv/ezr004.htm#010)), was the son and successor (668 B.C..md) of
Esar-haddon (q.v.). He was "luxurious, ambitious, and cruel, but a
magnificent patron of literature." He formed at Nineveh a library of
clay tablets, numbering about 10,000. These are now mostly in the
British Museum. They throw much light on the history and antiquities of
Assyria. Assur-bani-pal was a munificent patron of literature, and the
conqueror of Elam. Towards the middle of his reign his empire was shaken
by a great rebellion headed by his brother in Babylon. The rebellion was
finally put down, but Egypt was lost, and the military power of Assyria
was so exhausted that it could with difficulty resist the hordes of
Kimmerians who poured over Western Asia. (See NINEVEH.)
