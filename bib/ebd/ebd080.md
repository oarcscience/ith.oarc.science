<span id="000">**Chezib**</span> Deceitful, a town where Shelah, the son
of Judah, was born ([Gen 38:5](../kjv/gen038.htm#005)). Probably the
same as Achzib (q.v.).

<span id="001">**Chidon**</span> Dart, the name of the threshing-floor
at which the death of Uzzah took place ([Ch1
13:9](../kjv/ch1013.htm#009)). In the parallel passage in Samuel ([Sa2
6:6](../kjv/sa2006.htm#006)) it is called "Nachon's threshing-floor." It
was a place not far north-west from Jerusalem.

<span id="002">**Chiefs of Asia**</span> Asiarchs," the title given to
certain wealthy persons annually appointed to preside over the religious
festivals and games in the various cities of proconsular Asia ([Act
19:31](../kjv/act019.htm#031)). Some of these officials appear to have
been Paul's friends.

<span id="003">**Chief of the Three**</span> A title given to Adino the
Eznite, one of David's greatest heroes ([Sa2
23:8](../kjv/sa2023.htm#008)); also called Jashobeam ([Ch1
11:11](../kjv/ch1011.htm#011)).

<span id="004">**Chief Priest**</span> See PRIEST.

<span id="005">**Child**</span> This word has considerable latitude of
meaning in Scripture. Thus Joseph is called a child at the time when he
was probably about sixteen years of age ([Gen
37:3](../kjv/gen037.htm#003)); and Benjamin is so called when he was
above thirty years ([Gen 44:20](../kjv/gen044.htm#020)). Solomon called
himself a little child when he came to the kingdom ([Kg1
3:7](../kjv/kg1003.htm#007)). The descendants of a man, however remote,
are called his children; as, "the children of Edom," "the children of
Moab," "the children of Israel." In the earliest times mothers did not
wean their children till they were from thirty months to three years
old; and the day on which they were weaned was kept as a festival day
([Gen 21:8](../kjv/gen021.htm#008); [Exo 2:7](../kjv/exo002.htm#007),
[Exo 2:9](../kjv/exo002.htm#009); [Sa1 1:22](../kjv/sa1001.htm#022);
[Mat 21:16](../kjv/mat021.htm#016)). At the age of five, children began
to learn the arts and duties of life under the care of their fathers
([Deu 6:20](../kjv/deu006.htm#020); [Deu 11:19](../kjv/deu011.htm#019)).
To have a numerous family was regarded as a mark of divine favour ([Gen
11:30](../kjv/gen011.htm#030); [Gen 30:1](../kjv/gen030.htm#001); [Sa1
2:5](../kjv/sa1002.htm#005); [Sa2 6:23](../kjv/sa2006.htm#023); [Psa
127:3](../kjv/psa127.htm#003); [Psa 128:3](../kjv/psa128.htm#003)).
Figuratively the name is used for those who are ignorant or
narrow-minded ([Mat 11:16](../kjv/mat011.htm#016); [Luk
7:32](../kjv/luk007.htm#032); [Co1 13:11](../kjv/co1013.htm#011)). "When
I was a child, I spake as a child." "Brethren, be not children in
understanding" ([Co1 14:20](../kjv/co1014.htm#020)). "That we henceforth
be no more children, tossed to and fro" ([Eph
4:14](../kjv/eph004.htm#014)). Children are also spoken of as
representing simplicity and humility ([Mat
19:13](../kjv/mat019.htm#013); [Mar 10:13](../kjv/mar010.htm#013); [Luk
18:15](../kjv/luk018.htm#015)). Believers are "children of light" ([Luk
16:8](../kjv/luk016.htm#008); [Th1 5:5](../kjv/th1005.htm#005)) and
"children of obedience" ([Pe1 1:14](../kjv/pe1001.htm#014)).

<span id="006">**Chileab**</span> Protected by the father, David's
second son by Abigail ([Sa2 3:3](../kjv/sa2003.htm#003)); called also
Daniel ([Ch1 3:1](../kjv/ch1003.htm#001)). He seems to have died when
young.

<span id="007">**Chilion**</span> The pining one, the younger son of
Elimelech and Naomi, and husband of Orpah, Ruth's sister ([Rut
1:2](../kjv/rut001.htm#002); [Rut 4:9](../kjv/rut004.htm#009)).

<span id="008">**Chilmad**</span> A place or country unknown which,
along with Sheba and Asshur, traded with Tyre ([Eze
27:23](../kjv/eze027.htm#023)).

<span id="009">**Chimham**</span> Pining, probably the youngest son of
Barzillai the Gileadite ([Sa2 19:37](../kjv/sa2019.htm#037)). The
"habitation of Chimham" ([Jer 41:17](../kjv/jer041.htm#017)) was
probably an inn or khan, which is the proper meaning of the Hebrew
geruth, rendered "habitation", established in later times in his
possession at Bethlehem, which David gave to him as a reward for his
loyalty in accompanying him to Jerusalem after the defeat of Absalom
([Kg1 2:7](../kjv/kg1002.htm#007)). It has been supposed that,
considering the stationary character of Eastern institutions, it was in
the stable of this inn or caravanserai that our Saviour was born ([Luk
2:7](../kjv/luk002.htm#007)).
