<span id="000">**Charmer**</span> One who practises serpent-charming
([Psa 58:5](../kjv/psa058.htm#005); [Jer 8:17](../kjv/jer008.htm#017);
[Ecc 10:11](../kjv/ecc010.htm#011)). It was an early and universal
opinion that the most venomous reptiles could be made harmless by
certain charms or by sweet sounds. It is well known that there are
jugglers in India and in other Eastern lands who practise this art at
the present day. In [Isa 19:3](../kjv/isa019.htm#003) the word
"charmers" is the rendering of the Hebrew 'ittim , meaning, properly,
necromancers (R.V. marg., "whisperers"). In [Deu
18:11](../kjv/deu018.htm#011) the word "charmer" means a dealer in
spells, especially one who, by binding certain knots, was supposed
thereby to bind a curse or a blessing on its object. In [Isa
3:3](../kjv/isa003.htm#003) the words "eloquent orator" should be, as in
the Revised Version, "skilful enchanter."

<span id="001">**Charran**</span> Another form ([Act
7:2](../kjv/act007.htm#002), [Act 7:4](../kjv/act007.htm#004)) of Haran
(q.v.).

<span id="002">**Chebar**</span> Length, a river in the "land of the
Chaldeans" ([Eze 1:3](../kjv/eze001.htm#003)), on the banks of which
were located some of the Jews of the Captivity ([Eze
1:1](../kjv/eze001.htm#001); [Eze 3:15](../kjv/eze003.htm#015), [Eze
3:23](../kjv/eze003.htm#023); [Eze 10:15](../kjv/eze010.htm#015), [Eze
10:20](../kjv/eze010.htm#020), [Eze 10:22](../kjv/eze010.htm#022)). It
has been supposed to be identical with the river Habor, the Chaboras, or
modern Khabour, which falls into the Euphrates at Circesium. To the
banks of this river some of the Israelites were removed by the Assyrians
([Kg2 17:6](../kjv/kg2017.htm#006)). An opinion that has much to support
it is that the "Chebar" was the royal canal of Nebuchadnezzar, the Nahr
Malcha, the greatest in Mesopotamia, which connected the Tigris with the
Euphrates, in the excavation of which the Jewish captives were probably
employed.

<span id="003">**Chedorlaomer**</span> (= Khudur-Lagamar of the
inscriptions), king of Elam. Many centuries before the age of Abraham,
Canaan and even the Sinaitic peninsula had been conquered by Babylonian
kings, and in the time of Abraham himself Babylonia was ruled by a
dynasty which claimed sovereignity over Syria and Palestine. The kings
of the dynasty bore names which were not Babylonian, but at once South
Arabic and Hebrew. The most famous king of the dynasty was Khammu-rabi,
who united Babylonia under one rule, and made Babylon its capital. When
he ascended the throne, the country was under the suzerainty of the
Elamites, and was divided into two kingdoms, that of Babylon (the
Biblical Shinar) and that of Larsa (the Biblical Ellasar). The king of
Larsa was Eri-Aku ("the servant of the moongod"), the son of an Elamite
prince, KudurMabug, who is entitled "the father of the land of the
Amorites." A recently discovered tablet enumerates among the enemies of
Khammu-rabi, Kudur-Lagamar ("the servant of the goddess Lagamar") or
Chedorlaomer, Eri-Aku or Arioch, and Tudkhula or Tidal. Khammu-rabi,
whose name is also read Ammi-rapaltu or Amraphel by some scholars,
succeeded in overcoming Eri-Aku and driving the Elamites out of
Babylonia. Assur-bani-pal, the last of the Assyrian conquerors, mentions
in two inscriptions that he took Susa 1635 years after Kedor-nakhunta,
king of Elam, had conquered Babylonia. It was in the year 660 B.C. that
Assur-bani-pal took Susa.

<span id="004">**Cheek**</span> Smiting on the cheek was accounted a
grievous injury and insult ([Job 16:10](../kjv/job016.htm#010); [Lam
3:30](../kjv/lam003.htm#030); [Mic 5:1](../kjv/mic005.htm#001)). The
admonition ([Luk 6:29](../kjv/luk006.htm#029)), "Unto him that smiteth
thee on the one cheek offer also the other," means simply, "Resist not
evil" ([Mat 5:39](../kjv/mat005.htm#039); [Pe1
2:19](../kjv/pe1002.htm#019)). [Psa 3:7](../kjv/psa003.htm#007) = that
God had deprived his enemies of the power of doing him injury.

<span id="005">**Cheese**</span> (A.S. cese). This word occurs three
times in the Authorized Version as the translation of three different
Hebrew words: (1.) [Sa1 17:18](../kjv/sa1017.htm#018), "ten cheeses;"
i.e., ten sections of curd. (2.) [Sa2 17:29](../kjv/sa2017.htm#029),
"cheese of kine" = perhaps curdled milk of kine. The Vulgate version
reads "fat calves." [Job 10:10](../kjv/job010.htm#010), curdled milk is
meant by the word. cese). This word occurs three times in the Authorized
Version as the translation of three different Hebrew words: (a.) [Sa1
17:18](../kjv/sa1017.htm#018), "ten cheeses;" i.e., ten sections of
curd. (b.) [Sa2 17:29](../kjv/sa2017.htm#029), "cheese of kine" =
perhaps curdled milk of kine. The Vulgate version reads "fat calves."
(c.) [Job 10:10](../kjv/job010.htm#010), curdled milk is meant by the
word.

<span id="006">**Chemarim**</span> Black, ([Zep
1:4](../kjv/zep001.htm#004); rendered "idolatrous priests" in [Kg2
23:5](../kjv/kg2023.htm#005), and "priests" in [Hos
10:5](../kjv/hos010.htm#005)). Some derive this word from the Assyrian
Kamaru, meaning "to throw down," and interpret it as describing the
idolatrous priests who prostrate themselves before the idols. Others
regard it as meaning "those who go about in black." or "ascetics."

<span id="007">**Chemosh**</span> The destroyer, subduer, or fishgod,
the god of the Moabites ([Num 21:29](../kjv/num021.htm#029); [Jer
48:7](../kjv/jer048.htm#007), [Jer 48:13](../kjv/jer048.htm#013), [Jer
48:46](../kjv/jer048.htm#046)). The worship of this god, "the
abomination of Moab," was introduced at Jerusalem by Solomon ([Kg1
11:7](../kjv/kg1011.htm#007)), but was abolished by Josiah ([Kg2
23:13](../kjv/kg2023.htm#013)). On the "Moabite Stone" (q.v.), Mesha
([Kg2 3:5](../kjv/kg2003.htm#005)) ascribes his victories over the king
of Israel to this god, "And Chemosh drove him before my sight."

<span id="008">**Chenaanah**</span> Merchant. (1.) A Benjamite ([Ch1
7:10](../kjv/ch1007.htm#010)). (2.) The father of Zedekiah ([Kg1
22:11](../kjv/kg1022.htm#011), [Kg1 22:24](../kjv/kg1022.htm#024)).

<span id="009">**Chenaiah**</span> Whom Jehovah hath made, "chief of the
Levites," probably a Kohathite ([Ch1 15:22](../kjv/ch1015.htm#022)), and
therefore not the same as mentioned in [Ch1
26:29](../kjv/ch1026.htm#029).
