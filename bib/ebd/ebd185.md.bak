------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Hurai**</span> Linen-worker, one of David's heroes, a
native of the valley of Mount Gaash ([Ch1
11:32](../kjv/ch1011.htm#032).md).

<span id="001">**Husband**</span> I.e., the "house-band," connecting and
keeping together the whole family. A man when betrothed was esteemed
from that time a husband ([Mat 1:16](../kjv/mat001.htm#016.md), [Mat
1:20](../kjv/mat001.htm#020); [Luk 2:5](../kjv/luk002.htm#005).md). A
recently married man was exempt from going to war for "one year" ([Deu
20:7](../kjv/deu020.htm#007); [Deu 24:5](../kjv/deu024.htm#005).md).

<span id="002">**Husbandman**</span> One whose business it is to
cultivate the ground. It was one of the first occupations, and was
esteemed most honourable ([Gen 9:20](../kjv/gen009.htm#020.md); [Gen
26:12](../kjv/gen026.htm#012), [Gen 26:14](../kjv/gen026.htm#014.md); [Gen
37:7](../kjv/gen037.htm#007), etc..md). All the Hebrews, except those
engaged in religious services, were husbandman. (See AGRICULTURE.)

<span id="003">**Hushai**</span> Quick, "the Archite," "the king's
friend" ([Ch1 27:33](../kjv/ch1027.htm#033).md). When David fled from
Jerusalem, on account of the rebellion of Absalom, and had reached the
summit of Olivet, he there met Hushai, whom he sent back to Jerusalem
for the purpose of counteracting the influence of Ahithophel, who had
joined the ranks of Absalom ([Sa2 15:32](../kjv/sa2015.htm#032.md), [Sa2
15:37](../kjv/sa2015.htm#037); [Sa2 16:16](../kjv/sa2016.htm#016).md). It
was by his advice that Absalom refrained from immediately pursuing after
David. By this delay the cause of Absalom was ruined, for it gave David
time to muster his forces.

<span id="004">**Husk**</span> In [Num 6:4](../kjv/num006.htm#004.md) (Heb.
zag ) it means the "skin" of a grape. In [Kg2
4:42](../kjv/kg2004.htm#042) (Heb. tsiqlon .md) it means a "sack" for
grain, as rendered in the Revised Version. In [Luk
15:16](../kjv/luk015.htm#016.md), in the parable of the Prodigal Son, it
designates the beans of the carob tree, or Ceratonia siliqua. From the
supposition, mistaken, however, that it was on the husks of this tree
that John the Baptist fed, it is called "St. John's bread" and "locust
tree." This tree is in "February covered with innumerable purple-red
pendent blossoms, which ripen in April and May into large crops of pods
from 6 to 10 inches long, flat, brown, narrow, and bent like a horn
(whence the Greek name keratia , meaning 'little horns'), with a
sweetish taste when still unripe. Enormous quantities of these are
gathered for sale in various towns and for exportation." "They were
eaten as food, though only by the poorest of the poor, in the time of
our Lord." The bean is called a "gerah," which is used as the name of
the smallest Hebrew weight, twenty of these making a shekel.

<span id="005">**Hymn**</span> Occurs only [Eph
5:19](../kjv/eph005.htm#019) and [Col 3:16](../kjv/col003.htm#016.md). The
verb to "sing an hymn" occurs [Mat 26:30](../kjv/mat026.htm#030.md) and
[Mar 14:26](../kjv/mar014.htm#026.md). The same Greek word is rendered to
"sing praises" [Act 16:25](../kjv/act016.htm#025) (R.V., "sing hymns".md)
and [Heb 2:12](../kjv/heb002.htm#012.md). The "hymn" which our Lord sang
with his disciples at the last Supper is generally supposed to have been
the latter part of the Hallel, comprehending Ps. 113-118. It was thus a
name given to a number of psalms taken together and forming a devotional
exercise. The noun hymn is used only with reference to the services of
the Greeks, and was distinguished from the psalm. The Greek tunes
required Greek hymns. Our information regarding the hymnology of the
early Christians is very limited.

<span id="006">**Hypocrite**</span> One who puts on a mask and feigns
himself to be what he is not; a dissembler in religion. Our Lord
severely rebuked the scribes and Pharisees for their hypocrisy ([Mat
6:2](../kjv/mat006.htm#002), [Mat 6:5](../kjv/mat006.htm#005.md), [Mat
6:16](../kjv/mat006.htm#016).md). "The hypocrite's hope shall perish" ([Job
8:13](../kjv/job008.htm#013).md). The Hebrew word here rendered "hypocrite"
rather means the "godless" or "profane," as it is rendered in [Jer
23:11](../kjv/jer023.htm#011.md), i.e., polluted with crimes.

<span id="007">**Hyssop**</span> (Heb. 'ezob ; LXX. hyssopos), first
mentioned in [Exo 12:22](../kjv/exo012.htm#022.md) in connection with the
institution of the Passover. We find it afterwards mentioned in [Lev
14:4](../kjv/lev014.htm#004), [Lev 14:6](../kjv/lev014.htm#006.md), [Lev
14:52](../kjv/lev014.htm#052); [Num 19:6](../kjv/num019.htm#006.md), [Num
19:18](../kjv/num019.htm#018); [Heb 9:19](../kjv/heb009.htm#019.md). It is
spoken of as a plant "springing out of the wall" ([Kg1
4:33](../kjv/kg1004.htm#033).md). Many conjectures have been formed as to
what this plant really was. Some contend that it was a species of
marjoram (origanum), six species of which are found in Palestine. Others
with more probability think that it was the caper plant, the Capparis
spinosa of Linnaeus. This plant grew in Egypt, in the desert of Sinai,
and in Palestine. It was capable of producing a stem three or four feet
in length ([Mat 27:48](../kjv/mat027.htm#048.md); [Mar
15:36](../kjv/mar015.htm#036.md). Compare [Joh
19:29](../kjv/joh019.htm#029).md).

<span id="008">**Ibhar**</span> Chosen, one of David's sons ([Ch1
3:6](../kjv/ch1003.htm#006); [Sa2 5:15](../kjv/sa2005.htm#015).md).

<span id="009">**Ibleam**</span> People-waster, a city assigned to
Manasseh ([Jos 17:11](../kjv/jos017.htm#011).md), from which the
Israelites, however, could not expel the Canaanites ([Jdg
1:27](../kjv/jdg001.htm#027).md). It is also called Bileam ([Ch1
6:70](../kjv/ch1006.htm#070).md). It was probably the modern Jelamah, a
village 21/2 miles north of Jenin.
