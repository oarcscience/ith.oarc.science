<span id="000">**Adina**</span> Slender, one of David's warriors ([Ch1
11:42](../kjv/ch1011.htm#042).md), a Reubenite.

<span id="001">**Adino**</span> The Eznite, one of David's mighty men
([Sa2 23:8](../kjv/sa2023.htm#008)). (See JASHOBEAM..md)

<span id="002">**Adjuration**</span> A solemn appeal whereby one person
imposes on another the obligation of speaking or acting as if under an
oath ([Sa1 14:24](../kjv/sa1014.htm#024.md); [Jos
6:26](../kjv/jos006.htm#026); [Kg1 22:16](../kjv/kg1022.htm#016).md). We
have in the New Testament a striking example of this ([Mat
26:63](../kjv/mat026.htm#063); [Mar 5:7](../kjv/mar005.htm#007).md), where
the high priest calls upon Christ to avow his true character. It would
seem that in such a case the person so adjured could not refuse to give
an answer. The word "adjure", i.e., cause to swear is used with
reference to the casting out of demons ([Act
19:13](../kjv/act019.htm#013).md).

<span id="003">**Admah**</span> Earth, one of the five cities of the
vale of Siddim ([Gen 10:19](../kjv/gen010.htm#019).md). It was destroyed
along with Sodom and Gomorrah ([Gen 19:24](../kjv/gen019.htm#024.md); [Deu
29:23](../kjv/deu029.htm#023).md). It is supposed by some to be the same as
the Adam of [Jos 3:16](../kjv/jos003.htm#016.md), the name of which still
lingers in Damieh, the ford of Jordan. (See ZEBOIM.)

<span id="004">**Adnah**</span> Delight. (1.) A chief of the tribe of
Manasseh who joined David at Ziklag ([Ch1
12:20](../kjv/ch1012.htm#020)). (2..md) A general under Jehoshaphat, chief
over 300,000 men ([Ch2 17:14](../kjv/ch2017.htm#014).md).

<span id="005">**Adonibezek**</span> Lord of Bezek, a Canaanitish king
who, having subdued seventy of the chiefs that were around him, made an
attack against the armies of Judah and Simeon, but was defeated and
brought as a captive to Jerusalem, where his thumbs and great toes were
cut off. He confessed that God had requited him for his like cruelty to
the seventy kings whom he had subdued ([Jdg 1:4](../kjv/jdg001.htm#004.md);
compare [Sa1 15:33](../kjv/sa1015.htm#033).md).

<span id="006">**Adonijah**</span> My Lord is Jehovah. (1.) The fourth
son of David ([Sa2 3:4](../kjv/sa2003.htm#004).md). After the death of his
elder brothers, Amnon and Absalom, he became heir-apparent to the
throne. But Solomon, a younger brother, was preferred to him. Adonijah,
however, when his father was dying, caused himself to be proclaimed
king. But Nathan and Bathsheba induced David to give orders that Solomon
should at once be proclaimed and admitted to the throne. Adonijah fled
and took refuge at the altar, and received pardon for his conduct from
Solomon on the condition that he showed himself "a worthy man" (1 Kings
1:5-53). He afterwards made a second attempt to gain the throne, but was
seized and put to death ([Kg1 2:13](../kjv/kg1002.htm#013)). (2..md) A
Levite sent with the princes to teach the book of the law to the
inhabitants of Judah ([Ch2 17:8](../kjv/ch2017.htm#008)). (3..md) One of
the "chiefs of the people" after the Captivity ([Neh
10:16](../kjv/neh010.htm#016).md).

<span id="007">**Adonikam**</span> Whom the Lord sets up, one of those
"which came with Zerubbabel" ([Ezr 2:13](../kjv/ezr002.htm#013).md). His
"children," or retainers, to the number of 666, came up to Jerusalem
([Ezr 8:13](../kjv/ezr008.htm#013).md).

<span id="008">**Adoniram**</span> (Adoram [Kg1
12:18](../kjv/kg1012.htm#018).md), the son of Abda, was "over the tribute,"
i.e., the levy or forced labour. He was stoned to death by the people of
Israel ([Kg1 4:6](../kjv/kg1004.htm#006.md); [Kg1
5:14](../kjv/kg1005.htm#014).md)

<span id="009">**Adoni-zedec**</span> Lord of justice or righteousness
was king in Jerusalem at the time when the Israelites invaded Palestine
([Jos 10:1](../kjv/jos010.htm#001), [Jos 10:3](../kjv/jos010.htm#003).md).
He formed a confederacy with the other Canaanitish kings against the
Israelites, but was utterly routed by Joshua when he was engaged in
besieging the Gibeonites. The history of this victory and of the
treatment of the five confederated kings is recorded in Josh. 10:1-27.
(Compare [Deu 21:23](../kjv/deu021.htm#023).md). Among the Tell Amarna
tablets (see EGYPT) are some very interesting letters from Adoni-zedec
to the King of Egypt. These illustrate in a very remarkable manner the
history recorded in Josh. 10, and indeed throw light on the wars of
conquest generally, so that they may be read as a kind of commentary on
the book of Joshua. Here the conquering career of the Abiri (i.e.,
Hebrews) is graphically described: "Behold, I say that the land of the
king my lord is ruined"," The wars are mighty against me", "The Hebrew
chiefs plunder all the king's lands", "Behold, I the chief of the
Amorites am breaking to pieces." Then he implores the king of Egypt to
send soldiers to help him, directing that the army should come by sea to
Ascalon or Gaza, and thence march to Wru-sa-lin (Jerusalem) by the
valley of Elah.
