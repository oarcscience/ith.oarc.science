<span id="000">**Tema**</span> South; desert, one of the sons of
Ishmael, and father of a tribe so called ([Gen
25:15](../kjv/gen025.htm#015); [Ch1 1:30](../kjv/ch1001.htm#030.md); [Job
6:19](../kjv/job006.htm#019); [Isa 21:14](../kjv/isa021.htm#014.md); [Jer
25:23](../kjv/jer025.htm#023).md) which settled at a place to which he gave
his name, some 250 miles south-east of Edom, on the route between
Damascus and Mecca, in the northern part of the Arabian peninsula,
toward the Syrian desert; the modern Teyma.

<span id="001">**Teman**</span> Id. (1.) A grandson of Esau, one of the
"dukes of Edom" ([Gen 36:11](../kjv/gen036.htm#011.md), [Gen
36:15](../kjv/gen036.htm#015), [Gen 36:42](../kjv/gen036.htm#042)). (2..md)
A place in Southern Idumea, the land of "the sons of the east,"
frequently mentioned in the Old Testament. It was noted for the wisdom
of its inhabitants ([Amo 1:12](../kjv/amo001.htm#012.md); [Oba
1:8](../kjv/oba001.htm#008); [Jer 49:7](../kjv/jer049.htm#007.md); [Eze
25:13](../kjv/eze025.htm#013).md). It was divided from the hills of Paran
by the low plain of Arabah ([Hab 3:3](../kjv/hab003.htm#003).md).

<span id="002">**Temanite**</span> A man of Teman, the designation of
Eliphaz, one of Job's three friends ([Job 2:11](../kjv/job002.htm#011.md);
[Job 22:1](../kjv/job022.htm#001).md).

<span id="003">**Temeni**</span> One of the sons of Ashur, the father of
Tekoa ([Ch1 4:6](../kjv/ch1004.htm#006).md).

<span id="004">**Temple**</span> First used of the tabernacle, which is
called "the temple of the Lord" ([Sa1 1:9](../kjv/sa1001.htm#009).md). In
the New Testament the word is used figuratively of Christ's human body
([Joh 2:19](../kjv/joh002.htm#019), [Joh 2:21](../kjv/joh002.htm#021).md).
Believers are called "the temple of God" ([Co1
3:16](../kjv/co1003.htm#016), [Co1 3:17](../kjv/co1003.htm#017).md). The
Church is designated "an holy temple in the Lord" ([Eph
2:21](../kjv/eph002.htm#021).md). Heaven is also called a temple ([Rev
7:5](../kjv/rev007.htm#005).md). We read also of the heathen "temple of the
great goddess Diana" ([Act 19:27](../kjv/act019.htm#027).md). This word is
generally used in Scripture of the sacred house erected on the summit of
Mount Moriah for the worship of God. It is called "the temple" ([Kg1
6:17](../kjv/kg1006.htm#017).md); "the temple \[R.V., 'house'\] of the
Lord" ([Kg2 11:10](../kjv/kg2011.htm#010).md); "thy holy temple" ([Psa
79:1](../kjv/psa079.htm#001).md); "the house of the Lord" ([Ch2
23:5](../kjv/ch2023.htm#005), [Ch2 23:12](../kjv/ch2023.htm#012).md); "the
house of the God of Jacob" ([Isa 2:3](../kjv/isa002.htm#003).md); "the
house of my glory" ([Isa 60:7](../kjv/isa060.htm#007).md); an "house of
prayer" ([Isa 56:7](../kjv/isa056.htm#007.md); [Mat
21:13](../kjv/mat021.htm#013).md); "an house of sacrifice" ([Ch2
7:12](../kjv/ch2007.htm#012).md); "the house of their sanctuary" ([Ch2
36:17](../kjv/ch2036.htm#017).md); "the mountain of the Lord's house" ([Isa
2:2](../kjv/isa002.htm#002).md); "our holy and our beautiful house" ([Isa
64:11](../kjv/isa064.htm#011).md); "the holy mount" ([Isa
27:13](../kjv/isa027.htm#013).md); "the palace for the Lord God" ([Ch1
29:1](../kjv/ch1029.htm#001).md); "the tabernacle of witness" ([Ch2
24:6](../kjv/ch2024.htm#006).md); "Zion" ([Psa
74:2](../kjv/psa074.htm#002); [Psa 84:7](../kjv/psa084.htm#007).md). Christ
calls it "my Father's house" ([Joh 2:16](../kjv/joh002.htm#016).md).

<span id="005">**Temple, Solomon's**</span> Before his death David had
"with all his might" provided materials in great abundance for the
building of the temple on the summit of Mount Moriah ([Ch1
22:14](../kjv/ch1022.htm#014); [Ch1 29:4](../kjv/ch1029.htm#004.md); [Ch2
3:1](../kjv/ch2003.htm#001).md), on the east of the city, on the spot where
Abraham had offered up Isaac ([Gen 22:1](../kjv/gen022.htm#001).md). In the
beginning of his reign Solomon set about giving effect to the desire
that had been so earnestly cherished by his father, and prepared
additional materials for the building. From subterranean quarries at
Jerusalem he obtained huge blocks of stone for the foundations and walls
of the temple. These stones were prepared for their places in the
building under the eye of Tyrian master-builders. He also entered into a
compact with Hiram II., king of Tyre, for the supply of whatever else
was needed for the work, particularly timber from the forests of
Lebanon, which was brought in great rafts by the sea to Joppa, whence it
was dragged to Jerusalem (1 Kings 5). As the hill on which the temple
was to be built did not afford sufficient level space, a huge wall of
solid masonry of great height, in some places more than 200 feet high,
was raised across the south of the hill, and a similar wall on the
eastern side, and in the spaces between were erected many arches and
pillars, thus raising up the general surface to the required level.
Solomon also provided for a sufficient water supply for the temple by
hewing in the rocky hill vast cisterns, into which water was conveyed by
channels from the "pools" near Bethlehem. One of these cisterns, the
"great sea," was capable of containing three millions of gallons. The
overflow was led off by a conduit to the Kidron. In all these
preparatory undertakings a space of about three years was occupied; and
now the process of the erection of the great building began, under the
direction of skilled Phoenician builders and workmen, in the fourth year
of Solomon's reign, 480 years after the Exodus (1 Kings 6; 2 Chr. 3).
Many thousands of labourers and skilled artisans were employed in the
work. Stones prepared in the quarries underneath the city ([Kg1
5:17](../kjv/kg1005.htm#017), [Kg1 5:18](../kjv/kg1005.htm#018).md) of huge
dimension (see QUARRIES) were gradually placed on the massive walls, and
closely fitted together without any mortar between, till the whole
structure was completed. No sound of hammer or axe or any tool of iron
was heard as the structure arose ([Kg1 6:7](../kjv/kg1006.htm#007).md).
"Like some tall palm the noiseless fabric sprang." The building was 60
cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high. The engineers of the
Palestine Exploration Fund, in their explorations around the temple
area, discovered what is believed to have been the "chief corner stone"
of the temple, "the most interesting stone in the world." It lies at the
bottom of the south-eastern angle, and is 3 feet 8 inches high by 14
feet long. It rests on the solid rock at a depth of 79 feet 3 inches
below the present surface. (See PINNACLE.) In examining the walls the
engineers were "struck with admiration at the vastness of the blocks and
the general excellence of the workmanship." At length, in the autumn of
the eleventh year of his reign, seven and a half years after it had been
begun, the temple was completed in all its architectural magnificence
and beauty. For thirteen years there it stood, on the summit of Moriah,
silent and unused. The reasons for this strange delay in its
consecration are unknown. At the close of these thirteen years
preparations for the dedication of the temple were made on a scale of
the greatest magnificence. The ark was solemnly brought from the tent in
which David had deposited it to the place prepared for it in the temple,
and the glory-cloud, the symbol of the divine presence, filled the
house. Then Solomon ascended a platform which had been erected for him,
in the sight of all the people, and lifting up his hands to heaven
poured out his heart to God in prayer (1 Kings 8; 2 Chr. 6, 7). The
feast of dedication, which lasted seven days, followed by the feast of
tabernacles, marked a new era in the history of Israel. On the eighth
day of the feast of tabernacles, Solomon dismissed the vast assemblage
of the people, who returned to their homes filled with joy and gladness,
"Had Solomon done no other service beyond the building of the temple, he
would still have influenced the religious life of his people down to the
latest days. It was to them a perpetual reminder and visible symbol of
God's presence and protection, a strong bulwark of all the sacred
traditions of the law, a witness to duty, an impulse to historic study,
an inspiration of sacred song." The temple consisted of, (1.) The oracle
or most holy place ([Kg1 6:19](../kjv/kg1006.htm#019.md); [Kg1
8:6](../kjv/kg1008.htm#006).md), called also the "inner house" ([Kg1
6:27](../kjv/kg1006.htm#027).md), and the "holiest of all" ([Heb
9:3](../kjv/heb009.htm#003).md). It was 20 cubits in length, breadth, and
height. It was floored and wainscoted with cedar ([Kg1
6:16](../kjv/kg1006.htm#016).md), and its walls and floor were overlaid
with gold ([Kg1 6:20](../kjv/kg1006.htm#020.md), [Kg1
6:21](../kjv/kg1006.htm#021), [Kg1 6:30](../kjv/kg1006.htm#030).md). There
was a two-leafed door between it and the holy place overlaid with gold
([Ch2 4:22](../kjv/ch2004.htm#022).md); also a veil of blue purple and
crimson and fine linen ([Ch2 3:14](../kjv/ch2003.htm#014.md); compare [Exo
26:33](../kjv/exo026.htm#033).md). It had no windows ([Kg1
8:12](../kjv/kg1008.htm#012).md). It was indeed the dwelling-place of God.
(2.) The holy place (q.v.), [Kg1 8:8](../kjv/kg1008.htm#008.md), called
also the "greater house" ([Ch2 3:5](../kjv/ch2003.htm#005).md) and the
"temple" ([Kg1 6:17](../kjv/kg1006.htm#017)). (3..md) The porch or entrance
before the temple on the east ([Kg1 6:3](../kjv/kg1006.htm#003.md); [Ch2
3:4](../kjv/ch2003.htm#004); [Ch2 29:7](../kjv/ch2029.htm#007).md). In the
porch stood the two pillars Jachin and Boaz ([Kg1
7:21](../kjv/kg1007.htm#021); [Kg2 11:14](../kjv/kg2011.htm#014.md); [Kg2
23:3](../kjv/kg2023.htm#003)). (4..md) The chambers, which were built about
the temple on the southern, western, and northern sides ([Kg1
6:5](../kjv/kg1006.htm#005).md). These formed a part of the building. Round
about the building were, (a.) The court of the priests ([Ch2
4:9](../kjv/ch2004.htm#009).md), called the "inner court" ([Kg1
6:36](../kjv/kg1006.htm#036).md). It contained the altar of burnt-offering
([Ch2 15:8](../kjv/ch2015.htm#008).md), the brazen sea ([Ch2
4:2](../kjv/ch2004.htm#002), [Ch2 4:10](../kjv/ch2004.htm#010).md), and ten
lavers ([Kg1 7:38](../kjv/kg1007.htm#038.md), [Kg1
7:39](../kjv/kg1007.htm#039)). (b..md) The great court, which surrounded
the whole temple ([Ch2 4:9](../kjv/ch2004.htm#009).md). Here the people
assembled to worship God ([Jer 19:14](../kjv/jer019.htm#014.md); [Jer
26:2](../kjv/jer026.htm#002).md). This temple erected by Solomon was many
times pillaged during the course of its history, ([Kg1
14:25](../kjv/kg1014.htm#025), [Kg1 14:26](../kjv/kg1014.htm#026.md); [Kg2
14:14](../kjv/kg2014.htm#014); [Kg2 16:8](../kjv/kg2016.htm#008.md), [Kg2
16:17](../kjv/kg2016.htm#017), [Kg2 16:18](../kjv/kg2016.htm#018.md); [Kg2
18:15](../kjv/kg2018.htm#015), [Kg2 18:16](../kjv/kg2018.htm#016).md). At
last it was pillaged and destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar ([Kg2
24:13](../kjv/kg2024.htm#013); [Ch2 36:7](../kjv/ch2036.htm#007).md). He
burned the temple, and carried all its treasures with him to Babylon
([Kg2 25:9](../kjv/kg2025.htm#009); [Ch2 36:19](../kjv/ch2036.htm#019.md);
[Isa 64:11](../kjv/isa064.htm#011).md). These sacred vessels were at
length, at the close of the Captivity, restored to the Jews by Cyrus
([Ezr 1:7](../kjv/ezr001.htm#007).md).

<span id="006">**Temple, The Second**</span> After the return from
captivity, under Zerubbabel (q.v.) and the high priest Jeshua,
arrangements were almost immediately made to reorganize the
long-desolated kingdom. The body of pilgrims, forming a band of 42,360,
including children, having completed the long and dreary journey of some
four months, from the banks of the Euphrates to Jerusalem, were animated
in all their proceeding by a strong religious impulse, and therefore one
of their first cares was to restore their ancient worship by rebuilding
the temple. On the invitation of Zerubbabel, the governor, who showed
them a remarkable example of liberality by contributing personally 1,000
golden darics (probably about $6,000), besides other gifts, the people
with great enthusiasm poured their gifts into the sacred treasury (Ezra
2). First they erected and dedicated the altar of Jehovah on the exact
spot where it had formerly stood, and they then cleared away the charred
heaps of debris which occupied the site of the old temple; and in the
second month of the second year (535 B.C.), amid great public excitement
and rejoicing (Ps. 116; [Psa 117:1](../kjv/psa117.htm#001); 118.md), the
foundations of the second temple were laid. A wide interest was felt in
this great movement, although it was regarded with mingled feelings by
the spectators ([Hag 2:3](../kjv/hag002.htm#003.md); [Zac
4:10](../kjv/zac004.htm#010).md). The Samaritans made proposals for a
co-operation in the work. Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the elders, however,
declined all such cooperation: Judah must build the temple without help.
Immediately evil reports were spread regarding the Jews. The Samaritans
sought to "frustrate their purpose" ([Ezr 4:5](../kjv/ezr004.htm#005).md),
and sent messengers to Ecbatana and Susa, with the result that the work
was suspended. Seven years after this Cyrus died ingloriously, having
killed himself in Syria when on his way back from Egypt to the east, and
was succeeded by his son Cambyses (529-522 B.C.), on whose death the
"false Smerdis," an impostor, occupied the throne for some seven or
eight months, and then Darius Hystaspes became king (522 B.C.). In the
second year of this monarch the work of rebuilding the temple was
resumed and carried forward to its completion ([Ezr
5:6](../kjv/ezr005.htm#006); [Ezr 6:1](../kjv/ezr006.htm#001).md), under
the stimulus of the earnest counsels and admonitions of the prophets
Haggai and Zechariah. It was ready for consecration in the spring of 516
B.C., twenty years after the return from captivity. This second temple
had not the ark, the Urim and Thummim, the holy oil, the sacred fire,
the tables of stone, the pot of manna, and Aaron's rod. As in the
tabernacle, there was in it only one golden lamp for the holy place, one
table of shewbread, and the incense altar, with golden censers, and many
of the vessels of gold that had belonged to Solomon's temple that had
been carried to Babylon but restored by Cyrus ([Ezr
1:7](../kjv/ezr001.htm#007).md). This second temple also differed from the
first in that, while in the latter there were numerous "trees planted in
the courts of the Lord," there were none in the former. The second
temple also had for the first time a space, being a part of the outer
court, provided for proselytes who were worshippers of Jehovah, although
not subject to the laws of Judaism. The temple, when completed, was
consecrated amid great rejoicing on the part of all the people ([Ezr
6:16](../kjv/ezr006.htm#016).md), although there were not wanting outward
evidences that the Jews were no longer an independent people, but were
subject to a foreign power. [Hag 2:9](../kjv/hag002.htm#009.md) is rightly
rendered in the Revised Version, "The latter glory of this house shall
be greater than the former," instead of, "The glory of this latter
house," etc., in the Authorized Version. The temple, during the
different periods of its existence, is regarded as but one house, the
one only house of God (compare [Hag 2:3](../kjv/hag002.htm#003).md). The
glory here predicted is spiritual glory and not material splendour.
"Christ himself, present bodily in the temple on Mount Zion during his
life on earth, present spiritually in the Church now, present in the
holy city, the heavenly Jerusalem, of which he is the temple, calling
forth spiritual worship and devotion is the glory here predicted"
(Perowne).

<span id="007">**Temple, Herod's**</span> The temple erected by the
exiles on their return from Babylon had stood for about five hundred
years, when Herod the Great became king of Judea. The building had
suffered considerably from natural decay as well as from the assaults of
hostile armies, and Herod, desirous of gaining the favour of the Jews,
proposed to rebuild it. This offer was accepted, and the work was begun
(B.C. 18), and carried out at great labour and expense, and on a scale
of surpassing splendour. The main part of the building was completed in
ten years, but the erection of the outer courts and the embellishment of
the whole were carried on during the entire period of our Lord's life on
earth ([Joh 2:16](../kjv/joh002.htm#016.md), [Joh
2:19](../kjv/joh002.htm#019).md), and the temple was completed only A.D.
65. But it was not long permitted to exist. Within forty years after our
Lord's crucifixion, his prediction of its overthrow was accomplished
([Luk 19:41](../kjv/luk019.htm#041).md). The Roman legions took the city of
Jerusalem by storm, and notwithstanding the strenuous efforts Titus made
to preserve the temple, his soldiers set fire to it in several places,
and it was utterly destroyed (A.D. 70), and was never rebuilt. Several
remains of Herod's stately temple have by recent explorations been
brought to light. It had two courts-one intended for the Israelites
only, and the other, a large outer court, called "the court of the
Gentiles," intended for the use of strangers of all nations. These two
courts were separated by a low wall, as Josephus states, some 4 1/2 feet
high, with thirteen openings. Along the top of this dividing wall, at
regular intervals, were placed pillars bearing in Greek an inscription
to the effect that no stranger was, on the pain of death, to pass from
the court of the Gentiles into that of the Jews. At the entrance to a
graveyard at the north-western angle of the Haram wall, a stone was
discovered by M. Ganneau in 1871, built into the wall, bearing the
following inscription in Greek capitals: "No stranger is to enter within
the partition wall and enclosure around the sanctuary. Whoever is caught
will be responsible to himself for his death, which will ensue." There
can be no doubt that the stone thus discovered was one of those
originally placed on the boundary wall which separated the Jews from the
Gentiles, of which Josephus speaks. It is of importance to notice that
the word rendered "sanctuary" in the inscription was used in a specific
sense of the inner court, the court of the Israelites, and is the word
rendered "temple" in [Joh 2:15](../kjv/joh002.htm#015.md) and [Act
21:28](../kjv/act021.htm#028), [Act 21:29](../kjv/act021.htm#029.md). When
Paul speaks of the middle wall of partition ([Eph
2:14](../kjv/eph002.htm#014).md), he probably makes allusion to this
dividing wall. Within this partition wall stood the temple proper,
consisting of, (1.) the court of the women, 8 feet higher than the outer
court; (2.) 10 feet higher than this court was the court of Israel; (3.)
the court of the priests, again 3 feet higher; and lastly (4.) the
temple floor, 8 feet above that; thus in all 29 feet above the level of
the outer court. The summit of Mount Moriah, on which the temple stood,
is now occupied by the Haram esh-Sherif, i.e., "the sacred enclosure."
This enclosure is about 1,500 feet from north to south, with a breadth
of about 1,000 feet, covering in all a space of about 35 acres. About
the centre of the enclosure is a raised platform, 16 feet above the
surrounding space, and paved with large stone slabs, on which stands the
Mohammedan mosque called Kubbet es-Sahkra i.e., the "Dome of the Rock,"
or the Mosque of Omar. This mosque covers the site of Solomon's temple.
In the centre of the dome there is a bare, projecting rock, the highest
part of Moriah (q.v.), measuring 60 feet by 40, standing 6 feet above
the floor of the mosque, called the sahkra, i.e., "rock." Over this rock
the altar of burnt-offerings stood. It was the threshing-floor of
Araunah the Jebusite. The exact position on this "sacred enclosure"
which the temple occupied has not been yet definitely ascertained. Some
affirm that Herod's temple covered the site of Solomon's temple and
palace, and in addition enclosed a square of 300 feet at the
south-western angle. The temple courts thus are supposed to have
occupied the southern portion of the "enclosure," forming in all a
square of more than 900 feet. It is argued by others that Herod's temple
occupied a square of 600 feet at the south-west of the "enclosure."

<span id="008">**Temptation**</span> (1.) Trial; a being put to the
test. Thus God "tempted \[[Gen 22:1](../kjv/gen022.htm#001.md); R.V., 'did
prove'\] Abraham;" and afflictions are said to tempt, i.e., to try, men
([Jam 1:2](../kjv/jam001.htm#002), [Jam 1:12](../kjv/jam001.htm#012.md);
compare [Deu 8:2](../kjv/deu008.htm#002).md), putting their faith and
patience to the test. (2.) Ordinarily, however, the word means
solicitation to that which is evil, and hence Satan is called "the
tempter" ([Mat 4:3](../kjv/mat004.htm#003).md). Our Lord was in this way
tempted in the wilderness. That temptation was not internal, but by a
real, active, subtle being. It was not self-sought. It was submitted to
as an act of obedience on his part. "Christ was led, driven. An unseen
personal force bore him a certain violence is implied in the words"
([Mat 4:1](../kjv/mat004.htm#001).md). The scene of the temptation of our
Lord is generally supposed to have been the mountain of Quarantania
(q.v.), "a high and precipitous wall of rock, 1,200 or 1,500 feet above
the plain west of Jordan, near Jericho." Temptation is common to all
([Dan 12:10](../kjv/dan012.htm#010); [Zac 13:9](../kjv/zac013.htm#009.md);
[Psa 66:10](../kjv/psa066.htm#010); [Luk 22:31](../kjv/luk022.htm#031.md),
[Luk 22:40](../kjv/luk022.htm#040); [Heb 11:17](../kjv/heb011.htm#017.md);
[Jam 1:12](../kjv/jam001.htm#012); [Pe1 1:7](../kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md);
[Pe1 4:12](../kjv/pe1004.htm#012).md). We read of the temptation of Joseph
(Gen. 39), of David (2 Sam. 24; 1 Chr. 21), of Hezekiah ([Ch2
32:31](../kjv/ch2032.htm#031)), of Daniel (Dan. 6.md), etc. So long as we
are in this world we are exposed to temptations, and need ever to be on
our watch against them.

<span id="009">**Tent**</span> (1.) Heb. 'ohel ([Gen
9:21](../kjv/gen009.htm#021), [Gen 9:27](../kjv/gen009.htm#027).md). This
word is used also of a dwelling or habitation ([Kg1
8:66](../kjv/kg1008.htm#066); [Isa 16:5](../kjv/isa016.htm#005.md); [Jer
4:20](../kjv/jer004.htm#020).md), and of the temple ([Eze
41:1](../kjv/eze041.htm#001).md). When used of the tabernacle, as in [Kg1
