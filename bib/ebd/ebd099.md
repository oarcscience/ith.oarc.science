<span id="000">**Daystar**</span> Which precedes and accompanies the
sun-rising. It is found only in [Pe2 1:19](../kjv/pe2001.htm#019.md), where
it denotes the manifestation of Christ to the soul, imparting spiritual
light and comfort. He is the "bright and morning star" of [Rev
2:28](../kjv/rev002.htm#028); [Rev 22:16](../kjv/rev022.htm#016.md).
(Compare [Num 24:17](../kjv/num024.htm#017)..md)

<span id="001">**Deacon**</span> Anglicized form of the Greek word
diaconos , meaning a "runner," "messenger," "servant." For a long period
a feeling of mutual jealousy had existed between the "Hebrews," or Jews
proper, who spoke the sacred language of palestine, and the
"Hellenists," or Jews of the Grecian speech, who had adopted the Grecian
language, and read the Septuagint version of the Bible instead of the
Hebrew. This jealousy early appeared in the Christian community. It was
alleged by the Hellenists that their widows were overlooked in the daily
distribution of alms. This spirit must be checked. The apostles
accordingly advised the disciples to look out for seven men of good
report, full of the Holy Ghost, and men of practical wisdom, who should
take entire charge of this distribution, leaving them free to devote
themselves entirely to the spiritual functions of their office ([Act
6:1](../kjv/act006.htm#001).md). This was accordingly done. Seven men were
chosen, who appear from their names to have been Hellenists. The name
"deacon" is nowhere applied to them in the New Testament; they are
simply called "the seven" ([Act 21:8](../kjv/act021.htm#008).md). Their
office was at first secular, but it afterwards became also spiritual;
for among other qualifications they must also be "apt to teach" ([Ti1
3:8](../kjv/ti1003.htm#008).md). Both Philip and Stephen, who were of "the
seven," preached; they did "the work of evangelists."

<span id="002">**Deaconess**</span> [Rom 16:1](../kjv/rom016.htm#001.md),
[Rom 16:3](../kjv/rom016.htm#003), [Rom 16:12](../kjv/rom016.htm#012.md);
[Phi 4:2](../kjv/phi004.htm#002), [Phi 4:3](../kjv/phi004.htm#003.md); [Ti1
3:11](../kjv/ti1003.htm#011); [Ti1 5:9](../kjv/ti1005.htm#009.md), [Ti1
5:10](../kjv/ti1005.htm#010); [Tit 2:3](../kjv/tit002.htm#003.md), [Tit
2:4](../kjv/tit002.htm#004).md). In these passages it is evident that
females were then engaged in various Christian ministrations. Pliny
makes mention of them also in his letter to Trajan (A.D. 110).

<span id="003">**Dead Sea**</span> The name given by Greek writers of
the second century to that inland sea called in Scripture the "salt sea"
([Gen 14:3](../kjv/gen014.htm#003); [Num 34:12](../kjv/num034.htm#012).md),
the "sea of the plain" ([Deu 3:17](../kjv/deu003.htm#017).md), the "east
sea" ([Eze 47:18](../kjv/eze047.htm#018.md); [Joe
2:20](../kjv/joe002.htm#020).md), and simply "the sea" ([Eze
47:8](../kjv/eze047.htm#008).md). The Arabs call it Bahr Lut, i.e., the Sea
of Lot. It lies about 16 miles in a straight line to the east of
Jerusalem. Its surface is 1,292 feet below the surface of the
Mediterranean Sea. It covers an area of about 300 square miles. Its
depth varies from 1,310 to 11 feet. From various phenomena that have
been observed, its bottom appears to be still subsiding. It is about 53
miles long, and of an average breadth of 10 miles. It has no outlet, the
great heat of that region causing such rapid evaporation that its
average depth, notwithstanding the rivers that run into it (see JORDAN),
is maintained with little variation. The Jordan alone discharges into it
no less than six million tons of water every twenty-four hours. The
waters of the Dead Sea contain 24.6 per cent. of mineral salts, about
seven times as much as in ordinary sea-water; thus they are unusually
buoyant. Chloride of magnesium is most abundant; next to that chloride
of sodium (common salt). But terraces of alluvial deposits in the deep
valley of the Jordan show that formerly one great lake extended from the
Waters of Merom to the foot of the watershed in the Arabah. The waters
were then about 1,400 feet above the present level of the Dead Sea, or
slightly above that of the Mediterranean, and at that time were much
less salt. Nothing living can exist in this sea. "The fish carried down
by the Jordan at once die, nor can even mussels or corals live in it;
but it is a fable that no bird can fly over it, or that there are no
living creatures on its banks. Dr. Tristram found on the shores three
kinds of kingfishers, gulls, ducks, and grebes, which he says live on
the fish which enter the sea in shoals, and presently die. He collected
one hundred and eighteen species of birds, some new to science, on the
shores, or swimming or flying over the waters. The cane-brakes which
fringe it at some parts are the homes of about forty species of
mammalia, several of them animals unknown in England; and innumerable
tropical or semi-tropical plants perfume the atmosphere wherever fresh
water can reach. The climate is perfect and most delicious, and indeed
there is perhaps no place in the world where a sanatorium could be
established with so much prospect of benefit as at Ain Jidi (Engedi).",
Geikie's Hours, etc.

<span id="004">**Deal, Tenth**</span> See OMER.

<span id="005">**Dearth**</span> A scarcity of provisions (1 Kings 17).
There were frequent dearths in Palestine. In the days of Abram there was
a "famine in the land" ([Gen 12:10](../kjv/gen012.htm#010).md), so also in
the days of Jacob ([Gen 47:4](../kjv/gen047.htm#004.md), [Gen
47:13](../kjv/gen047.htm#013).md). We read also of dearths in the time of
the judges ([Rut 1:1](../kjv/rut001.htm#001).md), and of the kings ([Sa2
21:1](../kjv/sa2021.htm#001); [Kg1 18:2](../kjv/kg1018.htm#002.md); [Kg2
4:38](../kjv/kg2004.htm#038); [Kg2 8:1](../kjv/kg2008.htm#001).md). In New
Testament times there was an extensive famine in Palestine ([Act
11:28](../kjv/act011.htm#028).md) in the fourth year of the reign of the
emperor Claudius (A.D. 44 and 45).

<span id="006">**Death**</span> May be simply defined as the termination
of life. It is represented under a variety of aspects in Scripture: (1.)
"The dust shall return to the earth as it was" ([Ecc
12:7](../kjv/ecc012.htm#007)). (2..md) "Thou takest away their breath, they
die" ([Psa 104:29](../kjv/psa104.htm#029)). (3..md) It is the dissolution
of "our earthly house of this tabernacle" ([Co2
5:1](../kjv/co2005.htm#001).md); the "putting off this tabernacle" ([Pe2
1:13](../kjv/pe2001.htm#013), [Pe2 1:14](../kjv/pe2001.htm#014)). (4..md)
Being "unclothed" ([Co2 5:3](../kjv/co2005.htm#003.md), [Co2
5:4](../kjv/co2005.htm#004)). (5..md) "Falling on sleep" ([Psa
76:5](../kjv/psa076.htm#005); [Jer 51:39](../kjv/jer051.htm#039.md); [Act
13:36](../kjv/act013.htm#036); [Pe2 3:9](../kjv/pe2003.htm#009). (6..md) "I
go whence I shall not return" ([Job 10:21](../kjv/job010.htm#021).md);
"Make me to know mine end" ([Psa 39:4](../kjv/psa039.htm#004).md); "to
depart" ([Phi 1:23](../kjv/phi001.htm#023).md). The grave is represented as
"the gates of death" ([Job 38:17](../kjv/job038.htm#017.md); [Psa
9:13](../kjv/psa009.htm#013); [Psa 107:18](../kjv/psa107.htm#018).md). The
gloomy silence of the grave is spoken of under the figure of the "shadow
of death" ([Jer 2:6](../kjv/jer002.htm#006).md). Death is the effect of sin
([Heb 2:14](../kjv/heb002.htm#014).md), and not a "debt of nature." It is
but once ([Heb 9:27](../kjv/heb009.htm#027).md), universal ([Gen
3:19](../kjv/gen003.htm#019).md), necessary ([Luk
2:28](../kjv/luk002.htm#028).md). Jesus has by his own death taken away its
sting for all his followers ([Co1 15:55](../kjv/co1015.htm#055).md). There
is a spiritual death in trespasses and sins, i.e., the death of the soul
under the power of sin ([Rom 8:6](../kjv/rom008.htm#006.md); [Eph
2:1](../kjv/eph002.htm#001), [Eph 2:3](../kjv/eph002.htm#003.md); [Col
2:13](../kjv/col002.htm#013).md). The "second death" ([Rev
2:11](../kjv/rev002.htm#011).md) is the everlasting perdition of the wicked
([Rev 21:8](../kjv/rev021.htm#008).md), and "second" in respect to natural
or temporal death. THE DEATH OF CHRIST is the procuring cause
incidentally of all the blessings men enjoy on earth. But specially it
is the procuring cause of the actual salvation of all his people,
together with all the means that lead thereto. It does not make their
salvation merely possible, but certain ([Mat
18:11](../kjv/mat018.htm#011); [Rom 5:10](../kjv/rom005.htm#010.md); [Co2
5:21](../kjv/co2005.htm#021); [Gal 1:4](../kjv/gal001.htm#004.md); [Gal
3:13](../kjv/gal003.htm#013); [Eph 1:7](../kjv/eph001.htm#007.md); [Eph
2:16](../kjv/eph002.htm#016); [Rom 8:32](../kjv/rom008.htm#032).md).

<span id="007">**Debir**</span> Oracle town; sanctuary. (1.) One of the
eleven cities to the west of Hebron, in the highlands of Judah ([Jos
15:49](../kjv/jos015.htm#049); [Jdg 1:11](../kjv/jdg001.htm#011).md). It
was originally one of the towns of the Anakim ([Jos
15:15](../kjv/jos015.htm#015).md), and was also called Kirjath-sepher
(q.v.) and Kirjath-sannah ([Jos 15:49](../kjv/jos015.htm#049).md). Caleb,
who had conquered and taken possession of the town and district of
Hebron ([Jos 14:6](../kjv/jos014.htm#006).md), offered the hand of his
daughter to any one who would successfully lead a party against Debir.
Othniel, his younger brother ([Jdg 1:13](../kjv/jdg001.htm#013.md); [Jdg
3:9](../kjv/jdg003.htm#009).md), achieved the conquest, and gained Achsah
as his wife. She was not satisfied with the portion her father gave her,
and as she was proceeding toward her new home, she "lighted from off her
ass" and said to him, "Give me a blessing \[i.e., a dowry\]: for thou
hast given me a south land" ([Jos 15:19](../kjv/jos015.htm#019), A.V..md);
or, as in the Revised Version, "Thou hast set me in the land of the
south", i.e., in the Negeb, outside the rich valley of Hebron, in the
dry and barren land. "Give me also springs of water. And he gave her the
upper springs, and the nether springs." Debir has been identified with
the modern Edh-Dhaheriyeh, i.e., "the well on the ridge", to the south
of Hebron. (2.) A place near the "valley of Achor" ([Jos
15:7](../kjv/jos015.htm#007).md), on the north boundary of Judah, between
Jerusalem and Jericho. (3.) The king of Eglon, one of the five
Canaanitish kings who were hanged by Joshua ([Jos
10:3](../kjv/jos010.htm#003), [Jos 10:23](../kjv/jos010.htm#023).md) after
the victory at Gibeon. These kings fled and took refuge in a cave at
Makkedah. Here they were kept confined till Joshua returned from the
pursuit of their discomfited armies, when he caused them to be brought
forth, and "Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five
trees" ([Jos 10:26](../kjv/jos010.htm#026).md).

<span id="008">**Deborah**</span> A bee. (1.) Rebekah's nurse. She
accompanied her mistress when she left her father's house in Padan-aram
to become the wife of Isaac ([Gen 24:59](../kjv/gen024.htm#059).md). Many
years afterwards she died at Bethel, and was buried under the "oak of
weeping", Allon-bachuth ([Gen 35:8](../kjv/gen035.htm#008)). (2..md) A
prophetess, "wife" (woman?) of Lapidoth. Jabin, the king of Hazor, had
for twenty years held Israel in degrading subjection. The spirit of
patriotism seemed crushed out of the nation. In this emergency Deborah
roused the people from their lethargy. Her fame spread far and wide. She
became a "mother in Israel" ([Jdg 4:6](../kjv/jdg004.htm#006.md), [Jdg
4:14](../kjv/jdg004.htm#014); [Jdg 5:7](../kjv/jdg005.htm#007).md), and
"the children of Israel came up to her for judgment" as she sat in her
tent under the palm tree "between Ramah and Bethel." Preparations were
everywhere made by her direction for the great effort to throw off the
yoke of bondage. She summoned Barak from Kadesh to take the command of
10,000 men of Zebulun and Naphtali, and lead them to Mount Tabor on the
plain of Esdraelon at its north-east end. With his aid she organized
this army. She gave the signal for attack, and the Hebrew host rushed
down impetuously upon the army of Jabin, which was commanded by Sisera,
and gained a great and decisive victory. The Canaanitish army almost
wholly perished. That was a great and ever-memorable day in Israel. In
Judg. 5 is given the grand triumphal ode, the "song of Deborah," which
she wrote in grateful commemoration of that great deliverance. (See
LAPIDOTH, JABIN \[2\].)

<span id="009">**Debt**</span> The Mosaic law encouraged the practice of
lending ([Deu 15:7](../kjv/deu015.htm#007.md); [Psa
37:26](../kjv/psa037.htm#026); [Mat 5:42](../kjv/mat005.htm#042).md); but
it forbade the exaction of interest except from foreigners. Usury was
strongly condemned ([Pro 28:8](../kjv/pro028.htm#008.md); [Eze
18:8](../kjv/eze018.htm#008), [Eze 18:13](../kjv/eze018.htm#013.md), [Eze
18:17](../kjv/eze018.htm#017); [Eze 22:12](../kjv/eze022.htm#012.md); [Psa
15:5](../kjv/psa015.htm#005).md). On the Sabbatical year all pecuniary
obligations were canceled ([Deu 15:1](../kjv/deu015.htm#001).md). These
regulations prevented the accumulation of debt.
