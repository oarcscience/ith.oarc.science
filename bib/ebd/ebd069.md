<span id="000">**Calah**</span> One of the most ancient cities of
Assyria. "Out of that land he \[i.e., Nimrod\] went forth into Assyria,
and builded Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah, and Resen" ([Gen
10:11](../kjv/gen010.htm#011), R.V.). Its site is now marked probably by
the Nimrud ruins on the left bank of the Tigris. These cover an area of
about 1,000 acres, and are second only in size and importance to the
mass of ruins opposite Mosul. This city was at one time the capital of
the empire, and was the residence of Sardanapalus and his successors
down to the time of Sargon, who built a new capital, the modern
Khorsabad. It has been conjectured that these four cities mentioned in
[Gen 10:11](../kjv/gen010.htm#011) were afterwards all united into one
and called Nineveh (q.v.).

<span id="001">**Calamus**</span> The Latin for cane, Hebrew Kaneh ,
mentioned ([Exo 30:23](../kjv/exo030.htm#023)) as one of the ingredients
in the holy anointing oil, one of the sweet scents ([Sol
4:14](../kjv/sol004.htm#014)), and among the articles sold in the
markets of Tyre ([Eze 27:19](../kjv/eze027.htm#019)). The word
designates an Oriental plant called the "sweet flag," the Acorus calamus
of Linnaeus. It is elsewhere called "sweet cane" ([Isa
43:24](../kjv/isa043.htm#024); [Jer 6:20](../kjv/jer006.htm#020)). It
has an aromatic smell, and when its knotted stalk is cut and dried and
reduced to powder, it forms an ingredient in the most precious perfumes.
It was not a native of Palestine, but was imported from Arabia Felix or
from India. It was probably that which is now known in India by the name
of "lemon grass" or "ginger grass," the Andropogon schoenanthus. (See
CANE.)

<span id="002">**Calcol**</span> ([Ch1 2:6](../kjv/ch1002.htm#006)),
sustenance, the same probably as Chalcol ([Kg1
4:31](../kjv/kg1004.htm#031)), one of the four sages whom Solomon
excelled in wisdom; for "he was wiser than all men."

<span id="003">**Caleb**</span> A dog. (1.) One of the three sons of
Hezron of the tribe of Judah. He is also called Chelubai ([Ch1
2:9](../kjv/ch1002.htm#009)). His descendants are enumerated ([Ch1
2:18](../kjv/ch1002.htm#018), [Ch1 2:42](../kjv/ch1002.htm#042)). (2.) A
"son of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratah" ([Ch1
2:50](../kjv/ch1002.htm#050)). Some would read the whole passage thus:
"These \[i.e., the list in [Ch1 2:42](../kjv/ch1002.htm#042)\] were the
sons of Caleb. The sons of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratah, were Shobal,
etc." Thus Hur would be the name of the son and not the father of Caleb
([Ch1 2:19](../kjv/ch1002.htm#019)). (3.) The son of Jephunneh ([Num
13:6](../kjv/num013.htm#006); [Num 32:12](../kjv/num032.htm#012); [Jos
14:6](../kjv/jos014.htm#006), [Jos 14:14](../kjv/jos014.htm#014)). He
was one of those whom Moses sent to search the land in the second year
after the Exodus. He was one of the family chiefs of the tribe of Judah.
He and Joshua the son of Nun were the only two of the whole number who
encouraged the people to go up and possess the land, and they alone were
spared when a plague broke out in which the other ten spies perished
(Num. 13; 14). All the people that had been numbered, from twenty years
old and upward, perished in the wilderness except these two. The last
notice we have of Caleb is when (being then eighty-five years of age) he
came to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, after the people had gained
possession of the land, and reminded him of the promise Moses had made
to him, by virtue of which he claimed a certain portion of the land of
Kirjatharba as his inheritance ([Jos 14:6](../kjv/jos014.htm#006); [Jos
15:13](../kjv/jos015.htm#013); [Jos 21:10](../kjv/jos021.htm#010); [Sa1
25:2](../kjv/sa1025.htm#002), [Sa1 25:3](../kjv/sa1025.htm#003); [Sa1
30:14](../kjv/sa1030.htm#014)). He is called a "Kenezite" in [Jos
14:6](../kjv/jos014.htm#006), [Jos 14:14](../kjv/jos014.htm#014). This
may simply mean "son of Kenez" ([Num 32:12](../kjv/num032.htm#012)).
Some, however, read "Jephunneh, the son of Kenez," who was a descendant
of Hezron, the son of Pharez, a grandson of Judah ([Ch1
2:5](../kjv/ch1002.htm#005)). This Caleb may possibly be identical with
(2). (4.) Caleb gave his name apparently to a part of the south country
([Sa1 30:14](../kjv/sa1030.htm#014)) of Judah, the district between
Hebron and Carmel, which had been assigned to him. When he gave up the
city of Hebron to the priests as a city of refuge, he retained
possession of the surrounding country ([Jos
21:11](../kjv/jos021.htm#011), [Jos 21:12](../kjv/jos021.htm#012);
compare [Sa1 25:3](../kjv/sa1025.htm#003)).

<span id="004">**Calf**</span> Calves were commonly made use of in
sacrifices, and are therefore frequently mentioned in Scripture. The
"fatted calf" was regarded as the choicest of animal food; it was
frequently also offered as a special sacrifice ([Sa1
28:24](../kjv/sa1028.htm#024); [Amo 6:4](../kjv/amo006.htm#004); [Luk
15:23](../kjv/luk015.htm#023)). The words used in [Jer
34:18](../kjv/jer034.htm#018), [Jer 34:19](../kjv/jer034.htm#019), "cut
the calf in twain," allude to the custom of dividing a sacrifice into
two parts, between which the parties ratifying a covenant passed ([Gen
15:9](../kjv/gen015.htm#009), [Gen 15:10](../kjv/gen015.htm#010), [Gen
15:17](../kjv/gen015.htm#017), [Gen 15:18](../kjv/gen015.htm#018)). The
sacrifice of the lips, i.e., priase, is called "the calves of our lips"
([Hos 14:2](../kjv/hos014.htm#002), R.V., "as bullocks the offering of
our lips." Compare [Heb 13:15](../kjv/heb013.htm#015); [Psa
116:7](../kjv/psa116.htm#007); [Jer 33:11](../kjv/jer033.htm#011)). The
golden calf which Aaron made ([Exo 32:4](../kjv/exo032.htm#004)) was
probably a copy of the god Moloch rather than of the god Apis, the
sacred ox or calf of Egypt. The Jews showed all through their history a
tendency toward the Babylonian and Canaanitish idolatry rather than
toward that of Egypt. Ages after this, Jeroboam, king of Israel, set up
two idol calves, one at Dan, and the other at Bethel, that he might thus
prevent the ten tribes from resorting to Jerusalem for worship ([Kg1
12:28](../kjv/kg1012.htm#028)). These calves continued to be a snare to
the people till teh time of their captivity. The calf at Dan was carried
away in the reign of Pekah by Tiglath-pileser, and that at Bethel ten
years later, in the reign of Hoshea, by Shalmaneser ([Kg2
15:29](../kjv/kg2015.htm#029); [Kg2 17:33](../kjv/kg2017.htm#033)). This
sin of Jeroboam is almost always mentioned along with his name ([Kg2
15:28](../kjv/kg2015.htm#028) etc.).

<span id="005">**Calkers**</span> Workmen skilled in stopping the seams
of the deck or sides of vessels. The inhabitants of Gebel were employed
in such work on Tyrian vessels ([Eze 27:9](../kjv/eze027.htm#009), [Eze
27:27](../kjv/eze027.htm#027); marg., "strengtheners" or "stoppers of
chinks").

<span id="006">**Call**</span> (1.) To cry for help, hence to pray ([Gen
4:26](../kjv/gen004.htm#026)). Thus men are said to "call upon the name
of the Lord" ([Act 2:21](../kjv/act002.htm#021); [Act
7:59](../kjv/act007.htm#059); [Act 9:14](../kjv/act009.htm#014); [Rom
10:12](../kjv/rom010.htm#012); [Co1 1:2](../kjv/co1001.htm#002)). (2.)
God calls with respect to men when he designates them to some special
office ([Exo 31:2](../kjv/exo031.htm#002); [Isa
22:20](../kjv/isa022.htm#020); [Act 13:2](../kjv/act013.htm#002)), and
when he invites them to accept his offered grace ([Mat
9:13](../kjv/mat009.htm#013); [Mat 11:28](../kjv/mat011.htm#028); [Mat
22:4](../kjv/mat022.htm#004)). In the message of the gospel his call is
addressed to all men, to Jews and Gentiles alike ([Mat
28:19](../kjv/mat028.htm#019); [Mar 16:15](../kjv/mar016.htm#015); [Rom
9:24](../kjv/rom009.htm#024), [Rom 9:25](../kjv/rom009.htm#025)). But
this universal call is not inseparably connected with salvation,
although it leaves all to whom it comes inexcusable if they reject it
([Joh 3:14](../kjv/joh003.htm#014); [Mat 22:14](../kjv/mat022.htm#014)).
An effectual call is something more than the outward message of the Word
of God to men. It is internal, and is the result of the enlightening and
sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit ([Joh
16:14](../kjv/joh016.htm#014); [Act 26:18](../kjv/act026.htm#018); [Joh
6:44](../kjv/joh006.htm#044)), effectually drawing men to Christ, and
disposing and enabling them to receive the truth ([Joh
6:45](../kjv/joh006.htm#045); [Act 16:14](../kjv/act016.htm#014); [Eph
1:17](../kjv/eph001.htm#017)).

<span id="007">**Calling**</span> A profession, or as we usually say, a
vocation ([Co1 7:20](../kjv/co1007.htm#020)). The "hope of your calling"
in [Eph 4:4](../kjv/eph004.htm#004) is the hope resulting from your
being called into the kingdom of God.

<span id="008">**Calneh**</span> Fort, one of the four cities founded by
Nimrod ([Gen 10:10](../kjv/gen010.htm#010)). It is the modern Niffer, a
lofty mound of earth and rubbish situated in the marshes on the left,
i.e., the east, bank of the Euphrates, but 30 miles distant from its
present course, and about 60 miles south-south-east from Babylon. It is
mentioned as one of the towns with which Tyre carried on trade. It was
finally taken and probably destroyed by one of the Assyrian kings ([Amo
6:2](../kjv/amo006.htm#002)). It is called Calno ([Isa
10:9](../kjv/isa010.htm#009)) and Canneh ([Eze
27:23](../kjv/eze027.htm#023)).

<span id="009">**Calvary**</span> Only in [Luk
23:33](../kjv/luk023.htm#033), the Latin name Calvaria , which was used
as a translation of the Greek word Kranion , by which the Hebrew word
Gulgoleth was interpreted, "the place of a skull." It probably took this
name from its shape, being a hillock or low, rounded, bare elevation
somewhat in the form of a human skull. It is nowhere in Scripture called
a "hill." The crucifixion of our Lord took place outside the city walls
([Heb 13:11](../kjv/heb013.htm#011)) and near the public thoroughfare.
"This thing was not done in a corner." (See GOLGOTHA.)
