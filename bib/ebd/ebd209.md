<span id="000">**John**</span> (1.) One who, with Annas and Caiaphas,
sat in judgment on the apostles Peter and John ([Act
4:6](../kjv/act004.htm#006).md). He was of the kindred of the high priest;
otherwise unknown. (2.) The Hebrew name of Mark (q.v.). He is designated
by this name in the acts of the Apostles ([Act
12:12](../kjv/act012.htm#012), [Act 12:25](../kjv/act012.htm#025.md); [Act
13:5](../kjv/act013.htm#005), [Act 13:13](../kjv/act013.htm#013.md); [Act
15:37](../kjv/act015.htm#037)). (3..md) The Apostle, brother of James the
"Greater" ([Mat 4:21](../kjv/mat004.htm#021.md); [Mat
10:2](../kjv/mat010.htm#002); [Mar 1:19](../kjv/mar001.htm#019.md); [Mar
3:17](../kjv/mar003.htm#017); [Mar 10:35](../kjv/mar010.htm#035).md). He
was one, probably the younger, of the sons of Zebedee ([Mat
4:21](../kjv/mat004.htm#021).md) and Salome ([Mat
27:56](../kjv/mat027.htm#056.md); compare [Mar
15:40](../kjv/mar015.htm#040).md), and was born at Bethsaida. His father
was apparently a man of some wealth (compare [Mar
1:20](../kjv/mar001.htm#020); [Luk 5:3](../kjv/luk005.htm#003.md); [Joh
19:27](../kjv/joh019.htm#027).md). He was doubtless trained in all that
constituted the ordinary education of Jewish youth. When he grew up he
followed the occupation of a fisherman on the Lake of Galilee. When John
the Baptist began his ministry in the wilderness of Judea, John, with
many others, gathered round him, and was deeply influenced by his
teaching. There he heard the announcement, "Behold the Lamb of God," and
forthwith, on the invitation of Jesus, became a disciple and ranked
among his followers ([Joh 1:36](../kjv/joh001.htm#036.md), [Joh
1:37](../kjv/joh001.htm#037).md) for a time. He and his brother then
returned to their former avocation, for how long is uncertain. Jesus
again called them ([Mat 4:21](../kjv/mat004.htm#021.md); [Luk
5:1](../kjv/luk005.htm#001).md), and now they left all and permanently
attached themselves to the company of his disciples. He became one of
the innermost circle ([Mar 5:37](../kjv/mar005.htm#037.md); [Mat
17:1](../kjv/mat017.htm#001); [Mat 26:37](../kjv/mat026.htm#037.md); [Mar
13:3](../kjv/mar013.htm#003).md). He was the disciple whom Jesus loved. In
zeal and intensity of character he was a "Boanerges" ([Mar
3:17](../kjv/mar003.htm#017).md). This spirit once and again broke out
([Mat 20:20](../kjv/mat020.htm#020); [Mar 10:35](../kjv/mar010.htm#035.md);
[Luk 9:49](../kjv/luk009.htm#049), [Luk 9:54](../kjv/luk009.htm#054).md).
At the betrayal he and Peter follow Christ afar off, while the others
betake themselves to hasty flight ([Joh 18:15](../kjv/joh018.htm#015).md).
At the trial he follows Christ into the council chamber, and thence to
the praetorium ([Joh 18:16](../kjv/joh018.htm#016.md), [Joh
18:19](../kjv/joh018.htm#019), [Joh 18:28](../kjv/joh018.htm#028).md) and
to the place of crucifixion ([Joh 19:26](../kjv/joh019.htm#026.md), [Joh
19:27](../kjv/joh019.htm#027).md). To him and Peter, Mary first conveys
tidings of the resurrection ([Joh 20:2](../kjv/joh020.htm#002).md), and
they are the first to go and see what her strange words mean. After the
resurrection he and Peter again return to the Sea of Galilee, where the
Lord reveals himself to them ([Joh 21:1](../kjv/joh021.htm#001.md), [Joh
21:7](../kjv/joh021.htm#007).md). We find Peter and John frequently after
this together ([Act 3:1](../kjv/act003.htm#001.md); [Act
4:13](../kjv/act004.htm#013).md). John remained apparently in Jerusalem as
the leader of the church there ([Act 15:6](../kjv/act015.htm#006.md); [Gal
2:9](../kjv/gal002.htm#009).md). His subsequent history is unrecorded. He
was not there, however, at the time of Paul's last visit (Acts
21:15-40). He appears to have retired to Ephesus, but at what time is
unknown. The seven churches of Asia were the objects of his special care
([Rev 1:11](../kjv/rev001.htm#011).md). He suffered under persecution, and
was banished to Patmos ([Rev 1:9](../kjv/rev001.htm#009).md); whence he
again returned to Ephesus, where he died, probably about A.D. 98, having
outlived all or nearly all the friends and companions even of his mature
years. There are many interesting traditions regarding John during his
residence at Ephesus, but these cannot claim the character of historical
truth.

<span id="001">**John, Gospel of**</span> The genuineness of this
Gospel, i.e., the fact that the apostle John was its author, is beyond
all reasonable doubt. In recent times, from about 1820, many attempts
have been made to impugn its genuineness, but without success. The
design of John in writing this Gospel is stated by himself ([Joh
20:31](../kjv/joh020.htm#031).md). It was at one time supposed that he
wrote for the purpose of supplying the omissions of the synoptical,
i.e., of the first three, Gospels, but there is no evidence for this.
"There is here no history of Jesus and his teaching after the manner of
the other evangelists. But there is in historical form a representation
of the Christian faith in relation to the person of Christ as its
central point; and in this representation there is a picture on the one
hand of the antagonism of the world to the truth revealed in him, and on
the other of the spiritual blessedness of the few who yield themselves
to him as the Light of life" (Reuss). After the prologue ([Joh
1:1](../kjv/joh001.htm#001).md), the historical part of the book begins
with [Joh 1:6](../kjv/joh001.htm#006.md), and consists of two parts. The
first part ([Joh 1:6](../kjv/joh001.htm#006).md) contains the history of
our Lord's public ministry from the time of his introduction to it by
John the Baptist to its close. The second part (John 13 - 21) presents
our Lord in the retirement of private life and in his intercourse with
his immediate followers (John 13 - 17), and gives an account of his
sufferings and of his appearances to the disciples after his
resurrection (John 18 - 21). The peculiarities of this Gospel are the
place it gives (1.) to the mystical relation of the Son to the Father,
and (2.) of the Redeemer to believers; (3.) the announcement of the Holy
Ghost as the Comforter; (4.) the prominence given to love as an element
in the Christian character. It was obviously addressed primarily to
Christians. It was probably written at Ephesus, which, after the
destruction of Jerusalem (A.D. 70), became the centre of Christian life
and activity in the East, about A.D. 90.

<span id="002">**John, First Epistle of**</span> The fourth of the
catholic or "general" epistles. It was evidently written by John the
evangelist, and probably also at Ephesus, and when the writer was in
advanced age. The purpose of the apostle ([Jo1
1:1](../kjv/jo1001.htm#001).md) is to declare the Word of Life to those to
whom he writes, in order that they might be united in fellowship with
the Father and his Son Jesus Christ. He shows that the means of union
with God are, (1.) on the part of Christ, his atoning work ([Jo1
1:7](../kjv/jo1001.htm#007); [Jo1 2:2](../kjv/jo1002.htm#002.md); [Jo1
3:5](../kjv/jo1003.htm#005); [Jo1 4:10](../kjv/jo1004.htm#010.md), [Jo1
4:14](../kjv/jo1004.htm#014); [Jo1 5:11](../kjv/jo1005.htm#011.md), [Jo1
5:12](../kjv/jo1005.htm#012).md) and his advocacy ([Jo1
2:1](../kjv/jo1002.htm#001)); and (2..md) on the part of man, holiness
([Jo1 1:6](../kjv/jo1001.htm#006).md), obedience ([Jo1
2:3](../kjv/jo1002.htm#003)), purity ([Jo1 3:3](../kjv/jo1003.htm#003).md),
faith ([Jo1 3:23](../kjv/jo1003.htm#023.md); [Jo1
4:3](../kjv/jo1004.htm#003); [Jo1 5:5](../kjv/jo1005.htm#005).md), and love
([Jo1 2:7](../kjv/jo1002.htm#007), [Jo1 2:8](../kjv/jo1002.htm#008.md);
[Jo1 3:14](../kjv/jo1003.htm#014); [Jo1 4:7](../kjv/jo1004.htm#007.md);
[Jo1 5:1](../kjv/jo1005.htm#001).md).

<span id="003">**John, Second Epistle of**</span> Is addressed to "the
elect lady," and closes with the words, "The children of thy elect
sister greet thee;" but some would read instead of "lady" the proper
name Kyria. Of the thirteen verses composing this epistle seven are in
the First Epistle. The person addressed in commended for her piety, and
is warned against false teachers.

<span id="004">**John, Third Epistle of**</span> Is addressed to Caius,
or Gaius, but whether to the Christian of that name in Macedonia ([Act
19:29](../kjv/act019.htm#029).md) or in Corinth ([Rom
16:23](../kjv/rom016.htm#023).md) or in Derbe ([Act
20:4](../kjv/act020.htm#004).md) is uncertain. It was written for the
purpose of commending to Gaius some Christians who were strangers in the
place where he lived, and who had gone thither for the purpose of
preaching the gospel ([Jo3 1:7](../kjv/jo3001.htm#007).md). The Second and
Third Epistles were probably written soon after the First, and from
Ephesus.

<span id="005">**John the Baptist**</span> The "forerunner of our Lord."
We have but fragmentary and imperfect accounts of him in the Gospels. He
was of priestly descent. His father, Zacharias, was a priest of the
course of Abia ([Ch1 24:10](../kjv/ch1024.htm#010).md), and his mother,
Elisabeth, was of the daughters of Aaron ([Luk
1:5](../kjv/luk001.htm#005).md). The mission of John was the subject of
prophecy ([Mat 3:3](../kjv/mat003.htm#003.md); [Isa
40:3](../kjv/isa040.htm#003); [Mal 3:1](../kjv/mal003.htm#001).md). His
birth, which took place six months before that of Jesus, was foretold by
an angel. Zacharias, deprived of the power of speech as a token of God's
truth and a reproof of his own incredulity with reference to the birth
of his son, had the power of speech restored to him on the occasion of
his circumcision ([Luk 1:64](../kjv/luk001.htm#064).md). After this no more
is recorded of him for thirty years than what is mentioned in [Luk
1:80](../kjv/luk001.htm#080.md). John was a Nazarite from his birth ([Luk
1:15](../kjv/luk001.htm#015); [Num 6:1](../kjv/num006.htm#001).md). He
spent his early years in the mountainous tract of Judah lying between
Jerusalem and the Dead Sea ([Mat 3:1](../kjv/mat003.htm#001).md). At length
he came forth into public life, and great multitudes from "every
quarter" were attracted to him. The sum of his preaching was the
necessity of repentance. He denounced the Sadducees and Pharisees as a
"generation of vipers," and warned them of the folly of trusting to
external privileges ([Luk 3:8](../kjv/luk003.htm#008).md). "As a preacher,
John was eminently practical and discriminating. Self-love and
covetousness were the prevalent sins of the people at large. On them,
therefore, he enjoined charity and consideration for others. The
publicans he cautioned against extortion, the soldiers against crime and
plunder." His doctrine and manner of life roused the entire south of
Palestine, and the people from all parts flocked to the place where he
was, on the banks of the Jordan. There he baptized thousands unto
repentance. The fame of John reached the ears of Jesus in Nazareth ([Mat
3:5](../kjv/mat003.htm#005).md), and he came from Galilee to Jordan to be
baptized of John, on the special ground that it became him to "fulfill
all righteousness" ([Mat 3:15](../kjv/mat003.htm#015).md). John's special
office ceased with the baptism of Jesus, who must now "increase as the
King come to his kingdom. He continued, however, for a while to bear
testimony to the Messiahship of Jesus. He pointed him out to his
disciples, saying, "Behold the Lamb of God." His public ministry was
suddenly (after about six months probably) brought to a close by his
being cast into prison by Herod, whom he had reproved for the sin of
having taken to himself the wife of his brother Philip ([Luk
3:19](../kjv/luk003.htm#019).md). He was shut up in the castle of Machaerus
(q.v.), a fortress on the southern extremity of Peraea, 9 miles east of
the Dead Sea, and here he was beheaded. His disciples, having consigned
the headless body to the grave, went and told Jesus all that had
occurred ([Mat 14:3](../kjv/mat014.htm#003).md). John's death occurred
apparently just before the third Passover of our Lord's ministry. Our
Lord himself testified regarding him that he was a "burning and a
shining light" ([Joh 5:35](../kjv/joh005.htm#035).md).
