<span id="000">**Closet**</span> As used in the New Testament, signifies
properly a storehouse ([Luk 12:24](../kjv/luk012.htm#024).md), and hence a
place of privacy and retirement ([Mat 6:6](../kjv/mat006.htm#006.md); [Luk
12:3](../kjv/luk012.htm#003).md).

<span id="001">**Cloud**</span> The Hebrew so rendered means "a
covering," because clouds cover the sky. The word is used as a symbol of
the Divine presence, as indicating the splendour of that glory which it
conceals ([Exo 16:10](../kjv/exo016.htm#010.md); [Exo
33:9](../kjv/exo033.htm#009); [Num 11:25](../kjv/num011.htm#025.md); [Num
12:5](../kjv/num012.htm#005); [Job 22:14](../kjv/job022.htm#014.md); [Psa
18:11](../kjv/psa018.htm#011).md). A "cloud without rain" is a proverbial
saying, denoting a man who does not keep his promise ([Pro
16:15](../kjv/pro016.htm#015); [Isa 18:4](../kjv/isa018.htm#004.md); [Isa
25:5](../kjv/isa025.htm#005); [Jde 1:12](../kjv/jde001.htm#012).md). A
cloud is the figure of that which is transitory ([Job
30:15](../kjv/job030.htm#015); [Hos 6:4](../kjv/hos006.htm#004).md). A
bright cloud is the symbolical seat of the Divine presence ([Exo
29:42](../kjv/exo029.htm#042), [Exo 29:43](../kjv/exo029.htm#043.md); [Kg1
8:10](../kjv/kg1008.htm#010); [Ch2 5:14](../kjv/ch2005.htm#014.md); [Eze
43:4](../kjv/eze043.htm#004)), and was called the Shechinah (q.v..md).
Jehovah came down upon Sinai in a cloud ([Exo
19:9](../kjv/exo019.htm#009).md); and the cloud filled the court around the
tabernacle in the wilderness so that Moses could not enter it ([Exo
40:34](../kjv/exo040.htm#034), [Exo 40:35](../kjv/exo040.htm#035).md). At
the dedication of the temple also the cloud "filled the house of the
Lord" ([Kg1 8:10](../kjv/kg1008.htm#010).md). Thus in like manner when
Christ comes the second time he is described as coming "in the clouds"
([Mat 17:5](../kjv/mat017.htm#005); [Mat 24:30](../kjv/mat024.htm#030.md);
[Act 1:9](../kjv/act001.htm#009), [Act 1:11](../kjv/act001.htm#011).md).
False teachers are likened unto clouds carried about with a tempest
([Pe2 2:17](../kjv/pe2002.htm#017).md). The infirmities of old age, which
come one after another, are compared by Solomon to "clouds returning
after the rain" ([Ecc 12:2](../kjv/ecc012.htm#002).md). The blotting out of
sins is like the sudden disappearance of threatening clouds from the sky
([Isa 44:22](../kjv/isa044.htm#022).md). Cloud, the pillar of, was the
glory-cloud which indicated God's presence leading the ransomed people
through the wilderness ([Exo 13:22](../kjv/exo013.htm#022.md); [Exo
33:9](../kjv/exo033.htm#009), [Exo 33:10](../kjv/exo033.htm#010).md). This
pillar preceded the people as they marched, resting on the ark ([Exo
13:21](../kjv/exo013.htm#021); [Exo 40:36](../kjv/exo040.htm#036).md). By
night it became a pillar of fire ([Num 9:17](../kjv/num009.htm#017).md).

<span id="002">**Cnidus**</span> A town and harbour on the extreme
south-west of the peninsula of Doris in Asia Minor. Paul sailed past it
on his voyage to Rome after leaving Myra ([Act
27:7](../kjv/act027.htm#007).md).

<span id="003">**Coal**</span> It is by no means certain that the
Hebrews were acquainted with mineral coal, although it is found in
Syria. Their common fuel was dried dung of animals and wood charcoal.
Two different words are found in Hebrew to denote coal, both occurring
in [Pro 26:21](../kjv/pro026.htm#021.md), "As coal \[Heb. peham ; i.e.,
"black coal"\] is to burning coal (Heb. gehalim \]." The latter of these
words is used in [Job 41:21](../kjv/job041.htm#021.md); [Pro
6:28](../kjv/pro006.htm#028); [Isa 44:19](../kjv/isa044.htm#019.md). The
words "live coal" in [Isa 6:6](../kjv/isa006.htm#006.md) are more correctly
"glowing stone." In [Lam 4:8](../kjv/lam004.htm#008.md) the expression
"blacker than a coal" is literally rendered in the margin of the Revised
Version "darker than blackness." "Coals of fire" ([Sa2
22:9](../kjv/sa2022.htm#009), [Sa2 22:13](../kjv/sa2022.htm#013.md); [Psa
18:8](../kjv/psa018.htm#008), [Psa 18:12](../kjv/psa018.htm#012.md), [Psa
18:13](../kjv/psa018.htm#013), etc..md) is an expression used
metaphorically for lightnings proceeding from God. A false tongue is
compared to "coals of juniper" ([Psa 120:4](../kjv/psa120.htm#004.md); [Jam
3:6](../kjv/jam003.htm#006).md). "Heaping coals of fire on the head"
symbolizes overcoming evil with good. The words of Paul ([Rom
12:20](../kjv/rom012.htm#020).md) are equivalent to saying, "By charity and
kindness thou shalt soften down his enmity as surely as heaping coals on
the fire fuses the metal in the crucible."

<span id="004">**Coat**</span> The tunic worn like the shirt next the
skin ([Lev 16:4](../kjv/lev016.htm#004.md); [Sol
5:3](../kjv/sol005.htm#003); [Sa2 15:32](../kjv/sa2015.htm#032.md); [Exo
28:4](../kjv/exo028.htm#004); [Exo 29:5](../kjv/exo029.htm#005).md). The
"coats of skins" prepared by God for Adam and Eve were probably nothing
more than aprons ([Gen 3:21](../kjv/gen003.htm#021).md). This tunic was
sometimes woven entire without a seam ([Joh
19:23](../kjv/joh019.htm#023).md); it was also sometimes of "many colours"
([Gen 37:3](../kjv/gen037.htm#003.md); R.V. marg., "a long garment with
sleeves"). The "fisher's coat" of [Joh 21:7](../kjv/joh021.htm#007.md) was
obviously an outer garment or cloak, as was also the "coat" made by
Hannah for Samuel ([Sa1 2:19](../kjv/sa1002.htm#019)). (See DRESS..md)

<span id="005">**Coat of Mail**</span> In rendering of a Hebrew word
meaning "glittering" ([Sa1 17:5](../kjv/sa1017.htm#005.md), [Sa1
17:38](../kjv/sa1017.htm#038).md). The same word in the plural form is
translated "habergeons" in [Ch2 26:14](../kjv/ch2026.htm#014.md) and [Neh
4:16](../kjv/neh004.htm#016.md). The "harness" ([Kg1
22:34](../kjv/kg1022.htm#034).md), "breastplate" ([Isa
59:17](../kjv/isa059.htm#017).md), and "brigandine" ([Jer
46:4](../kjv/jer046.htm#004).md), were probably also corselets or coats of
mail. (See ARMOUR.)

<span id="006">**Cock-crowing**</span> In our Lord's time the Jews had
adopted the Greek and Roman division of the night into four watches,
each consisting of three hours, the first beginning at six o'clock in
the evening ([Luk 12:38](../kjv/luk012.htm#038.md); [Mat
14:25](../kjv/mat014.htm#025); [Mar 6:48](../kjv/mar006.htm#048).md). But
the ancient division, known as the first and second cock-crowing, was
still retained. The cock usually crows several times soon after midnight
(this is the first crowing), and again at the dawn of day (and this is
the second crowing). Mark mentions ([Mar 14:30](../kjv/mar014.htm#030).md)
the two cock-crowings. Matthew ([Mat 26:34](../kjv/mat026.htm#034).md)
alludes to that only which was emphatically the cock-crowing, viz, the
second.

<span id="007">**Cockatrice**</span> The mediaeval name (a corruption of
of "crocodile") of a fabulous serpent supposed to be produced from a
cock's egg. It is generally supposed to denote the cerastes, or "horned
viper," a very poisonous serpent about a foot long. Others think it to
be the yellow viper (Daboia xanthina), one of the most dangerous vipers,
from its size and its nocturnal habits ([Isa
11:8](../kjv/isa011.htm#008); [Isa 14:29](../kjv/isa014.htm#029.md); [Isa
59:5](../kjv/isa059.htm#005); [Jer 8:17](../kjv/jer008.htm#017.md); in all
which the Revised Version renders the Hebrew tziphoni by "basilisk"). In
[Pro 23:32](../kjv/pro023.htm#032.md) the Hebrew tzeph'a is rendered both
in the Authorized Version and the Revised Version by "adder;" margin of
Revised Version "basilisk," and of Authorized Version "cockatrice."

<span id="008">**Cockle**</span> Occurs only in [Job
31:40](../kjv/job031.htm#040) (marg., "noisome weeds".md), where it is the
rendering of a Hebrew word ( b'oshah ) which means "offensive," "having
a bad smell," referring to some weed perhaps which has an unpleasant
odour. Or it may be regarded as simply any noisome weed, such as the
"tares" or darnel of [Mat 13:30](../kjv/mat013.htm#030.md). In [Isa
5:2](../kjv/isa005.htm#002), [Isa 5:4](../kjv/isa005.htm#004.md) the plural
form is rendered "wild grapes."

<span id="009">**Coele-Syria**</span> Hollow Syria, the name (not found
in Scripture) given by the Greeks to the extensive valley, about 100
miles long, between the Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon range of mountains.
