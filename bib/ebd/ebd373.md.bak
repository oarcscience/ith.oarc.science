<span id="000">**Trophimus**</span> A foster-child, an Ephesian who
accompanied Paul during a part of his third missionary journey ([Act
20:4](../kjv/act020.htm#004); [Act 21:29](../kjv/act021.htm#029).md). He
was with Paul in Jerusalem, and the Jews, supposing that the apostle had
brought him with him into the temple, raised a tumult which resulted in
Paul's imprisonment. (See TEMPLE, HEROD'S.) In writing to Timothy, the
apostle says, "Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick" ([Ti2
4:20](../kjv/ti2004.htm#020).md). This must refer to some event not noticed
in the Acts.

<span id="001">**Trumpets**</span> Were of a great variety of forms, and
were made of divers materials. Some were made of silver ([Num
10:2](../kjv/num010.htm#002).md), and were used only by the priests in
announcing the approach of festivals and in giving signals of war. Some
were also made of rams' horns ([Jos 6:8](../kjv/jos006.htm#008).md). They
were blown at special festivals, and to herald the arrival of special
seasons ([Lev 23:24](../kjv/lev023.htm#024.md); [Lev
25:9](../kjv/lev025.htm#009); [Ch1 15:24](../kjv/ch1015.htm#024.md); [Ch2
29:27](../kjv/ch2029.htm#027); [Psa 81:3](../kjv/psa081.htm#003.md); [Psa
98:6](../kjv/psa098.htm#006).md). "Trumpets" are among the symbols used in
the Book of Revelation ([Rev 1:10](../kjv/rev001.htm#010.md); [Rev
8:2](../kjv/rev008.htm#002)). (See HORN..md)

<span id="002">**Trumpets, Feast of**</span> Was celebrated at the
beginning of the month Tisri, the first month of the civil year. It
received its name from the circumstances that the trumpets usually blown
at the commencement of each month were on that occasion blown with
unusual solemnity ([Lev 23:23](../kjv/lev023.htm#023.md); [Num
10:10](../kjv/num010.htm#010); [Num 29:1](../kjv/num029.htm#001).md). It
was one of the seven days of holy convocation. The special design of
this feast, which is described in these verses, is not known.

<span id="003">**Truth**</span> Used in various senses in Scripture. In
[Pro 12:17](../kjv/pro012.htm#017), [Pro 12:19](../kjv/pro012.htm#019.md),
it denotes that which is opposed to falsehood. In [Isa
59:14](../kjv/isa059.htm#014), [Isa 59:15](../kjv/isa059.htm#015.md), [Jer
7:28](../kjv/jer007.htm#028.md), it means fidelity or truthfulness. The
doctrine of Christ is called "the truth of the gospel" ([Gal
2:5](../kjv/gal002.htm#005).md), "the truth" ([Ti2
3:7](../kjv/ti2003.htm#007); [Ti2 4:4](../kjv/ti2004.htm#004).md). Our Lord
says of himself, "I am the way, and the truth" ([Joh
14:6](../kjv/joh014.htm#006).md).

<span id="004">**Tryphena and Tryphosa**</span> Two female Christians,
active workers, whom Paul salutes in his epistle to the Romans ([Rom
16:12](../kjv/rom016.htm#012).md).

<span id="005">**Tubal**</span> (1.) The fifth son of Japheth ([Gen
10:2](../kjv/gen010.htm#002)). (2..md) A nation, probably descended from
the son of Japheth. It is mentioned by Isaiah ([Isa
66:19](../kjv/isa066.htm#019).md), along with Javan, and by Ezekiel ([Eze
27:13](../kjv/eze027.htm#013).md), along with Meshech, among the traders
with Tyre, also among the confederates of Gog ([Eze
38:2](../kjv/eze038.htm#002), [Eze 38:3](../kjv/eze038.htm#003.md); [Eze
39:1](../kjv/eze039.htm#001).md), and with Meshech among the nations which
were to be destroyed ([Eze 32:26](../kjv/eze032.htm#026).md). This nation
was probably the Tiberini of the Greek historian Herodotus, a people of
the Asiatic highland west of the Upper Euphrates, the southern range of
the Caucasus, on the east of the Black Sea.

<span id="006">**Tubal-cain**</span> The son of Lamech and Zillah, "an
instructor of every artificer in brass and iron" ([Gen
4:22](../kjv/gen004.htm#022.md); R.V., "the forger of every cutting
instrument of brass and iron").

<span id="007">**Turtle, Turtle-dove**</span> Its peculiar peaceful and
gentle habit is often referred to in Scripture. A pair was offered in
sacrifice by Mary at her purification ([Luk
2:24](../kjv/luk002.htm#024).md). The pigeon and the turtle-dove were the
only birds permitted to be offered in sacrifice ([Lev
1:14](../kjv/lev001.htm#014); [Lev 5:7](../kjv/lev005.htm#007.md); [Lev
14:22](../kjv/lev014.htm#022); [Lev 15:14](../kjv/lev015.htm#014.md), [Lev
15:29](../kjv/lev015.htm#029), etc..md). The Latin name of this bird,
turtur , is derived from its note, and is a repetition of the Hebrew
name tor . Three species are found in Palestine, (1.) the turtle-dove (
Turtur auritus ), (2.) the collared turtle (T. risorius ), and (3.) the
palm turtle (T. Senegalensis ). But it is to the first of these species
which the various passages of Scripture refer. It is a migratory bird
([Jer 8:7](../kjv/jer008.htm#007); [Sol 2:11](../kjv/sol002.htm#011.md),
[Sol 2:12](../kjv/sol002.htm#012).md). "Search the glades and valleys, even
by sultry Jordan, at the end of March, and not a turtle-dove is to be
seen. Return in the second week of April, and clouds of doves are
feeding on the cloves of plain. They over-spread the whole face of the
land." "Immediately on its arrival it pours forth from every garden,
grove, and wooded hill its melancholy yet soothing ditty unceasingly
form early dawn till sunset. It is from its plaintive and continuous
note, doubtless, that David, pouring forth his heart's sorrow to God,
compares himself to a turtle-dove" ([Psa 74:19](../kjv/psa074.htm#019).md).

<span id="008">**Tychicus**</span> Chance, an Asiatic Christian, a
"faithful minister in the Lord" ([Eph 6:21](../kjv/eph006.htm#021.md), [Eph
6:22](../kjv/eph006.htm#022).md), who, with Trophimus, accompanied Paul on
a part of his journey from Macedonia to Jerusalem ([Act
20:4](../kjv/act020.htm#004).md). He is alluded to also in [Col
4:7](../kjv/col004.htm#007), [Tit 3:12](../kjv/tit003.htm#012.md), and [Ti2
4:12](../kjv/ti2004.htm#012.md) as having been with Paul at Rome, whence he
sent him to Ephesus, probably for the purpose of building up and
encouraging the church there.

<span id="009">**Type**</span> Occurs only once in Scripture ([Co1
10:11](../kjv/co1010.htm#011), A.V. marg..md). The Greek word tupos is
rendered "print" ([Joh 20:25](../kjv/joh020.htm#025).md), "figure" ([Act
7:43](../kjv/act007.htm#043); [Rom 5:14](../kjv/rom005.htm#014).md),
"fashion" ([Act 7:44](../kjv/act007.htm#044).md), "manner" ([Act
23:25](../kjv/act023.htm#025).md), "form" ([Rom
6:17](../kjv/rom006.htm#017).md), "example" or "ensample" ([Co1
10:6](../kjv/co1010.htm#006), [Co1 10:11](../kjv/co1010.htm#011.md); [Phi
3:17](../kjv/phi003.htm#017); [Th1 1:7](../kjv/th1001.htm#007.md); [Th2
3:9](../kjv/th2003.htm#009); [Ti1 4:12](../kjv/ti1004.htm#012).md). It
properly means a "model" or "pattern" or "mould" into which clay or wax
was pressed, that it might take the figure or exact shape of the mould.
The word "type" is generally used to denote a resemblance between
something present and something future, which is called the "antitype."
