<span id="000">**Cabins**</span> Only in [Jer
37:16](../kjv/jer037.htm#016) (R.V., "cells".md), arched vaults or recesses
off a passage or room; cells for the closer confinement of prisoners.

<span id="001">**Cabul**</span> How little! as nothing. (1.) A town on
the eastern border of Asher ([Jos 19:27](../kjv/jos019.htm#027).md),
probably one of the towns given by Solomon to Hiram; the modern Kabul,
some 8 miles east of Accho, on the very borders of Galilee. (2.) A
district in the north-west of Galilee, near to Tyre, containing twenty
cities given to Hiram by Solomon as a reward for various services
rendered to him in building the temple ([Kg1
9:13](../kjv/kg1009.htm#013).md), and as payment of the six score talents
of gold he had borrowed from him. Hiram gave the cities this name
because he was not pleased with the gift, the name signifying "good for
nothing." Hiram seems afterwards to have restored these cities to
Solomon ([Ch2 8:2](../kjv/ch2008.htm#002).md).

<span id="002">**Caesar**</span> The title assumed by the Roman emperors
after Julius Caesar. In the New Testament this title is given to various
emperors as sovereigns of Judaea without their accompanying distinctive
proper names ([Joh 19:15](../kjv/joh019.htm#015.md); [Act
17:7](../kjv/act017.htm#007).md). The Jews paid tribute to Caesar ([Mat
22:17](../kjv/mat022.htm#017).md), and all Roman citizens had the right of
appeal to him ([Act 25:11](../kjv/act025.htm#011).md). The Caesars referred
to in the New Testament are Augustus ([Luk 2:1](../kjv/luk002.htm#001).md),
Tiberius ([Luk 3:1](../kjv/luk003.htm#001.md); [Luk
20:22](../kjv/luk020.htm#022).md), Claudius ([Act
11:28](../kjv/act011.htm#028).md), and Nero ([Act
25:8](../kjv/act025.htm#008); [Phi 4:22](../kjv/phi004.htm#022).md).

<span id="003">**Caesarea**</span> (Palestinae), a city on the shore of
the Mediterranean, on the great road from Tyre to Egypt, about 70 miles
northwest of Jerusalem, at the northern extremity of the plain of
Sharon. It was built by Herod the Great (10 B.C.), who named it after
Caesar Augustus, hence called Caesarea Sebaste (Gr. Sebastos =
"Augustus"), on the site of an old town called "Strato's Tower." It was
the capital of the Roman province of Judaea, the seat of the governors
or procurators, and the headquarters of the Roman troops. It was the
great Gentile city of Palestine, with a spacious artificial harbour. It
was adorned with many buildings of great splendour, after the manner of
the Roman cities of the West. Here Cornelius the centurion was converted
through the instrumentality of Peter ([Act 10:1](../kjv/act010.htm#001.md),
[Act 10:24](../kjv/act010.htm#024).md), and thus for the first time the
door of faith was opened to the Gentiles. Philip the evangelist resided
here with his four daughters ([Act 21:8](../kjv/act021.htm#008).md). From
this place Saul sailed for his native Tarsus when forced to flee from
Jerusalem ([Act 9:30](../kjv/act009.htm#030).md), and here he landed when
returning from his second missionary journey ([Act
18:22](../kjv/act018.htm#022).md). He remained as a prisoner here for two
years before his voyage to Rome ([Act 24:27](../kjv/act024.htm#027.md);
[Act 25:1](../kjv/act025.htm#001), [Act 25:4](../kjv/act025.htm#004.md),
[Act 25:6](../kjv/act025.htm#006), [Act 25:13](../kjv/act025.htm#013).md).
Here on a "set day," when games were celebrated in the theatre in honour
of the emperor Claudius, Herod Agrippa I. appeared among the people in
great pomp, and in the midst of the idolatrous homage paid to him was
suddenly smitten by an angel, and carried out a dying man. He was "eaten
of worms" ([Act 12:19](../kjv/act012.htm#019).md), thus perishing by the
same loathsome disease as his granfather, Herod the Great. It still
retains its ancient name Kaiseriyeh, but is now desolate. "The present
inhabitants of the ruins are snakes, scorpions, lizards, wild boars, and
jackals." It is described as the most desolate city of all Palestine.

<span id="004">**Caesara Philippi**</span> A city on the northeast of
the marshy plain of el-Huleh, 120 miles north of Jerusalem, and 20 miles
north of the Sea of Galilee, at the "upper source" of the Jordan, and
near the base of Mount Hermon. It is mentioned in [Mat
16:13](../kjv/mat016.htm#013) and [Mar 8:27](../kjv/mar008.htm#027.md) as
the northern limit of our Lord's public ministry. According to some its
original name was Baal-Gad ([Jos 11:17](../kjv/jos011.htm#017).md), or
Baal-Hermon ([Jdg 3:3](../kjv/jdg003.htm#003.md); [Ch1
5:23](../kjv/ch1005.htm#023).md), when it was a Canaanite sanctuary of
Baal. It was afterwards called Panium or Paneas, from a deep cavern full
of water near the town. This name was given to the cavern by the Greeks
of the Macedonian kingdom of Antioch because of its likeness to the
grottos of Greece, which were always associated with the worship of
their god Pan. Its modern name is Banias. Here Herod built a temple,
which he dedicated to Augustus Caesar. This town was afterwards enlarged
and embellished by Herod Philip, the tetrarch of Trachonitis, of whose
territory it formed a part, and was called by him Caesarea Philippi,
partly after his own name, and partly after that of the emperor Tiberius
Caesar. It is thus distinguished from the Caesarea of Palestine. (See
JORDAN.)

<span id="005">**Cage**</span> (Heb. kelub' , [Jer
5:27](../kjv/jer005.htm#027.md), marg. "coop;" rendered "basket" in [Amo
8:1](../kjv/amo008.htm#001).md), a basket of wicker-work in which birds
were placed after being caught. In [Rev 18:2](../kjv/rev018.htm#002.md) it
is the rendering of the Greek phulake , properly a prison or place of
confinement.

<span id="006">**Caiaphas**</span> The Jewish high priest (A.D. 27-36)
at the beginning of our Lord's public ministry, in the reign of Tiberius
([Luk 3:2](../kjv/luk003.htm#002).md), and also at the time of his
condemnation and crucifixion ([Mat 26:3](../kjv/mat026.htm#003.md), [Mat
26:57](../kjv/mat026.htm#057); [Joh 11:49](../kjv/joh011.htm#049.md); [Joh
18:13](../kjv/joh018.htm#013), [Joh 18:14](../kjv/joh018.htm#014).md). He
held this office during the whole of Pilate's administration. His wife
was the daughter of Annas, who had formerly been high priest, and was
probably the vicar or deputy (Heb. sagan ) of Caiaphas. He was of the
sect of the Sadducees ([Act 5:17](../kjv/act005.htm#017).md), and was a
member of the council when he gave his opinion that Jesus should be put
to death "for the people, and that the whole nation perish not" ([Joh
11:50](../kjv/joh011.htm#050).md). In these words he unconsciously uttered
a prophecy. "Like Saul, he was a prophet in spite of himself." Caiaphas
had no power to inflict the punishment of death, and therefore Jesus was
sent to Pilate, the Roman governor, that he might duly pronounce the
sentence against him ([Mat 27:2](../kjv/mat027.htm#002.md); [Joh
18:28](../kjv/joh018.htm#028).md). At a later period his hostility to the
gospel is still manifest ([Act 4:6](../kjv/act004.htm#006).md). (See
ANNAS.)

<span id="007">**Cain**</span> A possession; a spear. (1.) The
first-born son of Adam and Eve (Gen. 4). He became a tiller of the
ground, as his brother Abel followed the pursuits of pastoral life. He
was "a sullen, selfwilled, haughty, vindictive man; wanting the
religious element in his character, and defiant even in his attitude
towards God." It came to pass "in process of time" (marg. "at the end of
days"), i.e., probably on the Sabbath, that the two brothers presented
their offerings to the Lord. Abel's offering was of the "firstlings of
his flock and of the fat," while Cain's was "of the fruit of the
ground." Abel's sacrifice was "more excellent" ([Heb
11:4](../kjv/heb011.htm#004).md) than Cain's, and was accepted by God. On
this account Cain was "very wroth," and cherished feelings of murderous
hatred against his brother, and was at length guilty of the desperate
outrage of putting him to death ([Jo1 3:12](../kjv/jo1003.htm#012).md). For
this crime he was expelled from Eden, and henceforth led the life of an
exile, bearing upon him some mark which God had set upon him in answer
to his own cry for mercy, so that thereby he might be protected from the
wrath of his fellow-men; or it may be that God only gave him some sign
to assure him that he would not be slain ([Gen
4:15](../kjv/gen004.htm#015).md). Doomed to be a wanderer and a fugitive in
the earth, he went forth into the "land of Nod", i.e., the land of
"exile", which is said to have been in the "east of Eden," and there he
builded a city, the first we read of, and called it after his son's
name, Enoch. His descendants are enumerated to the sixth generation.
They gradually degenerated in their moral and spiritual condition till
they became wholly corrupt before God. This corruption prevailed, and at
length the Deluge was sent by God to prevent the final triumph of evil.
(See ABEL.) (2.) A town of the Kenites, a branch of the Midianites ([Jos
15:57](../kjv/jos015.htm#057).md), on the east edge of the mountain above
Engedi; probably the "nest in a rock" mentioned by Balaam ([Num
24:21](../kjv/num024.htm#021).md). It is identified with the modern Yekin,
3 miles south-east of Hebron.

<span id="008">**Cainan**</span> Possession; smith. (1.) The fourth
antediluvian patriarch, the eldest son of Enos. He was 70 years old at
the birth of his eldest son Mahalaleel, after which he lived 840 years
([Gen 5:9](../kjv/gen005.htm#009).md), and was 910 years old when he died.
He is also called Kenan ([Ch1 1:2](../kjv/ch1001.htm#002)). (2..md) The son
of Arphaxad ([Luk 3:36](../kjv/luk003.htm#036).md). He is nowhere named in
the Old Testament. He is usually called the "second Cainan."

<span id="009">**Cake**</span> Cakes made of wheat or barley were
offered in the temple. They were salted, but unleavened ([Exo
29:2](../kjv/exo029.htm#002); [Lev 2:4](../kjv/lev002.htm#004).md). In
idolatrous worship thin cakes or wafers were offered "to the queen of
heaven" ([Jer 7:18](../kjv/jer007.htm#018.md); [Jer
44:19](../kjv/jer044.htm#019).md). Pancakes are described in [Sa2
13:8](../kjv/sa2013.htm#008), [Sa2 13:9](../kjv/sa2013.htm#009.md). Cakes
mingled with oil and baked in the oven are mentioned in [Lev
2:4](../kjv/lev002.htm#004.md), and "wafers unleavened anointed with oil,"
in [Exo 29:2](../kjv/exo029.htm#002); [Lev 8:26](../kjv/lev008.htm#026.md);
[Ch1 23:29](../kjv/ch1023.htm#029.md). "Cracknels," a kind of crisp cakes,
were among the things Jeroboam directed his wife to take with her when
she went to consult Ahijah the prophet at Shiloh ([Kg1
14:3](../kjv/kg1014.htm#003).md). Such hard cakes were carried by the
Gibeonites when they came to Joshua ([Jos 9:5](../kjv/jos009.htm#005.md),
[Jos 9:12](../kjv/jos009.htm#012).md). They described their bread as
"mouldy;" but the Hebrew word nikuddim, here used, ought rather to be
rendered "hard as biscuit." It is rendered "cracknels" in [Kg1
14:3](../kjv/kg1014.htm#003.md). The ordinary bread, when kept for a few
days, became dry and excessively hard. The Gibeonites pointed to this
hardness of their bread as an evidence that they had come a long
journey. We read also of honey-cakes ([Exo
16:31](../kjv/exo016.htm#031).md), "cakes of figs" ([Sa1
25:18](../kjv/sa1025.htm#018).md), "cake" as denoting a whole piece of
bread ([Kg1 17:12](../kjv/kg1017.htm#012).md), and "a \[round\] cake of
barley bread" ([Jdg 7:13](../kjv/jdg007.htm#013).md). In Lev. 2 is a list
of the different kinds of bread and cakes which were fit for offerings.
