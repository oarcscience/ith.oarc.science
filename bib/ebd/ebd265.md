<span id="000">**Nahaliel**</span> Possession, or valley of God, one of
the encampments of the Israelites in the wilderness ([Num
21:19](../kjv/num021.htm#019).md), on the confines of Moab. This is
identified with the ravine of the Zerka M'ain , the ancient Callirhoe,
the hot springs on the east of the Jordan, not far from the Dead Sea.

<span id="001">**Nahallal**</span> Pasture, a city in Zebulun on the
border of Issachar ([Jos 19:15](../kjv/jos019.htm#015).md), the same as
Nahalol ([Jdg 1:30](../kjv/jdg001.htm#030).md). It was given to the
Levites. It has been by some identified with Malul in the plain of
Esdraelon, 4 miles from Nazareth.

<span id="002">**Naharai**</span> Snorer, a Berothite, one of David's
heroes, and armour-bearer of Joab ([Ch1 11:39](../kjv/ch1011.htm#039).md).

<span id="003">**Nahash**</span> Serpent. (1.) King of the Ammonites in
the time of Saul. The inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead having been exposed
to great danger from Nahash, sent messengers to Gibeah to inform Saul of
their extremity. He promptly responded to the call, and gathering
together an army he marched against Nahash. "And it came to pass that
they which remained were scattered, so that two of them \[the
Ammonites\] were not left together" ([Sa1 11:1](../kjv/sa1011.htm#001).md).
(2.) Another king of the Ammonites of the same name is mentioned, who
showed kindness to David during his wanderings ([Sa2
10:2](../kjv/sa2010.htm#002).md). On his death David sent an embassy of
sympathy to Hanun, his son and successor, at Rabbah Ammon, his capital.
The grievous insult which was put upon these ambassadors led to a war
against the Ammonites, who, with their allies the Syrians, were
completely routed in a battle fought at "the entering in of the gate,"
probably of Medeba ([Sa2 10:6](../kjv/sa2010.htm#006).md). Again Hadarezer
rallied the Syrian host, which was totally destroyed by the Israelite
army under Joab in a decisive battle fought at Helam ([Sa2
10:17](../kjv/sa2010.htm#017).md), near to Hamath ([Ch1
18:3](../kjv/ch1018.htm#003).md). "So the Syrians feared to help the
children of Ammon any more" ([Sa2 10:19](../kjv/sa2010.htm#019)). (3..md)
The father of Amasa, who was commander-in-chief of Abasolom's army ([Sa2
17:25](../kjv/sa2017.htm#025).md). Jesse's wife had apparently been first
married to this man, to whom she bore Abigail and Zeruiah, who were thus
David's sisters, but only on the mother's side ([Ch1
2:16](../kjv/ch1002.htm#016).md).

<span id="004">**Nahath**</span> Rest. (1.) One of the four sons of
Reuel, the son of Esau ([Gen 36:13](../kjv/gen036.htm#013.md), [Gen
36:17](../kjv/gen036.htm#017)). (2..md) A Kohathite Levite ([Ch1
6:26](../kjv/ch1006.htm#026)). (3..md) A Levite, one of the overseers of
the sacred offerings of the temple ([Ch2 31:13](../kjv/ch2031.htm#013).md).

<span id="005">**Nabi**</span> Hidden, one of the twelve spies sent out
to explore the land of Canaan ([Num 13:14](../kjv/num013.htm#014).md).

<span id="006">**Nahor**</span> Snorting. (1.) The father of Terah, who
was the father of Abraham ([Gen 11:22](../kjv/gen011.htm#022.md); [Luk
3:34](../kjv/luk003.htm#034)). (2..md) A son of Terah, and elder brother of
Abraham ([Gen 11:26](../kjv/gen011.htm#026.md), [Gen
11:27](../kjv/gen011.htm#027); [Jos 24:2](../kjv/jos024.htm#002), R.V..md).
He married Milcah, the daughter of his brother Haran, and remained in
the land of his nativity on the east of the river Euphrates at Haran
([Gen 11:27](../kjv/gen011.htm#027).md). A correspondence was maintained
between the family of Abraham in Canaan and the relatives in the old
ancestral home at Haran till the time of Jacob. When Jacob fled from
Haran all intercourse between the two branches of the family came to an
end ([Gen 31:55](../kjv/gen031.htm#055).md). His grand-daughter Rebekah
became Isaac's wife ([Gen 24:67](../kjv/gen024.htm#067).md).

<span id="007">**Nahshon**</span> Sorcerer, the son of Aminadab, and
prince of the children of Judah at the time of the first numbering of
the tribes in the wilderness ([Exo 6:23](../kjv/exo006.htm#023).md). His
sister Elisheba was the wife of Aaron. He died in the wilderness ([Num
26:64](../kjv/num026.htm#064), [Num 26:65](../kjv/num026.htm#065).md). His
name occurs in the Greek form Naasson in the genealogy of Christ (Matt,
[Job 1:4](../kjv/job001.htm#004); [Luk 3:32](../kjv/luk003.htm#032).md).

<span id="008">**Nahum**</span> Consolation, the seventh of the
so-called minor prophets, an Elkoshite. All we know of him is recorded
in the book of his prophecies. He was probably a native of Galilee, and
after the deportation of the ten tribes took up his residence in
Jerusalem. Others think that Elkosh was the name of a place on the east
bank of the Tigris, and that Nahum dwelt there.

<span id="009">**Nahum, Book of**</span> Nahum prophesied, according to
some, in the beginning of the reign of Ahaz (743 B.C.). Others, however,
think that his prophecies are to be referred to the latter half of the
reign of Hezekiah (about 709 B.C.). This is the more probable opinion,
internal evidences leading to that conclusion. Probably the book was
written in Jerusalem (soon after 709 B.C.), where he witnessed the
invasion of Sennacherib and the destruction of his host ([Kg2
19:35](../kjv/kg2019.htm#035).md). The subject of this prophecy is the
approaching complete and final destruction of Nineveh, the capital of
the great and at that time flourishing Assyrian empire. Assur-bani-pal
was at the height of his glory. Nineveh was a city of vast extent, and
was then the centre of the civilization and commerce of the world, a
"bloody city all full of lies and robbery" ([Nah
3:1](../kjv/nah003.htm#001).md), for it had robbed and plundered all the
neighbouring nations. It was strongly fortified on every side, bidding
defiance to every enemy; yet it was to be utterly destroyed as a
punishment for the great wickedness of its inhabitants. Jonah had
already uttered his message of warning, and Nahum was followed by
Zephaniah, who also predicted ([Zep 2:4](../kjv/zep002.htm#004).md) the
destruction of the city, predictions which were remarkably fulfilled
(625 B.C.) when Nineveh was destroyed apparently by fire, and the
Assyrian empire came to an end, an event which changed the face of Asia.
(See NINEVEH.)
