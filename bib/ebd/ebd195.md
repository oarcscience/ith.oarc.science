<span id="000">**Jadon**</span> Judge, a Meronothite who assisted in
rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem ([Neh 3:7](../kjv/neh003.htm#007).md).

<span id="001">**Jael**</span> Mountain-goat, the wife of Heber the
Kenite ([Jdg 4:17](../kjv/jdg004.htm#017).md). When the Canaanites were
defeated by Barak, Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, fled and sought
refuge with the friendly tribe of Heber, beneath the oaks of Zaanaim. As
he drew near, Jael invited him to enter her tent. He did so, and as he
lay wearied on the floor he fell into a deep sleep. She then took in her
left hand one of the great wooden pins ("nail") which fastened down the
cords of the tent, and in her right hand the mallet, or "hammer," used
for driving it into the ground, and stealthily approaching her sleeping
guest, with one well-directed blow drove the nail through his temples
into the earth ([Jdg 5:27](../kjv/jdg005.htm#027).md). She then led Barak,
who was in pursuit, into her tent, and boastfully showed him what she
had done. (See SISERA; DEBORAH.)
