<span id="000">**Kelita**</span> Dwarf, a Levite who assisted Ezra in
expounding the law to the people ([Neh 8:7](../kjv/neh008.htm#007); [Neh
10:10](../kjv/neh010.htm#010)).

<span id="001">**Kemuel**</span> Helper of God, or assembly of God. (1.)
The third son of Nahor ([Gen 22:21](../kjv/gen022.htm#021)). (2.) Son of
Shiphtan, appointed on behalf of the tribe of Ephraim to partition the
land of Canaan ([Num 34:24](../kjv/num034.htm#024)). (3.) A Levite ([Ch1
27:17](../kjv/ch1027.htm#017)).

<span id="002">**Kenath**</span> Possession, a city of Gilead. It was
captured by Nobah, who called it by his own name ([Num
32:42](../kjv/num032.htm#042)). It has been identified with Kunawat, on
the slopes of Jebel Hauran (Mount Bashan), 60 miles east from the south
end of the Sea of Galilee.

<span id="003">**Kenaz**</span> Hunter. (1.) One of the sons of Eliphaz,
the son of Esau. He became the chief of an Edomitish tribe ([Gen
36:11](../kjv/gen036.htm#011), [Gen 36:15](../kjv/gen036.htm#015), [Gen
36:42](../kjv/gen036.htm#042)). (2.) Caleb's younger brother, and father
of Othniel ([Jos 15:17](../kjv/jos015.htm#017)), whose family was of
importance in Israel down to the time of David ([Ch1
27:15](../kjv/ch1027.htm#015)). Some think that Othniel ([Jdg
1:13](../kjv/jdg001.htm#013)), and not Kenaz, was Caleb's brother. (3.)
Caleb's grandson ([Ch1 4:15](../kjv/ch1004.htm#015)).

<span id="004">**Kenites**</span> Smiths, the name of a tribe inhabiting
the desert lying between southern Palestine and the mountains of Sinai.
Jethro was of this tribe ([Jdg 1:16](../kjv/jdg001.htm#016)). He is
called a "Midianite" ([Num 10:29](../kjv/num010.htm#029)), and hence it
is concluded that the Midianites and the Kenites were the same tribe.
They were wandering smiths, "the gypsies and traveling tinkers of the
old Oriental world. They formed an important guild in an age when the
art of metallurgy was confined to a few" (Sayce's Races, etc.). They
showed kindness to Israel in their journey through the wilderness. They
accompanied them in their march as far as Jericho ([Jdg
1:16](../kjv/jdg001.htm#016)), and then returned to their old haunts
among the Amalekites, in the desert to the south of Judah. They
sustained afterwards friendly relations with the Israelites when settled
in Canaan ([Jdg 4:11](../kjv/jdg004.htm#011), [Jdg
4:17](../kjv/jdg004.htm#017); [Sa1 27:10](../kjv/sa1027.htm#010); [Sa1
30:29](../kjv/sa1030.htm#029)). The Rechabites belonged to this tribe
([Ch1 2:55](../kjv/ch1002.htm#055)) and in the days of Jeremiah ([Jer
35:7](../kjv/jer035.htm#007)) are referred to as following their nomad
habits. Saul bade them depart from the Amalekites ([Sa1
15:6](../kjv/sa1015.htm#006)) when, in obedience to the divine
commission, he was about to "smite Amalek." And his reason is, "for ye
showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of
Egypt." Thus "God is not unrighteous to forget the kindness shown to his
people; but they shall be remembered another day, at the farthest in the
great day, and recompensed in the resurrection of the just" (M. Henry's
Commentary). They are mentioned for the last time in Scripture in [Sa1
27:10](../kjv/sa1027.htm#010); compare [Sa1
30:20](../kjv/sa1030.htm#020).

<span id="005">**Kenizzite**</span> (1.) The name of a tribe referred to
in the covenant God made with Abraham ([Gen
15:19](../kjv/gen015.htm#019)). They are not mentioned among the
original inhabitants of Canaan ([Exo 3:8](../kjv/exo003.htm#008); [Jos
3:10](../kjv/jos003.htm#010)), and probably they inhabited some part of
Arabia, in the confines of Syria. (2.) A designation given to Caleb
(R.V., [Num 32:12](../kjv/num032.htm#012); A.V., Kenezite).

<span id="006">**Kerchief**</span> Mentioned only [Eze
13:18](../kjv/eze013.htm#018), [Eze 13:21](../kjv/eze013.htm#021), as an
article of apparel or ornament applied to the head of the idolatrous
women of Israel. The precise meaning of the word is uncertain. It
appears to have been a long loose shawl, such as Oriental women wrap
themselves in ([Rut 3:15](../kjv/rut003.htm#015); [Isa
3:22](../kjv/isa003.htm#022)). Some think that it was a long veil or
head-dress, denoting by its form the position of those who wore it.

<span id="007">**Keren-happuch**</span> Horn of the face-paint =
cosmetic-box, the name of Job's third daughter ([Job
42:14](../kjv/job042.htm#014)), born after prosperity had returned to
him.

<span id="008">**Kerioth**</span> Cities. (1.) A town in the south of
Judah ([Jos 15:25](../kjv/jos015.htm#025)). Judas the traitor was
probably a native of this place, and hence his name Iscariot. It has
been identified with the ruins of el-Kureitein, about 10 miles south of
Hebron. (See HAZOR \[4\]). (2.) A city of Moab ([Jer
48:24](../kjv/jer048.htm#024), [Jer 48:41](../kjv/jer048.htm#041)),
called Kirioth ([Amo 2:2](../kjv/amo002.htm#002)).

<span id="009">**Kesitah**</span> ([Gen 33:19](../kjv/gen033.htm#019),
R.V., marg., a Hebrew word, rendered, A.V., pl. "pieces of money,"
marg., "lambs;" [Jos 24:32](../kjv/jos024.htm#032), "pieces of silver;"
[Job 42:11](../kjv/job042.htm#011), "piece of money"). The kesitah was
probably a piece of money of a particular weight, cast in the form of a
lamb. The monuments of Egypt show that such weights were used. (See
PIECES.)
