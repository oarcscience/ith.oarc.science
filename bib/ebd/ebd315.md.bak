<span id="000">**Robbery**</span> Practiced by the Ishmaelites ([Gen
16:12](../kjv/gen016.htm#012).md), the Chaldeans and Sabeans ([Job
1:15](../kjv/job001.htm#015), [Job 1:17](../kjv/job001.htm#017).md), and
the men of Shechem ([Jdg 9:25](../kjv/jdg009.htm#025.md). See also [Sa1
27:6](../kjv/sa1027.htm#006); 30; [Hos 4:2](../kjv/hos004.htm#002.md); [Hos
6:9](../kjv/hos006.htm#009).md). Robbers infested Judea in our Lord's time
([Luk 10:30](../kjv/luk010.htm#030); [Joh 18:40](../kjv/joh018.htm#040.md);
[Act 5:36](../kjv/act005.htm#036), [Act 5:37](../kjv/act005.htm#037.md);
[Act 21:38](../kjv/act021.htm#038); [Co2 11:26](../kjv/co2011.htm#026).md).
The words of the Authorized Version, "counted it not robbery to be
equal," etc. ([Phi 2:6](../kjv/phi002.htm#006.md), [Phi
2:7](../kjv/phi002.htm#007).md), are better rendered in the Revised
Version, "counted it not a prize to be on an equality," etc., i.e., "did
not look upon equality with God as a prize which must not slip from his
grasp" = "did not cling with avidity to the prerogatives of his divine
majesty; did not ambitiously display his equality with God." "Robbers of
churches" should be rendered, as in the Revised Version, "of temples."
In the temple at Ephesus there was a great treasure-chamber, and as all
that was laid up there was under the guardianship of the goddess Diana,
to steal from such a place would be sacrilege ([Act
19:37](../kjv/act019.htm#037).md).

<span id="001">**Rock**</span> (Heb. tsur ), employed as a symbol of God
in the Old Testament ([Sa1 2:2](../kjv/sa1002.htm#002.md); [Sa2
22:3](../kjv/sa2022.htm#003); [Isa 17:10](../kjv/isa017.htm#010.md); [Psa
28:1](../kjv/psa028.htm#001); [Psa 31:2](../kjv/psa031.htm#002.md), [Psa
31:3](../kjv/psa031.htm#003); [Psa 89:26](../kjv/psa089.htm#026.md); [Psa
95:1](../kjv/psa095.htm#001).md); also in the New Testament ([Mat
16:18](../kjv/mat016.htm#018); [Rom 9:33](../kjv/rom009.htm#033.md); [Co1
10:4](../kjv/co1010.htm#004)). In [Dan 2:45](../kjv/dan002.htm#045.md) the
Chaldaic form of the Hebrew word is translated "mountain." It ought to
be translated "rock," as in [Hab 1:12](../kjv/hab001.htm#012.md) in the
Revised Version. The "rock" from which the stone is cut there signifies
the divine origin of Christ. (See STONE.)

<span id="002">**Roe**</span> (Heb. tsebi ), properly the gazelle (Arab.
ghazal ), permitted for food ([Deu 14:5](../kjv/deu014.htm#005.md); compare
[Deu 12:15](../kjv/deu012.htm#015), [Deu 12:22](../kjv/deu012.htm#022.md);
[Deu 15:22](../kjv/deu015.htm#022); [Kg1 4:23](../kjv/kg1004.htm#023).md),
noted for its swiftness and beauty and grace of form ([Sa2
2:18](../kjv/sa2002.htm#018); [Ch1 12:8](../kjv/ch1012.htm#008.md); [Sol
2:9](../kjv/sol002.htm#009); [Sol 7:3](../kjv/sol007.htm#003.md); [Sol
8:14](../kjv/sol008.htm#014)). The gazelle (Gazella dorcas.md) is found in
great numbers in Palestine. "Among the gray hills of Galilee it is still
'the roe upon the mountains of Bether,' and I have seen a little troop
of gazelles feeding on the Mount of Olives close to Jerusalem itself"
(Tristram). The Hebrew word ( 'ayyalah ) in [Pro
5:19](../kjv/pro005.htm#019) thus rendered (R.V., "doe".md), is properly
the "wild she-goat," the mountain goat, the ibex. (See [Sa1
24:2](../kjv/sa1024.htm#002); [Psa 104:18](../kjv/psa104.htm#018.md); [Job
39:1](../kjv/job039.htm#001)..md)

<span id="003">**Rogelim**</span> Fullers, a town of Gilead, the
residence of Barzillai the Gileadite ([Sa2
17:27](../kjv/sa2017.htm#027); [Sa2 19:31](../kjv/sa2019.htm#031).md),
probably near to Mahanaim.

<span id="004">**Roll**</span> The common form of ancient books. The
Hebrew word rendered "roll" or "volume" is meghillah, found in [Ezr
6:2](../kjv/ezr006.htm#002); [Psa 40:7](../kjv/psa040.htm#007.md); [Jer
36:2](../kjv/jer036.htm#002), [Jer 36:6](../kjv/jer036.htm#006.md), [Jer
36:23](../kjv/jer036.htm#023), [Jer 36:28](../kjv/jer036.htm#028.md), [Jer
36:29](../kjv/jer036.htm#029); [Eze 2:9](../kjv/eze002.htm#009.md); [Eze
3:1](../kjv/eze003.htm#001); [Zac 5:1](../kjv/zac005.htm#001.md), [Zac
5:2](../kjv/zac005.htm#002.md). "Rolls" (Chald. pl. of sephar,
corresponding to Heb. sepher ) in [Ezr 6:1](../kjv/ezr006.htm#001.md) is
rendered in the Revised Version "archives." In the New Testament the
word "volume" ([Heb 10:7](../kjv/heb010.htm#007); R.V., "roll".md) occurs
as the rendering of the Greek kephalis , meaning the head or top of the
stick or cylinder on which the manuscript was rolled, and hence the
manuscript itself. (See BOOK.)

<span id="005">**Romamti-ezer**</span> Elevation of help, one of the
sons of Heman, "the king's seer in the words of God, to lift up the
horn." He was head of the "four-and-twentieth" course of singers ([Ch1
25:4](../kjv/ch1025.htm#004), [Ch1 25:31](../kjv/ch1025.htm#031).md).

<span id="006">**Romans, Epistle to the**</span> This epistle was
probably written at Corinth. Phoebe ([Rom 16:1](../kjv/rom016.htm#001).md)
of Cenchrea conveyed it to Rome, and Gaius of Corinth entertained the
apostle at the time of his writing it ([Rom
16:23](../kjv/rom016.htm#023); [Co1 1:14](../kjv/co1001.htm#014).md), and
Erastus was chamberlain of the city, i.e., of Corinth ([Ti2
4:20](../kjv/ti2004.htm#020).md). The precise time at which it was written
is not mentioned in the epistle, but it was obviously written when the
apostle was about to "go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints",
i.e., at the close of his second visit to Greece, during the winter
preceding his last visit to that city ([Rom
15:25](../kjv/rom015.htm#025.md); compare [Act
19:21](../kjv/act019.htm#021); [Act 20:2](../kjv/act020.htm#002.md), [Act
20:3](../kjv/act020.htm#003), [Act 20:16](../kjv/act020.htm#016.md); [Co1
16:1](../kjv/co1016.htm#001).md), early in A.D. 58. It is highly probable
that Christianity was planted in Rome by some of those who had been at
Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost ([Act 2:10](../kjv/act002.htm#010).md).
At this time the Jews were very numerous in Rome, and their synagogues
were probably resorted to by Romans also, who in this way became
acquainted with the great facts regarding Jesus as these were reported
among the Jews. Thus a church composed of both Jews and Gentiles was
formed at Rome. Many of the brethren went out to meet Paul on his
approach to Rome. There are evidences that Christians were then in Rome
in considerable numbers, and had probably more than one place of meeting
([Rom 16:14](../kjv/rom016.htm#014.md), [Rom
16:15](../kjv/rom016.htm#015).md). The object of the apostle in writing to
this church was to explain to them the great doctrines of the gospel.
His epistle was a "word in season." Himself deeply impressed with a
sense of the value of the doctrines of salvation, he opens up in a clear
and connected form the whole system of the gospel in its relation both
to Jew and Gentile. This epistle is peculiar in this, that it is a
systematic exposition of the gospel of universal application. The
subject is here treated argumentatively, and is a plea for Gentiles
addressed to Jews. In the Epistle to the Galatians, the same subject is
discussed, but there the apostle pleads his own authority, because the
church in Galatia had been founded by him. After the introduction ([Rom
1:1](../kjv/rom001.htm#001).md), the apostle presents in it divers aspects
and relations the doctrine of justification by faith (Rom. 1:16 - 11:36)
on the ground of the imputed righteousness of Christ. He shows that
salvation is all of grace, and only of grace. This main section of his
letter is followed by various practical exhortations (Rom. 12:1 -
15:13), which are followed by a conclusion containing personal
explanations and salutations, which contain the names of twenty-four
Christians at Rome, a benediction, and a doxology ([Rom
15:14](../kjv/rom015.htm#014).md).

<span id="007">**Rome**</span> The most celebrated city in the world at
the time of Christ. It is said to have been founded 753 B.C.. When the
New Testament was written, Rome was enriched and adorned with the spoils
of the world, and contained a population estimated at 1,200,000, of
which the half were slaves, and including representatives of nearly
every nation then known. It was distinguished for its wealth and luxury
and profligacy. The empire of which it was the capital had then reached
its greatest prosperity. On the day of Pentecost there were in Jerusalem
"strangers from Rome," who doubtless carried with them back to Rome
tidings of that great day, and were instrumental in founding the church
there. Paul was brought to this city a prisoner, where he remained for
two years ([Act 28:30](../kjv/act028.htm#030.md), [Act
28:31](../kjv/act028.htm#031).md) "in his own hired house." While here,
Paul wrote his epistles to the Philippians, to the Ephesians, to the
Colossians, to Philemon, and probably also to the Hebrews. He had during
these years for companions Luke and Aristarchus ([Act
27:2](../kjv/act027.htm#002).md), Timothy ([Phi
1:1](../kjv/phi001.htm#001); [Col 1:1](../kjv/col001.htm#001).md), Tychicus
([Eph 6:21](../kjv/eph006.htm#021).md), Epaphroditus ([Phi
4:18](../kjv/phi004.htm#018).md), and John Mark ([Col
4:10](../kjv/col004.htm#010)). (See PAUL..md) Beneath this city are
extensive galleries, called "catacombs," which were used from about the
time of the apostles (one of the inscriptions found in them bears the
date A.D. 71) for some three hundred years as places of refuge in the
time of persecution, and also of worship and burial. About four thousand
inscriptions have been found in the catacombs. These give an interesting
insight into the history of the church at Rome down to the time of
Constantine.

<span id="008">**Rose**</span> Many varieties of the rose proper are
indigenous to Syria. The famed rose of Damascus is white, but there are
also red and yellow roses. In [Sol 2:1](../kjv/sol002.htm#001.md) and [Isa
35:1](../kjv/isa035.htm#001.md) the Hebrew word habatstseleth (found only
in these passages), rendered "rose" (R.V. marg., "autumn crocus"), is
supposed by some to mean the oleander, by others the sweet-scented
narcissus (a native of Palestine), the tulip, or the daisy; but nothing
definite can be affirmed regarding it. The "rose of Sharon" is probably
the cistus or rock-rose, several species of which abound in Palestine.
"Mount Carmel especially abounds in the cistus, which in April covers
some of the barer parts of the mountain with a glow not inferior to that
of the Scottish heather." (See MYRRH \[2\].)

<span id="009">**Rosh**</span> ([Eze 38:2](../kjv/eze038.htm#002.md), [Eze
38:3](../kjv/eze038.htm#003); [Eze 39:1](../kjv/eze039.htm#001).md) is
rendered "chief" in the Authorized Version. It is left untranslated as a
proper name in the Revised Version. Some have supposed that the Russians
are here meant, as one of the three Scythian tribes of whom Magog was
the prince. They invaded the land of Judah in the days of Josiah.
Herodotus, the Greek historian, says: "For twenty-eight years the
Scythians ruled over Asia, and things were turned upside down by their
violence and contempt." (See BETH-SHEAN.)
