<span id="000">**Michaiah**</span> (1.) The queen-mother of King Abijah
([Ch2 13:2](../kjv/ch2013.htm#002)). (See MAACHAH \[4\]). (2..md) One of
those sent out by Jehoshaphat to instruct the people in the law ([Ch2
17:7](../kjv/ch2017.htm#007)). (3.) [Kg2 22:12](../kjv/kg2022.htm#012.md).
(4.) The son of Gemariah. He reported to the king's officers Jeremiah's
prediction, which he had heard Baruch read ([Jer
36:11](../kjv/jer036.htm#011), [Jer 36:13](../kjv/jer036.htm#013).md) from
his father Gemariah's chamber in the temple. (5.) A Levite ([Neh
12:35](../kjv/neh012.htm#035)). (6..md) A priest ([Neh
12:41](../kjv/neh012.htm#041).md).

<span id="001">**Michal**</span> Rivulet, or who as God?, the younger of
Saul's two daughters by his wife Ahinoam ([Sa1
14:49](../kjv/sa1014.htm#049), [Sa1 14:50](../kjv/sa1014.htm#050).md).
"Attracted by the graces of his person and the gallantry of his conduct,
she fell in love with David and became his wife" ([Sa1
18:20](../kjv/sa1018.htm#020).md). She showed her affection for him by
promoting his escape to Naioth when Saul sought his life ([Sa1
19:12](../kjv/sa1019.htm#012). Compare Ps. 59. See TERAPHIM.md). After this
she did not see David for many years. Meanwhile she was given in
marriage to another man, Phalti or Phaltiel of Gallim ([Sa1
25:44](../kjv/sa1025.htm#044).md), but David afterwards formally reclaimed
her as his lawful wife ([Sa2 3:13](../kjv/sa2003.htm#013).md). The relation
between her and David soon after this was altered. They became alienated
from each other. This happened on that memorable day when the ark was
brought up in great triumph from its temporary resting-place to the Holy
City. In David's conduct on that occasion she saw nothing but a needless
humiliation of the royal dignity ([Ch1 15:29](../kjv/ch1015.htm#029).md).
She remained childless, and thus the races of David and Saul were not
mixed. In [Sa2 21:8](../kjv/sa2021.htm#008.md) her name again occurs, but
the name Merab should probably be here substituted for Michal (Compare
[Sa1 18:19](../kjv/sa1018.htm#019).md).

<span id="002">**Michmash**</span> Something hidden, a town of Benjamin
([Ezr 2:27](../kjv/ezr002.htm#027).md), east of Bethel and south of Migron,
on the road to Jerusalem ([Isa 10:28](../kjv/isa010.htm#028).md). It lay on
the line of march of an invading army from the north, on the north side
of the steep and precipitous Wady es-Suweinit ("valley of the little
thorn-tree" or "the acacia"), and now bears the name of Mukhmas. This
wady is called "the passage of Michmash" ([Sa1
13:23](../kjv/sa1013.htm#023).md). Immediately facing Mukhmas, on the
opposite side of the ravine, is the modern representative of Geba, and
behind this again are Ramah and Gibeah. This was the scene of a great
battle fought between the army of Saul and the Philistines, who were
utterly routed and pursued for some 16 miles towards Philistia as far as
the valley of Aijalon. "The freedom of Benjamin secured at Michmash led
through long years of conflict to the freedom of all its kindred
tribes." The power of Benjamin and its king now steadily increased. A
new spirit and a new hope were now at work in Israel. (See SAUL.)

<span id="003">**Michmethah**</span> Hiding-place, a town in the
northern border of Ephraim and Manasseh, and not far west of Jordan
([Jos 16:6](../kjv/jos016.htm#006); [Jos 17:7](../kjv/jos017.htm#007).md).

<span id="004">**Michri**</span> Prize of Jehovah, a Benjamite, the
father of Uzzi ([Ch1 9:8](../kjv/ch1009.htm#008).md).

<span id="005">**Michtam**</span> Writing; i.e., a poem or song found in
the titles of [Psa 16:1](../kjv/psa016.htm#001.md); 56-60. Some translate
the word "golden", i.e., precious. It is rendered in the LXX. by a word
meaning "tablet inscription" or a "stelograph." The root of the word
means to stamp or grave, and hence it is regarded as denoting a
composition so precious as to be worthy to be engraven on a durable
tablet for preservation; or, as others render, "a psalm precious as
stamped gold," from the word kethem, "fine or stamped gold."

<span id="006">**Middin**</span> Measures, one of the six cities "in the
wilderness," on the west of the Dead Sea, mentioned along with En-gedi
([Jos 15:61](../kjv/jos015.htm#061).md).

<span id="007">**Midian**</span> Strife, the fourth son of Abraham by
Keturah, the father of the Midianites ([Gen
25:2](../kjv/gen025.htm#002); [Ch1 1:32](../kjv/ch1001.htm#032).md).

<span id="008">**Midianite**</span> An Arabian tribe descended from
Midian. They inhabited principally the desert north of the peninsula of
Arabia. The peninsula of Sinai was the pasture ground for their flocks.
They were virtually the rulers of Arabia, being the dominant tribe. Like
all Arabians, they were a nomad people. They early engaged in commercial
pursuits. It was to one of their caravans that Joseph was sold ([Gen
37:28](../kjv/gen037.htm#028), [Gen 37:36](../kjv/gen037.htm#036).md). The
next notice of them is in connection with Moses' flight from Egypt ([Exo
2:15](../kjv/exo002.htm#015).md). Here in Midian Moses became the servant
and afterwards the son-in-law of Reuel or Jethro, the priest. After the
Exodus, the Midianites were friendly to the Israelites so long as they
traversed only their outlying pasture-ground on the west of the Arabah;
but when, having passed the southern end of Edom, they entered into the
land of Midian proper, they joined with Balak, the king of Moab, in a
conspiracy against them ([Num 22:4](../kjv/num022.htm#004).md). Balaam, who
had been sent for to curse Israel, having utterly failed to do so, was
dismissed by the king of Moab; nevertheless he still tarried among the
Midianites, and induced them to enter into correspondence with the
Israelites, so as to bring them into association with them in the
licentious orgies connected with the worship of Baal-Peor. This crafty
counsel prevailed. The Israelites took part in the heathen festival, and
so brought upon themselves a curse indeed. Their apostasy brought upon
them a severe punishment. A plague broke out amongst them, and more than
twenty-four thousand of the people perished ([Num
25:9](../kjv/num025.htm#009).md). But the Midianites were not to be left
unpunished. A terrible vengeance was denounced against them. A thousand
warriors from each tribe, under the leadership of Phinehas, went forth
against them. The Midianites were utterly routed. Their cities were
consumed by fire, five of their kings were put to death, and the whole
nation was destroyed ([Jos 13:21](../kjv/jos013.htm#021.md), [Jos
13:22](../kjv/jos013.htm#022).md). Balaam also perished by the sword,
receiving the "wages of his unrighteousness" ([Num
31:8](../kjv/num031.htm#008); [Pe2 2:15](../kjv/pe2002.htm#015).md). The
whole of the country on the east of Jordan, now conquered by the
Israelites (see SIHON; OG), was divided between the two tribes of Reuben
and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh. Some two hundred and fifty years
after this the Midianites had regained their ancient power, and in
confederation with the Amalekites and the "children of the east" they
made war against their old enemies the Israelites, whom for seven years
they oppressed and held in subjection. They were at length assailed by
Gideon in that ever-memorable battle in the great plain of Esdraelon,
and utterly destroyed ([Jdg 6:1](../kjv/jdg006.htm#001).md). Frequent
allusions are afterwards made to this great victory ([Psa
83:10](../kjv/psa083.htm#010), [Psa 83:12](../kjv/psa083.htm#012.md); [Isa
9:4](../kjv/isa009.htm#004); [Isa 10:6](../kjv/isa010.htm#006).md). They
now wholly pass away from the page of history both sacred and profane.

<span id="009">**Midwife**</span> The two midwives mentioned in [Exo
1:15](../kjv/exo001.htm#015.md) were probably the superintendents of the
whole class.
