<span id="000">**Dragon**</span> (1.) Heb. tannim , plural of tan. The
name of some unknown creature inhabiting desert places and ruins ([Job
30:29](../kjv/job030.htm#029); [Psa 44:19](../kjv/psa044.htm#019.md); [Isa
13:22](../kjv/isa013.htm#022); [Isa 34:13](../kjv/isa034.htm#013.md); [Isa
43:20](../kjv/isa043.htm#020); [Jer 10:22](../kjv/jer010.htm#022.md); [Mic
1:8](../kjv/mic001.htm#008); [Mal 1:3](../kjv/mal001.htm#003).md);
probably, as translated in the Revised Version, the jackal (q.v.). (2.)
Heb. tannin . Some great sea monster ([Jer
51:34](../kjv/jer051.htm#034)). In [Isa 51:9](../kjv/isa051.htm#009.md) it
may denote the crocodile. In [Gen 1:21](../kjv/gen001.htm#021.md) (Heb.
plural tanninim ) the Authorized Version renders "whales," and the
Revised Version "sea monsters." It is rendered "serpent" in [Exo
7:9](../kjv/exo007.htm#009.md). It is used figuratively in [Psa
74:13](../kjv/psa074.htm#013); [Eze 29:3](../kjv/eze029.htm#003.md). In the
New Testament the word "dragon" is found only in [Rev
12:3](../kjv/rev012.htm#003), [Rev 12:4](../kjv/rev012.htm#004.md), [Rev
12:7](../kjv/rev012.htm#007), [Rev 12:9](../kjv/rev012.htm#009.md), [Rev
12:16](../kjv/rev012.htm#016), [Rev 12:17](../kjv/rev012.htm#017.md), etc.,
and is there used metaphorically of "Satan." (See WHALE.)

<span id="001">**Dragon Well**</span> ([Neh
2:13](../kjv/neh002.htm#013).md), supposed by some to be identical with the
Pool of Gihon.

<span id="002">**Dram**</span> The Authorized Version understood the
word 'adarkonim ([Ch1 29:7](../kjv/ch1029.htm#007.md); [Ezr
8:27](../kjv/ezr008.htm#027).md), and the similar word darkomnim ([Ezr
2:69](../kjv/ezr002.htm#069); [Neh 7:70](../kjv/neh007.htm#070).md), as
equivalent to the Greek silver coin the drachma . But the Revised
Version rightly regards it as the Greek dareikos , a Persian gold coin
(the daric ) of the value of about 1 pound, 2 shekel, which was first
struck by Darius, the son of Hystaspes, and was current in Western Asia
long after the fall of the Persian empire. (See DARIC.)

<span id="003">**Draught-house**</span> ([Kg2
10:27](../kjv/kg2010.htm#027).md). Jehu ordered the temple of Baal to be
destroyed, and the place to be converted to the vile use of receiving
offal or ordure. (Compare [Mat 15:17](../kjv/mat015.htm#017)..md)

<span id="004">**Drawer of Water**</span> ([Deu
29:11](../kjv/deu029.htm#011); [Jos 9:21](../kjv/jos009.htm#021.md), [Jos
9:23](../kjv/jos009.htm#023).md), a servile employment to which the
Gibeonites were condemned.

<span id="005">**Dream**</span> God has frequently made use of dreams in
communicating his will to men. The most remarkable instances of this are
recorded in the history of Jacob ([Gen 28:12](../kjv/gen028.htm#012.md);
[Gen 31:10](../kjv/gen031.htm#010).md), Laban ([Gen
31:24](../kjv/gen031.htm#024).md), Joseph ([Gen
37:9](../kjv/gen037.htm#009)), Gideon (Judg. 7.md), and Solomon ([Kg1
3:5](../kjv/kg1003.htm#005).md). Other significant dreams are also
recorded, such as those of Abimelech ([Gen
20:3](../kjv/gen020.htm#003).md), Pharaoh's chief butler and baker ([Gen
40:5](../kjv/gen040.htm#005).md), Pharaoh ([Gen
41:1](../kjv/gen041.htm#001).md), the Midianites ([Jdg
7:13](../kjv/jdg007.htm#013).md), Nebuchadnezzar ([Dan
2:1](../kjv/dan002.htm#001); [Dan 4:10](../kjv/dan004.htm#010.md), [Dan
4:18](../kjv/dan004.htm#018).md), the wise men from the east ([Mat
2:12](../kjv/mat002.htm#012).md), and Pilate's wife ([Mat
27:19](../kjv/mat027.htm#019).md). To Joseph "the Lord appeared in a
dream," and gave him instructions regarding the infant Jesus ([Mat
1:20](../kjv/mat001.htm#020); [Mat 2:12](../kjv/mat002.htm#012.md), [Mat
2:13](../kjv/mat002.htm#013), [Mat 2:19](../kjv/mat002.htm#019).md). In a
vision of the night a "man of Macedonia" stood before Paul and said,
"Come over into Macedonia and help us" ([Act
16:9](../kjv/act016.htm#009.md); see also [Act
18:9](../kjv/act018.htm#009); [Act 27:23](../kjv/act027.htm#023).md).

<span id="006">**Dredge**</span> ([Job 24:6](../kjv/job024.htm#006).md).
See CORN.

<span id="007">**Dregs**</span> ([Psa 75:8](../kjv/psa075.htm#008.md); [Isa
51:17](../kjv/isa051.htm#017), [Isa 51:22](../kjv/isa051.htm#022).md), the
lees of wine which settle at the bottom of the vessel.

<span id="008">**Dress**</span> (1.) Materials used. The earliest and
simplest an apron of fig-leaves sewed together ([Gen
3:7](../kjv/gen003.htm#007).md); then skins of animals ([Gen
3:21](../kjv/gen003.htm#021).md). Elijah's dress was probably the skin of a
sheep ([Kg2 1:8](../kjv/kg2001.htm#008).md). The Hebrews were early
acquainted with the art of weaving hair into cloth ([Exo
26:7](../kjv/exo026.htm#007); [Exo 35:6](../kjv/exo035.htm#006).md), which
formed the sackcloth of mourners. This was the material of John the
Baptist's robe ([Mat 3:4](../kjv/mat003.htm#004).md). Wool was also woven
into garments ([Lev 13:47](../kjv/lev013.htm#047.md); [Deu
22:11](../kjv/deu022.htm#011); [Eze 34:3](../kjv/eze034.htm#003.md); [Job
31:20](../kjv/job031.htm#020); [Pro 27:26](../kjv/pro027.htm#026).md). The
Israelites probably learned the art of weaving linen when they were in
Egypt ([Ch1 4:21](../kjv/ch1004.htm#021).md). Fine linen was used in the
vestments of the high priest ([Exo 28:5](../kjv/exo028.htm#005).md), as
well as by the rich ([Gen 41:42](../kjv/gen041.htm#042.md); [Pro
31:22](../kjv/pro031.htm#022); [Luk 16:19](../kjv/luk016.htm#019).md). The
use of mixed material, as wool and flax, was forbidden ([Lev
19:19](../kjv/lev019.htm#019); [Deu 22:11](../kjv/deu022.htm#011)). (2..md)
Colour. The prevailing colour was the natural white of the material
used, which was sometimes rendered purer by the fuller's art ([Psa
104:1](../kjv/psa104.htm#001), [Psa 104:2](../kjv/psa104.htm#002.md); [Isa
63:3](../kjv/isa063.htm#003); [Mar 9:3](../kjv/mar009.htm#003).md). The
Hebrews were acquainted with the art of dyeing ([Gen
37:3](../kjv/gen037.htm#003), [Gen 37:23](../kjv/gen037.htm#023).md).
Various modes of ornamentation were adopted in the process of weaving
([Exo 28:6](../kjv/exo028.htm#006); [Exo 26:1](../kjv/exo026.htm#001.md),
[Exo 26:31](../kjv/exo026.htm#031); [Exo 35:25](../kjv/exo035.htm#025).md),
and by needle-work ([Jdg 5:30](../kjv/jdg005.htm#030.md); [Psa
45:13](../kjv/psa045.htm#013).md). Dyed robes were imported from foreign
countries, particularly from Phoenicia ([Zep
1:8](../kjv/zep001.htm#008).md). Purple and scarlet robes were the marks of
the wealthy ([Luk 16:19](../kjv/luk016.htm#019.md); [Sa2
1:24](../kjv/sa2001.htm#024)). (3..md) Form. The robes of men and women
were not very much different in form from each other. (a) The "coat"
(kethoneth), of wool, cotton, or linen, was worn by both sexes. It was a
closely-fitting garment, resembling in use and form our shirt ([Joh
19:23](../kjv/joh019.htm#023).md). It was kept close to the body by a
girdle ([Joh 21:7](../kjv/joh021.htm#007).md). A person wearing this "coat"
alone was described as naked ([Sa1 19:24](../kjv/sa1019.htm#024.md); [Isa
20:2](../kjv/isa020.htm#002); [Kg2 6:30](../kjv/kg2006.htm#030.md); [Joh
21:7](../kjv/joh021.htm#007).md); deprived of it he would be absolutely
naked. (b) A linen cloth or wrapper (sadin) of fine linen, used somewhat
as a night-shirt ([Mar 14:51](../kjv/mar014.htm#051).md). It is mentioned
in [Jdg 14:12](../kjv/jdg014.htm#012.md), [Jdg
14:13](../kjv/jdg014.htm#013), and rendered there "sheets." (c.md) An upper
tunic (meil), longer than the "coat" ([Sa1 2:19](../kjv/sa1002.htm#019.md);
[Sa1 24:4](../kjv/sa1024.htm#004); [Sa1 28:14](../kjv/sa1028.htm#014).md).
In [Sa1 28:14](../kjv/sa1028.htm#014.md) it is the mantle in which Samuel
was enveloped; in [Sa1 24:4](../kjv/sa1024.htm#004.md) it is the "robe"
under which Saul slept. The disciples were forbidden to wear two "coats"
([Mat 10:10](../kjv/mat010.htm#010); [Luk 9:3](../kjv/luk009.htm#003).md).
(d) The usual outer garment consisted of a piece of woolen cloth like a
Scotch plaid, either wrapped round the body or thrown over the shoulders
like a shawl, with the ends hanging down in front, or it might be thrown
over the head so as to conceal the face ([Sa2
15:30](../kjv/sa2015.htm#030); [Est 6:12](../kjv/est006.htm#012).md). It
was confined to the waist by a girdle, and the fold formed by the
overlapping of the robe served as a pocket ([Kg2
4:39](../kjv/kg2004.htm#039); [Psa 79:12](../kjv/psa079.htm#012.md); [Hag
2:12](../kjv/hag002.htm#012); [Pro 17:23](../kjv/pro017.htm#023.md); [Pro
21:14](../kjv/pro021.htm#014).md). Female dress. The "coat" was common to
both sexes ([Sol 5:3](../kjv/sol005.htm#003).md). But peculiar to females
were (1.) the "veil" or "wimple," a kind of shawl ([Rut
3:15](../kjv/rut003.htm#015.md); rendered "mantle," R.V., [Isa
3:22](../kjv/isa003.htm#022)); (2..md) the "mantle," also a species of
shawl ([Isa 3:22](../kjv/isa003.htm#022)); (3..md) a "veil," probably a
light summer dress ([Gen 24:65](../kjv/gen024.htm#065)); (4..md) a
"stomacher," a holiday dress ([Isa 3:24](../kjv/isa003.htm#024).md). The
outer garment terminated in an ample fringe or border, which concealed
the feet ([Isa 47:2](../kjv/isa047.htm#002.md); [Jer
13:22](../kjv/jer013.htm#022).md). The dress of the Persians is described
in [Dan 3:21](../kjv/dan003.htm#021.md). The reference to the art of sewing
are few, inasmuch as the garments generally came forth from the loom
ready for being worn, and all that was required in the making of clothes
devolved on the women of a family ([Pro 31:22](../kjv/pro031.htm#022.md);
[Act 9:39](../kjv/act009.htm#039).md). Extravagance in dress is referred to
in [Jer 4:30](../kjv/jer004.htm#030.md); [Eze
16:10](../kjv/eze016.htm#010); [Zep 1:8](../kjv/zep001.htm#008.md) (R.V.,
"foreign apparel"); [Ti1 2:9](../kjv/ti1002.htm#009.md); [Pe1
3:3](../kjv/pe1003.htm#003.md). Rending the robes was expressive of grief
([Gen 37:29](../kjv/gen037.htm#029.md), [Gen
37:34](../kjv/gen037.htm#034).md), fear ([Kg1
21:27](../kjv/kg1021.htm#027).md), indignation ([Kg2
5:7](../kjv/kg2005.htm#007).md), or despair ([Jdg
11:35](../kjv/jdg011.htm#035); [Est 4:1](../kjv/est004.htm#001).md).
Shaking the garments, or shaking the dust from off them, was a sign of
renunciation ([Act 18:6](../kjv/act018.htm#006).md); wrapping them round
the head, of awe ([Kg1 19:13](../kjv/kg1019.htm#013).md) or grief ([Sa2
15:30](../kjv/sa2015.htm#030.md); casting them off, of excitement ([Act
22:23](../kjv/act022.htm#023).md); laying hold of them, of supplication
([Sa1 15:27](../kjv/sa1015.htm#027).md). In the case of traveling, the
outer garments were girded up ([Kg1 18:46](../kjv/kg1018.htm#046).md). They
were thrown aside also when they would impede action ([Mar
10:50](../kjv/mar010.htm#050); [Joh 13:4](../kjv/joh013.htm#004.md); [Act
7:58](../kjv/act007.htm#058).md).

<span id="009">**Drink**</span> The drinks of the Hebrews were water,
wine, "strong drink," and vinegar. Their drinking vessels were the cup,
goblet or "basin," the "cruse" or pitcher, and the saucer. To drink
water by measure ([Eze 4:11](../kjv/eze004.htm#011).md), and to buy water
to drink ([Lam 5:4](../kjv/lam005.htm#004).md), denote great scarcity. To
drink blood means to be satiated with slaughter. The Jews carefully
strained their drinks through a sieve, through fear of violating the law
of [Lev 11:20](../kjv/lev011.htm#020.md), [Lev
11:23](../kjv/lev011.htm#023), [Lev 11:41](../kjv/lev011.htm#041.md), [Lev
11:42](../kjv/lev011.htm#042). (See [Mat 23:24](../kjv/mat023.htm#024.md).
"Strain at" should be "strain out.")
