<span id="000">**Zephathah**</span> A valley in the west of Judah, near
Mareshah; the scene of Asa's conflict with Zerah the Ethiopian ([Ch2
14:9](../kjv/ch2014.htm#009)). Identified with the Wady Safieh.

<span id="001">**Zerah**</span> Sunrise. (1.) An "Ethiopian," probably
Osorkon II., the successor of Shishak on the throne of Egypt. With an
enormous army, the largest we read of in Scripture, he invaded the
kingdom of Judah in the days of Asa ([Ch2 14:9](../kjv/ch2014.htm#009)).
He reached Zephathah, and there encountered the army of Asa. This is the
only instance "in all the annals of Judah of a victorious encounter in
the field with a first-class heathen power in full force." The Egyptian
host was utterly routed, and the Hebrews gathered "exceeding much
spoil." Three hundred years elapsed before another Egyptian army, that
of Necho (609 B.C.), came up against Jerusalem. (2.) A son of Tamar
([Gen 38:30](../kjv/gen038.htm#030)); called also Zara ([Mat
1:3](../kjv/mat001.htm#003)). (3.) A Gershonite Levite ([Ch1
6:21](../kjv/ch1006.htm#021), [Ch1 6:41](../kjv/ch1006.htm#041)).

<span id="002">**Zered**</span> =Zared, luxuriance; willow bush, a brook
or valley communicating with the Dead Sea near its southern extremity
([Num 21:12](../kjv/num021.htm#012); [Deu 2:14](../kjv/deu002.htm#014)).
It is called the "brook of the willows" ([Isa
15:7](../kjv/isa015.htm#007)) and the "river of the wilderness" ([Amo
6:14](../kjv/amo006.htm#014)). It has been identified with the Wady
el-Aksy.

<span id="003">**Zereda**</span> The fortress, a city on the north of
Mount Ephraim; the birthplace of Jeroboam ([Kg1
11:26](../kjv/kg1011.htm#026)). It is probably the same as Zaretan ([Jos
3:16](../kjv/jos003.htm#016)), Zererath ([Jdg
7:22](../kjv/jdg007.htm#022)), Zartanah ([Kg1
4:12](../kjv/kg1004.htm#012)), or the following.

<span id="004">**Zeredathah**</span> A place in the plain of Jordan; the
same as Zarthan ([Ch2 4:17](../kjv/ch2004.htm#017); [Kg1
7:46](../kjv/kg1007.htm#046)). Here Solomon erected the foundries in
which Hiram made the great castings of bronze for the temple.

<span id="005">**Zererath**</span> ([Jdg 7:22](../kjv/jdg007.htm#022)),
perhaps identical with Zereda or Zeredathah. Some identify it with
Zahrah, a place about 3 miles west of Beth-shean.

<span id="006">**Zeresh**</span> Star of Venus, the wife of Haman, whom
she instigated to prepare a gallows for Mordecai ([Est
5:10](../kjv/est005.htm#010)).

<span id="007">**Zeruah**</span> Stricken, mother of Jeroboam, the first
king of the ten tribes ([Kg1 11:26](../kjv/kg1011.htm#026)).

<span id="008">**Zerubbabel**</span> The seed of Babylon, the son of
Salathiel or Shealtiel ([Hag 1:1](../kjv/hag001.htm#001); Zorobabel,
[Mat 1:12](../kjv/mat001.htm#012)); called also the son of Pedaiah ([Ch1
3:17](../kjv/ch1003.htm#017)), i.e., according to a frequent usage of
the word "son;" the grandson or the nephew of Salathiel. He is also
known by the Persian name of Sheshbazzar ([Ezr
1:8](../kjv/ezr001.htm#008), [Ezr 1:11](../kjv/ezr001.htm#011)). In the
first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, he led the first band of Jews,
numbering 42,360 ([Ezr 2:64](../kjv/ezr002.htm#064)), exclusive of a
large number of servants, who returned from captivity at the close of
the seventy years. In the second year after the Return, he erected an
altar and laid the foundation of the temple on the ruins of that which
had been destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar ([Ezr 3:8](../kjv/ezr003.htm#008);
Ezra 4 - 6). All through the work he occupied a prominent place,
inasmuch as he was a descendant of the royal line of David.

<span id="009">**Zeruiah**</span> Stricken of the Lord, David's sister,
and the mother of Abishai, Joab, and Asahel ([Ch1
2:16](../kjv/ch1002.htm#016)), who were the three leading heroes of
David's army, and being his nephews, they were admitted to the closest
companionship with him.
