<span id="000">**Ehud**</span> Union. (1.) A descendant of Benjamin
([Ch1 7:10](../kjv/ch1007.htm#010)), his great-grandson. (2.) The son of
Gera, of the tribe of Benjamin ([Jdg 3:15](../kjv/jdg003.htm#015)).
After the death of Othniel the people again fell into idolatry, and
Eglon, the king of Moab, uniting his bands with those of the Ammonites
and the Amalekites, crossed the Jordan and took the city of Jericho, and
for eighteen years held that whole district in subjection, exacting from
it an annual tribute. At length Ehud, by a stratagem, put Eglon to death
with a two-edged dagger a cubit long, and routed the Moabites at the
fords of the Jordan, putting 10,000 of them to death. Thenceforward the
land, at least Benjamin, enjoyed rest "for fourscore years" (Judg.
3:12-30). (See QUARRIES \[2\].) But in the south-west the Philistines
reduced the Israelites to great straits ([Jdg
5:6](../kjv/jdg005.htm#006)). From this oppression Shamgar was raised up
to be their deliverer.

<span id="001">**Ekron**</span> Firm-rooted, the most northerly of the
five towns belonging to the lords of the Philistines, about 11 miles
north of Gath. It was assigned to Judah ([Jos
13:3](../kjv/jos013.htm#003)), and afterwards to Dan ([Jos
19:43](../kjv/jos019.htm#043)), but came again into the full possession
of the Philistines ([Sa1 5:10](../kjv/sa1005.htm#010)). It was the last
place to which the Philistines carried the ark before they sent it back
to Israel ([Sa1 5:10](../kjv/sa1005.htm#010); [Sa1
6:1](../kjv/sa1006.htm#001)). There was here a noted sanctuary of
Baal-zebub ([Kg2 1:2](../kjv/kg2001.htm#002), [Kg2
1:3](../kjv/kg2001.htm#003), [Kg2 1:6](../kjv/kg2001.htm#006), [Kg2
1:16](../kjv/kg2001.htm#016)). Now the small village Akir. It is
mentioned on monuments in 702 B.C., when Sennacherib set free its king,
imprisoned by Hezekiah in Jerusalem, according to the Assyrian record.

<span id="002">**Elah**</span> Terebinth or oak. (1.) Valley of, where
the Israelites were encamped when David killed Goliath ([Sa1
17:2](../kjv/sa1017.htm#002), [Sa1 17:19](../kjv/sa1017.htm#019)). It
was near Shochoh of Judah and Azekah ([Sa1
17:1](../kjv/sa1017.htm#001)). It is the modern Wady es-Sunt, i.e.,
"valley of the acacia." "The terebinths from which the valley of Elah
takes its name still cling to their ancient soil. On the west side of
the valley, near Shochoh, there is a very large and ancient tree of this
kind known as the 'terebinth of Wady Sur,' 55 feet in height, its trunk
17 feet in circumference, and the breadth of its shade no less than 75
feet. It marks the upper end of the Elah valley, and forms a noted
object, being one of the largest terebinths in Palestine." Geikie's The
Holy Land, etc. (2.) One of the Edomite chiefs or "dukes" of Mount Seir
([Gen 36:41](../kjv/gen036.htm#041)). (3.) The second of the three sons
of Caleb, the son of Jephunneh ([Ch1 4:15](../kjv/ch1004.htm#015)). (4.)
The son and successor of Baasha, king of Israel ([Kg1
16:8](../kjv/kg1016.htm#008)). He was killed while drunk by Zimri, one
of the captains of his chariots, and was the last king of the line of
Baasha. Thus was fulfilled the prophecy of Jehu ([Kg1
16:6](../kjv/kg1016.htm#006), [Kg1 16:7](../kjv/kg1016.htm#007), [Kg1
16:11](../kjv/kg1016.htm#011)). (5.) The father of Hoshea, the last king
of Israel ([Kg2 15:30](../kjv/kg2015.htm#030); [Kg2
17:1](../kjv/kg2017.htm#001)).

<span id="003">**Elam**</span> Highland, the son of Shem ([Gen
10:22](../kjv/gen010.htm#022)), and the name of the country inhabited by
his descendants ([Gen 14:1](../kjv/gen014.htm#001), [Gen
14:9](../kjv/gen014.htm#009); [Isa 11:11](../kjv/isa011.htm#011); [Isa
21:2](../kjv/isa021.htm#002), etc.) lying to the east of Babylonia, and
extending to the shore of the Mediterranean, a distance in a direct line
of about 1,000 miles. The name Elam is an Assyrian word meaning "high."
"The inhabitants of Elam, or 'the Highlands,' to the east of Babylon,
were called Elamites. They were divided into several branches, speaking
different dialects of the same agglutinative language. The race to which
they belonged was brachycephalic, or short-headed, like the pre-Semitic
Sumerians of Babylonia. "The earliest Elamite kingdom seems to have been
that of Anzan, the exact site of which is uncertain; but in the time of
Abraham, Shushan or Susa appears to have already become the capital of
the country. Babylonia was frequently invaded by the Elamite kings, who
at times asserted their supremacy over it (as in the case of
Chedorlaomer, the Kudur-Lagamar, or 'servant of the goddess Lagamar,' of
the cuneiform texts). "The later Assyrian monarchs made several
campaigns against Elam, and finally Assur-bani-pal (about 650 B.C.)
succeeded in conquering the country, which was ravaged with fire and
sword. On the fall of the Assyrian Empire, Elam passed into the hands of
the Persians" (A.H. Sayce). This country was called by the Greeks Cissia
or Susiana.

<span id="004">**Elasah**</span> God made. (1.) One of the descendants
of Judah, of the family of Hezron ([Ch1 2:39](../kjv/ch1002.htm#039),
"Eleasah"). (2.) A descendant of king Saul ([Ch1
8:37](../kjv/ch1008.htm#037); [Ch1 9:43](../kjv/ch1009.htm#043)). (3.)
The son of Shaphan, one of the two who were sent by Zedekiah to
Nebuchadnezzar, and also took charge of Jeremiah's letter to the
captives in Babylon ([Jer 29:3](../kjv/jer029.htm#003)).

<span id="005">**Elath**</span> Grove; trees, ([Deu
2:8](../kjv/deu002.htm#008)), also in plural form Eloth ([Kg1
9:26](../kjv/kg1009.htm#026), etc.); called by the Greeks and Romans
Elana; a city of Idumea, on the east, i.e., the Elanitic, gulf, or the
Gulf of Akabah, of the Red Sea. It is first mentioned in [Deu
2:8](../kjv/deu002.htm#008). It is also mentioned along with Ezion-geber
in [Kg1 9:26](../kjv/kg1009.htm#026). It was within the limits of
Solomon's dominion, but afterwards revolted. It was, however, recovered
and held for a time under king Uzziah ([Kg2
14:22](../kjv/kg2014.htm#022)). Now the ruin Aila.

<span id="006">**El-Bethel**</span> God of Bethel, the name of the place
where Jacob had the vision of the ladder, and where he erected an altar
([Gen 31:13](../kjv/gen031.htm#013); [Gen 35:7](../kjv/gen035.htm#007)).

<span id="007">**Eldad**</span> Whom God has loved, one of the seventy
elders whom Moses appointed ([Num 11:26](../kjv/num011.htm#026), [Num
11:27](../kjv/num011.htm#027)) to administer justice among the people.
He, with Medad, prophesied in the camp instead of going with the rest to
the tabernacle, as Moses had commanded. This incident was announced to
Moses by Joshua, who thought their conduct in this respect irregular.
Moses replied, "Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the Lord's
people were prophets" ([Num 11:24](../kjv/num011.htm#024); compare [Mar
9:38](../kjv/mar009.htm#038); [Luk 9:49](../kjv/luk009.htm#049)).

<span id="008">**Elder**</span> A name frequently used in the Old
Testament as denoting a person clothed with authority, and entitled to
respect and reverence ([Gen 50:7](../kjv/gen050.htm#007)). It also
denoted a political office ([Num 22:7](../kjv/num022.htm#007)). The
"elders of Israel" held a rank among the people indicative of authority.
Moses opened his commission to them ([Exo 3:16](../kjv/exo003.htm#016)).
They attended Moses on all important occasions. Seventy of them attended
on him at the giving of the law ([Exo 24:1](../kjv/exo024.htm#001)).
Seventy also were selected from the whole number to bear with Moses the
burden of the people ([Num 11:16](../kjv/num011.htm#016), [Num
11:17](../kjv/num011.htm#017)). The "elder" is the keystone of the
social and political fabric wherever the patriarchal system exists. At
the present day this is the case among the Arabs, where the sheik (i.e.,
"the old man") is the highest authority in the tribe. The body of the
"elders" of Israel were the representatives of the people from the very
first, and were recognized as such by Moses. All down through the
history of the Jews we find mention made of the elders as exercising
authority among the people. They appear as governors ([Deu
31:28](../kjv/deu031.htm#028)), as local magistrates ([Deu
16:18](../kjv/deu016.htm#018)), administering justice ([Deu
19:12](../kjv/deu019.htm#012)). They were men of extensive influence
([Sa1 30:26](../kjv/sa1030.htm#026)). In New Testament times they also
appear taking an active part in public affairs ([Mat
16:21](../kjv/mat016.htm#021); [Mat 21:23](../kjv/mat021.htm#023); [Mat
26:59](../kjv/mat026.htm#059)). The Jewish eldership was transferred
from the old dispensation to the new. "The creation of the office of
elder is nowhere recorded in the New Testament, as in the case of
deacons and apostles, because the latter offices were created to meet
new and special emergencies, while the former was transmitted from the
earliest times. In other words, the office of elder was the only
permanent essential office of the church under either dispensation." The
"elders" of the New Testament church were the "pastors" ([Eph
4:11](../kjv/eph004.htm#011)), "bishops or overseers" ([Act
20:28](../kjv/act020.htm#028)), "leaders" and "rulers" ([Heb
13:7](../kjv/heb013.htm#007); [Th1 5:12](../kjv/th1005.htm#012)) of the
flock. Everywhere in the New Testament bishop and presbyter are titles
given to one and the same officer of the Christian church. He who is
called presbyter or elder on account of his age or gravity is also
called bishop or overseer with reference to the duty that lay upon him
([Tit 1:5](../kjv/tit001.htm#005); [Act 20:17](../kjv/act020.htm#017);
[Phi 1:1](../kjv/phi001.htm#001)).

<span id="009">**Elealeh**</span> God has ascended, a place in the
pastoral country east of Jordan, in the tribe of Reuben ([Num
32:3](../kjv/num032.htm#003), [Num 32:37](../kjv/num032.htm#037)). It is
not again mentioned till the time of Isaiah ([Isa
15:4](../kjv/isa015.htm#004); [Isa 16:9](../kjv/isa016.htm#009)) and
Jeremiah ([Jer 48:34](../kjv/jer048.htm#034)). It is now an extensive
ruin called el -A'al , about one mile north-east of Heshbon.
