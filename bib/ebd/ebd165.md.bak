<span id="000">**Harosheth of the Gentiles**</span> ([Jdg
4:2](../kjv/jdg004.htm#002).md) or nations, a city near Hazor in Galilee of
the Gentiles, or Upper Galilee, in the north of Palestine. It was here
that Jabin's great army was marshaled before it went forth into the
great battlefield of Esdraelon to encounter the army of Israel, by which
it was routed and put to flight (Judg. 4). It was situated "at the
entrance of the pass to Esdraelon from the plain of Acre" at the base of
Carmel. The name in the Hebrew is Harosheth ha Gojim, i.e., " the smithy
of the nations;" probably, as is supposed, so called because here
Jabin's iron war-chariots, armed with scythes, were made. It is
identified with el-Harithiyeh.

<span id="001">**Harp**</span> (Heb. kinnor ), the national instrument
of the Hebrews. It was invented by Jubal ([Gen
4:21](../kjv/gen004.htm#021).md). Some think the word kinnor denotes the
whole class of stringed instruments. It was used as an accompaniment to
songs of cheerfulness as well as of praise to God ([Gen
31:27](../kjv/gen031.htm#027); [Sa1 16:23](../kjv/sa1016.htm#023.md); [Ch2
20:28](../kjv/ch2020.htm#028); [Psa 33:2](../kjv/psa033.htm#002.md); [Psa
137:2](../kjv/psa137.htm#002).md). In Solomon's time harps were made of
almug-trees ([Kg1 10:11](../kjv/kg1010.htm#011.md), [Kg1
10:12](../kjv/kg1010.htm#012)). In [Ch1 15:21](../kjv/ch1015.htm#021.md)
mention is made of "harps on the Sheminith;" Revised Version, "harps set
to the Sheminith;" better perhaps "harps of eight strings." The soothing
effect of the music of the harp is referred to [Sa1
16:16](../kjv/sa1016.htm#016), [Sa1 16:23](../kjv/sa1016.htm#023.md); [Sa1
18:10](../kjv/sa1018.htm#010); [Sa1 19:9](../kjv/sa1019.htm#009.md). The
church in heaven is represented as celebrating the triumphs of the
Redeemer "harping with their harps" ([Rev 14:2](../kjv/rev014.htm#002).md).

<span id="002">**Harrow**</span> (Heb. harits ), a tribulum or sharp
threshing sledge; a frame armed on the under side with rollers or sharp
spikes ([Sa2 12:31](../kjv/sa2012.htm#031.md); [Ch1
20:3](../kjv/ch1020.htm#003).md). Heb. verb sadad , to harrow a field,
break its clods ([Job 39:10](../kjv/job039.htm#010.md); [Isa
28:4](../kjv/isa028.htm#004); [Hos 10:11](../kjv/hos010.htm#011).md). Its
form is unknown. It may have resembled the instrument still in use in
Egypt.

<span id="003">**Harsha**</span> Worker or enchanter, one of the
Nethinim ([Ezr 2:52](../kjv/ezr002.htm#052.md); [Neh
7:54](../kjv/neh007.htm#054).md).

<span id="004">**Hart**</span> (Heb. 'ayal ), a stag or male deer. It is
ranked among the clean animals ([Deu 12:15](../kjv/deu012.htm#015.md); [Deu
14:5](../kjv/deu014.htm#005); [Deu 15:22](../kjv/deu015.htm#022).md), and
was commonly killed for food ([Kg1 4:23](../kjv/kg1004.htm#023).md). The
hart is frequently alluded to in the poetical and prophetical books
([Isa 35:6](../kjv/isa035.htm#006); [Sol 2:8](../kjv/sol002.htm#008.md),
[Sol 2:9](../kjv/sol002.htm#009); [Lam 1:6](../kjv/lam001.htm#006.md); [Psa
42:1](../kjv/psa042.htm#001).md).

<span id="005">**Harum**</span> Elevated, ([Ch1
4:8](../kjv/ch1004.htm#008).md), a descendant of Judah.

<span id="006">**Haruphite**</span> A native of Hariph; an epithet given
to Shephatiah, one of those who joined David at Ziklag ([Ch1
12:5](../kjv/ch1012.htm#005).md).

<span id="007">**Haruz**</span> Eager, the father of Meshullemeth, the
wife of king Manasseh ([Kg2 21:19](../kjv/kg2021.htm#019).md) and mother of
king Amon.

<span id="008">**Harvest**</span> The season for gathering grain or
fruit. On the 16th day of Abib (or April) a handful of ripe ears of corn
was offered as a first-fruit before the Lord, and immediately after this
the harvest commenced ([Lev 23:9](../kjv/lev023.htm#009.md); [Sa2
21:9](../kjv/sa2021.htm#009), [Sa2 21:10](../kjv/sa2021.htm#010.md); [Rut
2:23](../kjv/rut002.htm#023).md). It began with the feast of Passover and
ended with Pentecost, thus lasting for seven weeks ([Exo
23:16](../kjv/exo023.htm#016).md). The harvest was a season of joy ([Psa
126:1](../kjv/psa126.htm#001); [Isa 9:3](../kjv/isa009.htm#003).md). This
word is used figuratively [Mat 9:37](../kjv/mat009.htm#037.md); [Mat
13:30](../kjv/mat013.htm#030); [Luk 10:2](../kjv/luk010.htm#002.md); [Joh
4:35](../kjv/joh004.htm#035). (See AGRICULTURE..md)

<span id="009">**Hasadiah**</span> Favoured by Jehovah, one of the sons
of Pedaiah ([Ch1 3:20](../kjv/ch1003.htm#020).md), of the royal line of
David.
