<span id="000">**Mark**</span> The evangelist; "John whose surname was
Mark" ([Act 12:12](../kjv/act012.htm#012.md), [Act
12:25](../kjv/act012.htm#025).md). Mark (Marcus, [Col
4:10](../kjv/col004.htm#010), etc..md) was his Roman name, which gradually
came to supersede his Jewish name John. He is called John in [Act
13:5](../kjv/act013.htm#005), [Act 13:13](../kjv/act013.htm#013.md), and
Mark in [Act 15:39](../kjv/act015.htm#039.md), [Ti2
4:11](../kjv/ti2004.htm#011.md), etc. He was the son of Mary, a woman
apparently of some means and influence, and was probably born in
Jerusalem, where his mother resided ([Act
12:12](../kjv/act012.htm#012).md). Of his father we know nothing. He was
cousin of Barnabas ([Col 4:10](../kjv/col004.htm#010).md). It was in his
mother's house that Peter found "many gathered together praying" when he
was released from prison; and it is probable that it was here that he
was converted by Peter, who calls him his "son" ([Pe1
5:13](../kjv/pe1005.htm#013).md). It is probable that the "young man"
spoken of in [Mar 14:51](../kjv/mar014.htm#051.md), [Mar
14:52](../kjv/mar014.htm#052.md) was Mark himself. He is first mentioned in
[Act 12:25](../kjv/act012.htm#025.md). He went with Paul and Barnabas on
their first journey (about A.D. 47) as their "minister," but from some
cause turned back when they reached Perga in Pamphylia ([Act
12:25](../kjv/act012.htm#025); [Act 13:13](../kjv/act013.htm#013).md).
Three years afterwards a "sharp contention" arose between Paul and
Barnabas ([Act 15:36](../kjv/act015.htm#036).md), because Paul would not
take Mark with him. He, however, was evidently at length reconciled to
the apostle, for he was with him in his first imprisonment at Rome ([Col
4:10](../kjv/col004.htm#010); [Plm 1:24](../kjv/plm001.htm#024).md). At a
later period he was with Peter in Babylon ([Pe1
5:13](../kjv/pe1005.htm#013).md), then, and for some centuries afterwards,
one of the chief seats of Jewish learning; and he was with Timothy in
Ephesus when Paul wrote him during his second imprisonment ([Ti2
4:11](../kjv/ti2004.htm#011).md). He then disappears from view.

<span id="001">**Mark, Gospel According to**</span> It is the current
and apparently well-founded tradition that Mark derived his information
mainly from the discourses of Peter. In his mother's house he would have
abundant opportunities of obtaining information from the other apostles
and their coadjutors, yet he was "the disciple and interpreter of Peter"
specially. As to the time when it was written, the Gospel furnishes us
with no definite information. Mark makes no mention of the destruction
of Jerusalem, hence it must have been written before that event, and
probably about A.D. 63. The place where it was written was probably
Rome. Some have supposed Antioch (Compare [Mar
15:21](../kjv/mar015.htm#021) with [Act 11:20](../kjv/act011.htm#020).md).
It was intended primarily for Romans. This appears probable when it is
considered that it makes no reference to the Jewish law, and that the
writer takes care to interpret words which a Gentile would be likely to
misunderstand, such as, "Boanerges" ([Mar 3:17](../kjv/mar003.htm#017).md);
"Talitha cumi" ([Mar 5:41](../kjv/mar005.htm#041).md); "Corban" ([Mar
7:11](../kjv/mar007.htm#011).md); "Bartimaeus" ([Mar
10:46](../kjv/mar010.htm#046).md); "Abba" ([Mar
14:36](../kjv/mar014.htm#036).md); "Eloi," etc. ([Mar
15:34](../kjv/mar015.htm#034).md). Jewish usages are also explained ([Mar
7:3](../kjv/mar007.htm#003); [Mar 14:3](../kjv/mar014.htm#003.md); [Mar
14:12](../kjv/mar014.htm#012); [Mar 15:42](../kjv/mar015.htm#042).md). Mark
also uses certain Latin words not found in any of the other Gospels, as
"speculator" ([Mar 6:27](../kjv/mar006.htm#027.md), rendered, A.V.,
"executioner;" R.V., "soldier of his guard"), " xestes " (a corruption
of sextarius, rendered "pots," [Mar 7:4](../kjv/mar007.htm#004.md), [Mar
7:8](../kjv/mar007.htm#008).md), " quadrans " ([Mar
12:42](../kjv/mar012.htm#042), rendered "a farthing".md), "centurion" ([Mar
15:39](../kjv/mar015.htm#039), [Mar 15:44](../kjv/mar015.htm#044.md), [Mar
15:45](../kjv/mar015.htm#045).md). He only twice quotes from the Old
Testament ([Mar 1:2](../kjv/mar001.htm#002.md); [Mar
15:28](../kjv/mar015.htm#028).md). The characteristics of this Gospel are,
(1.) the absence of the genealogy of our Lord, (2.) whom he represents
as clothed with power, the "lion of the tribe of Judah." (3.) Mark also
records with wonderful minuteness the very words ([Mar
3:17](../kjv/mar003.htm#017); [Mar 5:41](../kjv/mar005.htm#041.md); [Mar
7:11](../kjv/mar007.htm#011), [Mar 7:34](../kjv/mar007.htm#034.md); [Mar
14:36](../kjv/mar014.htm#036).md) as well as the position ([Mar
9:35](../kjv/mar009.htm#035).md) and gestures ([Mar
3:5](../kjv/mar003.htm#005), [Mar 3:34](../kjv/mar003.htm#034.md); [Mar
5:32](../kjv/mar005.htm#032); [Mar 9:36](../kjv/mar009.htm#036.md); [Mar
10:16](../kjv/mar010.htm#016)) of our Lord. (4..md) He is also careful to
record particulars of person ([Mar 1:29](../kjv/mar001.htm#029.md), [Mar
1:36](../kjv/mar001.htm#036); [Mar 3:6](../kjv/mar003.htm#006.md), [Mar
3:22](../kjv/mar003.htm#022), etc..md), number ([Mar
5:13](../kjv/mar005.htm#013); [Mar 6:7](../kjv/mar006.htm#007), etc..md),
place ([Mar 2:13](../kjv/mar002.htm#013.md); [Mar
4:1](../kjv/mar004.htm#001); [Mar 7:31](../kjv/mar007.htm#031), etc..md),
and time ([Mar 1:35](../kjv/mar001.htm#035.md); [Mar
2:1](../kjv/mar002.htm#001); [Mar 4:35](../kjv/mar004.htm#035), etc..md),
which the other evangelists omit. (5.) The phrase "and straightway"
occurs nearly forty times in this Gospel; while in Luke's Gospel, which
is much longer, it is used only seven times, and in John only four
times. "The Gospel of Mark," says Westcott, "is essentially a transcript
from life. The course and issue of facts are imaged in it with the
clearest outline." "In Mark we have no attempt to draw up a continuous
narrative. His Gospel is a rapid succession of vivid pictures loosely
strung together without much attempt to bind them into a whole or give
the events in their natural sequence. This pictorial power is that which
specially characterizes this evangelist, so that 'if any one desires to
know an evangelical fact, not only in its main features and grand
results, but also in its most minute and so to speak more graphic
delineation, he must betake himself to Mark.'". The leading principle
running through this Gospel may be expressed in the motto: "Jesus
came... preaching the gospel of the kingdom" ([Mar
1:14](../kjv/mar001.htm#014).md). "Out of a total of 662 verses, Mark has
406 in common with Matthew and Luke, 145 with Matthew, 60 with Luke, and
at most 51 peculiar to itself." (See MATTHEW.)

<span id="002">**Market-place**</span> Any place of public resort, and
hence a public place or broad street ([Mat
11:16](../kjv/mat011.htm#016); [Mat 20:3](../kjv/mat020.htm#003).md), as
well as a forum or market-place proper, where goods were exposed for
sale, and where public assemblies and trials were held ([Act
16:19](../kjv/act016.htm#019); [Act 17:17](../kjv/act017.htm#017).md). This
word occurs in the Old Testament only in [Eze
27:13](../kjv/eze027.htm#013.md). In early times markets were held at the
gates of cities, where commodities were exposed for sale ([Kg2
7:18](../kjv/kg2007.htm#018).md). In large towns the sale of particular
articles seems to have been confined to certain streets, as we may infer
from such expressions as "the bakers' street" ([Jer
37:21](../kjv/jer037.htm#021).md), and from the circumstance that in the
time of Josephus the valley between Mounts Zion and Moriah was called
the Tyropoeon or the "valley of the cheesemakers."

<span id="003">**Maroth**</span> Bitterness; i.e., "perfect grief", a
place not far from Jerusalem; mentioned in connection with the invasion
of the Assyrian army ([Mic 1:12](../kjv/mic001.htm#012).md).

<span id="004">**Marriage**</span> Was instituted in Paradise when man
was in innocence ([Gen 2:18](../kjv/gen002.htm#018).md). Here we have its
original charter, which was confirmed by our Lord, as the basis on which
all regulations are to be framed ([Mat 19:4](../kjv/mat019.htm#004.md),
[Mat 19:5](../kjv/mat019.htm#005).md). It is evident that monogamy was the
original law of marriage ([Mat 19:5](../kjv/mat019.htm#005.md); [Co1
6:16](../kjv/co1006.htm#016).md). This law was violated in after times,
when corrupt usages began to be introduced ([Gen
4:19](../kjv/gen004.htm#019); [Gen 6:2](../kjv/gen006.htm#002).md). We meet
with the prevalence of polygamy and concubinage in the patriarchal age
([Gen 16:1](../kjv/gen016.htm#001); [Gen 22:21](../kjv/gen022.htm#021.md);
[Gen 28:8](../kjv/gen028.htm#008), [Gen 28:9](../kjv/gen028.htm#009.md);
[Gen 29:23](../kjv/gen029.htm#023), etc..md). Polygamy was acknowledged in
the Mosaic law and made the basis of legislation, and continued to be
practiced all down through the period of Jewish history to the
Captivity, after which there is no instance of it on record. It seems to
have been the practice from the beginning for fathers to select wives
for their sons ([Gen 24:3](../kjv/gen024.htm#003.md); [Gen
38:6](../kjv/gen038.htm#006).md). Sometimes also proposals were initiated
by the father of the maiden ([Exo 2:21](../kjv/exo002.htm#021).md). The
brothers of the maiden were also sometimes consulted ([Gen
24:51](../kjv/gen024.htm#051); [Gen 34:11](../kjv/gen034.htm#011).md), but
her own consent was not required. The young man was bound to give a
price to the father of the maiden ([Gen 31:15](../kjv/gen031.htm#015.md);
[Gen 34:12](../kjv/gen034.htm#012); [Exo 22:16](../kjv/exo022.htm#016.md),
[Exo 22:17](../kjv/exo022.htm#017); [Sa1 18:23](../kjv/sa1018.htm#023.md),
[Sa1 18:25](../kjv/sa1018.htm#025); [Rut 4:10](../kjv/rut004.htm#010.md);
[Hos 3:2](../kjv/hos003.htm#002).md) On these patriarchal customs the
Mosaic law made no change. In the pre-Mosaic times, when the proposals
were accepted and the marriage price given, the bridegroom could come at
once and take away his bride to his own house ([Gen
24:63](../kjv/gen024.htm#063).md). But in general the marriage was
celebrated by a feast in the house of the bride's parents, to which all
friends were invited ([Gen 29:22](../kjv/gen029.htm#022.md), [Gen
29:27](../kjv/gen029.htm#027).md); and on the day of the marriage the
bride, concealed under a thick veil, was conducted to her future
husband's home. Our Lord corrected many false notions then existing on
the subject of marriage ([Mat 22:23](../kjv/mat022.htm#023).md), and placed
it as a divine institution on the highest grounds. The apostles state
clearly and enforce the nuptial duties of husband and wife ([Eph
5:22](../kjv/eph005.htm#022); [Col 3:18](../kjv/col003.htm#018.md), [Col
3:19](../kjv/col003.htm#019); [Pe1 3:1](../kjv/pe1003.htm#001).md).
Marriage is said to be "honourable" ([Heb 13:4](../kjv/heb013.htm#004).md),
and the prohibition of it is noted as one of the marks of degenerate
times ([Ti1 4:3](../kjv/ti1004.htm#003).md). The marriage relation is used
to represent the union between God and his people ([Isa
54:5](../kjv/isa054.htm#005); [Jer 3:1](../kjv/jer003.htm#001.md); [Hos
2:9](../kjv/hos002.htm#009), [Hos 2:20](../kjv/hos002.htm#020).md). In the
New Testament the same figure is employed in representing the love of
Christ to his saints ([Eph 5:25](../kjv/eph005.htm#025).md). The Church of
the redeemed is the "Bride, the Lamb's wife" ([Rev
19:7](../kjv/rev019.htm#007).md).

<span id="005">**Marriage-feasts**</span> ([Joh
2:1](../kjv/joh002.htm#001).md) "lasted usually for a whole week; but the
cost of such prolonged rejoicing is very small in the East. The guests
sit round the great bowl or bowls on the floor, the meal usually
consisting of a lamb or kid stewed in rice or barley. The most honoured
guests sit nearest, others behind; and all in eating dip their hand into
the one smoking mound, pieces of the thin bread, bent together, serving
for spoons when necessary. After the first circle have satisfied
themselves, those lower in honour sit down to the rest, the whole
company being men, for women are never seen at a feast. Water is poured
on the hands before eating; and this is repeated when the meal closes,
the fingers having first been wiped on pieces of bread, which, after
serving the same purpose as table-napkins with us, are thrown on the
ground to be eaten by any dog that may have stolen in from the streets
through the ever-open door, or picked up by those outside when gathered
and tossed out to them ([Mat 15:27](../kjv/mat015.htm#027.md); [Mar
7:28](../kjv/mar007.htm#028).md). Rising from the ground and retiring to
the seats round the walls, the guests then sit down cross-legged and
gossip, or listen to recitals, or puzzle over riddles, light being
scantily supplied by a small lamp or two, or if the night be chilly, by
a smouldering fire of weeds kindled in the middle of the room, perhaps
in a brazier, often in a hole in the floor. As to the smoke, it escapes
as it best may; but indeed there is little of it, though enough to
blacken the water or wine or milk skins hung up on pegs on the wall.
(Compare [Psa 119:83](../kjv/psa119.htm#083)..md) To some such
marriage-feast Jesus and his five disciples were invited at Cana of
Galilee." Geikie's Life of Christ. (See CANA.)

<span id="006">**Mars' Hill**</span> The Areopagus or rocky hill in
Athens, north-west of the Acropolis, where the Athenian supreme tribunal
and court of morals was held. From some part of this hill Paul delivered
the address recorded in [Act 17:22](../kjv/act017.htm#022.md). (See
AREOPAGUS.)

<span id="007">**Martha**</span> Bitterness, the sister of Lazarus and
Mary, and probably the eldest of the family, who all resided at Bethany
([Luk 10:38](../kjv/luk010.htm#038), [Luk 10:40](../kjv/luk010.htm#040.md),
[Luk 10:41](../kjv/luk010.htm#041); John 11:1-39.md). From the residence
being called "her house," some have supposed that she was a widow, and
that her brother and sister lodged with her. She seems to have been of
an anxious, bustling spirit, anxious to be helpful in providing the best
things for the Master's use, in contrast to the quiet earnestness of
Mary, who was more concerned to avail herself of the opportunity of
sitting at his feet and learning of him. Afterwards at a supper given to
Christ and his disciples in her house "Martha served." Nothing further
is known of her. "Mary and Martha are representatives of two orders of
human character. One was absorbed, preoccupied, abstracted; the other
was concentrated and single-hearted. Her own world was the all of
Martha; Christ was the first thought with Mary. To Martha life was 'a
succession of particular businesses;' to Mary life 'was rather the flow
of one spirit.' Martha was Petrine, Mary was Johannine. The one was a
well-meaning, bustling busybody; the other was a reverent disciple, a
wistful listener." Paul had such a picture as that of Martha in his mind
when he spoke of serving the Lord "without distraction" ([Co1
7:35](../kjv/co1007.htm#035).md).

<span id="008">**Martyr**</span> One who bears witness of the truth, and
suffers death in the cause of Christ ([Act
22:20](../kjv/act022.htm#020); [Rev 2:13](../kjv/rev002.htm#013.md); [Rev
17:6](../kjv/rev017.htm#006).md). In this sense Stephen was the first
martyr. The Greek word so rendered in all other cases is translated
"witness." (1.) In a court of justice ([Mat
18:16](../kjv/mat018.htm#016); [Mat 26:65](../kjv/mat026.htm#065.md); [Act
6:13](../kjv/act006.htm#013); [Act 7:58](../kjv/act007.htm#058.md); [Heb
10:28](../kjv/heb010.htm#028); [Ti1 5:19](../kjv/ti1005.htm#019)). (2..md)
As of one bearing testimony to the truth of what he has seen or known
([Luk 24:48](../kjv/luk024.htm#048); [Act 1:8](../kjv/act001.htm#008.md),
[Act 1:22](../kjv/act001.htm#022); [Rom 1:9](../kjv/rom001.htm#009.md);
[Th1 2:5](../kjv/th1002.htm#005), [Th1 2:10](../kjv/th1002.htm#010.md);
[Jo1 1:2](../kjv/jo1001.htm#002).md).

<span id="009">**Mary**</span> Hebrew Miriam. (1.) The wife of Joseph,
the mother of Jesus, called the "Virgin Mary," though never so
designated in Scripture ([Mat 2:11](../kjv/mat002.htm#011.md); [Act
1:14](../kjv/act001.htm#014).md). Little is known of her personal history.
Her genealogy is given in Luke 3. She was of the tribe of Judah and the
lineage of David ([Psa 132:11](../kjv/psa132.htm#011.md); [Luk
1:32](../kjv/luk001.htm#032).md). She was connected by marriage with
Elisabeth, who was of the lineage of Aaron ([Luk
1:36](../kjv/luk001.htm#036).md). While she resided at Nazareth with her
parents, before she became the wife of Joseph, the angel Gabriel
announced to her that she was to be the mother of the promised Messiah
([Luk 1:35](../kjv/luk001.htm#035).md). After this she went to visit her
cousin Elisabeth, who was living with her husband Zacharias (probably at
Juttah, [Jos 15:55](../kjv/jos015.htm#055.md); [Jos
21:16](../kjv/jos021.htm#016), in the neighbourhood of Maon.md), at a
considerable distance, about 100 miles, from Nazareth. Immediately on
entering the house she was saluted by Elisabeth as the mother of her
Lord, and then forthwith gave utterance to her hymn of thanksgiving
([Luk 1:46](../kjv/luk001.htm#046.md); compare [Sa1
2:1](../kjv/sa1002.htm#001).md). After three months Mary returned to
Nazareth to her own home. Joseph was supernaturally made aware ([Mat
1:18](../kjv/mat001.htm#018).md) of her condition, and took her to his own
home. Soon after this the decree of Augustus ([Luk
2:1](../kjv/luk002.htm#001).md) required that they should proceed to
Bethlehem ([Mic 5:2](../kjv/mic005.htm#002).md), some 80 or 90 miles from
Nazareth; and while they were there they found shelter in the inn or
khan provided for strangers ([Luk 2:6](../kjv/luk002.htm#006.md), [Luk
2:7](../kjv/luk002.htm#007).md). But as the inn was crowded, Mary had to
retire to a place among the cattle, and there she brought forth her son,
who was called Jesus ([Mat 1:21](../kjv/mat001.htm#021).md), because he was
to save his people from their sins. This was followed by the
presentation in the temple, the flight into Egypt, and their return in
the following year and residence at Nazareth (Matt. 2). There for thirty
years Mary, the wife of Joseph the carpenter, resides, filling her own
humble sphere, and pondering over the strange things that had happened
to her. During these years only one event in the history of Jesus is
recorded, viz., his going up to Jerusalem when twelve years of age, and
his being found among the doctors in the temple ([Luk
2:41](../kjv/luk002.htm#041).md). Probably also during this period Joseph
died, for he is not again mentioned. After the commencement of our
Lord's public ministry little notice is taken of Mary. She was present
at the marriage in Cana. A year and a half after this we find her at
Capernaum ([Mat 12:46](../kjv/mat012.htm#046.md), [Mat
12:48](../kjv/mat012.htm#048), [Mat 12:49](../kjv/mat012.htm#049).md),
where Christ uttered the memorable words, "Who is my mother? and who are
my brethren? And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and
said, Behold my mother and my brethren!" The next time we find her is at
the cross along with her sister Mary, and Mary Magdalene, and Salome,
and other women ([Joh 19:26](../kjv/joh019.htm#026).md). From that hour
John took her to his own abode. She was with the little company in the
upper room after the Ascension ([Act 1:14](../kjv/act001.htm#014).md). From
this time she wholly disappears from public notice. The time and manner
of her death are unknown. (2.) Mary Magdalene, i.e., Mary of Magdala, a
town on the western shore of the Lake of Tiberias. She is for the first
time noticed in [Luk 8:3](../kjv/luk008.htm#003.md) as one of the women who
"ministered to Christ of their substance." Their motive was that of
gratitude for deliverances he had wrought for them. Out of Mary were
cast seven demons. Gratitude to her great Deliverer prompted her to
become his follower. These women accompanied him also on his last
journey to Jerusalem ([Mat 27:55](../kjv/mat027.htm#055.md); [Mar
15:41](../kjv/mar015.htm#041); [Luk 23:55](../kjv/luk023.htm#055).md). They
stood near the cross. There Mary remained till all was over, and the
body was taken down and laid in Joseph's tomb. Again, in the earliest
dawn of the first day of the week she, with Salome and Mary the mother
of James ([Mat 28:1](../kjv/mat028.htm#001.md); [Mar
16:2](../kjv/mar016.htm#002).md), came to the sepulchre, bringing with them
sweet spices, that they might anoint the body of Jesus. They found the
sepulchre empty, but saw the "vision of angels" ([Mat
28:5](../kjv/mat028.htm#005).md). She hastens to tell Peter and John, who
were probably living together at this time ([Joh
20:1](../kjv/joh020.htm#001), [Joh 20:2](../kjv/joh020.htm#002).md), and
again immediately returns to the sepulchre. There she lingers
thoughtfully, weeping at the door of the tomb. The risen Lord appears to
her, but at first she knows him not. His utterance of her name "Mary"
recalls her to consciousness, and she utters the joyful, reverent cry,
"Rabboni." She would fain cling to him, but he forbids her, saying,
"Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father." This is the last
record regarding Mary of Magdala, who now returned to Jerusalem. The
idea that this Mary was "the woman who was a sinner," or that she was
unchaste, is altogether groundless. (3.) Mary the sister of Lazarus is
brought to our notice in connection with the visits of our Lord to
Bethany. She is contrasted with her sister Martha, who was "cumbered
about many things" while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen
"the good part." Her character also appears in connection with the death
of her brother ([Joh 11:20](../kjv/joh011.htm#020.md), [Joh
11:31](../kjv/joh011.htm#031), [Joh 11:33](../kjv/joh011.htm#033).md). On
the occasion of our Lord's last visit to Bethany, Mary brought "a pound
of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus"
as he reclined at table in the house of one Simon, who had been a leper
([Mat 26:6](../kjv/mat026.htm#006); [Mar 14:3](../kjv/mar014.htm#003.md);
[Joh 12:2](../kjv/joh012.htm#002), [Joh 12:3](../kjv/joh012.htm#003).md).
This was an evidence of her overflowing love to the Lord. Nothing is
known of her subsequent history. It would appear from this act of
Mary's, and from the circumstance that they possessed a family vault
([Joh 11:38](../kjv/joh011.htm#038).md), and that a large number of Jews
from Jerusalem came to condole with them on the death of Lazarus ([Joh
11:19](../kjv/joh011.htm#019).md), that this family at Bethany belonged to
the wealthier class of the people. (See MARTHA.) (4.) Mary the wife of
Cleopas is mentioned ([Joh 19:25](../kjv/joh019.htm#025).md) as standing at
the cross in company with Mary of Magdala and Mary the mother of Jesus.
By comparing [Mat 27:56](../kjv/mat027.htm#056.md) and [Mar
15:40](../kjv/mar015.htm#040.md), we find that this Mary and "Mary the
mother of James the little" are on and the same person, and that she was
the sister of our Lord's mother. She was that "other Mary" who was
present with Mary of Magdala at the burial of our Lord ([Mat
27:61](../kjv/mat027.htm#061); [Mar 15:47](../kjv/mar015.htm#047).md); and
she was one of those who went early in the morning of the first day of
the week to anoint the body, and thus became one of the first witnesses
of the resurrection ([Mat 28:1](../kjv/mat028.htm#001.md); [Mar
16:1](../kjv/mar016.htm#001); [Luk 24:1](../kjv/luk024.htm#001)). (5..md)
Mary the mother of John Mark was one of the earliest of our Lord's
disciples. She was the sister of Barnabas ([Col
4:10](../kjv/col004.htm#010).md), and joined with him in disposing of their
land and giving the proceeds of the sale into the treasury of the Church
([Act 4:37](../kjv/act004.htm#037); [Act 12:12](../kjv/act012.htm#012).md).
Her house in Jerusalem was the common meeting-place for the disciples
there. (6.) A Christian at Rome who treated Paul with special kindness
([Rom 16:6](../kjv/rom016.htm#006).md).
