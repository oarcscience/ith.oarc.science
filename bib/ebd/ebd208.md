<span id="000">**Joash**</span> Whom Jehovah bestowed. (1.) A contracted
form of Jehoash, the father of Gideon ([Jdg
6:11](../kjv/jdg006.htm#011), [Jdg 6:29](../kjv/jdg006.htm#029); [Jdg
8:13](../kjv/jdg008.htm#013), [Jdg 8:29](../kjv/jdg008.htm#029), [Jdg
8:32](../kjv/jdg008.htm#032)). (2.) One of the Benjamite archers who
joined David at Ziklag ([Ch1 12:3](../kjv/ch1012.htm#003)). (3.) One of
King Ahab's sons ([Kg1 22:26](../kjv/kg1022.htm#026)). (4.) King of
Judah ([Kg2 11:2](../kjv/kg2011.htm#002); [Kg2
12:19](../kjv/kg2012.htm#019), [Kg2 12:20](../kjv/kg2012.htm#020)). (See
JEHOASH \[1\].) (5.) King of Israel ([Kg2 13:9](../kjv/kg2013.htm#009),
[Kg2 13:12](../kjv/kg2013.htm#012), [Kg2 13:13](../kjv/kg2013.htm#013),
[Kg2 13:25](../kjv/kg2013.htm#025)). (See JEHOASH \[2\].) (6.) [Ch1
7:8](../kjv/ch1007.htm#008). (7.) One who had charge of the royal stores
of oil under David and Solomon ([Ch1 27:28](../kjv/ch1027.htm#028)).

<span id="001">**Job**</span> Persecuted, an Arabian patriarch who
resided in the land of Uz (q.v.). While living in the midst of great
prosperity, he was suddenly overwhelmed by a series of sore trials that
fell upon him. Amid all his sufferings he maintained his integrity. Once
more God visited him with the rich tokens of his goodness and even
greater prosperity than he had enjoyed before. He survived the period of
trial for one hundred and forty years, and died in a good old age, an
example to succeeding generations of integrity ([Eze
14:14](../kjv/eze014.htm#014), [Eze 14:20](../kjv/eze014.htm#020)) and
of submissive patience under the sorest calamities ([Jam
5:11](../kjv/jam005.htm#011)). His history, so far as it is known, is
recorded in his book.

<span id="002">**Job, Book of**</span> A great diversity of opinion
exists as to the authorship of this book. From internal evidence, such
as the similarity of sentiment and language to those in the Psalms and
Proverbs (see Ps. 88 and 89), the prevalence of the idea of "wisdom,"
and the style and character of the composition, it is supposed by some
to have been written in the time of David and Solomon. Others argue that
it was written by Job himself, or by Elihu, or Isaiah, or perhaps more
probably by Moses, who was "learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,
and mighty in words and deeds" ([Act 7:22](../kjv/act007.htm#022)). He
had opportunities in Midian for obtaining the knowledge of the facts
related. But the authorship is altogether uncertain. As to the character
of the book, it is a historical poem, one of the greatest and sublime
poems in all literature. Job was a historical person, and the localities
and names were real and not fictitious. It is "one of the grandest
portions of the inspired Scriptures, a heavenly-replenished storehouse
of comfort and instruction, the patriarchal Bible, and a precious
monument of primitive theology. It is to the Old Testament what the
Epistle to the Romans is to the New." It is a didactic narrative in a
dramatic form. This book was apparently well known in the days of
Ezekiel, 600 B.C. ([Eze 14:14](../kjv/eze014.htm#014)). It formed a part
of the sacred Scriptures used by our Lord and his apostles, and is
referred to as a part of the inspired Word ([Heb
12:5](../kjv/heb012.htm#005); [Co1 3:19](../kjv/co1003.htm#019)). The
subject of the book is the trial of Job, its occasion, nature,
endurance, and issue. It exhibits the harmony of the truths of
revelation and the dealings of Providence, which are seen to be at once
inscrutable, just, and merciful. It shows the blessedness of the truly
pious, even amid sore afflictions, and thus ministers comfort and hope
to tried believers of every age. It is a book of manifold instruction,
and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for
instruction in righteousness ([Ti2 3:16](../kjv/ti2003.htm#016)). It
consists of, (1.) An historical introduction in prose (Job 1, [Job
2:1](../kjv/job002.htm#001)). (2.) The controversy and its solution, in
poetry (Job 3 - 42:6). Job's desponding lamentation (Job 3) is the
occasion of the controversy which is carried on in three courses of
dialogues between Job and his three friends. The first course gives the
commencement of the controversy (Job 4 - 14); the second the growth of
the controversy (Job 15 - 21); and the third the height of the
controversy (Job 22 - 27). This is followed by the solution of the
controversy in the speeches of Elihu and the address of Jehovah,
followed by Job's humble confession ([Job 42:1](../kjv/job042.htm#001))
of his own fault and folly. (3.) The third division is the historical
conclusion, in prose ([Job 42:7](../kjv/job042.htm#007)). Sir J. W.
Dawson in "The Expositor" says: "It would now seem that the language and
theology of the book of Job can be better explained by supposing it to
be a portion of Minean \[Southern Arabia\] literature obtained by Moses
in Midian than in any other way. This view also agrees better than any
other with its references to natural objects, the art of mining, and
other matters."

<span id="003">**Jobab**</span> Dweller in the desert. (1.) One of the
sons of Joktan, and founder of an Arabian tribe ([Gen
10:29](../kjv/gen010.htm#029)). (2.) King of Edom, succeeded Bela ([Gen
36:33](../kjv/gen036.htm#033), [Gen 36:34](../kjv/gen036.htm#034)). (3.)
A Canaanitish king ([Jos 11:1](../kjv/jos011.htm#001)) who joined the
confederacy against Joshua.

<span id="004">**Jochebed**</span> Jehovah is her glory, the wife of
Amram, and the mother of Miriam, Aaron, and Moses ([Num
26:59](../kjv/num026.htm#059)). She is spoken of as the sister of
Kohath, Amram's father ([Exo 6:20](../kjv/exo006.htm#020); compare Ex.
16, 18; [Exo 2:1](../kjv/exo002.htm#001)).

<span id="005">**Joel**</span> Jehovah is his God. (1.) The oldest of
Samuel's two sons appointed by him as judges in Beersheba ([Sa1
8:2](../kjv/sa1008.htm#002)). (2.) A descendant of Reuben ([Ch1
5:4](../kjv/ch1005.htm#004), [Ch1 5:8](../kjv/ch1005.htm#008)). (3.) One
of David's famous warriors ([Ch1 11:38](../kjv/ch1011.htm#038)). (4.) A
Levite of the family of Gershom ([Ch1 15:7](../kjv/ch1015.htm#007), [Ch1
15:11](../kjv/ch1015.htm#011)). (5.) [Ch1 7:3](../kjv/ch1007.htm#003).
(6.) [Ch1 27:20](../kjv/ch1027.htm#020). (7.) The second of the twelve
minor prophets. He was the son of Pethuel. His personal history is only
known from his book.

<span id="006">**Joel, Book of**</span> Joel was probably a resident in
Judah, as his commission was to that people. He makes frequent mention
of Judah and Jerusalem ([Joe 1:14](../kjv/joe001.htm#014); [Joe
2:1](../kjv/joe002.htm#001), [Joe 2:15](../kjv/joe002.htm#015), [Joe
2:32](../kjv/joe002.htm#032); [Joe 3:1](../kjv/joe003.htm#001), [Joe
3:12](../kjv/joe003.htm#012), [Joe 3:17](../kjv/joe003.htm#017), [Joe
3:20](../kjv/joe003.htm#020), [Joe 3:21](../kjv/joe003.htm#021)). He
probably flourished in the reign of Uzziah (about 800 B.C.), and was
contemporary with Amos and Isaiah. The contents of this book are, (1.) A
prophecy of a great public calamity then impending over the land,
consisting of a want of water and an extraordinary plague of locusts
(Joel 1:1 - 2:11). (2.) The prophet then calls on his countrymen to
repent and to turn to God, assuring them of his readiness to forgive
([Joe 2:12](../kjv/joe002.htm#012)), and foretelling the restoration of
the land to its accustomed fruitfulness ([Joe
2:18](../kjv/joe002.htm#018)). (3.) Then follows a Messianic prophecy,
quoted by Peter ([Act 2:39](../kjv/act002.htm#039)). (4.) Finally, the
prophet foretells portents and judgments as destined to fall on the
enemies of God (Joel 3, but in the Hebrew text Joel 4, Heb. Text).

<span id="007">**Joelah**</span> A Benjamite who joined David at Ziklag
([Ch1 12:7](../kjv/ch1012.htm#007)).

<span id="008">**Joezer**</span> Jehovah is his help, one of the
Korhites who became part of David's body-guard ([Ch1
12:6](../kjv/ch1012.htm#006)).

<span id="009">**Johanan**</span> Whom Jehovah graciously bestows. (1.)
One of the Gadite heroes who joined David in the desert of Judah ([Ch1
12:12](../kjv/ch1012.htm#012)). (2.) The oldest of King Josiah's sons
([Ch1 3:15](../kjv/ch1003.htm#015)). (3.) Son of Careah, one of the
Jewish chiefs who rallied round Gedaliah, whom Nebuchadnezzar had made
governor in Jerusalem ([Kg2 25:23](../kjv/kg2025.htm#023); [Jer
40:8](../kjv/jer040.htm#008)). He warned Gedaliah of the plans of
Ishmael against him, a warning which was unheeded ([Jer
40:13](../kjv/jer040.htm#013), [Jer 40:16](../kjv/jer040.htm#016)). He
afterwards pursued the murderer of the governor, and rescued the
captives ([Jer 41:8](../kjv/jer041.htm#008), [Jer
41:13](../kjv/jer041.htm#013), [Jer 41:15](../kjv/jer041.htm#015), [Jer
41:16](../kjv/jer041.htm#016)). He and his associates subsequently fled
to Tahpanhes in Egypt ([Jer 43:2](../kjv/jer043.htm#002), [Jer
43:4](../kjv/jer043.htm#004), [Jer 43:5](../kjv/jer043.htm#005)), taken
Jeremiah with them. "The flight of Gedaliah's community to Egypt
extinguished the last remaining spark of life in the Jewish state. The
work of the ten centuries since Joshua crossed the Jordan had been
undone."
