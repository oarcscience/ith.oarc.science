<span id="000">**Thessalonica**</span> A large and populous city on the
Thermaic bay. It was the capital of one of the four Roman districts of
Macedonia, and was ruled by a praetor. It was named after Thessalonica,
the wife of Cassander, who built the city. She was so called by her
father, Philip, because he first heard of her birth on the day of his
gaining a victory over the Thessalians. On his second missionary
journey, Paul preached in the synagogue here, the chief synagogue of the
Jews in that part of Macedonia, and laid the foundations of a church
([Act 17:1](../kjv/act017.htm#001); [Th1 1:9](../kjv/th1001.htm#009).md).
The violence of the Jews drove him from the city, when he fled to Berea
([Act 17:5](../kjv/act017.htm#005).md). The "rulers of the city" before
whom the Jews "drew Jason," with whom Paul and Silas lodged, are in the
original called politarchai, an unusual word, which was found, however,
inscribed on an arch in Thessalonica. This discovery confirms the
accuracy of the historian. Paul visited the church here on a subsequent
occasion ([Act 20:1](../kjv/act020.htm#001).md). This city long retained
its importance. It is the most important town of European Turkey, under
the name of Saloniki, with a mixed population of about 85,000.

<span id="001">**Theudas**</span> Thanksgiving, referred to by Gamaliel
in his speech before the council at Jerusalem ([Act
5:36](../kjv/act005.htm#036).md). He headed an insurrection against the
Roman authority. Beyond this nothing is known of him.

<span id="002">**Thick Clay**</span> ([Hab 2:6](../kjv/hab002.htm#006).md)
is correctly rendered in the Revised Version "pledges." The Chaldean
power is here represented as a rapacious usurer, accumulating the wealth
that belonged to others.

<span id="003">**Thieves, The Two**</span> ([Luk
23:32](../kjv/luk023.htm#032), [Luk 23:39](../kjv/luk023.htm#039).md),
robbers, rather brigands, probably followers of Barabbas. Our Lord's
cross was placed between those of the "malefactors," to add to the
ignominy of his position. According to tradition, Demas or Dismas was
the name of the penitent thief hanging on the right, and Gestas of the
impenitent on the left.

<span id="004">**Thistle**</span> (1.) Heb. hoah ([Kg2
14:9](../kjv/kg2014.htm#009); [Job 31:40](../kjv/job031.htm#040).md). In
[Job 41:2](../kjv/job041.htm#002.md) the Hebrew word is rendered "thorn,"
but in the Revised Version "hook." It is also rendered "thorn" in [Ch2
33:11](../kjv/ch2033.htm#011); [Pro 26:9](../kjv/pro026.htm#009.md); [Sol
2:2](../kjv/sol002.htm#002.md); "brambles" in [Isa
34:13](../kjv/isa034.htm#013.md). It is supposed to be a variety of the
wild plum tree, but by some it is regarded as the common thistle, of
which there are many varieties in Palestine. (2.) Heb. dardar , meaning
"a plant growing luxuriantly" ([Gen 3:18](../kjv/gen003.htm#018.md); [Hos
10:8](../kjv/hos010.htm#008).md); Gr. tribolos , "a triple point" ([Mat
7:16](../kjv/mat007.htm#016); [Heb 6:8](../kjv/heb006.htm#008.md), "brier,"
R.V. "thistle"). This was probably the star-thistle, called by botanists
Centaurea calcitropa, or "caltrops," a weed common in corn-fields. (See
THORNS.)

<span id="005">**Thomas**</span> Twin, one of the twelve ([Mat
10:3](../kjv/mat010.htm#003); [Mar 3:18](../kjv/mar003.htm#018), etc..md).
He was also called Didymus ([Joh 11:16](../kjv/joh011.htm#016.md); [Joh
20:24](../kjv/joh020.htm#024).md), which is the Greek equivalent of the
Hebrew name. All we know regarding him is recorded in the fourth Gospel
([Joh 11:15](../kjv/joh011.htm#015), [Joh 11:16](../kjv/joh011.htm#016.md);
[Joh 14:4](../kjv/joh014.htm#004), [Joh 14:5](../kjv/joh014.htm#005.md);
[Joh 20:24](../kjv/joh020.htm#024), [Joh 20:25](../kjv/joh020.htm#025.md),
[Joh 20:26](../kjv/joh020.htm#026).md). From the circumstance that in the
lists of the apostles he is always mentioned along with Matthew, who was
the son of Alphaeus ([Mar 3:18](../kjv/mar003.htm#018).md), and that these
two are always followed by James, who was also the son of Alphaeus, it
has been supposed that these three, Matthew, Thomas, and James, were
brothers.

<span id="006">**Thorn**</span> (1.) Heb. hedek ([Pro
15:19](../kjv/pro015.htm#019).md), rendered " brier " in [Mic
7:4](../kjv/mic007.htm#004.md). Some thorny plant, of the Solanum family,
suitable for hedges. This is probably the so-called "apple of Sodom,"
which grows very abundantly in the Jordan valley. "It is a shrubby
plant, from 3 to 5 feet high, with very branching stems, thickly clad
with spines, like those of the English brier, with leaves very large and
woolly on the under side, and thorny on the midriff." (2.) Heb. kotz
([Gen 3:18](../kjv/gen003.htm#018); [Hos 10:8](../kjv/hos010.htm#008).md),
rendered akantha by the LXX. In the New Testament this word akantha is
also rendered "thorns" ([Mat 7:16](../kjv/mat007.htm#016.md); [Mat
13:7](../kjv/mat013.htm#007); [Heb 6:8](../kjv/heb006.htm#008).md). The
word seems to denote any thorny or prickly plant ([Jer
12:13](../kjv/jer012.htm#013).md). It has been identified with the Ononis
spinosa by some. (3.) Heb. na'atzutz ([Isa 7:19](../kjv/isa007.htm#019.md);
[Isa 55:13](../kjv/isa055.htm#013).md). This word has been interpreted as
denoting the Zizyphus spina Christi, or the jujube tree. It is supposed
by some that the crown of thorns placed in wanton cruelty by the Roman
soldiers on our Saviour's brow before his crucifixion was plaited of
branches of this tree. It overruns a great part of the Jordan valley. It
is sometimes called the lotus-tree. "The thorns are long and sharp and
recurved, and often create a festering wound." It often grows to a great
size. (See CROWN OF THORNS.) (4.) Heb. atad ([Psa
58:9](../kjv/psa058.htm#009).md) is rendered in the LXX. and Vulgate by
Rhamnus, or Lycium Europoeum, a thorny shrub, which is common all over
Palestine. From its resemblance to the box it is frequently called the
box-thorn.

<span id="007">**Thorn in the Flesh**</span> ([Co2
12:7](../kjv/co2012.htm#007).md). Many interpretations have been given of
this passage. (1.) Roman Catholic writers think that it denotes
suggestions to impiety. (2.) Luther, Calvin, and other Reformers
interpret the expression as denoting temptation to unbelief. (3.) Others
suppose the expression refers to "a pain in the ear or head," epileptic
fits, or, in general, to some severe physical infirmity, which was a
hindrance to the apostle in his work (compare [Co1
2:3](../kjv/co1002.htm#003); [Co2 10:10](../kjv/co2010.htm#010.md); [Co2
11:30](../kjv/co2011.htm#030); [Gal 4:13](../kjv/gal004.htm#013.md), [Gal
4:14](../kjv/gal004.htm#014); [Gal 6:17](../kjv/gal006.htm#017).md). With a
great amount of probability, it has been alleged that his malady was
defect of sight, consequent on the dazzling light which shone around him
at his conversion acute opthalmia. This would account for the statements
in [Gal 4:14](../kjv/gal004.htm#014.md); [Co2
10:10](../kjv/co2010.htm#010); also [Act 23:5](../kjv/act023.htm#005.md),
and for his generally making use of the help of an amanuensis (compare
[Rom 16:22](../kjv/rom016.htm#022), etc.). (4..md) Another view which has
been maintained is that this "thorn" consisted in an infirmity of
temper, to which he occasionally gave way, and which interfered with his
success (compare [Act 15:39](../kjv/act015.htm#039.md); [Act
23:2](../kjv/act023.htm#002).md). If we consider the fact, "which the
experience of God's saints in all ages has conclusively established, of
the difficulty of subduing an infirmity of temper, as well as the pain,
remorse, and humiliation such an infirmity is wont to cause to those who
groan under it, we may be inclined to believe that not the least
probable hypothesis concerning the 'thorn' or 'stake' in the flesh is
that the loving heart of the apostle bewailed as his sorest trail the
misfortune that, by impatience in word, he had often wounded those for
whom he would willingly have given his life" (Lias's Second Cor.,
Introd.).

<span id="008">**Thousands**</span> ([Mic 5:2](../kjv/mic005.htm#002).md),
another name for "families" or "clans" (see [Num
1:16](../kjv/num001.htm#016); [Num 10:4](../kjv/num010.htm#004.md); [Jos
22:14](../kjv/jos022.htm#014), [Jos 22:21](../kjv/jos022.htm#021).md).
Several "thousands" or "families" made up a "tribe."
