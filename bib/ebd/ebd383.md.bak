<span id="000">**Wizard**</span> A pretender to supernatural knowledge
and power, "a knowing one," as the original Hebrew word signifies. Such
an one was forbidden on pain of death to practice his deceptions ([Lev
19:31](../kjv/lev019.htm#031); [Lev 20:6](../kjv/lev020.htm#006.md), [Lev
20:27](../kjv/lev020.htm#027); [Sa1 28:3](../kjv/sa1028.htm#003.md); [Isa
8:19](../kjv/isa008.htm#019); [Isa 19:3](../kjv/isa019.htm#003).md).

<span id="001">**Wolf**</span> Heb. zeeb , frequently referred to in
Scripture as an emblem of treachery and cruelty. Jacob's prophecy,
"Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf" ([Gen 49:27](../kjv/gen049.htm#027).md),
represents the warlike character of that tribe (see Judg. 19 - 21).
Isaiah represents the peace of Messiah's kingdom by the words, "The wolf
also shall dwell with the lamb" ([Isa 11:6](../kjv/isa011.htm#006).md). The
habits of the wolf are described in [Jer 5:6](../kjv/jer005.htm#006.md);
[Hab 1:8](../kjv/hab001.htm#008); [Zep 3:3](../kjv/zep003.htm#003.md); [Eze
22:27](../kjv/eze022.htm#027); [Mat 7:15](../kjv/mat007.htm#015.md); [Mat
10:16](../kjv/mat010.htm#016); [Act 20:29](../kjv/act020.htm#029.md).
Wolves are still sometimes found in Palestine, and are the dread of
shepherds, as of old.

<span id="002">**Woman**</span> Was "taken out of man" ([Gen
2:23](../kjv/gen002.htm#023).md), and therefore the man has the
preeminence. "The head of the woman is the man;" but yet honour is to be
shown to the wife, "as unto the weaker vessel" ([Co1
11:3](../kjv/co1011.htm#003), [Co1 11:8](../kjv/co1011.htm#008.md), [Co1
11:9](../kjv/co1011.htm#009); [Pe1 3:7](../kjv/pe1003.htm#007).md). Several
women are mentioned in Scripture as having been endowed with prophetic
gifts, as Miriam ([Exo 15:20](../kjv/exo015.htm#020).md), Deborah ([Jdg
4:4](../kjv/jdg004.htm#004), [Jdg 4:5](../kjv/jdg004.htm#005).md), Huldah
([Kg2 22:14](../kjv/kg2022.htm#014).md), Noadiah ([Neh
6:14](../kjv/neh006.htm#014)), Anna ([Luk 2:36](../kjv/luk002.htm#036.md),
[Luk 2:37](../kjv/luk002.htm#037).md), and the daughters of Philip the
evangelist ([Act 21:8](../kjv/act021.htm#008.md), [Act
21:9](../kjv/act021.htm#009).md). Women are forbidden to teach publicly
([Co1 14:34](../kjv/co1014.htm#034), [Co1 14:35](../kjv/co1014.htm#035.md);
[Ti1 2:11](../kjv/ti1002.htm#011), [Ti1 2:12](../kjv/ti1002.htm#012).md).
Among the Hebrews it devolved upon women to prepare the meals for the
household ([Gen 18:6](../kjv/gen018.htm#006.md); [Sa2
13:8](../kjv/sa2013.htm#008).md), to attend to the work of spinning ([Exo
35:26](../kjv/exo035.htm#026); [Pro 31:19](../kjv/pro031.htm#019).md), and
making clothes ([Sa1 2:19](../kjv/sa1002.htm#019.md); [Pro
31:21](../kjv/pro031.htm#021).md), to bring water from the well ([Gen
24:15](../kjv/gen024.htm#015); [Sa1 9:11](../kjv/sa1009.htm#011).md), and
to care for the flocks ([Gen 29:6](../kjv/gen029.htm#006.md); [Exo
2:16](../kjv/exo002.htm#016).md). The word "woman," as used in [Mat
15:28](../kjv/mat015.htm#028), [Joh 2:4](../kjv/joh002.htm#004.md) and [Joh
20:13](../kjv/joh020.htm#013), [Joh 20:15](../kjv/joh020.htm#015.md),
implies tenderness and courtesy and not disrespect. Only where
revelation is known has woman her due place of honour assigned to her.

<span id="003">**Wood**</span> See FOREST.

<span id="004">**Wood-offering**</span> ([Neh
10:34](../kjv/neh010.htm#034); [Neh 13:31](../kjv/neh013.htm#031).md). It
would seem that in the time of Nehemiah arrangements were made, probably
on account of the comparative scarcity of wood, by which certain
districts were required, as chosen by lot, to furnish wood to keep the
altar fire perpetually burning ([Lev 6:13](../kjv/lev006.htm#013).md).

<span id="005">**Wool**</span> One of the first material used for making
woven cloth ([Lev 13:47](../kjv/lev013.htm#047.md), [Lev
13:48](../kjv/lev013.htm#048), [Lev 13:52](../kjv/lev013.htm#052.md), [Lev
13:59](../kjv/lev013.htm#059); [Lev 19:19](../kjv/lev019.htm#019).md). The
first-fruit of wool was to be offered to the priests ([Deu
18:4](../kjv/deu018.htm#004).md). The law prohibiting the wearing of a
garment "of divers sorts, as of woolen and linen together" ([Deu
22:11](../kjv/deu022.htm#011).md) may, like some other laws of a similar
character, have been intended to express symbolically the separateness
and simplicity of God's covenant people. The wool of Damascus, famous
for its whiteness, was of great repute in the Tyrian market ([Eze
27:18](../kjv/eze027.htm#018).md).

<span id="006">**Word, The**</span> (Gr. Logos ), one of the titles of
our Lord, found only in the writings of John ([Joh
1:1](../kjv/joh001.htm#001); [Jo1 1:1](../kjv/jo1001.htm#001.md); [Rev
19:13](../kjv/rev019.htm#013).md). As such, Christ is the revealer of God.
His office is to make God known. "No man hath seen God at any time; the
only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared
him" ([Joh 1:18](../kjv/joh001.htm#018).md). This title designates the
divine nature of Christ. As the Word, he "was in the beginning" and
"became flesh." "The Word was with God " and "was God," and was the
Creator of all things (compare [Psa 33:6](../kjv/psa033.htm#006.md); [Psa
107:20](../kjv/psa107.htm#020); [Psa 119:89](../kjv/psa119.htm#089.md);
[Psa 147:18](../kjv/psa147.htm#018); [Isa 40:8](../kjv/isa040.htm#008).md).

<span id="007">**Word of God**</span> ([Heb
4:12](../kjv/heb004.htm#012), etc..md). The Bible so called because the
writers of its several books were God's organs in communicating his will
to men. It is his "word," because he speaks to us in its sacred pages.
Whatever the inspired writers here declare to be true and binding upon
us, God declares to be true and binding. This word is infallible,
because written under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and therefore
free from all error of fact or doctrine or precept. (See INSPIRATION,
BIBLE.) All saving knowledge is obtained from the word of God. In the
case of adults it is an indispensable means of salvation, and is
efficacious thereunto by the gracious influence of the Holy Spirit ([Joh
17:17](../kjv/joh017.htm#017); [Ti2 3:15](../kjv/ti2003.htm#015.md), [Ti2
3:16](../kjv/ti2003.htm#016); [Pe1 1:23](../kjv/pe1001.htm#023).md).

<span id="008">**Works, Good**</span> The old objection against the
doctrine of salvation by grace, that it does away with the necessity of
good works, and lowers the sense of their importance (Rom. 6), although
it has been answered a thousand times, is still alleged by many. They
say if men are not saved by works, then works are not necessary. If the
most moral of men are saved in the same way as the very chief of
sinners, then good works are of no moment. And more than this, if the
grace of God is most clearly displayed in the salvation of the vilest of
men, then the worse men are the better. The objection has no validity.
The gospel of salvation by grace shows that good works are necessary. It
is true, unchangeably true, that without holiness no man shall see the
Lord. "Neither adulterers, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards"
shall inherit the kingdom of God. Works are "good" only when, (1.) they
spring from the principle of love to God. The moral character of an act
is determined by the moral principle that prompts it. Faith and love in
the heart are the essential elements of all true obedience. Hence good
works only spring from a believing heart, can only be wrought by one
reconciled to God ([Eph 2:10](../kjv/eph002.htm#010.md); [Jam
2:18](../kjv/jam002.htm#018); 22). (2..md) Good works have the glory of God
as their object; and (3.) they have the revealed will of God as their
only rule ([Deu 12:32](../kjv/deu012.htm#032.md); [Rev
22:18](../kjv/rev022.htm#018), [Rev 22:19](../kjv/rev022.htm#019).md). Good
works are an expression of gratitude in the believer's heart ([Joh
14:15](../kjv/joh014.htm#015), [Joh 14:23](../kjv/joh014.htm#023.md); [Gal
5:6](../kjv/gal005.htm#006).md). They are the fruits of the Spirit ([Tit
2:10](../kjv/tit002.htm#010).md), and thus spring from grace, which they
illustrate and strengthen in the heart. Good works of the most sincere
believers are all imperfect, yet like their persons they are accepted
through the mediation of Jesus Christ ([Col
3:17](../kjv/col003.htm#017).md), and so are rewarded; they have no merit
intrinsically, but are rewarded wholly of grace.

<span id="009">**Works, Covenant of**</span> Entered into by God with
Adam as the representative of the human race (compare [Gen
9:11](../kjv/gen009.htm#011), [Gen 9:12](../kjv/gen009.htm#012.md);
17:1-21), so styled because perfect obedience was its condition, thus
distinguishing it from the covenant of grace. (See COVENANT OF WORKS.)
