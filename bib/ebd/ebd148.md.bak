<span id="000">**Gibeah of Phinehas**</span> ([Jos
15:57](../kjv/jos015.htm#057), R.V. marg..md), a city on Mount Ephraim
which had been given to Phinehas ([Jos 24:33](../kjv/jos024.htm#033.md)
"hill," A.V.; R.V. marg. and Heb., "Gibeah."). Here Eleazar the son of
Aaron was buried. It has been identified with the modern Khurbet Jibia,
5 miles north of Guphna towards Shechem.

<span id="001">**Gibeah-haaraloth**</span> ([Jos
5:3](../kjv/jos005.htm#003), marg..md), hill of the foreskins, a place at
Gilgal where those who had been born in the wilderness were circumcised.
All the others, i.e., those who were under twenty years old at the time
of the sentence at Kadesh, had already been circumcised.

<span id="002">**Gibeon**</span> Hill-city, "one of the royal cities,
greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty" ([Jos
10:2](../kjv/jos010.htm#002).md). Its inhabitants were Hivites ([Jos
11:19](../kjv/jos011.htm#019).md). It lay within the territory of Benjamin,
and became a priest-city ([Jos 18:25](../kjv/jos018.htm#025.md); [Jos
21:17](../kjv/jos021.htm#017).md). Here the tabernacle was set up after the
destruction of Nob, and here it remained many years till the temple was
built by Solomon. It is represented by the modern el-Jib, to the
south-west of Ai, and about 51/2 miles north-north-west of Jerusalem. A
deputation of the Gibeonites, with their allies from three other cities
(Josh. 9; 17), visited the camp at Gilgal, and by false representations
induced Joshua to enter into a league with them, although the Israelites
had been specially warned against any league with the inhabitants of
Canaan ([Exo 23:32](../kjv/exo023.htm#032.md); [Exo
34:12](../kjv/exo034.htm#012); [Num 33:55](../kjv/num033.htm#055.md); [Deu
7:2](../kjv/deu007.htm#002).md). The deception practiced on Joshua was
detected three days later; but the oath rashly sworn "by Jehovah God of
Israel" was kept, and the lives of the Gibeonites were spared. They
were, however, made "bondsmen" to the sanctuary ([Jos
9:23](../kjv/jos009.htm#023).md). The most remarkable incident connected
with this city was the victory Joshua gained over the kings of Palestine
([Jos 10:16](../kjv/jos010.htm#016).md). The battle here fought has been
regarded as "one of the most important in the history of the world." The
kings of southern Canaan entered into a confederacy against Gibeon
(because it had entered into a league with Joshua) under the leadership
of Adoni-zedec, king of Jerusalem, and marched upon Gibeon with the view
of taking possession of it. The Gibeonites entreated Joshua to come to
their aid with the utmost speed. His army came suddenly upon that of the
Amorite kings as it lay encamped before the city. It was completely
routed, and only broken remnants of their great host found refuge in the
fenced cities. The five confederate kings who led the army were taken
prisoners, and put to death at Makkedah (q.v.). This eventful battle of
Beth-horon sealed the fate of all the cities of Southern Palestine.
Among the Amarna tablets is a letter from Adoni-zedec (q.v.) to the king
of Egypt, written probably at Makkedah after the defeat, showing that
the kings contemplated flight into Egypt. This place is again brought
into notice as the scene of a battle between the army of Ish-bosheth
under Abner and that of David led by Joab. At the suggestion of Abner,
to spare the effusion of blood twelve men on either side were chosen to
decide the battle. The issue was unexpected; for each of the men slew
his fellow, and thus they all perished. The two armies then engaged in
battle, in which Abner and his host were routed and put to flight ([Sa2
2:12](../kjv/sa2002.htm#012).md). This battle led to a virtual truce
between Judah and Israel, Judah, under David, increasing in power; and
Israel, under Ish-bosheth, continually losing ground. Soon after the
death of Absalom and David's restoration to his throne his kingdom was
visited by a grievous famine, which was found to be a punishment for
Saul's violation ([Sa2 21:2](../kjv/sa2021.htm#002.md), [Sa2
21:5](../kjv/sa2021.htm#005).md) of the covenant with the Gibeonites (Josh.
9:3-27). The Gibeonites demanded blood for the wrong that had been done
to them, and accordingly David gave up to them the two sons of Rizpah
(q.v.) and the five sons of Michal, and these the Gibeonites took and
hanged or crucified "in the hill before the Lord" ([Sa2
21:9](../kjv/sa2021.htm#009).md); and there the bodies hung for six months
([Sa2 21:10](../kjv/sa2021.htm#010).md), and all the while Rizpah watched
over the blackening corpses and "suffered neither the birds of the air
to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night." David
afterwards removed the bones of Saul and Jonathan at Jabeshgilead ([Sa2
21:12](../kjv/sa2021.htm#012), [Sa2 21:13](../kjv/sa2021.htm#013).md).
Here, "at the great stone," Amasa was put to death by Joab ([Sa2
20:5](../kjv/sa2020.htm#005).md). To the altar of burnt-offering which was
at Gibeon, Joab ([Kg1 2:28](../kjv/kg1002.htm#028).md), who had taken the
side of Adonijah, fled for sanctuary in the beginning of Solomon's
reign, and was there also slain by the hand of Benaiah. Soon after he
came to the throne, Solomon paid a visit of state to Gibeon, there to
offer sacrifices ([Kg1 3:4](../kjv/kg1003.htm#004.md); [Ch2
1:3](../kjv/ch2001.htm#003).md). On this occasion the Lord appeared to him
in a memorable dream, recorded in [Kg1 3:5](../kjv/kg1003.htm#005.md); [Ch2
1:7](../kjv/ch2001.htm#007.md). When the temple was built "all the men of
Israel assembled themselves" to king Solomon, and brought up from Gibeon
the tabernacle and "all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle" to
Jerusalem, where they remained till they were carried away by
Nebuchadnezzar ([Kg2 24:13](../kjv/kg2024.htm#013).md).

<span id="003">**Gideon**</span> Called also Jerubbaal ([Jdg
6:29](../kjv/jdg006.htm#029), [Jdg 6:32](../kjv/jdg006.htm#032).md), was
the first of the judges whose history is circumstantially narrated
(Judg. 6-8). His calling is the commencement of the second period in the
history of the judges. After the victory gained by Deborah and Barak
over Jabin, Israel once more sank into idolatry, and the Midianites
(q.v.) and Amalekites, with other "children of the east," crossed the
Jordan each year for seven successive years for the purpose of
plundering and desolating the land. Gideon received a direct call from
God to undertake the task of delivering the land from these warlike
invaders. He was of the family of Abiezer ([Jos
17:2](../kjv/jos017.htm#002); [Ch1 7:18](../kjv/ch1007.htm#018).md), and of
the little township of Ophrah ([Jdg 6:11](../kjv/jdg006.htm#011).md).
First, with ten of his servants, he overthrew the altars of Baal and cut
down the asherah which was upon it, and then blew the trumpet of alarm,
and the people flocked to his standard on the crest of Mount Gilboa to
the number of twenty-two thousand men. These were, however, reduced to
only three hundred. These, strangely armed with torches and pitchers and
trumpets, rushed in from three different points on the camp of Midian at
midnight, in the valley to the north of Moreh, with the terrible
war-cry, "For the Lord and for Gideon" ([Jdg
7:18](../kjv/jdg007.htm#018), R.V..md). Terror-stricken, the Midianites
were put into dire confusion, and in the darkness slew one another, so
that only fifteen thousand out of the great army of one hundred and
twenty thousand escaped alive. The memory of this great deliverance
impressed itself deeply on the mind of the nation ([Sa1
12:11](../kjv/sa1012.htm#011); [Psa 83:11](../kjv/psa083.htm#011.md); [Isa
9:4](../kjv/isa009.htm#004); [Isa 10:26](../kjv/isa010.htm#026.md); [Heb
11:32](../kjv/heb011.htm#032).md). The land had now rest for forty years.
Gideon died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of his
fathers. Soon after his death a change came over the people. They again
forgot Jehovah, and turned to the worship of Baalim, "neither shewed
they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal" ([Jdg
8:35](../kjv/jdg008.htm#035).md). Gideon left behind him seventy sons, a
feeble, sadly degenerated race, with one exception, that of Abimelech,
who seems to have had much of the courage and energy of his father, yet
of restless and unscrupulous ambition. He gathered around him a band who
slaughtered all Gideon's sons, except Jotham, upon one stone. (See
OPHRAH.)

<span id="004">**Gier Eagle**</span> Heb. raham = "parental affection,"
[Lev 11:18](../kjv/lev011.htm#018); [Deu 14:17](../kjv/deu014.htm#017.md);
R.V., "vulture"), a species of vulture living entirely on carrion. "It
is about the size of a raven; has an almost triangular, bald, and
wrinkled head, a strong pointed beak, black at the tip, large eyes and
ears, the latter entirely on the outside, and long feet." It is common
in Egypt, where it is popularly called "Pharaoh's chicken" (the Neophron
percnopterus), and is found in Palestine only during summer. Tristram
thinks that the Hebrew name, which is derived from a root meaning "to
love," is given to it from the fact that the male and female bird never
part company.

<span id="005">**Gift**</span> (1.) An gratuity ([Pro
19:6](../kjv/pro019.htm#006).md) to secure favour ([Pro
18:16](../kjv/pro018.htm#016); [Pro 21:14](../kjv/pro021.htm#014).md), a
thank-offering ([Num 18:11](../kjv/num018.htm#011).md), or a dowry ([Gen
34:12](../kjv/gen034.htm#012)). (2..md) An oblation or propitiatory gift
[Deu 26:8](../kjv/deu026.htm#008); [Psa 45:12](../kjv/psa045.htm#012.md);
[Psa 72:10](../kjv/psa072.htm#010)). (3..md) A bribe to a judge to obtain a
favourable verdict ([Exo 23:8](../kjv/exo023.htm#008.md); [Deu
16:19](../kjv/deu016.htm#019)). (4..md) Simply a thing given ([Mat
7:11](../kjv/mat007.htm#011); [Luk 11:13](../kjv/luk011.htm#013.md); [Eph
4:8](../kjv/eph004.htm#008).md); sacrificial ([Mat
5:23](../kjv/mat005.htm#023), [Mat 5:24](../kjv/mat005.htm#024.md); [Mat
8:4](../kjv/mat008.htm#004).md); eleemosynary ([Luk
21:1](../kjv/luk021.htm#001).md); a gratuity ([Joh
4:10](../kjv/joh004.htm#010); [Act 8:20](../kjv/act008.htm#020).md). In
[Act 2:38](../kjv/act002.htm#038.md) the generic word dorea is rendered
"gift." It differs from the charisma ([Co1 12:4](../kjv/co1012.htm#004).md)
as denoting not miraculous powers but the working of a new spirit in
men, and that spirit from God. The giving of presents entered largely
into the affairs of common life in the East. The nature of the presents
was as various as were the occasions: food ([Sa1
9:7](../kjv/sa1009.htm#007); [Sa1 16:20](../kjv/sa1016.htm#020).md), sheep
and cattle ([Gen 32:13](../kjv/gen032.htm#013).md), gold ([Sa2
18:11](../kjv/sa2018.htm#011).md), jewels ([Gen
24:53](../kjv/gen024.htm#053).md), furniture, and vessels for eating and
drinking ([Sa2 17:28](../kjv/sa2017.htm#028).md); delicacies, as spices,
honey, etc. ([Kg1 10:25](../kjv/kg1010.htm#025.md); [Kg2
5:22](../kjv/kg2005.htm#022).md). The mode of presentation was with as much
parade as possible: the presents were conveyed by the hands of servants
([Jdg 3:18](../kjv/jdg003.htm#018).md), or still better, on the backs of
beasts of burden ([Kg2 8:9](../kjv/kg2008.htm#009).md). The refusal of a
present was regarded as a high indignity; and this constituted the
aggravated insult noticed in [Mat 22:11](../kjv/mat022.htm#011.md), the
marriage robe having been offered and refused.

<span id="006">**Gifts, Spiritual**</span> (Gr. charismata ), gifts
supernaturally bestowed on the early Christians, each having his own
proper gift or gifts for the edification of the body of Christ. These
were the result of the extraordinary operation of the Spirit, as on the
day of Pentecost. They were the gifts of speaking with tongues, casting
out devils, healing, etc. ([Mar 16:17](../kjv/mar016.htm#017.md), [Mar
16:18](../kjv/mar016.htm#018).md), usually communicated by the medium of
the laying on of the hands of the apostles ([Act
8:17](../kjv/act008.htm#017); [Act 19:6](../kjv/act019.htm#006.md); [Ti1
4:14](../kjv/ti1004.htm#014).md). These charismata were enjoyed only for a
time. They could not continue always in the Church. They were suited to
its infancy and to the necessities of those times.

<span id="007">**Gihon**</span> A stream. (1.) One of the four rivers of
Eden ([Gen 2:13](../kjv/gen002.htm#013).md). It has been identified with
the Nile. Others regard it as the Oxus, or the Araxes, or the Ganges.
But as, according to the sacred narrative, all these rivers of Eden took
their origin from the head-waters of the Euphrates and the Trigris, it
is probable that the Gihon is the ancient Araxes, which, under the
modern name of the Arras, discharges itself into the Caspian Sea. It was
the Asiatic and not the African "Cush" which the Gihon compassed ([Gen
10:7](../kjv/gen010.htm#007)). (See EDEN.) (2..md) The only natural spring
of water in or near Jerusalem is the "Fountain of the Virgin" (q.v.),
which rises outside the city walls on the west bank of the Kidron
valley. On the occasion of the approach of the Assyrian army under
Sennacherib, Hezekiah, in order to prevent the besiegers from finding
water, "stopped the upper water course of Gihon, and brought it straight
down to the west side of the city of David" ([Ch2
32:30](../kjv/ch2032.htm#030); [Ch2 33:14](../kjv/ch2033.htm#014).md). This
"fountain" or spring is therefore to be regarded as the "upper water
course of Gihon." From this "fountain" a tunnel cut through the ridge
which forms the south part of the temple hill conveys the water to the
Pool of Siloam, which lies on the opposite side of this ridge at the
head of the Tyropoeon ("cheesemakers") valley, or valley of the son of
Hinnom, now filled up by rubbish. The length of this tunnel is about
1,750 feet. In 1880 an inscription was accidentally discovered on the
wall of the tunnel about nineteen feet from where it opens into the Pool
of Siloam. This inscription was executed in all probability by
Hezekiah's workmen. It briefly narrates the history of the excavation.
It may, however, be possible that this tunnel was executed in the time
of Solomon. If the "waters of Shiloah that go softly" ([Isa
8:6](../kjv/isa008.htm#006).md) refers to the gentle stream that still
flows through the tunnel into the Pool of Siloam, then this excavation
must have existed before the time of Hezekiah. In the upper part of the
Tyropoeoan valley there are two pools still existing, the first, called
Birket el-Mamilla, to the west of the Jaffa gate; the second, to the
south of the first, called Birket es-Sultan. It is the opinion of some
that the former was the "upper" and the latter the "lower" Pool of Gihon
([Kg2 18:17](../kjv/kg2018.htm#017); [Isa 7:3](../kjv/isa007.htm#003.md);
[Isa 36:2](../kjv/isa036.htm#002); [Isa 22:9](../kjv/isa022.htm#009).md).
(See CONDUIT; SILOAM.)

<span id="008">**Gilboa**</span> Boiling spring, a mountain range, now
Jebel Fukua' , memorable as the scene of Saul's disastrous defeat by the
Philistines. Here also his three sons were slain, and he himself died by
his own hand ([Sa1 28:4](../kjv/sa1028.htm#004.md); [Sa1
31:1](../kjv/sa1031.htm#001.md); 2 Sam. 1:6-21; [Sa2
21:12](../kjv/sa2021.htm#012); [Ch1 10:1](../kjv/ch1010.htm#001.md), [Ch1
10:8](../kjv/ch1010.htm#008).md). It was a low barren range of mountains
bounding the valley of Esdraelon (Jezreel) on the east, between it and
the Jordan valley. When the tidings of this defeat were conveyed to
David, he gave utterance to those pathetic words in the "Song of the
Bow" ([Sa2 1:19](../kjv/sa2001.htm#019).md).

<span id="009">**Gilead**</span> Hill of testimony, ([Gen
31:21](../kjv/gen031.htm#021).md), a mountainous region east of Jordan.
From its mountainous character it is called "the mount of Gilead" ([Gen
31:25](../kjv/gen031.htm#025).md). It is called also "the land of Gilead"
([Num 32:1](../kjv/num032.htm#001).md), and sometimes simply "Gilead" ([Psa
60:7](../kjv/psa060.htm#007); [Gen 37:25](../kjv/gen037.htm#025).md). It
comprised the possessions of the tribes of Gad and Reuben and the south
part of Manasseh ([Deu 3:13](../kjv/deu003.htm#013.md); [Num
32:40](../kjv/num032.htm#040).md). It was bounded on the north by Bashan,
and on the south by Moab and Ammon ([Gen 31:21](../kjv/gen031.htm#021.md);
[Deu 3:12](../kjv/deu003.htm#012).md). "Half Gilead" was possessed by
Sihon, and the other half, separated from it by the river Jabbok, by Og,
king of Bashan. The deep ravine of the river Hieromax (the modern
Sheriat el-Mandhur) separated Bashan from Gilead, which was about 60
miles in length and 20 in breadth, extending from near the south end of
the Lake of Gennesaret to the north end of the Dead Sea. Abarim, Pisgah,
Nebo, and Peor are its mountains mentioned in Scripture.
