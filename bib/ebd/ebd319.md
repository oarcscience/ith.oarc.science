<span id="000">**Salcah**</span> Wandering, a city of Bashan assigned to
the half tribe of Manasseh ([Deu 3:10](../kjv/deu003.htm#010.md); [Jos
12:5](../kjv/jos012.htm#005); [Jos 13:11](../kjv/jos013.htm#011).md),
identified with Salkhad, about 56 miles east of Jordan.

<span id="001">**Salem**</span> Peace, commonly supposed to be another
name of Jerusalem ([Gen 14:18](../kjv/gen014.htm#018.md); [Psa
76:2](../kjv/psa076.htm#002); [Heb 7:1](../kjv/heb007.htm#001.md), [Heb
7:2](../kjv/heb007.htm#002).md).

<span id="002">**Salim**</span> Peaceful, a place near Aenon (q.v.), on
the west of Jordan, where John baptized ([Joh
3:23](../kjv/joh003.htm#023).md). It was probably the Shalem mentioned in
[Gen 33:18](../kjv/gen033.htm#018.md), about 7 miles south of Aenon, at the
head of the great Wady Far'ah , which formed the northern boundary of
Judea in the Jordan valley.

<span id="003">**Sallai**</span> Basket-maker. (1.) A Benjamite ([Neh
11:8](../kjv/neh011.htm#008)). (2..md) A priest in the days of Joshua and
Zerubbabel ([Neh 12:20](../kjv/neh012.htm#020).md).

<span id="004">**Sallu**</span> Weighed. (1.) A priest ([Neh
12:7](../kjv/neh012.htm#007)). (2..md) A Benjamite ([Ch1
9:7](../kjv/ch1009.htm#007); [Neh 11:7](../kjv/neh011.htm#007).md).

<span id="005">**Salmon**</span> (1.)Garment, the son of Nashon ([Rut
4:20](../kjv/rut004.htm#020); [Mat 1:4](../kjv/mat001.htm#004.md), [Mat
1:5](../kjv/mat001.htm#005).md), possibly the same as Salma in [Ch1
2:51](../kjv/ch1002.htm#051). (2.) Shady; or Zalmon (q.v..md), a hill
covered with dark forests, south of Shechem, from which Abimelech and
his men gathered wood to burn that city ([Jdg
9:48](../kjv/jdg009.htm#048)). In [Psa 68:14](../kjv/psa068.htm#014.md) the
change from war to peace is likened to snow on the dark mountain, as
some interpret the expression. Others suppose the words here mean that
the bones of the slain left unburied covered the land, so that it seemed
to be white as if covered with snow. The reference, however, of the
psalm is probably to Josh. 11 and 12. The scattering of the kings and
their followers is fitly likened unto the snow-flakes rapidly falling on
the dark Salmon. It is the modern Jebel Suleiman.

<span id="006">**Salmone**</span> A promontory on the east of Crete,
under which Paul sailed on his voyage to Rome ([Act
27:7](../kjv/act027.htm#007).md); the modern Cape Sidero.

<span id="007">**Salome**</span> Perfect. (1.) The wife of Zebedee and
mother of James and John ([Mat 27:56](../kjv/mat027.htm#056).md), and
probably the sister of Mary, the mother of our Lord ([Joh
19:25](../kjv/joh019.htm#025).md). She sought for her sons places of honour
in Christ's kingdom ([Mat 20:20](../kjv/mat020.htm#020.md), [Mat
20:21](../kjv/mat020.htm#021.md); compare [Mat
19:28](../kjv/mat019.htm#028).md). She witnessed the crucifixion ([Mar
15:40](../kjv/mar015.htm#040).md), and was present with the other women at
the sepulchre ([Mat 27:56](../kjv/mat027.htm#056)). (2..md) "The daughter
of Herodias," not named in the New Testament. On the occasion of the
birthday festival held by Herod Antipas, who had married her mother
Herodias, in the fortress of Machaerus, she "came in and danced, and
pleased Herod" (Mark 6:14-29). John the Baptist, at that time a prisoner
in the dungeons underneath the castle, was at her request beheaded by
order of Herod, and his head given to the damsel in a charger, "and the
damsel gave it to her mother," whose revengeful spirit was thus
gratified. "A luxurious feast of the period" (says Farrar, Life of
Christ) "was not regarded as complete unless it closed with some gross
pantomimic representation; and doubtless Herod had adopted the evil
fashion of his day. But he had not anticipated for his guests the rare
luxury of seeing a princess, his own niece, a grand-daughter of Herod
the Great and of Mariamne, a descendant, therefore, of Simon the high
priest and the great line of Maccabean princes, a princess who
afterwards became the wife of a tetrarch \[Philip, tetrarch of
Trachonitis\] and the mother of a king, honouring them by degrading
herself into a scenic dancer."

<span id="008">**Salt**</span> Used to season food ([Job
6:6](../kjv/job006.htm#006).md), and mixed with the fodder of cattle ([Isa
30:24](../kjv/isa030.htm#024), "clean;" in marg. of R.V. "salted".md). All
meat-offerings were seasoned with salt ([Lev
2:13](../kjv/lev002.htm#013).md). To eat salt with one is to partake of his
hospitality, to derive subsistence from him; and hence he who did so was
bound to look after his host's interests ([Ezr
4:14](../kjv/ezr004.htm#014.md), "We have maintenance from the king's
palace;" A.V. marg., "We are salted with the salt of the palace;" R.V.,
"We eat the salt of the palace"). A "covenant of salt" ([Num
18:19](../kjv/num018.htm#019); [Ch2 13:5](../kjv/ch2013.htm#005).md) was a
covenant of perpetual obligation. New-born children were rubbed with
salt ([Eze 16:4](../kjv/eze016.htm#004).md). Disciples are likened unto
salt, with reference to its cleansing and preserving uses ([Mat
5:13](../kjv/mat005.htm#013).md). When Abimelech took the city of Shechem,
he sowed the place with salt, that it might always remain a barren soil
([Jdg 9:45](../kjv/jdg009.htm#045).md). Sir Lyon Playfair argues, on
scientific grounds, that under the generic name of "salt," in certain
passages, we are to understand petroleum or its residue asphalt. Thus in
[Gen 19:26](../kjv/gen019.htm#026.md) he would read "pillar of asphalt;"
and in [Mat 5:13](../kjv/mat005.htm#013.md), instead of "salt,"
"petroleum," which loses its essence by exposure, as salt does not, and
becomes asphalt, with which pavements were made. The Jebel Usdum, to the
south of the Dead Sea, is a mountain of rock salt about 7 miles long and
from 2 to 3 miles wide and some hundreds of feet high.
