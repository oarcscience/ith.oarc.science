<span id="000">**Mulberry**</span> Heb. bakah , "to weep;" rendered
"Baca" (R.V., "weeping") in [Psa 84:6](../kjv/psa084.htm#006). The
plural form of the Hebrew bekaim is rendered "mulberry trees" in [Sa2
5:23](../kjv/sa2005.htm#023), [Sa2 5:24](../kjv/sa2005.htm#024) and [Ch1
14:14](../kjv/ch1014.htm#014), [Ch1 14:15](../kjv/ch1014.htm#015). The
tree here alluded to was probably the aspen or trembling poplar. "We
know with certainty that the black poplar, the aspen, and the Lombardy
poplar grew in Palestine. The aspen, whose long leafstalks cause the
leaves to tremble with every breath of wind, unites with the willow and
the oak to overshadow the watercourses of the Lebanon, and with the
oleander and the acacia to adorn the ravines of Southern Palestine"
(Kitto). By "the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees" we
are to understand a rustling among the trees like the marching of an
army. This was the signal that the Lord himself would lead forth David's
army to victory. (See SYCAMINE.)

<span id="001">**Mule**</span> (Heb. pered ), so called from the quick
step of the animal or its power of carrying loads. It is not probable
that the Hebrews bred mules, as this was strictly forbidden in the law
([Lev 19:19](../kjv/lev019.htm#019)), although their use was not
forbidden. We find them in common use even by kings and nobles ([Sa2
18:9](../kjv/sa2018.htm#009); [Kg1 1:33](../kjv/kg1001.htm#033); [Kg2
5:17](../kjv/kg2005.htm#017); [Psa 32:9](../kjv/psa032.htm#009)). They
are not mentioned, however, till the time of David, for the word
rendered "mules" (R.V. correctly, "hot springs") in [Gen
36:24](../kjv/gen036.htm#024) (yemim) properly denotes the warm springs
of Callirhoe, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. In David's reign
they became very common ([Sa2 13:29](../kjv/sa2013.htm#029); [Kg1
10:25](../kjv/kg1010.htm#025)). Mules are not mentioned in the New
Testament. Perhaps they had by that time ceased to be used in Palestine.

<span id="002">**Murder**</span> Willful murder was distinguished from
accidental homicide, and was invariably visited with capital punishment
([Num 35:16](../kjv/num035.htm#016), [Num 35:18](../kjv/num035.htm#018),
[Num 35:21](../kjv/num035.htm#021), [Num 35:31](../kjv/num035.htm#031);
[Lev 24:17](../kjv/lev024.htm#017)). This law in its principle is
founded on the fact of man's having been made in the likeness of God
([Gen 9:5](../kjv/gen009.htm#005), [Gen 9:6](../kjv/gen009.htm#006);
[Joh 8:44](../kjv/joh008.htm#044); [Jo1 3:12](../kjv/jo1003.htm#012),
[Jo1 3:15](../kjv/jo1003.htm#015)). The Mosaic law prohibited any
compensation for murder or the reprieve of the murderer ([Exo
21:12](../kjv/exo021.htm#012), [Exo 21:14](../kjv/exo021.htm#014); [Deu
19:11](../kjv/deu019.htm#011), [Deu 19:13](../kjv/deu019.htm#013); [Sa2
17:25](../kjv/sa2017.htm#025); [Sa2 20:10](../kjv/sa2020.htm#010)). Two
witnesses were required in any capital case ([Num
35:19](../kjv/num035.htm#019); [Deu 17:6](../kjv/deu017.htm#006)). If
the murderer could not be discovered, the city nearest the scene of the
murder was required to make expiation for the crime committed ([Deu
21:1](../kjv/deu021.htm#001)). These offenses also were to be punished
with death, (1.) striking a parent; (2.) cursing a parent; (3.)
kidnapping ([Exo 21:15](../kjv/exo021.htm#015); [Deu
27:16](../kjv/deu027.htm#016)).

<span id="003">**Murmuring**</span> Of the Hebrews in the wilderness,
called forth the displeasure of God, which was only averted by the
earnest prayer of Moses ([Num 11:33](../kjv/num011.htm#033), [Num
11:34](../kjv/num011.htm#034); 12; [Num 14:27](../kjv/num014.htm#027),
[Num 14:30](../kjv/num014.htm#030), [Num 14:31](../kjv/num014.htm#031);
[Num 16:3](../kjv/num016.htm#003); [Num 21:4](../kjv/num021.htm#004);
[Psa 106:25](../kjv/psa106.htm#025)). Forbidden by Paul ([Co1
10:10](../kjv/co1010.htm#010)).

<span id="004">**Murrain**</span> Heb. deber , "destruction," a "great
mortality", the fifth plague that fell upon the Egyptians ([Exo
9:3](../kjv/exo009.htm#003)). It was some distemper that resulted in the
sudden and widespread death of the cattle. It was confined to the cattle
of the Egyptians that were in the field ([Exo
9:6](../kjv/exo009.htm#006)).

<span id="005">**Mushi**</span> Receding, the second of the two sons of
Merari ([Exo 6:19](../kjv/exo006.htm#019); [Num
3:20](../kjv/num003.htm#020)). His sons were called Mushites ([Num
3:33](../kjv/num003.htm#033); [Num 26:58](../kjv/num026.htm#058)).

<span id="006">**Music**</span> Jubal was the inventor of musical
instruments ([Gen 4:21](../kjv/gen004.htm#021)). The Hebrews were much
given to the cultivation of music. Their whole history and literature
afford abundant evidence of this. After the Deluge, the first mention of
music is in the account of Laban's interview with Jacob ([Gen
31:27](../kjv/gen031.htm#027)). After their triumphal passage of the Red
Sea, Moses and the children of Israel sang their song of deliverance
(Ex. 15). But the period of Samuel, David, and Solomon was the golden
age of Hebrew music, as it was of Hebrew poetry. Music was now for the
first time systematically cultivated. It was an essential part of
training in the schools of the prophets ([Sa1
10:5](../kjv/sa1010.htm#005); [Sa1 19:19](../kjv/sa1019.htm#019); [Kg2
3:15](../kjv/kg2003.htm#015); [Ch1 25:6](../kjv/ch1025.htm#006)). There
now arose also a class of professional singers ([Sa2
19:35](../kjv/sa2019.htm#035); [Ecc 2:8](../kjv/ecc002.htm#008)). The
temple, however, was the great school of music. In the conducting of its
services large bands of trained singers and players on instruments were
constantly employed ([Sa2 6:5](../kjv/sa2006.htm#005); 1 Chr. 15; 16;
[Ch1 23:5](../kjv/ch1023.htm#005); [Ch1 25:1](../kjv/ch1025.htm#001)).
In private life also music seems to have held an important place among
the Hebrews ([Ecc 2:8](../kjv/ecc002.htm#008); [Amo
6:4](../kjv/amo006.htm#004); [Isa 5:11](../kjv/isa005.htm#011), [Isa
5:12](../kjv/isa005.htm#012); [Isa 24:8](../kjv/isa024.htm#008), [Isa
24:9](../kjv/isa024.htm#009); [Psa 137:1](../kjv/psa137.htm#001); [Jer
48:33](../kjv/jer048.htm#033); [Luk 15:25](../kjv/luk015.htm#025)).

<span id="007">**Music, Instrumental**</span> Among instruments of music
used by the Hebrews a principal place is given to stringed instruments.
These were, (1.) The kinnor, the "harp." (2.) The nebel, "a skin
bottle," rendered "psaltery." (3.) The sabbeka, or "sackbut," a lute or
lyre. (4.) The gittith, occurring in the title of [Psa
8:1](../kjv/psa008.htm#001); 81; [Psa 84:1](../kjv/psa084.htm#001). (5.)
Minnim ([Psa 150:4](../kjv/psa150.htm#004)), rendered "stringed
instruments;" in [Psa 45:8](../kjv/psa045.htm#008), in the form minni,
probably the apocopated (i.e., shortened) plural, rendered, Authorized
Version, "whereby," and in the Revised Version "stringed instruments."
(6.) Machalath, in the titles of [Psa 53:1](../kjv/psa053.htm#001) and
88; supposed to be a kind of lute or guitar. Of wind instruments mention
is made of, (1.) The 'ugab ([Gen 4:21](../kjv/gen004.htm#021); [Job
21:12](../kjv/job021.htm#012); [Job 30:31](../kjv/job030.htm#031)),
probably the so-called Pan's pipes or syrinx. (2.) The qeren or "horn"
([Jos 6:5](../kjv/jos006.htm#005); [Ch1 25:5](../kjv/ch1025.htm#005)).
(3.) The shophar , rendered "trumpet" ([Jos 6:4](../kjv/jos006.htm#004),
[Jos 6:6](../kjv/jos006.htm#006), [Jos 6:8](../kjv/jos006.htm#008)). The
word means "bright," and may have been so called from the clear, shrill
sound it emitted. It was often used ([Exo 19:13](../kjv/exo019.htm#013);
[Num 10:10](../kjv/num010.htm#010); [Jdg 7:16](../kjv/jdg007.htm#016),
[Jdg 7:18](../kjv/jdg007.htm#018); [Sa1 13:3](../kjv/sa1013.htm#003)).
(4.) The hatsotserah , or straight trumpet ([Psa
98:6](../kjv/psa098.htm#006); [Num 10:1](../kjv/num010.htm#001)). This
name is supposed by some to be an onomatopoetic word, intended to
imitate the pulse-like sound of the trumpet, like the Latin taratantara
. Some have identified it with the modern trombone. (5.) The halil ,
i.e., "bored through," a flute or pipe ([Sa1
10:5](../kjv/sa1010.htm#005); [Kg1 1:40](../kjv/kg1001.htm#040); [Isa
5:12](../kjv/isa005.htm#012); [Jer 48:36](../kjv/jer048.htm#036)) which
is still used in Palestine. (6.) The sumponyah , rendered "dulcimer"
([Dan 3:5](../kjv/dan003.htm#005)), probably a sort of bagpipe. (7.) The
maskrokith'a ([Dan 3:5](../kjv/dan003.htm#005)), rendered "flute," but
its precise nature is unknown. Of instruments of percussion mention is
made of, (1.) The toph , an instrument of the drum kind, rendered
"timbrel" ([Exo 15:20](../kjv/exo015.htm#020); [Job
21:12](../kjv/job021.htm#012); [Psa 68:25](../kjv/psa068.htm#025)); also
"tabret" ([Gen 31:27](../kjv/gen031.htm#027); [Isa
24:8](../kjv/isa024.htm#008); [Sa1 10:5](../kjv/sa1010.htm#005)). (2.)
The paamon , the "bells" on the robe of the high priest ([Exo
28:33](../kjv/exo028.htm#033);e [Exo 39:25](../kjv/exo039.htm#025)).
(3.) The tseltselim , "cymbals" ([Sa2 6:5](../kjv/sa2006.htm#005); [Psa
150:5](../kjv/psa150.htm#005)), which are struck together and produce a
loud, clanging sound. Metsilloth , "bells" on horses and camels for
ornament, and metsiltayim , "cymbals" ([Ch1
13:8](../kjv/ch1013.htm#008); [Ezr 3:10](../kjv/ezr003.htm#010), etc.).
These words are all derived from the same root, tsalal, meaning "to
tinkle." (4.) The menaan'im , used only in [Sa2
6:5](../kjv/sa2006.htm#005), rendered "cornets" (R.V., "castanets"); in
the Vulgate, " sistra ," an instrument of agitation. (5.) The shalishim
, mentioned only in [Sa1 18:6](../kjv/sa1018.htm#006), rendered
"instruments of music" (marg. of R.V., "triangles or three-stringed
instruments"). The words in [Ecc 2:8](../kjv/ecc002.htm#008), "musical
instruments, and that of all sorts," Authorized Version, are in the
Revised Version "concubines very many."

<span id="008">**Musician, Chief**</span> (Heb. menatstseah ), the
presenter of the Levitical choir or orchestra in the temple, mentioned
in the titles of fifty-five psalms, and in [Hab
3:19](../kjv/hab003.htm#019), Revised Version. The first who held this
office was Jeduthun ([Ch1 16:41](../kjv/ch1016.htm#041)), and the office
appears to have been hereditary. Heman and Asaph were his two colleagues
([Ch2 35:15](../kjv/ch2035.htm#015)).

<span id="009">**Mustard**</span> A plant of the genus sinapis, a
pod-bearing, shrub-like plant, growing wild, and also cultivated in
gardens. The little round seeds were an emblem of any small
insignificant object. It is not mentioned in the Old Testament; and in
each of the three instances of its occurrence in the New Testament ([Mat
13:31](../kjv/mat013.htm#031), [Mat 13:32](../kjv/mat013.htm#032); [Mar
4:31](../kjv/mar004.htm#031), [Mar 4:32](../kjv/mar004.htm#032); [Luk
13:18](../kjv/luk013.htm#018), [Luk 13:19](../kjv/luk013.htm#019)) it is
spoken of only with reference to the smallness of its seed. The common
mustard of Palestine is the Sinapis nigra. This garden herb sometimes
grows to a considerable height, so as to be spoken of as "a tree" as
compared with garden herbs.
