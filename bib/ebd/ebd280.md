<span id="000">**Oracle**</span> In the Old Testament used in every
case, except [Sa2 16:23](../kjv/sa2016.htm#023.md), to denote the most holy
place in the temple ([Kg1 6:5](../kjv/kg1006.htm#005.md), [Kg1
6:19](../kjv/kg1006.htm#019); [Kg1 8:6](../kjv/kg1008.htm#006).md). In [Sa2
16:23](../kjv/sa2016.htm#023.md) it means the Word of God. A man inquired
"at the oracle of God" by means of the Urim and Thummim in the
breastplate on the high priest's ephod. In the New Testament it is used
only in the plural, and always denotes the Word of God ([Rom
3:2](../kjv/rom003.htm#002); [Heb 5:12](../kjv/heb005.htm#012), etc..md).
The Scriptures are called "living oracles" (Compare [Heb
4:12](../kjv/heb004.htm#012).md) because of their quickening power ([Act
7:38](../kjv/act007.htm#038).md).

<span id="001">**Oreb**</span> Raven, a prince of Midian, who, being
defeated by Gideon and put to straits, was slain along with Zeeb ([Jdg
7:20](../kjv/jdg007.htm#020).md). Many of the Midianites perished along
with him ([Psa 83:9](../kjv/psa083.htm#009.md); [Isa
10:26](../kjv/isa010.htm#026).md).

<span id="002">**Oreb, The Rock of**</span> The place where Gideon slew
Oreb after the defeat of the Midianites ([Jdg
7:25](../kjv/jdg007.htm#025); [Isa 10:26](../kjv/isa010.htm#026).md). It
was probably the place now called Orbo, on the east of Jordan, near
Bethshean.

<span id="003">**Oren**</span> Ash or pine, the son of Jerahmeel ([Ch1
2:25](../kjv/ch1002.htm#025).md).

<span id="004">**Organ**</span> Some kind of wind instrument, probably a
kind of Pan's pipes ([Gen 4:21](../kjv/gen004.htm#021.md); [Job
21:12](../kjv/job021.htm#012); [Psa 150:4](../kjv/psa150.htm#004).md),
which consisted of seven or eight reeds of unequal length.

<span id="005">**Orion**</span> Heb. Kesil ; i.e., "the fool", the name
of a constellation ([Job 9:9](../kjv/job009.htm#009.md); [Job
38:31](../kjv/job038.htm#031); [Amo 5:8](../kjv/amo005.htm#008).md)
consisting of about eighty stars. The Vulgate renders thus, but the LXX.
renders by Hesperus, i.e., "the evening-star," Venus. The Orientals
"appear to have conceived of this constellation under the figure of an
impious giant bound upon the sky." This giant was, according to
tradition, Nimrod, the type of the folly that contends against God. In
[Isa 13:10](../kjv/isa013.htm#010.md) the plural form of the Hebrew word is
rendered "constellations.

<span id="006">**Ornan**</span> [Ch1 21:15](../kjv/ch1021.htm#015.md). (See
ARAUNAH.)

<span id="007">**Orpah**</span> Forelock or fawn, a Moabitess, the wife
of Chilion ([Rut 1:4](../kjv/rut001.htm#004.md); [Rut
4:10](../kjv/rut004.htm#010).md). On the death of her husband she
accompanied Naomi, her mother-in-law, part of the way to Bethlehem, and
then returned to Moab.

<span id="008">**Orphans**</span> ([Lam 5:3](../kjv/lam005.htm#003).md),
i.e., desolate and without protectors. The word occurs only here. In
[Joh 14:18](../kjv/joh014.htm#018.md) the word there rendered "comfortless"
(R.V., "desolate;" marg., "orphans") properly means "orphans." The same
Greek word is rendered "fatherless" in [Jam
1:27](../kjv/jam001.htm#027.md).

<span id="009">**Osprey**</span> Heb. 'ozniyyah , an unclean bird
according to the Mosaic law ([Lev 11:13](../kjv/lev011.htm#013.md); [Deu
14:12](../kjv/deu014.htm#012).md); the fish-eating eagle (Pandion
haliaetus); one of the lesser eagles. But the Hebrew word may be taken
to denote the short-toed eagle (Circaetus gallicus of Southern Europe),
one of the most abundant of the eagle tribe found in Palestine.
