<span id="000">**A (Alpha)**</span> Alpha, the first letter of the Greek
alphabet, as Omega is the last. These letters occur in the text of [Rev
1:8](../kjv/rev001.htm#008), [Rev 1:11](../kjv/rev001.htm#011.md); [Rev
21:6](../kjv/rev021.htm#006); [Rev 22:13](../kjv/rev022.htm#013.md), and
are represented by "Alpha" and "Omega" respectively (omitted in R.V.,
[Rev 1:11](../kjv/rev001.htm#011).md). They mean "the first and last."
(Compare [Heb 12:2](../kjv/heb012.htm#002.md); [Isa
41:4](../kjv/isa041.htm#004); [Isa 44:6](../kjv/isa044.htm#006.md); [Rev
1:11](../kjv/rev001.htm#011), [Rev 1:17](../kjv/rev001.htm#017.md); [Rev
2:8](../kjv/rev002.htm#008)..md) In the symbols of the early Christian
Church these two letters are frequently combined with the cross or with
Christ's monogram to denote his divinity.

<span id="001">**Aaron**</span> The eldest son of Amram and Jochebed, a
daughter of Levi ([Exo 6:20](../kjv/exo006.htm#020).md). Some explain the
name as meaning mountaineer, others mountain of strength, illuminator.
He was born in Egypt three years before his brother Moses, and a number
of years after his sister Miriam ([Exo 2:1](../kjv/exo002.htm#001.md), [Exo
2:4](../kjv/exo002.htm#004); [Exo 7:7](../kjv/exo007.htm#007).md). He
married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab of the house of Judah ([Exo
6:23](../kjv/exo006.htm#023); [Ch1 2:10](../kjv/ch1002.htm#010).md), by
whom he had four sons, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. When the
time for the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt drew nigh, he was sent
by God ([Exo 4:14](../kjv/exo004.htm#014.md), [Exo
4:27](../kjv/exo004.htm#027).md) to meet his long-absent brother, that he
might co-operate with him in all that they were required to do in
bringing about the Exodus. He was to be the "mouth" or "prophet" of
Moses, i.e., was to speak for him, because he was a man of a ready
utterance ([Exo 7:1](../kjv/exo007.htm#001.md), [Exo
7:2](../kjv/exo007.htm#002), [Exo 7:9](../kjv/exo007.htm#009.md), [Exo
7:10](../kjv/exo007.htm#010), [Exo 7:19](../kjv/exo007.htm#019).md). He was
faithful to his trust, and stood by Moses in all his interviews with
Pharaoh. When the ransomed tribes fought their first battle with Amalek
in Rephidim, Moses stood on a hill overlooking the scene of the conflict
with the rod of God in his outstretched hand. On this occasion he was
attended by Aaron and Hur, his sister's husband, who held up his wearied
hands till Joshua and the chosen warriors of Israel gained the victory
([Exo 17:8](../kjv/exo017.htm#008).md). Afterwards, when encamped before
Sinai, and when Moses at the command of God ascended the mount to
receive the tables of the law, Aaron and his two sons, Nadab and Abihu,
along with seventy of the elders of Israel, were permitted to accompany
him part of the way, and to behold afar off the manifestation of the
glory of Israel's God ([Exo 19:24](../kjv/exo019.htm#024.md); [Exo
24:9](../kjv/exo024.htm#009).md). While Moses remained on the mountain with
God, Aaron returned unto the people; and yielding through fear, or
ignorance, or instability of character, to their clamour, made unto them
a golden calf, and set it up as an object of worship ([Exo
32:4](../kjv/exo032.htm#004); [Psa 106:19](../kjv/psa106.htm#019).md). On
the return of Moses to the camp, Aaron was sternly rebuked by him for
the part he had acted in this matter; but he interceded for him before
God, who forgave his sin ([Deu 9:20](../kjv/deu009.htm#020).md). On the
mount, Moses received instructions regarding the system of worship which
was to be set up among the people; and in accordance therewith Aaron and
his sons were consecrated to the priest's office (Lev. 8; 9). Aaron, as
high priest, held henceforth the prominent place appertaining to that
office. When Israel had reached Hazeroth, in "the wilderness of Paran,"
Aaron joined with his sister Miriam in murmuring against Moses, "because
of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married," probably after the death of
Zipporah. But the Lord vindicated his servant Moses, and punished Miriam
with leprosy (Num. 12). Aaron acknowledged his own and his sister's
guilt, and at the intercession of Moses they were forgiven. Twenty years
after this, when the children of Israel were encamped in the wilderness
of Paran, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram conspired against Aaron and his
sons; but a fearful judgment from God fell upon them, and they were
destroyed, and the next day thousands of the people also perished by a
fierce pestilence, the ravages of which were only stayed by the
interposition of Aaron (Num. 16). That there might be further evidence
of the divine appointment of Aaron to the priestly office, the chiefs of
the tribes were each required to bring to Moses a rod bearing on it the
name of his tribe. And these, along with the rod of Aaron for the tribe
of Levi, were laid up overnight in the tabernacle, and in the morning it
was found that while the other rods remained unchanged, that of Aaron
"for the house of Levi" budded, blossomed, and yielded almonds ([Num
17:1](../kjv/num017.htm#001).md). This rod was afterwards preserved in the
tabernacle ([Heb 9:4](../kjv/heb009.htm#004).md) as a memorial of the
divine attestation of his appointment to the priesthood. Aaron was
implicated in the sin of his brother at Meribah ([Num
20:8](../kjv/num020.htm#008).md), and on that account was not permitted to
enter the Promised Land. When the tribes arrived at Mount Hor, "in the
edge of the land of Edom," at the command of God Moses led Aaron and his
son Eleazar to the top of that mountain, in the sight of all the people.
There he stripped Aaron of his priestly vestments, and put them upon
Eleazar; and there Aaron died on the top of the mount, being 123 years
old ([Num 20:23](../kjv/num020.htm#023.md). Compare [Deu
10:6](../kjv/deu010.htm#006); [Deu 32:50](../kjv/deu032.htm#050).md), and
was "gathered unto his people." The people, "even all the house of
Israel," mourned for him thirty days. Of Aaron's sons two survived him,
Eleazar, whose family held the high-priesthood till the time of Eli; and
Ithamar, in whose family, beginning with Eli, the high-priesthood was
held till the time of Solomon. Aaron's other two sons had been struck
dead ([Lev 10:1](../kjv/lev010.htm#001.md), [Lev
10:2](../kjv/lev010.htm#002).md) for the daring impiety of offering
"strange fire" on the alter of incense. The Arabs still show with
veneration the traditionary site of Aaron's grave on one of the two
summits of Mount Hor, which is marked by a Mohammedan chapel. His name
is mentioned in the Koran, and there are found in the writings of the
rabbins many fabulous stories regarding him. He was the first anointed
priest. His descendants, "the house of Aaron," constituted the
priesthood in general. In the time of David they were very numerous
([Ch1 12:27](../kjv/ch1012.htm#027).md). The other branches of the tribe of
Levi held subordinate positions in connection with the sacred office.
Aaron was a type of Christ in his official character as the high priest.
His priest-hood was a "shadow of heavenly things," and was intended to
lead the people of Israel to look forward to the time when "another
priest" would arise "after the order of Melchizedek" ([Heb
6:20](../kjv/heb006.htm#020)). (See MOSES..md)

<span id="002">**Aaronites**</span> The descendants of Aaron, and
therefore priests. Jehoiada, the father of Benaiah, led 3,700 Aaronites
as "fighting men" to the support of David at Hebron ([Ch1
12:27](../kjv/ch1012.htm#027).md). Eleazar ([Num
3:32](../kjv/num003.htm#032).md), and at a later period Zadok ([Ch1
27:17](../kjv/ch1027.htm#017).md), was their chief.

<span id="003">**Abaddon**</span> Destruction, the Hebrew name
(equivalent to the Greek Apollyon , i.e., destroyer) of "the angel of
the bottomless pit" ([Rev 9:11](../kjv/rev009.htm#011).md). It is rendered
"destruction" in [Job 28:22](../kjv/job028.htm#022.md); [Job
31:12](../kjv/job031.htm#012); [Job 26:6](../kjv/job026.htm#006.md); [Pro
15:11](../kjv/pro015.htm#011); [Pro 27:20](../kjv/pro027.htm#020.md). In
the last three of these passages the Revised Version retains the word
"Abaddon." We may regard this word as a personification of the idea of
destruction, or as sheol, the realm of the dead.

<span id="004">**Abagtha**</span> One of the seven eunuchs in
Ahasuerus's court ([Est 1:10](../kjv/est001.htm#010.md); [Est
2:21](../kjv/est002.htm#021).md).

<span id="005">**Abana**</span> Stony (Heb. marg. "Amanah," perennial),
the chief river of Damascus ([Kg2 5:12](../kjv/kg2005.htm#012).md). Its
modern name is Barada, the Chrysorrhoas, or "golden stream," of the
Greeks. It rises in a cleft of the Anti-Lebanon range, about 23 miles
north-west of Damascus, and after flowing southward for a little way
parts into three smaller streams, the central one flowing through
Damascus, and the other two on each side of the city, diffusing beauty
and fertility where otherwise there would be barrenness.

<span id="006">**Abarim**</span> Regions beyond; i.e., on the east of
Jordan, a mountain, or rather a mountain-chain, over against Jericho, to
the east and south-east of the Dead Sea, in the land of Moab. From "the
top of Pisgah", i.e., Mount Nebo (q.v.), one of its summits, Moses
surveyed the Promised Land ([Deu 3:27](../kjv/deu003.htm#027.md); [Deu
32:49](../kjv/deu032.htm#049).md), and there he died ([Deu
34:1](../kjv/deu034.htm#001), [Deu 34:5](../kjv/deu034.htm#005).md). The
Israelites had one of their encampments in the mountains of Abarim ([Num
33:47](../kjv/num033.htm#047), [Num 33:48](../kjv/num033.htm#048).md) after
crossing the Arnon.

<span id="007">**Abba**</span> This Syriac or Chaldee word is found
three times in the New Testament ([Mar 14:36](../kjv/mar014.htm#036.md);
[Rom 8:15](../kjv/rom008.htm#015); [Gal 4:6](../kjv/gal004.htm#006).md),
and in each case is followed by its Greek equivalent, which is
translated "father." It is a term expressing warm affection and filial
confidence. It has no perfect equivalent in our language. It has passed
into European languages as an ecclesiastical term, "abbot."

<span id="008">**Abda**</span> Servant. (1.) The father of Adoniram,
whom Solomon set over the tribute ([Kg1 4:6](../kjv/kg1004.htm#006).md);
i.e., the forced labour (R.V., "levy"). (2.) A Levite of the family of
Jeduthun ([Neh 11:17](../kjv/neh011.htm#017).md), also called Obadiah ([Ch1
9:16](../kjv/ch1009.htm#016).md).

<span id="009">**Abdeel**</span> Servant of God, ([Jer
36:26](../kjv/jer036.htm#026).md), the father of Shelemiah.
