<span id="000">**Porter**</span> A gate-keeper ([Sa2
18:26](../kjv/sa2018.htm#026); [Kg2 7:10](../kjv/kg2007.htm#010); [Ch1
9:21](../kjv/ch1009.htm#021); [Ch2 8:14](../kjv/ch2008.htm#014)). Of the
Levites, 4,000 were appointed as porters by David ([Ch1
23:5](../kjv/ch1023.htm#005)), who were arranged according to their
families (1 Chr. 26:1-19) to take charge of the doors and gates of the
temple. They were sometimes employed as musicians ([Ch1
15:18](../kjv/ch1015.htm#018)).

<span id="001">**Post**</span> (1.) A runner, or courier, for the rapid
transmission of letters, etc. ([Ch2 30:6](../kjv/ch2030.htm#006); [Est
3:13](../kjv/est003.htm#013), [Est 3:15](../kjv/est003.htm#015); [Est
8:10](../kjv/est008.htm#010), [Est 8:14](../kjv/est008.htm#014); [Job
9:25](../kjv/job009.htm#025); [Jer 51:31](../kjv/jer051.htm#031)). Such
messengers were used from very early times. Those employed by the Hebrew
kings had a military character ([Sa1 22:17](../kjv/sa1022.htm#017); [Kg2
10:25](../kjv/kg2010.htm#025), "guard," marg. "runners"). The modern
system of postal communication was first established by Louis XI. of
France in A.D. 1464. (2.) This word sometimes also is used for lintel or
threshold ([Isa 6:4](../kjv/isa006.htm#004)).

<span id="002">**Potiphar**</span> Dedicated to Ra; i.e., to the
sun-god, the Egyptian to whom the Ishmaelites sold Joseph ([Gen
39:1](../kjv/gen039.htm#001)). He was "captain of the guard", i.e.,
chief, probably, of the state police, who, while they formed part of the
Egyptian army, were also largely employed in civil duties ([Gen
37:36](../kjv/gen037.htm#036); marg., "chief of the executioners").
Joseph, though a foreigner, gradually gained his confidence, and became
overseer over all his possessions. Believing the false accusation which
his profligate wife brought against Joseph, Potiphar cast him into
prison, where he remained for some years. (See JOSEPH.)

<span id="003">**Potipherah**</span> A priest of On, whose daughter
Asenath became Joseph's wife ([Gen 41:45](../kjv/gen041.htm#045)).

a fragment of earthenware ([Job 2:8](../kjv/job002.htm#008); [Pro
26:23](../kjv/pro026.htm#023); [Isa 45:9](../kjv/isa045.htm#009)).

<span id="005">**Pottage**</span> Heb. nazid , "boiled", a dish of
boiled food, as of lentils ([Gen 25:29](../kjv/gen025.htm#029); [Kg2
4:38](../kjv/kg2004.htm#038)).

<span id="006">**Potters' Field**</span> The name given to the piece of
ground which was afterwards bought with the money that had been given to
Judas. It was called the "field of blood" ([Mat
27:7](../kjv/mat027.htm#007)). Tradition places it in the valley of
Hinnom. (See ACELDAMA.)

<span id="007">**Pottery**</span> The art of, was early practiced among
all nations. Various materials seem to have been employed by the potter.

18:4](../kjv/gen018.htm#004)), of Rebekah ([Gen
27:14](../kjv/gen027.htm#014)), of Rachel ([Gen
29:2](../kjv/gen029.htm#002), [Gen 29:3](../kjv/gen029.htm#003), [Gen
29:8](../kjv/gen029.htm#008), [Gen 29:10](../kjv/gen029.htm#010)). The
potter's wheel is mentioned by Jeremiah ([Jer
18:3](../kjv/jer018.htm#003)). See also [Ch1
4:23](../kjv/ch1004.htm#023); [Psa 2:9](../kjv/psa002.htm#009); [Isa
45:9](../kjv/isa045.htm#009); [Isa 64:8](../kjv/isa064.htm#008); [Jer
19:1](../kjv/jer019.htm#001); [Lam 4:2](../kjv/lam004.htm#002); [Zac
11:13](../kjv/zac011.htm#013); [Rom 9:21](../kjv/rom009.htm#021).

<span id="008">**Pound**</span> (1.) A weight. Heb. maneh , equal to 100
shekels ([Kg1 10:17](../kjv/kg1010.htm#017); [Ezr
2:69](../kjv/ezr002.htm#069); [Neh 7:71](../kjv/neh007.htm#071), [Neh
7:72](../kjv/neh007.htm#072)). Gr. liter , equal to about 12 oz.

[Luk 19:24](../kjv/luk019.htm#024), [Luk 19:25](../kjv/luk019.htm#025)).
It was equal to 100 drachmas, and was of the value of about 3, 6s. 8d.
of our money. (See MONEY.)

<span id="009">**Praetorium**</span> The Greek word ( praitorion ) thus
rendered in [Mar 15:16](../kjv/mar015.htm#016) is rendered "common hall"
([Mat 27:27](../kjv/mat027.htm#027), marg., "governor's house"),
"judgment hall," ([Joh 18:28](../kjv/joh018.htm#028), [Joh
18:33](../kjv/joh018.htm#033), marg., "Pilate's house", [Joh
19:9](../kjv/joh019.htm#009); [Act 23:35](../kjv/act023.htm#035)),
"palace" ([Phi 1:13](../kjv/phi001.htm#013)). This is properly a
military word. It denotes (1.) the general's tent or headquarters; (2.)
the governor's residence, as in [Act 23:35](../kjv/act023.htm#035)
