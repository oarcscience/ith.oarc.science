------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Battlement**</span> A parapet wall or balustrade
surrounding the flat roofs of the houses, required to be built by a
special law ([Deu 22:8](../kjv/deu022.htm#008).md). In [Jer
5:10](../kjv/jer005.htm#010.md), it denotes the parapet of a city wall.

<span id="001">**Bay**</span> Denotes the estuary of the Dead Sea at the
mouth of the Jordan ([Jos 15:5](../kjv/jos015.htm#005.md); [Jos
18:19](../kjv/jos018.htm#019).md), also the southern extremity of the same
sea ([Jos 15:2](../kjv/jos015.htm#002).md). The same Hebrew word is
rendered "tongue" in [Isa 11:15](../kjv/isa011.htm#015.md), where it is
used with reference to the forked mouths of the Nile. BAY In [Zac
6:3](../kjv/zac006.htm#003), [Zac 6:7](../kjv/zac006.htm#007.md) denotes
the colour of horses, but the original Hebrew means strong, and is here
used rather to describe the horses as fleet or spirited.

<span id="002">**Bay tree**</span> Named only in [Psa
37:35](../kjv/psa037.htm#035.md), Authorized Version. The Hebrew word so
rendered is ereh, which simply means "native born", i.e., a tree not
transplanted, but growing on its native soil, and therefore luxuriantly.
If the psalmist intended by this word to denote any particular tree, it
may have been the evergreen bay laurel (Laurus nobilis), which is a
native of Palestine. Instead of "like a green bay tree" in the
Authorized Version, the Revised Version has, "like a green tree in its
native soil."

<span id="003">**Bdellium**</span> Occurs only in [Gen
2:12](../kjv/gen002.htm#012.md), where it designates a product of the land
of Havilah; and in [Num 11:7](../kjv/num011.htm#007.md), where the manna is
likened to it in colour. It was probably an aromatic gum like balsam
which exuded from a particular tree (Borassus flabelliformis) still
found in Arabia, Media, and India. It bears a resemblance in colour to
myrrh. Others think the word denotes "pearls," or some precious stone.

<span id="004">**Beacon**</span> A pole (Heb. to'ren ) used as a
standard or ensign set on the tops of mountains as a call to the people
to assemble themselves for some great national purpose ([Isa
30:17](../kjv/isa030.htm#017)). In [Isa 33:23](../kjv/isa033.htm#023.md)
and [Eze 27:5](../kjv/eze027.htm#005.md), the same word is rendered "mast."
(See BANNER.)

<span id="005">**Bealiah**</span> Whose Lord is Jehovah, a Benjamite,
one of David's thirty heroes of the sling and bow ([Ch1
12:5](../kjv/ch1012.htm#005).md).

<span id="006">**Bealoth**</span> Citizens, a town in the extreme south
of Judah ([Jos 15:24](../kjv/jos015.htm#024).md); probably the same as
Baalath-beer ([Jos 19:8](../kjv/jos019.htm#008).md). In [Kg1
4:16](../kjv/kg1004.htm#016.md), the Authorized Version has "in Aloth," the
Revised Version "Bealoth."

<span id="007">**Beam**</span> Occurs in the Authorized Version as the
rendering of various Hebrew words. In [Sa1 17:7](../kjv/sa1017.htm#007.md),
it means a weaver's frame or principal beam; in [Hab
2:11](../kjv/hab002.htm#011.md), a crossbeam or girder; [Kg2
6:2](../kjv/kg2006.htm#002), [Kg2 6:5](../kjv/kg2006.htm#005.md), a
cross-piece or rafter of a house; [Kg1 7:6](../kjv/kg1007.htm#006.md), an
architectural ornament as a projecting step or moulding; [Eze
41:25](../kjv/eze041.htm#025.md), a thick plank. In the New Testament the
word occurs only in [Mat 7:3](../kjv/mat007.htm#003.md), [Mat
7:4](../kjv/mat007.htm#004), [Mat 7:5](../kjv/mat007.htm#005.md), and [Luk
6:41](../kjv/luk006.htm#041), [Luk 6:42](../kjv/luk006.htm#042.md), where
it means (Gr. dokos ) a large piece of wood used for building purposes,
as contrasted with "mote" (Gr. karphos ), a small piece or mere
splinter. "Mote" and "beam" became proverbial for little and great
faults.

<span id="008">**Beans**</span> Mentioned in [Sa2
17:28](../kjv/sa2017.htm#028.md) as having been brought to David when
flying from Absalom. They formed a constituent in the bread Ezekiel
([Eze 4:9](../kjv/eze004.htm#009).md) was commanded to make, as they were
in general much used as an article of diet. They are extensively
cultivated in Egypt and Arabia and Syria.

<span id="009">**Bear**</span> A native of the mountain regions of
Western Asia, frequently mentioned in Scripture. David defended his
flocks against the attacks of a bear ([Sa1
17:34](../kjv/sa1017.htm#034).md). Bears came out of the wood and destroyed
the children who mocked the prophet Elisha ([Kg2
2:24](../kjv/kg2002.htm#024).md). Their habits are referred to in [Isa
59:11](../kjv/isa059.htm#011); [Pro 28:15](../kjv/pro028.htm#015.md); [Lam
3:10](../kjv/lam003.htm#010.md). The fury of the female bear when robbed of
her young is spoken of ([Sa2 17:8](../kjv/sa2017.htm#008.md); [Pro
17:12](../kjv/pro017.htm#012); [Hos 13:8](../kjv/hos013.htm#008).md). In
Daniel's vision of the four great monarchies, the Medo-Persian empire is
represented by a bear ([Dan 7:5](../kjv/dan007.htm#005).md)
