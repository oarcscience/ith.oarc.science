<span id="000">**Tidal**</span> (in the LXX. called "Thorgal"), styled
the "king of nations" ([Gen 14:1](../kjv/gen014.htm#001).md). Mentioned as
Tudkhula on Arioch's brick. Goyyim, translated "nations," is the country
called Gutium, east of Tigris and north of Elam.

<span id="001">**Tiglath-Pileser I**</span> (not mentioned in Scripture)
was the most famous of the monarchs of the first Assyrian empire (about
B.C.1110). After his death, for two hundred years the empire fell into
decay. The history of David and Solomon falls within this period. He was
succeeded by his son, Shalmaneser II.

<span id="002">**Tiglath-Pileser III**</span> Or Tilgath-Pilneser, the
Assyrian throne-name of Pul (q.v.). He appears in the Assyrian records
as gaining, in the fifth year of his reign (about 741 B.C.), a victory
over Azariah (= Uzziah in [Ch2 26:1](../kjv/ch2026.htm#001).md), king of
Judah, whose achievements are described in [Ch2
26:6](../kjv/ch2026.htm#006.md). He is first mentioned in Scripture,
however, as gaining a victory over Pekah, king of Israel, and Rezin of
Damascus, who were confederates. He put Rezin to death, and punished
Pekah by taking a considerable portion of his kingdom, and carrying off
(B.C.734) a vast number of its inhabitants into captivity ([Kg2
15:29](../kjv/kg2015.htm#029); [Kg2 16:5](../kjv/kg2016.htm#005.md); [Ch1
5:6](../kjv/ch1005.htm#006), [Ch1 5:26](../kjv/ch1005.htm#026).md), the
Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh whom he settled
in Gozan. In the Assyrian annals it is further related that, before he
returned from Syria, he held a court at Damascus, and received
submission and tribute from the neighbouring kings, among whom were
Pekah of Samaria and "Yahu-khazi \[i.e., Ahaz\], king of Judah" (compare
[Kg2 16:10](../kjv/kg2016.htm#010).md). He was the founder of what is
called "the second Assyrian empire," an empire meant to embrace the
whole world, the centre of which should be Nineveh. He died 728 B.C.,
and was succeeded by a general of his army, Ulula, who assumed the name
Shalmaneser IV.

<span id="003">**Timaeus**</span> Defiled, the father of blind
Bartimaeus ([Mar 10:46](../kjv/mar010.htm#046).md).

<span id="004">**Timbrel**</span> (Heb. toph ), a small drum or
tambourine; a tabret (q.v.). The antiquity of this musical instrument
appears from the scriptural allusions to it ([Gen
31:27](../kjv/gen031.htm#027); [Exo 15:20](../kjv/exo015.htm#020.md); [Jdg
11:34](../kjv/jdg011.htm#034), etc.) (See MUSIC..md)

<span id="005">**Timnah**</span> A portion. (1.) A town of Judah ([Jos
15:10](../kjv/jos015.htm#010).md). The Philistines took possession of it in
the days of Ahaz ([Ch2 28:18](../kjv/ch2028.htm#018).md). It was about 20
miles west of Jerusalem. It has been identified with Timnatha of Dan
([Jos 19:43](../kjv/jos019.htm#043).md), and also with Timnath ([Jdg
14:1](../kjv/jdg014.htm#001), [Jdg 14:5](../kjv/jdg014.htm#005)). (2..md) A
city in the mountains of Judah ([Jos 15:57](../kjv/jos015.htm#057).md)=
Tibna near Jeba' . (3.) A "duke" or sheik of Edom ([Gen
36:40](../kjv/gen036.htm#040).md).

<span id="006">**Timnath**</span> [Gen 38:12](../kjv/gen038.htm#012.md),
[Gen 38:14](../kjv/gen038.htm#014). (1..md) Heb. Timnathah , which is
appropriately rendered in the Revised Version, Timnah, a town in Judah.
(2.) The town where Samson sojourned, probably identical with "Timnah"
(3.) (Judg. 14:1-18).

<span id="007">**Timnath-heres**</span> Portion of the sun, where Joshua
was buried ([Jdg 2:9](../kjv/jdg002.htm#009).md). It was "in the mount of
Ephraim, in the north side of the hill Gaash," 10 miles south-west of
Shechem. The same as the following.

<span id="008">**Timnath-serah**</span> Remaining portion, the city of
Joshua in the hill country of Ephraim, the same as Timnath heres ([Jos
19:50](../kjv/jos019.htm#050); [Jos 24:30](../kjv/jos024.htm#030).md). "Of
all sites I have seen," says Lieut. -Col. Conder, "none is so striking
as that of Joshua's home, surrounded as it is with deep valleys and
wild, rugged hills." Opposite the town is a hill, on the northern side
of which there are many excavated sepulchers. Among these is the
supposed tomb of Joshua, which is said to be "the most striking monument
in the country." It is a "square chamber with five excavations in three
of its sides, the central one forming a passage leading into a second
chamber beyond. A great number of lamp-niches cover the walls of the
porch, upwards of two hundred, arranged in vertical rows. A single
cavity with a niche for a lamp has been thought to be the resting-place
of the warrior-chief of Israel." The modern Kefr Haris, 10 miles
south-west of Shechem.

<span id="009">**Timnite**</span> A man of Timnah. Samson's
father-in-law is so styled ([Jdg 15:6](../kjv/jdg015.htm#006).md).
