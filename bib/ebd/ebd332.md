<span id="000">**Shaveh, Valley of**</span> Valley of the plain the
ancient name of the "king's dale" (q.v.), or Kidron, on the north side
of Jerusalem ([Gen 14:17](../kjv/gen014.htm#017)).

<span id="001">**Shaveh-Kiriathaim**</span> Plain of Kirja-thaim where
Chedorlaomer defeated the Emims, the original inhabitants ([Gen
14:5](../kjv/gen014.htm#005)). Now Kureiyat, north of Dibon, in the land
of Moab.

<span id="002">**Shavsha**</span> ("Seraiah," [Sa2
8:17](../kjv/sa2008.htm#017); "Shisha," [Kg1
4:3](../kjv/kg1004.htm#003)), one of David's secretaries ([Ch1
18:16](../kjv/ch1018.htm#016)).

<span id="003">**Shealtiel**</span> Asked for of God, father of
Zerubbabel ([Ezr 3:2](../kjv/ezr003.htm#002), [Ezr
3:8](../kjv/ezr003.htm#008); [Neh 12:1](../kjv/neh012.htm#001)).

<span id="004">**Shearing-house**</span> ([Kg2
10:12](../kjv/kg2010.htm#012), [Kg2 10:14](../kjv/kg2010.htm#014);
marg., "house of shepherds binding sheep." R.V., "the shearing-house of
the shepherds;" marg., "house of gathering"), some place between Samaria
and Jezreel, where Jehu slew "two and forty men" of the royal family of
Judah. The Heb. word Beth-eked so rendered is supposed by some to be a
proper name.

<span id="005">**Shear-Jashub**</span> A remnant shall escape or return
(i.e., to God), a symbolical name which the prophet Isaiah gave to his
son ([Isa 7:3](../kjv/isa007.htm#003)), perhaps his eldest son.

<span id="006">**Sheba**</span> An oath, seven. (1.) Heb. shebha , the
son of Raamah ([Gen 10:7](../kjv/gen010.htm#007)), whose descendants
settled with those of Dedan on the Persian Gulf. (2.) Heb. id . A son of
Joktan ([Gen 10:28](../kjv/gen010.htm#028)), probably the founder of the
Sabeans. (3.) Heb. id . A son of Jokshan, who was a son of Abraham by
Keturah ([Gen 25:3](../kjv/gen025.htm#003)). (4.) Heb. id . A kingdom in
Arabia Felix. Sheba, in fact, was Saba in Southern Arabia, the Sabaeans
of classical geography, who carried on the trade in spices with the
other peoples of the ancient world. They were Semites, speaking one of
the two main dialects of Himyaritic or South Arabic. Sheba had become a
monarchy before the days of Solomon. Its queen brought him gold, spices,
and precious stones ([Kg1 10:1](../kjv/kg1010.htm#001)). She is called
by our Lord the "queen of the south" ([Mat
12:42](../kjv/mat012.htm#042)). (5.) Heb. shebha' , "seven" or "an oak."
A town of Simeon ([Jos 19:2](../kjv/jos019.htm#002)). (6.) Heb. id . A
"son of Bichri," of the family of Becher, the son of Benjamin, and thus
of the stem from which Saul was descended (2 Sam. 20:1-22). When David
was returning to Jerusalem after the defeat of Absalom, a strife arose
between the ten tribes and the tribe of Judah, because the latter took
the lead in bringing back the king. Sheba took advantage of this state
of things, and raised the standard of revolt, proclaiming, "We have no
part in David." With his followers he proceeded northward. David seeing
it necessary to check this revolt, ordered Abishai to take the gibborim,
"mighty men," and the body-guard and such troops as he could gather, and
pursue Sheba. Joab joined the expedition, and having treacherously put
Amasa to death, assumed the command of the army. Sheba took refuge in
Abel-Bethmaachah, a fortified town some miles north of Lake Merom. While
Joab was engaged in laying siege to this city, Sheba's head was, at the
instigation of a "wise woman" who had held a parley with him from the
city walls, thrown over the wall to the besiegers, and thus the revolt
came to an end.

<span id="007">**Shebaniah**</span> Whom Jehovah hides, or has made grow
up. (1.) A Levite appointed to blow the trumpet before the ark of God
([Ch1 15:24](../kjv/ch1015.htm#024)). (2.) Another Levite ([Neh
9:4](../kjv/neh009.htm#004), [Neh 9:5](../kjv/neh009.htm#005)). (3.) A
priest ([Neh 10:12](../kjv/neh010.htm#012)). (4.) A Levite ([Neh
10:4](../kjv/neh010.htm#004)).

<span id="008">**Shebarim**</span> Breaks; ruins, a place near Ai ([Jos
7:5](../kjv/jos007.htm#005); R.V. marg., "the quarries").

<span id="009">**Shebna**</span> Tender youth, "treasurer" over the
house in the reign of Hezekiah, i.e., comptroller or governor of the
palace. On account of his pride he was ejected from his office, and
Eliakim was promoted to it ([Isa 22:15](../kjv/isa022.htm#015)). He
appears to have been the leader of the party who favoured an alliance
with Egypt against Assyria. It is conjectured that "Shebna the scribe,"
who was one of those whom the king sent to confer with the Assyrian
ambassador ([Kg2 18:18](../kjv/kg2018.htm#018), [Kg2
18:26](../kjv/kg2018.htm#026), [Kg2 18:37](../kjv/kg2018.htm#037); [Kg2
19:2](../kjv/kg2019.htm#002); [Isa 36:3](../kjv/isa036.htm#003), [Isa
36:11](../kjv/isa036.htm#011), [Isa 36:22](../kjv/isa036.htm#022); [Isa
37:2](../kjv/isa037.htm#002)), was a different person.
