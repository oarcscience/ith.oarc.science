<span id="000">**Ammishaddai**</span> People of the Almighty the father
of Ahiezer, who was chief of the Danites at the time of the Exodus ([Num
1:12](../kjv/num001.htm#012); [Num 2:25](../kjv/num002.htm#025).md). This
is one of the few names compounded with the name of God, Shaddai,
"Almighty."

<span id="001">**Ammizabad**</span> People of the giver, the son of
Benaiah, who was the third and chief captain of the host under David
([Ch1 27:6](../kjv/ch1027.htm#006).md).

<span id="002">**Ammon**</span> Another form of the name Ben-ammi, the
son of Lot ([Gen 19:38](../kjv/gen019.htm#038).md). This name is also used
for his posterity ([Psa 83:7](../kjv/psa083.htm#007).md).

<span id="003">**Ammonite**</span> The usual name of the descendants of
Ammon, the son of Lot ([Gen 19:38](../kjv/gen019.htm#038).md). From the
very beginning ([Deu 2:16](../kjv/deu002.htm#016).md) of their history till
they are lost sight of ([Jdg 5:2](../kjv/jdg005.htm#002).md), this tribe is
closely associated with the Moabites ([Jdg
10:11](../kjv/jdg010.htm#011); [Ch2 20:1](../kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md); [Zep
2:8](../kjv/zep002.htm#008).md). Both of these tribes hired Balaam to curse
Israel ([Deu 23:4](../kjv/deu023.htm#004).md). The Ammonites were probably
more of a predatory tribe, moving from place to place, while the
Moabites were more settled. They inhabited the country east of the
Jordan and north of Moab and the Dead Sea, from which they had expelled
the Zamzummims or Zuzims ([Deu 2:20](../kjv/deu002.htm#020.md); [Gen
14:5](../kjv/gen014.htm#005).md). They are known as the Beni-ammi ([Gen
19:38](../kjv/gen019.htm#038).md), Ammi or Ammon being worshipped as their
chief god. They were of Semitic origin, and closely related to the
Hebrews in blood and language. They showed no kindness to the Israelites
when passing through their territory, and therefore they were prohibited
from "entering the congregation of the Lord to the tenth generation"
([Deu 23:3](../kjv/deu023.htm#003).md). They afterwards became hostile to
Israel ([Jdg 3:13](../kjv/jdg003.htm#013).md). Jephthah waged war against
them, and "took twenty cities with a very great slaughter" ([Jdg
11:33](../kjv/jdg011.htm#033).md). They were again signally defeated by
Saul ([Sa1 11:11](../kjv/sa1011.htm#011).md). David also defeated them and
their allies the Syrians ([Sa2 10:6](../kjv/sa2010.htm#006).md), and took
their chief city, Rabbah, with much spoil ([Sa2
10:14](../kjv/sa2010.htm#014); [Sa2 12:26](../kjv/sa2012.htm#026).md). The
subsequent events of their history are noted in [Ch2
20:25](../kjv/ch2020.htm#025); [Ch2 26:8](../kjv/ch2026.htm#008.md); [Jer
49:1](../kjv/jer049.htm#001); [Eze 25:3](../kjv/eze025.htm#003.md), [Eze
25:6](../kjv/eze025.htm#006.md). One of Solomon's wives was Naamah, an
Ammonite. She was the mother of Rehoboam ([Kg1
14:31](../kjv/kg1014.htm#031); [Ch2 12:13](../kjv/ch2012.htm#013).md). The
prophets predicted fearful judgments against the Ammonites because of
their hostility to Israel ([Zep 2:8](../kjv/zep002.htm#008.md); [Jer
49:1](../kjv/jer049.htm#001); [Eze 25:1](../kjv/eze025.htm#001.md), [Eze
25:10](../kjv/eze025.htm#010); [Amo 1:13](../kjv/amo001.htm#013).md). The
national idol worshipped by this people was Molech or Milcom, at whose
altar they offered human sacrifices ([Kg1 11:5](../kjv/kg1011.htm#005.md),
[Kg1 11:7](../kjv/kg1011.htm#007).md). The high places built for this idol
by Solomon, at the instigation of his Ammonitish wives, were not
destroyed till the time of Josiah ([Kg2 23:13](../kjv/kg2023.htm#013).md).

<span id="004">**Amnon**</span> Faithful. (1.) One of the sons of
Shammai, of the children of Ezra ([Ch1 4:20](../kjv/ch1004.htm#020.md);
compare [Ch1 4:17](../kjv/ch1004.htm#017)). (2..md) The eldest son of
David, by Ahinoam of Jezreel ([Ch1 3:1](../kjv/ch1003.htm#001.md); [Sa2
3:2](../kjv/sa2003.htm#002).md). Absalom caused him to be put to death for
his great crime in the matter of Tamar ([Sa2
13:28](../kjv/sa2013.htm#028), [Sa2 13:29](../kjv/sa2013.htm#029).md).

<span id="005">**Amon**</span> Builder. (1.) The governor of Samaria in
the time of Ahab. The prophet Micaiah was committed to his custody ([Kg1
22:26](../kjv/kg1022.htm#026); [Ch2 18:25](../kjv/ch2018.htm#025)). (2..md)
The son of Manasseh, and fourteenth king of Judah. He restored idolatry,
and set up the images which his father had cast down. Zephaniah ([Zep
1:4](../kjv/zep001.htm#004); [Zep 3:4](../kjv/zep003.htm#004.md), [Zep
3:11](../kjv/zep003.htm#011).md) refers to the moral depravity prevailing
in this king's reign. He was assassinated ([Kg2
21:18](../kjv/kg2021.htm#018); [Ch2 33:20](../kjv/ch2033.htm#020).md) by
his own servants, who conspired against him. (3.) An Egyptian god,
usually depicted with a human body and the head of a ram, referred to in
[Jer 46:25](../kjv/jer046.htm#025.md), where the word "multitudes" in the
Authorized Version is more appropriately rendered "Amon" in the Revised
Version. In [Nah 3:8](../kjv/nah003.htm#008.md) the expression "populous
No" the Revised Version "No-amon." Amon is identified with Ra, the
sun-god of Heliopolis. (4.) [Neh 7:59](../kjv/neh007.htm#059.md).

<span id="006">**Amorites**</span> Highlanders, or hillmen, the name
given to the descendants of one of the sons of Canaan ([Gen
14:7](../kjv/gen014.htm#007).md), called Amurra or Amurri in the Assyrian
and Egyptian inscriptions. On the early Babylonian monuments all Syria,
including Palestine, is known as "the land of the Amorites." The
southern slopes of the mountains of Judea are called the "mount of the
Amorites" ([Deu 1:7](../kjv/deu001.htm#007.md), [Deu
1:19](../kjv/deu001.htm#019), [Deu 1:20](../kjv/deu001.htm#020).md). They
seem to have originally occupied the land stretching from the heights
west of the Dead Sea ([Gen 14:7](../kjv/gen014.htm#007).md) to Hebron (Gen.
13. Compare [Gen 13:8](../kjv/gen013.htm#008.md); [Deu
3:8](../kjv/deu003.htm#008); [Deu 4:46](../kjv/deu004.htm#046).md),
embracing "all Gilead and all Bashan" ([Deu
3:10](../kjv/deu003.htm#010).md), with the Jordan valley on the east of the
river ([Deu 4:49](../kjv/deu004.htm#049).md), the land of the "two kings of
the Amorites," Sihon and Og ([Deu 31:4](../kjv/deu031.htm#004.md); [Jos
2:10](../kjv/jos002.htm#010); [Jos 9:10](../kjv/jos009.htm#010).md). The
five kings of the Amorites were defeated with great slaughter by Joshua
([Jos 10:10](../kjv/jos010.htm#010).md). They were again defeated at the
waters of Merom by Joshua, who smote them till there were none remaining
([Jos 11:8](../kjv/jos011.htm#008).md). It is mentioned as a surprising
circumstance that in the days of Samuel there was peace between them and
the Israelites ([Sa1 7:14](../kjv/sa1007.htm#014).md). The discrepancy
supposed to exist between [Deu 1:44](../kjv/deu001.htm#044.md) and [Num
14:45](../kjv/num014.htm#045.md) is explained by the circumstance that the
terms "Amorites" and "Amalekites" are used synonymously for the
"Canaanites." In the same way we explain the fact that the "Hivites" of
[Gen 34:2](../kjv/gen034.htm#002.md) are the "Amorites" of [Gen
48:22](../kjv/gen048.htm#022.md). Compare [Jos
10:6](../kjv/jos010.htm#006); [Jos 11:19](../kjv/jos011.htm#019.md) with
[Sa2 21:2](../kjv/sa2021.htm#002.md); also [Num
14:45](../kjv/num014.htm#045) with [Deu 1:44](../kjv/deu001.htm#044.md).
The Amorites were warlike mountaineers. They are represented on the
Egyptian monuments with fair skins, light hair, blue eyes, aquiline
noses, and pointed beards. They are supposed to have been men of great
stature; their king, Og, is described by Moses as the last "of the
remnant of the giants" ([Deu 3:11](../kjv/deu003.htm#011).md). Both Sihon
and Og were independent kings. Only one word of the Amorite language
survives, "Shenir," the name they gave to Mount Hermon ([Deu
3:9](../kjv/deu003.htm#009).md).

<span id="007">**Amos**</span> Borne; a burden, one of the twelve minor
prophets. He was a native of Tekota, the modern Tekua, a town about 12
miles south-east of Bethlehem. He was a man of humble birth, neither a
"prophet nor a prophet's son," but "an herdman and a dresser of sycomore
trees," R.V. He prophesied in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, and was
contemporary with Isaiah and Hosea ([Amo 1:1](../kjv/amo001.htm#001.md);
[Amo 7:14](../kjv/amo007.htm#014), [Amo 7:15](../kjv/amo007.htm#015.md);
[Zac 14:5](../kjv/zac014.htm#005).md), who survived him a few years. Under
Jeroboam II. the kingdom of Israel rose to the zenith of its prosperity;
but that was followed by the prevalence of luxury and vice and idolatry.
At this period Amos was called from his obscurity to remind the people
of the law of God's retributive justice, and to call them to repentance.
The Book of Amos consists of three parts: (1.) The nations around are
summoned to judgment because of their sins (Amos 1:1-2:3). He quotes
[Joe 3:16](../kjv/joe003.htm#016). (2..md)The spiritual condition of Judah,
and especially of Israel, is described (Amos 2:4-6:14). (3.) In Amos
7:1-9:10 are recorded five prophetic visions. (a.) The first two ([Amo
7:1](../kjv/amo007.htm#001).md) refer to judgments against the guilty
people. (b.) The next two ([Amo 7:7](../kjv/amo007.htm#007.md); [Amo
8:1](../kjv/amo008.htm#001).md) point out the ripeness of the people for
the threatened judgments. [Amo 7:10](../kjv/amo007.htm#010.md) consists of
a conversation between the prophet and the priest of Bethel. (c.) The
fifth describes the overthrow and ruin of Israel ([Amo
9:1](../kjv/amo009.htm#001).md); to which is added the promise of the
restoration of the kingdom and its final glory in the Messiah's kingdom.
The style is peculiar in the number of the allusions made to natural
objects and to agricultural occupations. Other allusions show also that
Amos was a student of the law as well as a "child of nature." These
phrases are peculiar to him: "Cleanness of teeth" \[i.e., want of
bread\] ([Amo 4:6](../kjv/amo004.htm#006).md); "The excellency of Jacob"
([Amo 6:8](../kjv/amo006.htm#008); [Amo 8:7](../kjv/amo008.htm#007).md);
"The high places of Isaac" ([Amo 7:9](../kjv/amo007.htm#009).md); "The
house of Isaac" ([Amo 7:16](../kjv/amo007.htm#016).md); "He that createth
the wind" ([Amo 4:13](../kjv/amo004.htm#013).md). Quoted, [Act
7:42](../kjv/act007.htm#042.md).

<span id="008">**Amoz**</span> Strong, the father of the prophet Isaiah
([Kg2 19:2](../kjv/kg2019.htm#002), [Kg2 19:20](../kjv/kg2019.htm#020.md);
[Kg2 20:1](../kjv/kg2020.htm#001); [Isa 1:1](../kjv/isa001.htm#001.md);
[Isa 2:1](../kjv/isa002.htm#001).md). As to his personal history little is
positively known. He is supposed by some to have been the "man of God"
spoken of in [Ch2 25:7](../kjv/ch2025.htm#007.md), [Ch2
25:8](../kjv/ch2025.htm#008.md).

<span id="009">**Amphipolis**</span> City on both sides, a Macedonian
city, a great Roman military station, through which Paul and Silas
passed on their way from Philippi to Thessalonica, a distance of 33
Roman miles from Philippi ([Act 17:1](../kjv/act017.htm#001).md).
