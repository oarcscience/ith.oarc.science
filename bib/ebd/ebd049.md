<span id="000">**Beard**</span> The mode of wearing it was definitely
prescribed to the Jews ([Lev 19:27](../kjv/lev019.htm#027.md); [Lev
21:5](../kjv/lev021.htm#005).md). Hence the import of Ezekiel's ([Eze
5:1](../kjv/eze005.htm#001).md) description of the "razor" i.e., the agents
of an angry providence being used against the guilty nation of the Jews.
It was a part of a Jew's daily toilet to anoint his beard with oil and
perfume ([Psa 133:2](../kjv/psa133.htm#002).md). Beards were trimmed with
the most fastidious care ([Sa2 19:24](../kjv/sa2019.htm#024).md), and their
neglect was an indication of deep sorrow ([Isa
15:2](../kjv/isa015.htm#002); [Jer 41:5](../kjv/jer041.htm#005).md). The
custom was to shave or pluck off the hair as a sign of mourning ([Isa
50:6](../kjv/isa050.htm#006); [Jer 48:37](../kjv/jer048.htm#037.md); [Ezr
9:3](../kjv/ezr009.htm#003).md). The beards of David's ambassadors were cut
off by Hanun ([Sa2 10:4](../kjv/sa2010.htm#004).md) as a mark of indignity.
On the other hand, the Egyptians carefully shaved the hair off their
faces, and they compelled their slaves to do so also ([Gen
41:14](../kjv/gen041.htm#014).md).

<span id="001">**Beast**</span> This word is used of flocks or herds of
grazing animals ([Exo 22:5](../kjv/exo022.htm#005.md); [Num
20:4](../kjv/num020.htm#004), [Num 20:8](../kjv/num020.htm#008.md), [Num
20:11](../kjv/num020.htm#011); [Psa 78:48](../kjv/psa078.htm#048).md); of
beasts of burden ([Gen 45:17](../kjv/gen045.htm#017).md); of eatable beasts
([Pro 9:2](../kjv/pro009.htm#002).md); and of swift beasts or dromedaries
([Isa 60:6](../kjv/isa060.htm#006).md). In the New Testament it is used of
a domestic animal as property ([Rev 18:13](../kjv/rev018.htm#013).md); as
used for food ([Co1 15:39](../kjv/co1015.htm#039).md), for service ([Luk
10:34](../kjv/luk010.htm#034); [Act 23:24](../kjv/act023.htm#024).md), and
for sacrifice ([Act 7:42](../kjv/act007.htm#042).md). When used in
contradistinction to man ([Psa 36:6](../kjv/psa036.htm#006).md), it denotes
a brute creature generally, and when in contradistinction to creeping
things ([Lev 11:2](../kjv/lev011.htm#002.md); [Lev
27:26](../kjv/lev027.htm#026).md), a four-footed animal. The Mosaic law
required that beasts of labour should have rest on the Sabbath ([Exo
20:10](../kjv/exo020.htm#010); [Exo 23:12](../kjv/exo023.htm#012).md), and
in the Sabbatical year all cattle were allowed to roam about freely, and
eat whatever grew in the fields ([Exo 23:11](../kjv/exo023.htm#011.md);
[Lev 25:7](../kjv/lev025.htm#007).md). No animal could be castrated ([Lev
22:24](../kjv/lev022.htm#024).md). Animal of different kinds were to be
always kept separate ([Lev 19:19](../kjv/lev019.htm#019.md); [Deu
22:10](../kjv/deu022.htm#010).md). Oxen when used in threshing were not to
be prevented from eating what was within their reach ([Deu
25:4](../kjv/deu025.htm#004); [Co1 9:9](../kjv/co1009.htm#009).md). This
word is used figuratively of an infuriated multitude ([Co1
15:32](../kjv/co1015.htm#032); [Act 19:29](../kjv/act019.htm#029.md);
compare [Psa 22:12](../kjv/psa022.htm#012.md), [Psa
22:16](../kjv/psa022.htm#016); [Ecc 3:18](../kjv/ecc003.htm#018.md); [Isa
11:6](../kjv/isa011.htm#006).md), and of wicked men ([Pe2
2:12](../kjv/pe2002.htm#012).md). The four beasts of [Dan
7:3](../kjv/dan007.htm#003), [Dan 7:17](../kjv/dan007.htm#017.md), [Dan
7:23](../kjv/dan007.htm#023.md) represent four kingdom or kings.

<span id="002">**Beaten Gold**</span> In [Num
8:4](../kjv/num008.htm#004.md), means "turned" or rounded work in gold. The
Greek Version, however, renders the word "sold gold;" the Revised
Version, "beaten work of gold." In [Kg1 10:16](../kjv/kg1010.htm#016.md),
[Kg1 10:17](../kjv/kg1010.htm#017.md), it probably means "mixed" gold, as
the word ought to be rendered, i.e., not pure gold. Others render the
word in these places "thin plates of gold."

<span id="003">**Beaten Oil**</span> ([Exo
27:20](../kjv/exo027.htm#020); [Exo 29:40](../kjv/exo029.htm#040).md),
obtained by pounding olives in a mortar, not by crushing them in a mill.
It was reckoned the best. (See OLIVE)

<span id="004">**Beautiful Gate**</span> The name of one of the gates of
the temple ([Act 3:2](../kjv/act003.htm#002).md). It is supposed to have
been the door which led from the court of the Gentiles to the court of
the women. It was of massive structure, and covered with plates of
Corinthian brass.

<span id="005">**Becher**</span> First-born; a youth, the second son of
Benjamin ([Gen 46:21](../kjv/gen046.htm#021).md), who came down to Egypt
with Jacob. It is probable that he married an Ephraimitish heiress, and
that his descendants were consequently reckoned among the tribe of
Ephraim ([Num 26:35](../kjv/num026.htm#035.md); [Ch1
7:20](../kjv/ch1007.htm#020), [Ch1 7:21](../kjv/ch1007.htm#021).md). They
are not reckoned among the descendants of Benjamin ([Num
26:38](../kjv/num026.htm#038).md).

<span id="006">**Bed**</span> (Heb. mittah ), for rest at night ([Exo
8:3](../kjv/exo008.htm#003); [Sa1 19:13](../kjv/sa1019.htm#013.md), [Sa1
19:15](../kjv/sa1019.htm#015), [Sa1 19:16](../kjv/sa1019.htm#016.md),
etc.); during sickness ([Gen 47:31](../kjv/gen047.htm#031.md); [Gen
48:2](../kjv/gen048.htm#002); [Gen 49:33](../kjv/gen049.htm#033), etc..md);
as a sofa for rest ([Sa1 28:23](../kjv/sa1028.htm#023.md); [Amo
3:12](../kjv/amo003.htm#012)). Another Hebrew word ( er'es .md) so rendered
denotes a canopied bed, or a bed with curtains ([Deu
3:11](../kjv/deu003.htm#011); [Psa 132:3](../kjv/psa132.htm#003).md), for
sickness ([Psa 6:6](../kjv/psa006.htm#006.md); [Psa
41:3](../kjv/psa041.htm#003).md). In the New Testament it denotes sometimes
a litter with a coverlet ([Mat 9:2](../kjv/mat009.htm#002.md), [Mat
9:6](../kjv/mat009.htm#006); [Luk 5:18](../kjv/luk005.htm#018.md); [Act
5:15](../kjv/act005.htm#015).md). The Jewish bedstead was frequently merely
the divan or platform along the sides of the house, sometimes a very
slight portable frame, sometimes only a mat or one or more quilts. The
only material for bed-clothes is mentioned in [Sa1
19:13](../kjv/sa1019.htm#013.md). Sleeping in the open air was not
uncommon, the sleeper wrapping himself in his outer garment ([Exo
22:26](../kjv/exo022.htm#026), [Exo 22:27](../kjv/exo022.htm#027.md); [Deu
24:12](../kjv/deu024.htm#012), [Deu 24:13](../kjv/deu024.htm#013).md).

<span id="007">**Bedan**</span> One of the judges of Israel ([Sa1
12:11](../kjv/sa1012.htm#011).md). It is uncertain who he was. Some suppose
that Barak is meant, others Samson, but most probably this is contracted
form of Abdon ([Jdg 12:13](../kjv/jdg012.htm#013).md).

<span id="008">**Bed-chamber**</span> An apartment in Eastern houses,
furnished with a slightly elevated platform at the upper end and
sometimes along the sides, on which were laid mattresses. This was the
general arrangement of the public sleeping-room for the males of the
family and for guests, but there were usually besides distinct
bed-chambers of a more private character ([Kg2
4:10](../kjv/kg2004.htm#010); [Exo 8:3](../kjv/exo008.htm#003.md); [Kg2
6:12](../kjv/kg2006.htm#012)). In [Kg2 11:2](../kjv/kg2011.htm#002.md) this
word denotes, as in the margin of the Revised Version, a store-room in
which mattresses were kept.

<span id="009">**Bedstead**</span> Used in [Deu
3:11](../kjv/deu003.htm#011.md), but elsewhere rendered "couch," "bed." In
[Kg2 1:4](../kjv/kg2001.htm#004); [Kg2 16:2](../kjv/kg2016.htm#002.md);
[Psa 132:3](../kjv/psa132.htm#003); [Amo 3:12](../kjv/amo003.htm#012.md),
the divan is meant by this word.
