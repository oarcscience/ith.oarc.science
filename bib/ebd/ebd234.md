<span id="000">**Lydia**</span> (1.) [Eze 30:5](../kjv/eze030.htm#005)
(Heb. Lud ), a province in the west of Asia Minor, which derived its
name from the fourth son of Shem ([Gen 10:22](../kjv/gen010.htm#022)).
It was bounded on the east by the greater Phrygia, and on the west by
Ionia and the Aegean Sea. (2.) A woman of Thyatira, a "seller of
purple," who dwelt in Philippi ([Act 16:14](../kjv/act016.htm#014), [Act
16:15](../kjv/act016.htm#015)). She was not a Jewess but a proselyte.
The Lord opened her heart as she heard the gospel from the lips of Paul
([Act 16:13](../kjv/act016.htm#013)). She thus became the first in
Europe who embraced Christianity. She was a person apparently of
considerable wealth, for she could afford to give a home to Paul and his
companions. (See THYATIRA.)

<span id="001">**Lysanias**</span> Tetrarch of Abilene ([Luk
3:1](../kjv/luk003.htm#001)), on the eastern slope of Anti-Lebanon, near
the city of Damascus.

<span id="002">**Lysias, Claudius**</span> The chief captain (chiliarch)
who commanded the Roman troops in Jerusalem, and sent Paul under guard
to the procurator Felix at Caesarea ([Act 21:31](../kjv/act021.htm#031);
[Act 22:24](../kjv/act022.htm#024)). His letter to his superior officer
is an interesting specimen of Roman military correspondence ([Act
23:26](../kjv/act023.htm#026)). He obtained his Roman citizenship by
purchase, and was therefore probably a Greek. (See CLAUDIUS.)

<span id="003">**Lystra**</span> A town of Lycaonia, in Asia Minor, in a
wild district and among a rude population. Here Paul preached the gospel
after he had been driven by persecution from Iconium ([Act
14:2](../kjv/act014.htm#002)). Here also he healed a lame man ([Act
14:8](../kjv/act014.htm#008)), and thus so impressed the ignorant and
superstitious people that they took him for Mercury, because he was the
"chief speaker," and his companion Barnabas for Jupiter, probably in
consequence of his stately, venerable appearance; and were proceeding to
offer sacrifices to them ([Act 14:13](../kjv/act014.htm#013)), when Paul
earnestly addressed them and turned their attention to the true source
of all blessings. But soon after, through the influence of the Jews from
Antioch in Pisidia and Iconium, they stoned Paul and left him for dead
([Act 14:19](../kjv/act014.htm#019)). On recovering, Paul left for
Derbe; but soon returned again, through Lystra, encouraging the
disciples there to steadfastness. He in all likelihood visited this city
again on his third missionary tour ([Act 18:23](../kjv/act018.htm#023)).
Timothy, who was probably born here ([Ti2 3:10](../kjv/ti2003.htm#010),
[Ti2 3:11](../kjv/ti2003.htm#011)), was no doubt one of those who were
on this occasion witnesses of Paul's persecution and his courage in
Lystra.

<span id="004">**Maachah**</span> Oppression, a small Syrian kingdom
near Geshur, east of the Hauran, the district of Batanea ([Jos
13:13](../kjv/jos013.htm#013); [Sa2 10:6](../kjv/sa2010.htm#006), [Sa2
10:8](../kjv/sa2010.htm#008); [Ch1 19:7](../kjv/ch1019.htm#007)). (2.) A
daughter of Talmai, king of the old native population of Geshur. She
became one of David's wives, and was the mother of Absalom ([Sa2
3:3](../kjv/sa2003.htm#003)). (3.) The father of Hanan, who was one of
David's body-guard ([Ch1 11:43](../kjv/ch1011.htm#043)). (4.) The
daughter of Abishalom (called Absalom, [Ch2
11:20](../kjv/ch2011.htm#020)), the third wife of Rehoboam, and mother
of Abijam ([Kg1 15:2](../kjv/kg1015.htm#002)). She is called "Michaiah
the daughter of Uriel," who was the husband of Absalom's daughter Tamar
([Ch2 13:2](../kjv/ch2013.htm#002)). Her son Abijah or Abijam was heir
to the throne. (5.) The father of Achish, the king of Gath ([Kg1
2:39](../kjv/kg1002.htm#039)), called also Maoch ([Sa1
27:2](../kjv/sa1027.htm#002)).

<span id="005">**Maaleh-acrabbim**</span> Ascent of the scorpions; i.e.,
"scorpion-hill", a pass on the south-eastern border of Palestine ([Num
34:4](../kjv/num034.htm#004); [Jos 15:3](../kjv/jos015.htm#003)). It is
identified with the pass of Sufah, entering Palestine from the great
Wady el-Fikreh, south of the Dead Sea. (See AKRABBIM.)

<span id="006">**Maarath**</span> Desolation, a place in the mountains
of Judah ([Jos 15:59](../kjv/jos015.htm#059)), probably the modern
village Beit Ummar, 6 miles north of Hebron.

<span id="007">**Maaseiah**</span> (1.) The work of Jehovah. (a.) One of
the Levites whom David appointed as porter for the ark ([Ch1
15:18](../kjv/ch1015.htm#018), [Ch1 15:20](../kjv/ch1015.htm#020)). (b.)
One of the "captains of hundreds" associated with Jehoiada in restoring
king Jehoash to the throne ([Ch2 23:1](../kjv/ch2023.htm#001)). (c.) The
"king's son," probably one of the sons of king Ahaz, killed by Zichri in
the invasion of Judah by Pekah, king of Israel ([Ch2
28:7](../kjv/ch2028.htm#007)). (d.) One who was sent by king Josiah to
repair the temple ([Ch2 34:8](../kjv/ch2034.htm#008)). He was governor
(Heb. sar , rendered elsewhere in the Authorized Version "prince,"
"chief captain," chief ruler") of Jerusalem. (e.) The father of the
priest Zephaniah ([Jer 21:1](../kjv/jer021.htm#001); [Jer
37:3](../kjv/jer037.htm#003)). (f.) The father of the false prophet
Zedekiah ([Jer 29:21](../kjv/jer029.htm#021)). (2.) Refuge is Jehovah, a
priest, the father of Neriah ([Jer 32:12](../kjv/jer032.htm#012); [Jer
51:59](../kjv/jer051.htm#059)).

<span id="008">**Maasiai**</span> Work of Jehovah, one of the priests
resident at Jerusalem at the Captivity ([Ch1
9:12](../kjv/ch1009.htm#012)).

<span id="009">**Maath**</span> Small, a person named in our Lord's
ancestry ([Luk 3:26](../kjv/luk003.htm#026)).
