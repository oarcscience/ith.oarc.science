<span id="000">**Nail**</span> (1.) For fastening. (a.) Hebrew yathed,
"piercing," a peg or nail of any material ([Eze
15:3](../kjv/eze015.htm#003)), more especially a tent-peg ([Exo
27:19](../kjv/exo027.htm#019); [Exo 35:18](../kjv/exo035.htm#018); [Exo
38:20](../kjv/exo038.htm#020)), with one of which Jael (q.v.) pierced
the temples of Sisera ([Jdg 4:21](../kjv/jdg004.htm#021), [Jdg
4:22](../kjv/jdg004.htm#022)). This word is also used metaphorically
([Zac 10:4](../kjv/zac010.htm#004)) for a prince or counsellor, just as
"the battlebow" represents a warrior. (b.) Masmer, a "point," the usual
word for a nail. The words of the wise are compared to "nails fastened
by the masters of assemblies" ([Ecc 12:11](../kjv/ecc012.htm#011),
A.V.). The Revised Version reads, "as nails well fastened are the words
of the masters," etc. Others (as Plumptre) read, "as nails fastened are
the masters of assemblies" (Compare [Isa 22:23](../kjv/isa022.htm#023);
[Ezr 9:8](../kjv/ezr009.htm#008)). David prepared nails for the temple
([Ch1 22:3](../kjv/ch1022.htm#003); [Ch2 3:9](../kjv/ch2003.htm#009)).
The nails by which our Lord was fixed to the cross are mentioned ([Joh
20:25](../kjv/joh020.htm#025); [Col 2:14](../kjv/col002.htm#014)). (2.)
Of the finger (Heb. tsipporen , "scraping"). To "pare the nails" is in
[Deu 21:12](../kjv/deu021.htm#012) (marg., "make," or "dress," or
"suffer to grow") one of the signs of purification, separation from
former heathenism (Compare [Lev 14:8](../kjv/lev014.htm#008); [Num
8:7](../kjv/num008.htm#007)). In [Jer 17:1](../kjv/jer017.htm#001) this
word is rendered "point."

<span id="001">**Nain**</span> From Heb. nain , "green pastures,"
"lovely"), the name of a town near the gate of which Jesus raised to
life a widow's son ([Luk 7:11](../kjv/luk007.htm#011)). It is identified
with the village called Nein, standing on the north-western slope of
Jebel ed-Duhy (= the "hill Moreh" = "Little hermon"), about 4 miles from
Tabor and 25 southwest of Capernaum. At the foot of the slope on which
it stands is the great plain of Esdraelon. This was the first miracle of
raising the dead our Lord had wrought, and it excited great awe and
astonishment among the people.

<span id="002">**Naioth**</span> Dwellings, the name given to the
prophetical college established by Samuel near Ramah. It consisted of a
cluster of separate dwellings, and hence its name. David took refuge
here when he fled from Saul ([Sa1 19:18](../kjv/sa1019.htm#018), [Sa1
19:19](../kjv/sa1019.htm#019), [Sa1 19:22](../kjv/sa1019.htm#022), [Sa1
19:23](../kjv/sa1019.htm#023)), and here he passed a few weeks in peace
(Compare [Psa 11:1](../kjv/psa011.htm#001)). It was probably the common
residence of the "sons of the prophets."

<span id="003">**Naked**</span> This word denotes (1.) absolute
nakedness ([Gen 2:25](../kjv/gen002.htm#025); [Job
1:21](../kjv/job001.htm#021); [Ecc 5:15](../kjv/ecc005.htm#015); [Mic
1:8](../kjv/mic001.htm#008); [Amo 2:16](../kjv/amo002.htm#016)); (2.)
being poorly clad ([Isa 58:7](../kjv/isa058.htm#007); [Jam
2:15](../kjv/jam002.htm#015)). It denotes also (3.) the state of one who
has laid aside his loose outer garment (Lat. nudus ), and appears
clothed only in a long tunic or under robe worn next the skin ([Sa1
19:24](../kjv/sa1019.htm#024); [Isa 47:3](../kjv/isa047.htm#003);
compare [Mar 14:52](../kjv/mar014.htm#052); [Joh
21:7](../kjv/joh021.htm#007)). It is used figuratively, meaning "being
discovered" or "made manifest" ([Job 26:6](../kjv/job026.htm#006); [Heb
4:13](../kjv/heb004.htm#013)). In [Exo 32:25](../kjv/exo032.htm#025) the
expression "the people were naked" (A.V.) is more correctly rendered in
the Revised Version "the people were broken loose", i.e., had fallen
into a state of lawlessness and insubordination. In [Ch2
28:19](../kjv/ch2028.htm#019) the words "he made Judah naked" (A.V.),
but Revised Version "he had dealt wantonly in Judah," mean "he had
permitted Judah to break loose from all the restraints of religion."

<span id="004">**Naomi**</span> The lovable; my delight, the wife of
Elimelech, and mother of Mahlon and Chilion, and mother-in-law of Ruth
([Rut 1:2](../kjv/rut001.htm#002), [Rut 1:20](../kjv/rut001.htm#020),
[Rut 1:21](../kjv/rut001.htm#021); [Rut 2:1](../kjv/rut002.htm#001)).
Elimelech and his wife left the district of Bethlehem-Judah, and found a
new home in the uplands of Moab. In course of time he died, as also his
two sons Mahlon and Chilion, who had married women of Moab, and three
widows were left mourning the loss of their husbands. Naomi longs to
return now to her own land, to Bethlehem. One of her widowed
daughters-in-law, Ruth, accompanies her, and is at length married to
Boaz (q.v.).

<span id="005">**Naphish**</span> Refresher, one of the sons of Ishmael
([Gen 25:15](../kjv/gen025.htm#015); [Ch1 1:31](../kjv/ch1001.htm#031)).
He was the father of an Arab tribe.

<span id="006">**Naphtali**</span> My wrestling, the fifth son of Jacob.
His mother was Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid ([Gen
30:8](../kjv/gen030.htm#008)). When Jacob went down into Egypt, Naphtali
had four sons ([Gen 46:24](../kjv/gen046.htm#024)). Little is known of
him as an individual.

<span id="007">**Naphtali, Tribe of**</span> On this tribe Jacob
pronounced the patriarchal blessing, "Naphtali is a hind let loose: he
giveth goodly words" ([Gen 49:21](../kjv/gen049.htm#021)). It was
intended thus to set forth under poetic imagery the future character and
history of the tribe. At the time of the Exodus this tribe numbered
53,400 adult males ([Num 1:43](../kjv/num001.htm#043)), but at the close
of the wanderings they numbered only 45,400 ([Num
26:48](../kjv/num026.htm#048)). Along with Dan and Asher they formed
"the camp of Dan," under a common standard ([Num
2:25](../kjv/num002.htm#025)), occupying a place during the march on the
north side of the tabernacle. The possession assigned to this tribe is
set forth in [Jos 19:32](../kjv/jos019.htm#032). It lay in the
north-eastern corner of the land, bounded on the east by the Jordan and
the lakes of Merom and Galilee, and on the north it extended far into
Coele-Syria, the valley between the two Lebanon ranges. It comprehended
a greater variety of rich and beautiful scenery and of soil and climate
than fell to the lot of any other tribe. The territory of Naphtali
extended to about 800 square miles, being the double of that of
Issachar. The region around Kedesh, one of its towns, was originally
called Galil, a name afterwards given to the whole northern division of
Canaan. A large number of foreigners settled here among the mountains,
and hence it was called "Galilee of the Gentiles" (q.v.), [Mat
4:15](../kjv/mat004.htm#015), [Mat 4:16](../kjv/mat004.htm#016). The
southern portion of Naphtali has been called the "Garden of Palestine."
It was of unrivaled fertility. It was the principal scene of our Lord's
public ministry. Here most of his parables were spoken and his miracles
wrought. This tribe was the first to suffer from the invasion of
Benhadad, king of Syria, in the reigns of Baasha, king of Israel, and
Asa, king of Judah ([Kg1 15:20](../kjv/kg1015.htm#020); [Ch2
16:4](../kjv/ch2016.htm#004)). In the reign of Pekah, king of Israel,
the Assyrians under Tiglath-pileser swept over the whole north of
Israel, and carried the people into captivity ([Kg2
15:29](../kjv/kg2015.htm#029)). Thus the kingdom of Israel came to an
end (722 B.C.). Naphtali is now almost wholly a desert, the towns of
Tiberias, on the shore of the Lake of Galilee, and Safed being the only
places in it of any importance.

<span id="008">**Naphtali, Mount**</span> The mountainous district of
Naphtali ([Jos 20:7](../kjv/jos020.htm#007)).

<span id="009">**Naphtuhim**</span> A Hamitic tribe descended from
Mizraim ([Gen 10:13](../kjv/gen010.htm#013)). Others identify this word
with Napata, the name of the city and territory on the southern frontier
of Mizraim, the modern Meroe, at the great bend of the Nile at Soudan.
This city was the royal residence, it is said, of Queen Candace ([Act
8:27](../kjv/act008.htm#027)). Here there are extensive and splendid
ruins.
