------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Bosor**</span> The Chaldee or Aramaic form of the name
Beor, the father of Balaam ([Pe2 2:15](../kjv/pe2002.htm#015).md).

<span id="001">**Botch**</span> The name given in [Deu
28:27](../kjv/deu028.htm#027), [Deu 28:35](../kjv/deu028.htm#035.md) to one
of the Egyptian plagues ([Exo 9:9](../kjv/exo009.htm#009).md). The word so
translated is usually rendered "boil" (q.v.).

<span id="002">**Bottle**</span> A vessel made of skins for holding wine
([Jos 9:4](../kjv/jos009.htm#004), [Jos 9:13](../kjv/jos009.htm#013.md);
[Sa1 16:20](../kjv/sa1016.htm#020); [Mat 9:17](../kjv/mat009.htm#017.md);
[Mar 2:22](../kjv/mar002.htm#022); [Luk 5:37](../kjv/luk005.htm#037.md),
[Luk 5:38](../kjv/luk005.htm#038).md), or milk ([Jdg
4:19](../kjv/jdg004.htm#019).md), or water ([Gen
21:14](../kjv/gen021.htm#014), [Gen 21:15](../kjv/gen021.htm#015.md), [Gen
21:19](../kjv/gen021.htm#019).md), or strong drink ([Hab
2:15](../kjv/hab002.htm#015).md). Earthenware vessels were also similarly
used ([Jer 19:1](../kjv/jer019.htm#001.md); [Kg1
14:3](../kjv/kg1014.htm#003); [Isa 30:14](../kjv/isa030.htm#014).md). In
[Job 32:19](../kjv/job032.htm#019.md) (compare [Mat
9:17](../kjv/mat009.htm#017); [Luk 5:37](../kjv/luk005.htm#037.md), [Luk
5:38](../kjv/luk005.htm#038); [Mar 2:22](../kjv/mar002.htm#022).md) the
reference is to a wine-skin ready to burst through the fermentation of
the wine. "Bottles of wine" in the Authorized Version of [Hos
7:5](../kjv/hos007.htm#005.md) is properly rendered in the Revised Version
by "the heat of wine," i.e., the fever of wine, its intoxicating
strength. The clouds are figuratively called the "bottles of heaven"
([Job 38:37](../kjv/job038.htm#037).md). A bottle blackened or shriveled by
smoke is referred to in [Psa 119:83](../kjv/psa119.htm#083.md) as an image
to which the psalmist likens himself.

<span id="003">**Bow**</span> The bow was in use in early times both in
war and in the chase ([Gen 21:20](../kjv/gen021.htm#020.md); [Gen
27:3](../kjv/gen027.htm#003); [Gen 48:22](../kjv/gen048.htm#022).md). The
tribe of Benjamin were famous for the use of the bow ([Ch1
8:40](../kjv/ch1008.htm#040); [Ch1 12:2](../kjv/ch1012.htm#002.md); [Ch2
14:8](../kjv/ch2014.htm#008); [Ch2 17:17](../kjv/ch2017.htm#017).md); so
also were the Elamites ([Isa 22:6](../kjv/isa022.htm#006).md) and the
Lydians ([Jer 46:9](../kjv/jer046.htm#009).md). The Hebrew word commonly
used for bow means properly to tread ([Ch1 5:18](../kjv/ch1005.htm#018.md);
[Ch1 8:40](../kjv/ch1008.htm#040).md), and hence it is concluded that the
foot was employed in bending the bow. Bows of steel (correctly "copper")
are mentioned ([Sa2 22:35](../kjv/sa2022.htm#035.md); [Psa
18:34](../kjv/psa018.htm#034).md). The arrows were carried in a quiver
([Gen 27:3](../kjv/gen027.htm#003); [Isa 22:6](../kjv/isa022.htm#006.md);
[Isa 49:2](../kjv/isa049.htm#002); [Psa 127:5](../kjv/psa127.htm#005).md).
They were apparently sometimes shot with some burning material attached
to them ([Psa 120:4](../kjv/psa120.htm#004).md). The bow is a symbol of
victory ([Psa 7:12](../kjv/psa007.htm#012).md). It denotes also falsehood,
deceit ([Psa 64:3](../kjv/psa064.htm#003.md), [Psa
64:4](../kjv/psa064.htm#004); [Hos 7:16](../kjv/hos007.htm#016.md); [Jer
9:3](../kjv/jer009.htm#003).md). "The use of the bow" in [Sa2
1:18](../kjv/sa2001.htm#018) (A.V..md) ought to be "the song of the bow,"
as in the Revised Version.

<span id="004">**Bowels**</span> [Phi 1:8](../kjv/phi001.htm#008.md); [Phi
2:1](../kjv/phi002.htm#001); [Col 3:12](../kjv/col003.htm#012).md),
compassionate feelings; R.V., "tender mercies."

<span id="005">**Bowing**</span> A mode of showing respect. Abraham
"bowed himself to the people of the land" ([Gen
23:7](../kjv/gen023.htm#007).md); so Jacob to Esau ([Gen
33:3](../kjv/gen033.htm#003).md); and the brethren of Joseph before him as
the governor of the land ([Gen 43:28](../kjv/gen043.htm#028).md). Bowing is
also frequently mentioned as an act of adoration to idols ([Jos
23:7](../kjv/jos023.htm#007); [Kg2 5:18](../kjv/kg2005.htm#018.md); [Jdg
2:19](../kjv/jdg002.htm#019); [Isa 44:15](../kjv/isa044.htm#015).md), and
to God ([Jos 5:14](../kjv/jos005.htm#014.md); [Psa
22:29](../kjv/psa022.htm#029); [Psa 72:9](../kjv/psa072.htm#009.md); [Mic
6:6](../kjv/mic006.htm#006); [Psa 95:6](../kjv/psa095.htm#006.md); [Eph
3:14](../kjv/eph003.htm#014).md).

<span id="006">**Bowl**</span> The sockets of the lamps of the golden
candlestick of the tabernacle are called bowls ([Exo
25:31](../kjv/exo025.htm#031), [Exo 25:33](../kjv/exo025.htm#033.md), [Exo
25:34](../kjv/exo025.htm#034); [Exo 37:17](../kjv/exo037.htm#017.md), [Exo
37:19](../kjv/exo037.htm#019), [Exo 37:20](../kjv/exo037.htm#020).md); the
same word so rendered being elsewhere rendered "cup" ([Gen
44:2](../kjv/gen044.htm#002), [Gen 44:12](../kjv/gen044.htm#012.md), [Gen
44:16](../kjv/gen044.htm#016).md), and wine "pot" ([Jer
35:5](../kjv/jer035.htm#005).md). The reservoir for oil, from which pipes
led to each lamp in Zechariah's vision of the candlestick, is called
also by this name ([Zac 4:2](../kjv/zac004.htm#002.md), [Zac
4:3](../kjv/zac004.htm#003).md); so also are the vessels used for libations
([Exo 25:29](../kjv/exo025.htm#029.md); [Exo
37:16](../kjv/exo037.htm#016).md).

<span id="007">**Box**</span> For holding oil or perfumery ([Mar
14:3](../kjv/mar014.htm#003).md). It was of the form of a flask or bottle.
The Hebrew word (pak) used for it is more appropriately rendered "vial"
in [Sa1 10:1](../kjv/sa1010.htm#001.md), and should also be so rendered in
[Kg2 9:1](../kjv/kg2009.htm#001.md), where alone else it occurs.

<span id="008">**Box-tree**</span> (Heb. teashshur ), mentioned in [Isa
60:13](../kjv/isa060.htm#013); [Isa 41:19](../kjv/isa041.htm#019.md), was,
according to some, a species of cedar growing in Lebanon. The words of
[Eze 27:6](../kjv/eze027.htm#006.md) literally translated are, "Thy benches
they have made of ivory, the daughter of the ashur tree," i.e., inlaid
with ashur wood. The ashur is the box-tree, and accordingly the Revised
Version rightly reads "inlaid in box wood." This is the Buxus
sempervirens of botanists. It is remarkable for the beauty of its
evergreen foliage and for the utility of its hard and durable wood.

<span id="009">**Bozrah**</span> Enclosure; fortress. (1.) The city of
Jobab, one of the early Edomite kings ([Gen
36:33](../kjv/gen036.htm#033).md). This place is mentioned by the prophets
in later times ([Isa 34:6](../kjv/isa034.htm#006.md); [Jer
49:13](../kjv/jer049.htm#013); [Amo 1:12](../kjv/amo001.htm#012.md); [Mic
2:12](../kjv/mic002.htm#012).md). Its modern representative is
el-Busseireh. It lies in the mountain district of Petra, 20 miles to the
south-east of the Dead Sea. (2.) A Moabite city in the "plain country"
([Jer 48:24](../kjv/jer048.htm#024).md), i.e., on the high level down on
the east of the Dead Sea. It is probably the modern Buzrah.
