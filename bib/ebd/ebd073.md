<span id="000">**Carriage**</span> In the Authorized Version this word
is found as the rendering of many different words. In [Jdg
18:21](../kjv/jdg018.htm#021) it means valuables, wealth, or booty. In
[Isa 46:1](../kjv/isa046.htm#001) (R.V., "the things that ye carried
about") the word means a load for a beast of burden. In [Sa1
17:22](../kjv/sa1017.htm#022) and [Isa 10:28](../kjv/isa010.htm#028) it
is the rendering of a word ("stuff" in [Sa1
10:22](../kjv/sa1010.htm#022)) meaning implements, equipments, baggage.
The phrase in [Act 21:15](../kjv/act021.htm#015), "We took up our
carriages," means properly, "We packed up our baggage," as in the
Revised Version.

<span id="001">**Cart**</span> A vehicle moving on wheels, and usually
drawn by oxen ([Sa2 6:3](../kjv/sa2006.htm#003)). The Hebrew word thus
rendered, 'agalah ([Sa1 6:7](../kjv/sa1006.htm#007), [Sa1
6:8](../kjv/sa1006.htm#008)), is also rendered "wagon" ([Gen
45:19](../kjv/gen045.htm#019)). It is used also to denote a war-chariot
([Psa 46:9](../kjv/psa046.htm#009)). Carts were used for the removal of
the ark and its sacred utensils ([Num 7:3](../kjv/num007.htm#003), [Num
7:6](../kjv/num007.htm#006)). After retaining the ark amongst them for
seven months, the Philistines sent it back to the Israelites. On this
occasion they set it in a new cart, probably a rude construction, with
solid wooden wheels like that still used in Western Asia, which was
drawn by two milch cows, which conveyed it straight to Beth-shemesh. A
"cart rope," for the purpose of fastening loads on carts, is used ([Isa
5:18](../kjv/isa005.htm#018)) as a symbol of the power of sinful
pleasures or habits over him who indulges them. (See CORD.) In Syria and
Palestine wheel-carriages for any other purpose than the conveyance of
agricultural produce are almost unknown.

<span id="002">**Carve**</span> The arts of engraving and carving were
much practised among the Jews. They were practised in connection with
the construction of the tabernacle and the temple ([Exo
31:2](../kjv/exo031.htm#002), [Exo 31:5](../kjv/exo031.htm#005); [Exo
35:33](../kjv/exo035.htm#033); [Kg1 6:18](../kjv/kg1006.htm#018), [Kg1
6:35](../kjv/kg1006.htm#035); [Psa 74:6](../kjv/psa074.htm#006)), as
well as in the ornamentation of the priestly dresses (Ex. 28:9-36; [Zac
3:9](../kjv/zac003.htm#009); [Ch2 2:7](../kjv/ch2002.htm#007), [Ch2
2:14](../kjv/ch2002.htm#014)). Isaiah ([Isa
44:13](../kjv/isa044.htm#013)) gives a minute description of the process
of carying idols of wood.

<span id="003">**Casement**</span> A barrier of open-work placed before
windows ([Pro 7:6](../kjv/pro007.htm#006)). In [Jdg
5:28](../kjv/jdg005.htm#028) the Hebrew word is rendered "lattice," in
the LXX. "network," an opening through which cool air is admitted.

<span id="004">**Casiphia**</span> Silver, a place between Babylon and
Jerusalem, where Iddo resided ([Ezr 8:17](../kjv/ezr008.htm#017));
otherwise unknown.

<span id="005">**Casluhim**</span> Fortified, a people descended from
Mizraim ([Gen 10:14](../kjv/gen010.htm#014); [Ch1
1:12](../kjv/ch1001.htm#012)). Their original seat was probably
somewhere in Lower Egypt, along the sea-coast to the south border of
Palestine.

<span id="006">**Cassia**</span> (1.) Hebrew kiddah' , i.e., "split."
One of the principal spices of the holy anointing oil ([Exo
30:24](../kjv/exo030.htm#024)), and an article of commerce ([Eze
27:19](../kjv/eze027.htm#019)). It is the inner bark of a tree
resembling the cinnamon (q.v.), the Cinnamomum cassia of botanists, and
was probably imported from India. (2.) Hebrew pl. ketzi'oth ([Psa
45:8](../kjv/psa045.htm#008)). Mentioned in connection with myrrh and
aloes as being used to scent garments. It was probably prepared from the
peeled bark, as the Hebrew word suggests, of some kind of cinnamon.

<span id="007">**Castaway**</span> Gr. adokimos , ([Co1
9:27](../kjv/co1009.htm#027)), one regarded as unworthy (R.V.,
"rejected"); elsewhere rendered "reprobate" ([Ti2
3:8](../kjv/ti2003.htm#008), etc.); "rejected" ([Heb
6:8](../kjv/heb006.htm#008), etc.).

<span id="008">**Castle**</span> A military fortress ([Ch1
11:7](../kjv/ch1011.htm#007)), also probably a kind of tower used by the
priests for making known anything discovered at a distance ([Ch1
6:54](../kjv/ch1006.htm#054)). Castles are also mentioned ([Gen
25:16](../kjv/gen025.htm#016)) as a kind of watch-tower, from which
shepherds kept watch over their flocks by night. The "castle" into which
the chief captain commanded Paul to be brought was the quarters of the
Roman soldiers in the fortress of Antonia (so called by Herod after his
patron Mark Antony), which was close to the north-west corner of the
temple ([Act 21:34](../kjv/act021.htm#034)), which it commanded.

<span id="009">**Castor and Pollux**</span> The "Dioscuri", two heroes
of Greek and Roman mythology. Their figures were probably painted or
sculptured on the prow of the ship which Luke refers to ([Act
28:11](../kjv/act028.htm#011)). They were regarded as the tutelary
divinities of sailors. They appeared in the heavens as the constellation
Gemini.
