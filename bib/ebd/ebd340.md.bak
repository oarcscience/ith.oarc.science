<span id="000">**Shoa**</span> Opulent, the mountain district lying to
the north-east of Babylonia, anciently the land of the Guti, or Kuti,
the modern Kurdistan. The plain lying between these mountains and the
Tigris was called su-Edina, i.e., "the border of the plain." This name
was sometimes shortened into Suti and Su, and has been regarded as =
Shoa ([Eze 23:23](../kjv/eze023.htm#023).md). Some think it denotes a place
in Babylon. (See PEKOD.)

<span id="004">**Shobal**</span> Pilgrim. (1.) The second son of Seir
the Horite; one of the Horite "dukes" ([Gen
36:20](../kjv/gen036.htm#020)). (2..md) One of the sons of Caleb, and a
descendant of Hur ([Ch1 2:50](../kjv/ch1002.htm#050.md), [Ch1
2:52](../kjv/ch1002.htm#052); [Ch1 4:1](../kjv/ch1004.htm#001.md), [Ch1
4:2](../kjv/ch1004.htm#002).md).

<span id="005">**Shobi**</span> Captor, son of Nahash of Rabbah, the
Ammonite. He showed kindness to David when he fled from Jerusalem to
Mahanaim ([Sa2 17:27](../kjv/sa2017.htm#027).md).

<span id="009">**Shoe**</span> Of various forms, from the mere sandal
(q.v.) to the complete covering of the foot. The word so rendered (A.V.)
in [Deu 33:25](../kjv/deu033.htm#025.md), min'al , "a bar," is derived from
a root meaning "to bolt" or "shut fast," and hence a fastness or
fortress. The verse has accordingly been rendered "iron and brass shall
be thy fortress," or, as in the Revised Version, "thy bars \[marg.,
"shoes"\] shall be iron and brass."
