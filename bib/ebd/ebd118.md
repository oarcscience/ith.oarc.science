<span id="000">**Elishah**</span> The oldest of the four sons of Javan
([Gen 10:4](../kjv/gen010.htm#004).md), whose descendants peopled Greece.
It has been supposed that Elishah's descendants peopled the
Peloponnesus, which was known by the name of Elis. This may be meant by
"the isles of Elishah" ([Eze 27:7](../kjv/eze027.htm#007).md).

<span id="001">**Elishama**</span> Whom God hears. (1.) A prince of
Benjamin, grandfather of Joshua ([Num 1:10](../kjv/num001.htm#010.md); [Ch1
7:26](../kjv/ch1007.htm#026)). (2..md) One of David's sons ([Sa2
5:16](../kjv/sa2005.htm#016)). (3..md) Another of David's sons ([Ch1
3:6](../kjv/ch1003.htm#006)). (4..md) A priest sent by Jehoshaphat to teach
the people the law ([Ch2 17:8](../kjv/ch2017.htm#008).md).

<span id="002">**Elishaphat**</span> Whom God has judged, one of the
"captains of hundreds" associated with Jehoiada in the league to
overthrow the usurpation of Athaliah ([Ch2
23:1](../kjv/ch2023.htm#001).md).

<span id="003">**Elisheba**</span> God is her oath, the daughter of
Amminadab and the wife of Aaron ([Exo 6:23](../kjv/exo006.htm#023).md).

<span id="004">**Elishua**</span> God his salvation, a son of David,
[Sa2 5:15](../kjv/sa2005.htm#015.md) = Elishama, [Ch1
3:6](../kjv/ch1003.htm#006.md).

<span id="005">**Elkanah**</span> God-created. (1.) The second son of
Korah ([Exo 6:24](../kjv/exo006.htm#024).md), or, according to [Ch1
6:22](../kjv/ch1006.htm#022), [Ch1 6:23](../kjv/ch1006.htm#023.md), more
correctly his grandson. (2.) Another Levite of the line of Heman the
singer, although he does not seem to have performed any of the usual
Levitical offices. He was father of Samuel the prophet ([Ch1
6:27](../kjv/ch1006.htm#027), [Ch1 6:34](../kjv/ch1006.htm#034).md). He was
"an Ephrathite" ([Sa1 1:1](../kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md), [Sa1
1:4](../kjv/sa1001.htm#004), [Sa1 1:8](../kjv/sa1001.htm#008).md), but
lived at Ramah, a man of wealth and high position. He had two wives,
Hannah, who was the mother of Samuel, and Peninnah.

<span id="006">**Elkosh**</span> God my bow, the birth-place of Nahum
the prophet ([Nah 1:1](../kjv/nah001.htm#001).md). It was probably situated
in Galilee, but nothing definite is known of it.

<span id="007">**Ellasar**</span> The oak or heap of Assyria, a
territory in Asia of which Arioch was king ([Gen
14:1](../kjv/gen014.htm#001), [Gen 14:9](../kjv/gen014.htm#009).md). It is
supposed that the old Chaldean town of Larsa was the metropolis of this
kingdom, situated nearly half-way between Ur (now Mugheir) and Erech, on
the left bank of the Euphrates. This town is represented by the mounds
of Senkereh, a little to the east of Erech.

<span id="008">**Elm**</span> [Hos 4:13](../kjv/hos004.htm#013.md);
rendered "terebinth" in the Revised Version. It is the Pistacia
terebinthus of Linn., a tree common in Palestine, long-lived, and
therefore often employed for landmarks and in designating places ([Gen
35:4](../kjv/gen035.htm#004); [Jdg 6:11](../kjv/jdg006.htm#011.md), [Jdg
6:19](../kjv/jdg006.htm#019). Rendered "oak" in both A.V. and R.V..md).
(See TEIL TREE.)

<span id="009">**Elnathan**</span> Whom God has given. (1.) An
inhabitant of Jerusalem, the father of Nehushta, who was the mother of
king Jehoiachin ([Kg2 24:8](../kjv/kg2024.htm#008).md). Probably the same
who tried to prevent Jehoiakim from burning the roll of Jeremiah's
prophecies ([Jer 26:22](../kjv/jer026.htm#022.md); [Jer
36:12](../kjv/jer036.htm#012)). (2.) [Ezr 8:16](../kjv/ezr008.htm#016.md).
