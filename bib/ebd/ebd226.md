<span id="000">**Leaven**</span> (1.) Heb. seor ([Exo
12:15](../kjv/exo012.htm#015), [Exo 12:19](../kjv/exo012.htm#019.md); [Exo
13:7](../kjv/exo013.htm#007); [Lev 2:11](../kjv/lev002.htm#011).md), the
remnant of dough from the preceding baking which had fermented and
become acid. (2.) Heb. hamets , properly "ferment." In [Num
6:3](../kjv/num006.htm#003.md), "vinegar of wine" is more correctly
"fermented wine." In [Exo 13:7](../kjv/exo013.htm#007.md), the proper
rendering would be, "Unfermented things \[Heb. matstsoth \] shall be
consumed during the seven days; and there shall not be seen with thee
fermented things \[ hamets \], and there shall not be seen with thee
leavened mass \[ seor \] in all thy borders." The chemical definition of
ferment or yeast is "a substance in a state of putrefaction, the atoms
of which are in a continual motion." The use of leaven was strictly
forbidden in all offerings made to the Lord by fire ([Lev
2:11](../kjv/lev002.htm#011); [Lev 7:12](../kjv/lev007.htm#012.md); [Lev
8:2](../kjv/lev008.htm#002); [Num 6:15](../kjv/num006.htm#015).md). Its
secretly penetrating and diffusive power is referred to in [Co1
5:6](../kjv/co1005.htm#006.md). In this respect it is used to illustrate
the growth of the kingdom of heaven both in the individual heart and in
the world ([Mat 13:33](../kjv/mat013.htm#033).md). It is a figure also of
corruptness and of perverseness of heart and life ([Mat
16:6](../kjv/mat016.htm#006), [Mat 16:11](../kjv/mat016.htm#011.md); [Mar
8:15](../kjv/mar008.htm#015); [Co1 5:7](../kjv/co1005.htm#007.md), [Co1
5:8](../kjv/co1005.htm#008).md).

<span id="001">**Lebanon**</span> White, "the white mountain of Syria,"
is the loftiest and most celebrated mountain range in Syria. It is a
branch running southward from the Caucasus, and at its lower end forking
into two parallel ranges, the eastern or Anti-Lebanon, and the western
or Lebanon proper. They enclose a long valley ([Jos
11:17](../kjv/jos011.htm#017).md) of from 5 to 8 miles in width, called by
Roman writers Coele-Syria, now called el-Buka'a , "the valley," a
prolongation of the valley of the Jordan. Lebanon proper, Jebel
es-Sharki, commences at its southern extremity in the gorge of the
Leontes, the ancient Litany, and extends north-east, parallel to the
Mediterranean coast, as far as the river Eleutherus, at the plain of
Emesa, "the entering of Hamath" ([Num 34:8](../kjv/num034.htm#008.md); [Kg1
8:65](../kjv/kg1008.htm#065).md), in all about 90 geographical miles in
extent. The average height of this range is from 6,000 to 8,000 feet;
the peak of Jebel Mukhmel is about 10,200 feet, and the Sannin about
9,000. The highest peaks are covered with perpetual snow and ice. In the
recesses of the range wild beasts as of old still abound ([Kg2
14:9](../kjv/kg2014.htm#009); [Sol 4:8](../kjv/sol004.htm#008).md). The
scenes of the Lebanon are remarkable for their grandeur and beauty, and
supplied the sacred writers with many expressive similes ([Psa
29:5](../kjv/psa029.htm#005), [Psa 29:6](../kjv/psa029.htm#006.md); [Psa
72:16](../kjv/psa072.htm#016); [Psa 104:16](../kjv/psa104.htm#016.md); [Sol
4:15](../kjv/sol004.htm#015); [Isa 2:13](../kjv/isa002.htm#013.md); [Isa
35:2](../kjv/isa035.htm#002); [Isa 60:13](../kjv/isa060.htm#013.md); [Hos
14:5](../kjv/hos014.htm#005).md). It is famous for its cedars ([Sol
5:15](../kjv/sol005.htm#015).md), its wines ([Hos
14:7](../kjv/hos014.htm#007).md), and its cool waters ([Jer
18:14](../kjv/jer018.htm#014).md). The ancient inhabitants were Giblites
and Hivites ([Jos 13:5](../kjv/jos013.htm#005.md); [Jdg
3:3](../kjv/jdg003.htm#003).md). It was part of the Phoenician kingdom
([Kg1 5:2](../kjv/kg1005.htm#002).md). The eastern range, or Anti-Lebanon,
or "Lebanon towards the sunrising," runs nearly parallel with the
western from the plain of Emesa till it connects with the hills of
Galilee in the south. The height of this range is about 5,000 feet. Its
highest peak is Hermon (q.v.), from which a number of lesser ranges
radiate. Lebanon is first mentioned in the description of the boundary
of Palestine ([Deu 1:7](../kjv/deu001.htm#007.md); [Deu
11:24](../kjv/deu011.htm#024).md). It was assigned to Israel, but was never
conquered ([Jos 13:2](../kjv/jos013.htm#002.md); [Jdg
3:1](../kjv/jdg003.htm#001).md). The Lebanon range is now inhabited by a
population of about 300,000 Christians, Maronites, and Druses, and is
ruled by a Christian governor. The Anti-Lebanon is inhabited by
Mohammedans, and is under a Turkish ruler.

<span id="002">**Lebbaeus**</span> Courageous, a surname of Judas
(Jude), one of the twelve ([Mat 10:3](../kjv/mat010.htm#003).md), called
also Thaddaeus, not to be confounded with the Judas who was the brother
of our Lord.

<span id="003">**Lebonah**</span> Frankincense, a town near Shiloh, on
the north side of Bethel ([Jdg 21:19](../kjv/jdg021.htm#019).md). It has
been identified with el-Lubban, to the south of Nablus.

<span id="004">**Leek**</span> (Heb. hatsir ; the Allium porrum),
rendered "grass" in [Kg1 18:5](../kjv/kg1018.htm#005.md), [Kg2
19:26](../kjv/kg2019.htm#026), [Job 40:15](../kjv/job040.htm#015.md), etc.;
"herb" in [Job 8:12](../kjv/job008.htm#012.md); "hay" in [Pro
27:25](../kjv/pro027.htm#025), and [Isa 15:6](../kjv/isa015.htm#006.md);
"leeks" only in [Num 11:5](../kjv/num011.htm#005.md). This Hebrew word
seems to denote in this last passage simply herbs, such as lettuce or
savoury herbs cooked as kitchen vegetables, and not necessarily what are
now called leeks. The leek was a favourite vegetable in Egypt, and is
still largely cultivated there and in Palestine.

<span id="005">**Lees**</span> (Heb. shemarim ), from a word meaning to
keep or preserve. It was applied to "lees" from the custom of allowing
wine to stand on the lees that it might thereby be better preserved
([Isa 25:6](../kjv/isa025.htm#006).md). "Men settled on their lees" ([Zep
1:12](../kjv/zep001.htm#012).md) are men "hardened or crusted." The image
is derived from the crust formed at the bottom of wines long left
undisturbed ([Jer 48:11](../kjv/jer048.htm#011).md). The effect of wealthy
undisturbed ease on the ungodly is hardening. They become stupidly
secure (Compare [Psa 55:19](../kjv/psa055.htm#019.md); [Amo
6:1](../kjv/amo006.htm#001).md). To drink the lees ([Psa
75:8](../kjv/psa075.htm#008).md) denotes severe suffering.

<span id="006">**Left Hand**</span> Among the Hebrews, denoted the north
([Job 23:9](../kjv/job023.htm#009); [Gen 14:15](../kjv/gen014.htm#015).md),
the face of the person being supposed to be toward the east.

<span id="007">**Left-handed**</span> ([Jdg
3:15](../kjv/jdg003.htm#015); [Jdg 20:16](../kjv/jdg020.htm#016).md), one
unable to use the right hand skillfully, and who therefore uses the
left; and also one who uses the left as well as the right, ambidextrous.
Such a condition of the hands is due to physical causes. This quality
was common apparently in the tribe of Benjamin.

<span id="008">**Legion**</span> A regiment of the Roman army, the
number of men composing which differed at different times. It originally
consisted of three thousand men, but in the time of Christ consisted of
six thousand, exclusive of horsemen, who were in number a tenth of the
foot-men. The word is used ([Mat 26:53](../kjv/mat026.htm#053.md); [Mar
5:9](../kjv/mar005.htm#009).md) to express simply a great multitude.

<span id="009">**Lehi**</span> A jawbone, a place in the tribe of Judah
where Samson achieved a victory over the Philistines ([Jdg
15:9](../kjv/jdg015.htm#009), [Jdg 15:14](../kjv/jdg015.htm#014.md), [Jdg
15:16](../kjv/jdg015.htm#016).md), slaying a thousand of them with the
jawbone of an ass. The words in [Jdg 15:19](../kjv/jdg015.htm#019.md), "a
hollow place that was in the jaw" (A.V.), should be, as in Revised
Version, "the hollow place that is in Lehi."
