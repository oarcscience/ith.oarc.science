<span id="000">**Toll**</span> One of the branches of the king of
Persia's revenues ([Ezr 4:13](../kjv/ezr004.htm#013.md); [Ezr
7:24](../kjv/ezr007.htm#024).md), probably a tax levied from those who used
the bridges and fords and highways.

<span id="001">**Tombs**</span> Of the Hebrews were generally excavated
in the solid rock, or were natural caves. Mention is made of such tombs
in [Jdg 8:32](../kjv/jdg008.htm#032); [Sa2 2:32](../kjv/sa2002.htm#032.md);
[Kg2 9:28](../kjv/kg2009.htm#028); [Kg2 23:30](../kjv/kg2023.htm#030.md).
They were sometimes made in gardens ([Kg2 21:26](../kjv/kg2021.htm#026.md);
[Kg2 23:16](../kjv/kg2023.htm#016); [Mat 27:60](../kjv/mat027.htm#060).md).
They are found in great numbers in and around Jerusalem and all over the
land. They were sometimes whitewashed ([Mat
23:27](../kjv/mat023.htm#027), [Mat 23:29](../kjv/mat023.htm#029).md). The
body of Jesus was laid in Joseph's new rock-hewn tomb, in a garden near
to Calvary. All evidence is in favour of the opinion that this tomb was
somewhere near the Damascus gate, and outside the city, and cannot be
identified with the so-called "holy sepulchre." The mouth of such rocky
tombs was usually closed by a large stone (Heb. golal ), which could
only be removed by the united efforts of several men ([Mat
28:2](../kjv/mat028.htm#002.md); compare [Joh
11:39](../kjv/joh011.htm#039)). (See GOLGOTHA..md)

<span id="002">**Tongues, Confusion of**</span> At Babel, the cause of
the early separation of mankind and their division into nations. The
descendants of Noah built a tower to prevent their dispersion; but God
"confounded their language" ([Gen 11:1](../kjv/gen011.htm#001).md), and
they were scattered over the whole earth. Till this time "the whole
earth was of one language and of one speech." (See SHINAR.)

<span id="003">**Tongues, Gift of**</span> Granted on the day of
Pentecost ([Act 2:4](../kjv/act002.htm#004).md), in fulfillment of a
promise Christ had made to his disciples ([Mar
16:17](../kjv/mar016.htm#017).md). What this gift actually was has been a
subject of much discussion. Some have argued that it was merely an
outward sign of the presence of the Holy Spirit among the disciples,
typifying his manifold gifts, and showing that salvation was to be
extended to all nations. But the words of Luke ([Act
2:9](../kjv/act002.htm#009).md) clearly show that the various peoples in
Jerusalem at the time of Pentecost did really hear themselves addressed
in their own special language with which they were naturally acquainted
(compare [Joe 2:28](../kjv/joe002.htm#028.md), [Joe
2:29](../kjv/joe002.htm#029).md). Among the gifts of the Spirit the apostle
enumerates in 1 Cor. 12:10 - 14:30, "divers kinds of tongues" and the
"interpretation of tongues." This "gift" was a different manifestation
of the Spirit from that on Pentecost, although it resembled it in many
particulars. Tongues were to be "a sign to them that believe not."

<span id="004">**Tooth**</span> One of the particulars regarding which
retaliatory punishment was to be inflicted ([Exo
21:24](../kjv/exo021.htm#024); [Lev 24:20](../kjv/lev024.htm#020.md); [Deu
19:21](../kjv/deu019.htm#021).md). "Gnashing of teeth" = rage, despair
([Mat 8:12](../kjv/mat008.htm#012); [Act 7:54](../kjv/act007.htm#054).md);
"cleanness of teeth" = famine ([Amo 4:6](../kjv/amo004.htm#006).md);
"children's teeth set on edge" = children suffering for the sins of
their fathers ([Eze 18:2](../kjv/eze018.htm#002).md).

<span id="005">**Topaz**</span> Heb. pitdah ([Eze
28:13](../kjv/eze028.htm#013); [Rev 21:20](../kjv/rev021.htm#020).md), a
golden yellow or "green" stone brought from Cush or Ethiopia ([Job
28:19](../kjv/job028.htm#019).md). It was the second stone in the first row
in the breastplate of the high priest, and had the name of Simeon
inscribed on it ([Exo 28:17](../kjv/exo028.htm#017).md). It is probably the
chrysolite of the moderns.

<span id="006">**Tophel**</span> Lime, a place in the wilderness of
Sinai ([Deu 1:1](../kjv/deu001.htm#001).md), now identified with Tafyleh or
Tufileh, on the west side of the Edomitish mountains.

<span id="007">**Tophet**</span> =Topheth, from Heb. toph "a drum,"
because the cries of children here sacrificed by the priests of Moloch
were drowned by the noise of such an instrument; or from taph or toph,
meaning "to burn," and hence a place of burning, the name of a
particular part in the valley of Hinnom. "Fire being the most
destructive of all elements, is chosen by the sacred writers to
symbolize the agency by which God punishes or destroys the wicked. We
are not to assume from prophetical figures that material fire is the
precise agent to be used. It was not the agency employed in the
destruction of Sennacherib, mentioned in [Isa
30:33](../kjv/isa030.htm#033.md) Tophet properly begins where the Vale of
Hinnom bends round to the east, having the cliffs of Zion on the north,
and the Hill of Evil Counsel on the south. It terminates at Beer 'Ayub ,
where it joins the Valley of Jehoshaphat. The cliffs on the southern
side especially abound in ancient tombs. Here the dead carcasses of
beasts and every offal and abomination were cast, and left to be either
devoured by that worm that never died or consumed by that fire that was
never quenched." Thus Tophet came to represent the place of punishment.
(See HINNOM.)

<span id="008">**Torches**</span> On the night of his betrayal, when our
Lord was in the garden of Gethsemane, Judas, "having received a band of
men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither
with lanterns and torches and weapons" ([Joh
18:1](../kjv/joh018.htm#001).md). Although it was the time of full moon,
yet in the valley of the Kidron "there fell great, deep shadows from the
declivity of the mountain and projecting rocks; there were there caverns
and grottos, into which a fugitive might retreat; finally, there were
probably a garden-house and tower, into whose gloom it might be
necessary for a searcher to throw light around." Lange's Commentary.
([Nah 2:3](../kjv/nah002.htm#003.md), "torches," Revised Version, "steel,"
probably should be "scythes" for war-chariots.)

<span id="009">**Torment**</span> Gr. basanos ([Mat
4:24](../kjv/mat004.htm#024).md), the "touch-stone" of justice; hence
inquisition by torture, and then any disease which racks and tortures
the limbs.
