<span id="000">**Zatthu**</span> A sprout, [Neh
10:14](../kjv/neh010.htm#014).

<span id="001">**Zattu**</span> Id., one whose descendants returned from
the Captivity with Zerubbabel ([Ezr 2:8](../kjv/ezr002.htm#008); [Neh
7:13](../kjv/neh007.htm#013)); probably the same as Zatthu.

<span id="002">**Zaza**</span> Plenty, a descendant of Judah ([Ch1
2:33](../kjv/ch1002.htm#033)).

<span id="003">**Zeal**</span> An earnest temper; may be enlightened
([Num 25:11](../kjv/num025.htm#011); [Co2 7:11](../kjv/co2007.htm#011);
[Co2 9:2](../kjv/co2009.htm#002)), or ignorant and misdirected ([Rom
10:2](../kjv/rom010.htm#002); [Phi 3:6](../kjv/phi003.htm#006)). As a
Christian grace, it must be grounded on right principles and directed to
right ends ([Gal 4:18](../kjv/gal004.htm#018)). It is sometimes ascribed
to God ([Kg2 19:31](../kjv/kg2019.htm#031); [Isa
9:7](../kjv/isa009.htm#007); [Isa 37:32](../kjv/isa037.htm#032); [Eze
5:13](../kjv/eze005.htm#013)).

<span id="004">**Zealots**</span> A sect of Jews which originated with
Judas the Gaulonite ([Act 5:37](../kjv/act005.htm#037)). They refused to
pay tribute to the Romans, on the ground that this was a violation of
the principle that God was the only king of Israel. They rebelled
against the Romans, but were soon scattered, and became a lawless band
of mere brigands. They were afterwards called Sicarii, from their use of
the sica, i.e., the Roman dagger.

<span id="005">**Zebadiah**</span> Gift of Jehovah. (1.) A son of
Asahel, Joab's brother ([Ch1 27:7](../kjv/ch1027.htm#007)). (2.) A
Levite who took part as one of the teachers in the system of national
education instituted by Jehoshaphat ([Ch2 17:7](../kjv/ch2017.htm#007),
[Ch2 17:8](../kjv/ch2017.htm#008)). (3.) The son of Ishmael, "the ruler
of the house of Judah in all the king's matters" ([Ch2
19:8](../kjv/ch2019.htm#008)). (4.) A son of Beriah ([Ch1
8:15](../kjv/ch1008.htm#015)). (5.) A Korhite porter of the Lord's house
([Ch1 26:2](../kjv/ch1026.htm#002)). Three or four others of this name
are also mentioned.

<span id="006">**Zebah**</span> Man-killer, or sacrifice, one of the two
kings who led the vast host of the Midianites who invaded the land of
Israel, and over whom Gideon gained a great and decisive victory (Judg.
8). Zebah and Zalmunna had succeeded in escaping across the Jordan with
a remnant of the Midianite host, but were overtaken at Karkor, probably
in the Hauran, and routed by Gideon. The kings were taken alive and
brought back across the Jordan; and confessing that they had personally
taken part in the slaughter of Gideon's brothers, they were put to death
(compare [Sa1 12:11](../kjv/sa1012.htm#011); [Isa
10:26](../kjv/isa010.htm#026); [Psa 83:11](../kjv/psa083.htm#011)).

<span id="007">**Zebaim**</span> ([Ezr 2:57](../kjv/ezr002.htm#057);
[Neh 7:59](../kjv/neh007.htm#059)). "Pochereth of Zebaim" should be read
as in the Revised Version, "Pochereth-hazzebaim" ("snaring the
antelopes"), probably the name of some hunter.

<span id="008">**Zebedee**</span> A Galilean fisherman, the husband of
Salome (q.v.), and the father of James and John, two of our Lord's
disciples ([Mat 4:21](../kjv/mat004.htm#021); [Mat
27:56](../kjv/mat027.htm#056); [Mar 15:40](../kjv/mar015.htm#040)). He
seems to have been a man of some position in Capernaum, for he had two
boats ([Luk 5:4](../kjv/luk005.htm#004)) and "hired servants" ([Mar
1:20](../kjv/mar001.htm#020)) of his own. No mention is made of him
after the call of his two sons by Jesus.

<span id="009">**Zeboim**</span> Gazelles or roes. (1.) One of the "five
cities of the plain" of Sodom, generally coupled with Admah ([Gen
10:19](../kjv/gen010.htm#019); [Gen 14:2](../kjv/gen014.htm#002); [Deu
29:23](../kjv/deu029.htm#023); [Hos 11:8](../kjv/hos011.htm#008)). It
had a king of its own (Shemeber), and was therefore a place of some
importance. It was destroyed along with the other cities of the plain.
(2.) A valley or rugged glen somewhere near Gibeah in Benjamin ([Sa1
13:18](../kjv/sa1013.htm#018)). It was probably the ravine now bearing
the name Wady Shakh-ed-Dub'a , or "ravine of the hyena," north of
Jericho. (3.) A place mentioned only in [Neh
11:34](../kjv/neh011.htm#034), inhabited by the Benjamites after the
Captivity.
