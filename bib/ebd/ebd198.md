<span id="000">**Jashobeam**</span> Dweller among the people; or to whom
the people turn, the Hachmonite ([Ch1 11:11](../kjv/ch1011.htm#011).md),
one of David's chief heroes who joined him at Ziklag ([Ch1
12:6](../kjv/ch1012.htm#006).md). He was the first of the three who broke
through the host of the Philistines to fetch water to David from the
well of Bethlehem ([Sa2 23:13](../kjv/sa2023.htm#013).md). He is also
called Adino the Eznite (8).

<span id="001">**Jashub**</span> Returner. (1.) The third of Issachar's
four sons ([Ch1 7:1](../kjv/ch1007.htm#001).md); called also Job ([Gen
46:13](../kjv/gen046.htm#013)). (2.) [Ezr 10:29](../kjv/ezr010.htm#029.md).

<span id="002">**Jason**</span> He that will cure, the host of Paul and
Silas in Thessalonica. The Jews assaulted his house in order to seize
Paul, but failing to find him, they dragged Jason before the ruler of
the city ([Act 17:5](../kjv/act017.htm#005).md). He was apparently one of
the kinsmen of Paul ([Rom 16:21](../kjv/rom016.htm#021).md), and
accompanied him from Thessalonica to Corinth.

<span id="003">**Jasper**</span> (Heb. yashpheh , "glittering"), a gem
of various colours, one of the twelve inserted in the high priest's
breast-plate ([Exo 28:20](../kjv/exo028.htm#020).md). It is named in the
building of the New Jerusalem ([Rev 21:18](../kjv/rev021.htm#018.md), [Rev
21:19](../kjv/rev021.htm#019).md). It was "most precious," "clear as
crystal" ([Rev 21:11](../kjv/rev021.htm#011).md). It was emblematic of the
glory of God ([Rev 4:3](../kjv/rev004.htm#003).md).

<span id="004">**Jattir**</span> Pre-eminent, a city in the mountains of
Judah ([Jos 15:48](../kjv/jos015.htm#048.md); [Jos
21:14](../kjv/jos021.htm#014).md).

<span id="005">**Javan**</span> (1.) The fourth "son" of Japheth ([Gen
10:2](../kjv/gen010.htm#002).md), whose descendants settled in Greece,
i.e., Ionia, which bears the name of Javan in Hebrew. Alexander the
Great is called the "king of Javan" (rendered "Grecia," [Dan
8:21](../kjv/dan008.htm#021); [Dan 10:20](../kjv/dan010.htm#020.md);
compare [Dan 11:2](../kjv/dan011.htm#002.md); [Zac
9:13](../kjv/zac009.htm#013).md). This word was universally used by the
nations of the East as the generic name of the Greek race. (2.) A town
or district of Arabia Felix, from which the Syrians obtained iron,
cassia, and calamus ([Eze 27:19](../kjv/eze027.htm#019).md).

<span id="006">**Javelin**</span> (1.) Heb. hanith , a lance, from its
flexibility ([Sa1 18:10](../kjv/sa1018.htm#010.md), [Sa1
18:11](../kjv/sa1018.htm#011); [Sa1 19:9](../kjv/sa1019.htm#009.md), [Sa1
19:10](../kjv/sa1019.htm#010); [Sa1 20:33](../kjv/sa1020.htm#033)). (2..md)
Heb. romah , a lance for heavy-armed troops, so called from its piercing
([Num 25:7](../kjv/num025.htm#007)). (See ARMS..md)

<span id="007">**Jaw-bone**</span> Of an ass afforded Samson a weapon
for the great slaughter of the Philistines ([Jdg
15:15](../kjv/jdg015.htm#015).md), in which he slew a thousand men. In [Jdg
15:19](../kjv/jdg015.htm#019.md) the Authorized Version reads, "God clave a
hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout." This
is a mis-translation of the words. The rendering should be as in the
Revised Version, "God clave the hollow place that is in Lehi," etc.,
Lehi (q.v.) being the name of the hill where this conflict was waged,
possibly so called because it was in shape like a jaw-bone.

<span id="008">**Jealousy**</span> Suspicion of a wife's purity, one of
the strongest passions ([Num 5:14](../kjv/num005.htm#014.md); [Pro
6:34](../kjv/pro006.htm#034); [Sol 8:6](../kjv/sol008.htm#006).md); also an
intense interest for another's honour or prosperity ([Psa
79:5](../kjv/psa079.htm#005); [Co1 10:22](../kjv/co1010.htm#022.md); [Zac
1:14](../kjv/zac001.htm#014).md).

<span id="009">**Jealousy, Image of**</span> An idolatrous object, seen
in vision by Ezekiel ([Eze 8:3](../kjv/eze008.htm#003.md), [Eze
8:5](../kjv/eze008.htm#005).md), which stood in the priests' or inner court
of the temple. Probably identical with the statue of Astarte ([Kg2
21:7](../kjv/kg2021.htm#007).md).
