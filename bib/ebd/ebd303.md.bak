<span id="000">**Puteoli**</span> A city on the coast of Campania, on
the north shore of a bay running north from the Bay of Naples, at which
Paul landed on his way to Rome, from which it was distant 170 miles.
Here he tarried for seven days ([Act 28:13](../kjv/act028.htm#013.md), [Act
28:14](../kjv/act028.htm#014).md). This was the great emporium for the
Alexandrian corn ships. Here Paul and his companions began their
journey, by the "Appian Way," to Rome. It is now called Pozzuoli. The
remains of a huge amphitheater, and of the quay at which Paul landed,
may still be seen here.

<span id="001">**Pygarg**</span> Heb. dishon , "springing", ([Deu
14:5](../kjv/deu014.htm#005).md), one of the animals permitted for food. It
is supposed to be the Antelope addax. It is described as "a large
animal, over 3 1/2 feet high at the shoulder, and, with its
gently-twisted horns, 2 1/2 feet long. Its colour is pure white, with
the exception of a short black mane, and a tinge of tawny on the
shoulders and back.", Tristram's Natural History.

<span id="002">**Quails**</span> The Israelites were twice relieved in
their privation by a miraculous supply of quails, (1.) in the wilderness
of Sin ([Exo 16:13](../kjv/exo016.htm#013)), and (2..md) again at
Kibroth-hattaavah (q.v.), [Num 11:31](../kjv/num011.htm#031.md). God
"rained flesh upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of
the sea" ([Psa 78:27](../kjv/psa078.htm#027).md). The words in [Num
11:31](../kjv/num011.htm#031.md), according to the Authorized Version,
appear to denote that the quails lay one above another to the thickness
of two cubits above the ground. The Revised Version, however, reads,
"about two cubits above the face of the earth", i.e., the quails flew at
this height, and were easily killed or caught by the hand. Being thus
secured in vast numbers by the people, they "spread them all abroad"
([Num 11:32](../kjv/num011.htm#032).md) in order to salt and dry them.
These birds (the Coturnix vulgaris of naturalists) are found in
countless numbers on the shores of the Mediterranean, and their annual
migration is an event causing great excitement.

<span id="003">**Quarantania**</span> A mountain some 1,200 feet high,
about 7 miles north-west of Jericho, the traditional scene of our Lord's
temptation ([Mat 4:8](../kjv/mat004.htm#008).md).

<span id="004">**Quarries**</span> (1.) The "Royal Quarries" (not found
in Scripture) is the name given to the vast caverns stretching far
underneath the northern hill, Bezetha, on which Jerusalem is built. Out
of these mammoth caverns stones, a hard lime-stone, have been quarried
in ancient times for the buildings in the city, and for the temples of
Solomon, Zerubbabel, and Herod. Huge blocks of stone are still found in
these caves bearing the marks of pick and chisel. The general appearance
of the whole suggests to the explorer the idea that the Phoenician
quarrymen have just suspended their work. The supposition that the
polished blocks of stone for Solomon's temple were sent by Hiram from
Lebanon or Tyre is not supported by any evidence (Compare [Kg1
5:8](../kjv/kg1005.htm#008).md). Hiram sent masons and stone-squarers to
Jerusalem to assist Solomon's workmen in their great undertaking, but
did not send stones to Jerusalem, where, indeed, they were not needed,
as these royal quarries abundantly testify. (2.) The "quarries" (Heb.
pesilim ) by Gilgal ([Jdg 3:19](../kjv/jdg003.htm#019).md), from which Ehud
turned back for the purpose of carrying out his design to put Eglon king
of Moab to death, were probably the "graven images" (as the word is
rendered by the LXX. and the Vulgate and in the marg. A.V. and R.V.), or
the idol temples the Moabites had erected at Gilgal, where the children
of Israel first encamped after crossing the Jordan. The Hebrew word is
rendered "graven images" in [Deu 7:25](../kjv/deu007.htm#025.md), and is
not elsewhere translated "quarries."

<span id="005">**Quartus**</span> Fourth, a Corinthian Christian who
sent by Paul his salutations to friends at Rome ([Rom
16:23](../kjv/rom016.htm#023).md).

<span id="006">**Quaternion**</span> A band of four soldiers. Peter was
committed by Herod to the custody of four quaternions, i.e., one
quaternion for each watch of the night ([Act
12:4](../kjv/act012.htm#004).md). Thus every precaution was taken against
his escape from prison. Two of each quaternion were in turn stationed at
the door ([Act 12:6](../kjv/act012.htm#006).md), and to two the apostle was
chained according to Roman custom.

<span id="007">**Queen**</span> No explicit mention of queens is made
till we read of the "queen of Sheba." The wives of the kings of Israel
are not so designated. In [Psa 45:9](../kjv/psa045.htm#009.md), the Hebrew
for "queen" is not malkah, one actually ruling like the Queen of Sheba,
but shegal, which simply means the king's wife. In [Kg1
11:19](../kjv/kg1011.htm#019.md), Pharaoh's wife is called "the queen," but
the Hebrew word so rendered ( g'birah ) is simply a title of honour,
denoting a royal lady, used sometimes for "queen-mother" ([Kg1
15:13](../kjv/kg1015.htm#013); [Ch2 15:16](../kjv/ch2015.htm#016).md). In
[Sol 6:8](../kjv/sol006.htm#008), [Sol 6:9](../kjv/sol006.htm#009.md), the
king's wives are styled "queens" (Heb. melakhoth ). In the New Testament
we read of the "queen of the south", i.e., Southern Arabia, Sheba ([Mat
12:42](../kjv/mat012.htm#042); [Luk 11:31](../kjv/luk011.htm#031).md) and
the "queen of the Ethiopians" ([Act 8:27](../kjv/act008.htm#027).md),
Candace.

<span id="008">**Queen of Heaven**</span> ([Jer
7:18](../kjv/jer007.htm#018); [Jer 44:17](../kjv/jer044.htm#017.md), [Jer
44:25](../kjv/jer044.htm#025).md), the moon, worshipped by the Assyrians as
the receptive power in nature.

<span id="009">**Quicksands**</span> Found only in [Act
27:17](../kjv/act027.htm#017.md), the rendering of the Greek Syrtis . On
the north coast of Africa were two localities dangerous to sailors,
called the Greater and Lesser Syrtis . The former of these is probably
here meant. It lies between Tripoli and Barca, and near Cyrene. The
Lesser Syrtis lay farther to the west.
