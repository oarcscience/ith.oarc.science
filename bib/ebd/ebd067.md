<span id="000">**Bush**</span> In which Jehovah appeared to Moses in the
wilderness ([Exo 3:2](../kjv/exo003.htm#002.md); [Act
7:30](../kjv/act007.htm#030).md). It is difficult to say what particular
kind of plant or bush is here meant. Probably it was the mimosa or
acacia. The words "in the bush" in [Mar 12:26](../kjv/mar012.htm#026.md);
[Luk 20:37](../kjv/luk020.htm#037.md), mean "in the passage or paragraph on
the bush;" i.e., in Ex. 3.

<span id="001">**Butler**</span> Properly a servant in charge of the
wine ([Gen 40:1](../kjv/gen040.htm#001.md); [Gen
41:9](../kjv/gen041.htm#009).md). The Hebrew word, mashkeh, thus translated
is rendered also (plural) "cup-bearers" ([Kg1
10:5](../kjv/kg1010.htm#005); [Ch2 9:4](../kjv/ch2009.htm#004).md).
Nehemiah ([Neh 1:11](../kjv/neh001.htm#011).md) was cup-bearer to king
Artaxerxes. It was a position of great responsibility and honour in
royal households.

<span id="002">**Butter**</span> (Heb. hemah ), curdled milk ([Gen
18:8](../kjv/gen018.htm#008); [Jdg 5:25](../kjv/jdg005.htm#025.md); [Sa2
17:29](../kjv/sa2017.htm#029).md), or butter in the form of the skim of hot
milk or cream, called by the Arabs kaimak, a semi-fluid ([Job
20:17](../kjv/job020.htm#017); [Job 29:6](../kjv/job029.htm#006.md); [Deu
32:14](../kjv/deu032.htm#014).md). The words of [Pro
30:33](../kjv/pro030.htm#033.md) have been rendered by some "the pressure
\[not churning\] of milk bringeth forth cheese."

<span id="003">**Buz**</span> Contempt. (1.) The second son of Nahor and
Milcah, and brother of Huz ([Gen 22:21](../kjv/gen022.htm#021).md). Elihu
was one of his descendants ([Job 32:2](../kjv/job032.htm#002)). (2..md) One
of the chiefs of the tribe of Gad ([Ch1 5:14](../kjv/ch1005.htm#014).md).
(3.) A district in Arabia Petrea ([Jer 25:23](../kjv/jer025.htm#023).md).

<span id="004">**Buzi**</span> The father of the prophet Ezekiel ([Eze
1:3](../kjv/eze001.htm#003).md).

<span id="005">**By**</span> In the expression "by myself" (A.V., [Co1
4:4](../kjv/co1004.htm#004).md), means, as rendered in the Revised Version,
"against myself."

<span id="006">**By and by**</span> Immediately ([Mat
13:21](../kjv/mat013.htm#021.md); R.V., "straightway;" [Luk
21:9](../kjv/luk021.htm#009).md).

<span id="007">**By-ways**</span> Only in [Jdg
5:6](../kjv/jdg005.htm#006) and [Psa 125:5](../kjv/psa125.htm#005.md);
literally "winding or twisted roads." The margin has "crooked ways."

<span id="008">**By-word**</span> Hebrew millah ([Job
30:9](../kjv/job030.htm#009).md), a word or speech, and hence object to
talk; Hebrew mashal ([Psa 44:14](../kjv/psa044.htm#014).md), a proverb or
parable. When it denotes a sharp word of derision, as in [Deu
28:37](../kjv/deu028.htm#037), [Kg1 9:7](../kjv/kg1009.htm#007.md), [Ch2
7:20](../kjv/ch2007.htm#020.md), the Hebrew sheninah is used. In [Jer
24:9](../kjv/jer024.htm#009.md) it is rendered "taunt."

<span id="009">**Cab**</span> Hollow (R.V., "kab"), occurs only in [Kg2
6:25](../kjv/kg2006.htm#025.md); a dry measure, the sixth part of a seah,
and the eighteenth part of an ephah, equal to about two English quarts.
