<span id="000">**Satan**</span> Adversary; accuser. When used as a
proper name, the Hebrew word so rendered has the article "the adversary"
([Job 1:6](../kjv/job001.htm#006); [Job 2:1](../kjv/job002.htm#001).md). In
the New Testament it is used as interchangeable with Diabolos, or the
devil, and is so used more than thirty times. He is also called "the
dragon," "the old serpent" ([Rev 12:9](../kjv/rev012.htm#009.md); [Rev
20:2](../kjv/rev020.htm#002).md); "the prince of this world" ([Joh
12:31](../kjv/joh012.htm#031); [Joh 14:30](../kjv/joh014.htm#030).md); "the
prince of the power of the air" ([Eph 2:2](../kjv/eph002.htm#002).md); "the
god of this world" ([Co2 4:4](../kjv/co2004.htm#004).md); "the spirit that
now worketh in the children of disobedience" ([Eph
2:2](../kjv/eph002.htm#002).md). The distinct personality of Satan and his
activity among men are thus obviously recognized. He tempted our Lord in
the wilderness ([Mat 4:1](../kjv/mat004.htm#001).md). He is "Beelzebub, the
prince of the devils" ([Mat 12:24](../kjv/mat012.htm#024).md). He is "the
constant enemy of God, of Christ, of the divine kingdom, of the
followers of Christ, and of all truth; full of falsehood and all malice,
and exciting and seducing to evil in every possible way." His power is
very great in the world. He is a "roaring lion, seeking whom he may
devour" ([Pe1 5:8](../kjv/pe1005.htm#008).md). Men are said to be "taken
captive by him" ([Ti2 2:26](../kjv/ti2002.htm#026).md). Christians are
warned against his "devices" ([Co2 2:11](../kjv/co2002.htm#011).md), and
called on to "resist" him ([Jam 4:7](../kjv/jam004.htm#007).md). Christ
redeems his people from "him that had the power of death, that is, the
devil" ([Heb 2:14](../kjv/heb002.htm#014).md). Satan has the "power of
death," not as lord, but simply as executioner.

<span id="001">**Satyr**</span> Hairy one. Mentioned in Greek mythology
as a creature composed of a man and a goat, supposed to inhabit wild and
desolate regions. The Hebrew word is rendered also "goat" ([Lev
4:24](../kjv/lev004.htm#024).md) and "devil", i.e., an idol in the form of
a goat ([Lev 17:7](../kjv/lev017.htm#007.md); [Ch2
11:15](../kjv/ch2011.htm#015).md). When it is said ([Isa
13:21](../kjv/isa013.htm#021.md); compare [Isa
34:14](../kjv/isa034.htm#014).md) "the satyrs shall dance there," the
meaning is that the place referred to shall become a desolate waste.
Some render the Hebrew word "baboon," a species of which is found in
Babylonia.

<span id="002">**Saul**</span> Asked for. (1.) A king of Edom ([Gen
36:37](../kjv/gen036.htm#037), [Gen 36:38](../kjv/gen036.htm#038).md);
called Shaul in [Ch1 1:48](../kjv/ch1001.htm#048). (2..md) The son of Kish
(probably his only son, and a child of prayer, "asked for"), of the
tribe of Benjamin, the first king of the Jewish nation. The singular
providential circumstances connected with his election as king are
recorded in 1 Sam. 8-10. His father's she-asses had strayed, and Saul
was sent with a servant to seek for them. Leaving his home at Gibeah
([Sa1 10:5](../kjv/sa1010.htm#005.md), "the hill of God," A.V.; lit., as in
R.V. marg., "Gibeah of God"), Saul and his servant went toward the
north-west over Mount Ephraim, and then turning north-east they came to
"the land of Shalisha," and thence eastward to the land of Shalim, and
at length came to the district of Zuph, near Samuel's home at Ramah
([Sa1 9:5](../kjv/sa1009.htm#005).md). At this point Saul proposed to
return from the three days' fruitless search, but his servant suggested
that they should first consult the "seer." Hearing that he was about to
offer sacrifice, the two hastened into Ramah, and "behold, Samuel came
out against them," on his way to the "bamah", i.e., the "height", where
sacrifice was to be offered; and in answer to Saul's question, "Tell me,
I pray thee, where the seer's house is," Samuel made himself known to
him. Samuel had been divinely prepared for his coming ([Sa1
9:15](../kjv/sa1009.htm#015).md), and received Saul as his guest. He took
him with him to the sacrifice, and then after the feast "communed with
Saul upon the top of the house" of all that was in his heart. On the
morrow Samuel "took a vial of oil and poured it on his head," and
anointed Saul as king over Israel (1 Sam. 9:25 - 10:8), giving him three
signs in confirmation of his call to be king. When Saul reached his home
in Gibeah the last of these signs was fulfilled, and the Sprit of God
came upon him, and "he was turned into another man." The simple
countryman was transformed into the king of Israel, a remarkable change
suddenly took place in his whole demeanour, and the people said in their
astonishment, as they looked on the stalwart son of Kish, "Is Saul also
among the prophets?", a saying which passed into a "proverb." (Compare
[Sa1 19:24](../kjv/sa1019.htm#024)..md) The intercourse between Saul and
Samuel was as yet unknown to the people. The "anointing" had been in
secret. But now the time had come when the transaction must be confirmed
by the nation. Samuel accordingly summoned the people to a solemn
assembly "before the Lord" at Mizpeh. Here the lot was drawn ([Sa1
10:17](../kjv/sa1010.htm#017).md), and it fell upon Saul, and when he was
presented before them, the stateliest man in all Israel, the air was
rent for the first time in Israel by the loud cry, "God save the king!"
He now returned to his home in Gibeah, attended by a king of bodyguard,
"a band of men whose hearts God had touched." On reaching his home he
dismissed them, and resumed the quiet toils of his former life. Soon
after this, on hearing of the conduct of Nahash the Ammonite at
Jabesh-Gilead (q.v.), an army out of all the tribes of Israel rallied at
his summons to the trysting-place at Bezek, and he led them forth a
great army to battle, gaining a complete victory over the Ammonite
invaders at Jabesh ([Sa1 11:1](../kjv/sa1011.htm#001).md). Amid the
universal joy occasioned by this victory he was now fully recognized as
the king of Israel. At the invitation of Samuel "all the people went to
Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the Lord in Gilgal." Samuel
now officially anointed him as king ([Sa1
11:15](../kjv/sa1011.htm#015).md). Although Samuel never ceased to be a
judge in Israel, yet now his work in that capacity practically came to
an end. Saul now undertook the great and difficult enterprise of freeing
the land from its hereditary enemies the Philistines, and for this end
he gathered together an army of 3,000 men ([Sa1
13:1](../kjv/sa1013.htm#001), [Sa1 13:2](../kjv/sa1013.htm#002).md). The
Philistines were encamped at Geba. Saul, with 2,000 men, occupied
Michmash and Mount Bethel; while his son Jonathan, with 1,000 men,
occupied Gibeah, to the south of Geba, and seemingly without any
direction from his father "smote" the Philistines in Geba. Thus roused,
the Philistines, who gathered an army of 30,000 chariots and 6,000
horsemen, and "people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in
multitude," encamped in Michmash, which Saul had evacuated for Gilgal.
Saul now tarried for seven days in Gilgal before making any movement, as
Samuel had appointed ([Sa1 10:8](../kjv/sa1010.htm#008).md); but becoming
impatient on the seventh day, as it was drawing to a close, when he had
made an end of offering the burnt offering, Samuel appeared and warned
him of the fatal consequences of his act of disobedience, for he had not
waited long enough ([Sa1 13:13](../kjv/sa1013.htm#013.md), [Sa1
13:14](../kjv/sa1013.htm#014).md). When Saul, after Samuel's departure,
went out from Gilgal with his 600 men, his followers having decreased to
that number ([Sa1 13:15](../kjv/sa1013.htm#015).md), against the
Philistines at Michmash (q.v.), he had his head-quarters under a
pomegranate tree at Migron, over against Michmash, the Wady es Suweinit
alone intervening. Here at Gibeah-Geba Saul and his army rested,
uncertain what to do. Jonathan became impatient, and with his
armour-bearer planned an assault against the Philistines, unknown to
Saul and the army ([Sa1 14:1](../kjv/sa1014.htm#001).md). Jonathan and his
armour-bearer went down into the wady, and on their hands and knees
climbed to the top of the narrow rocky ridge called Bozez, where was the
outpost of the Philistine army. They surprised and then slew twenty of
the Philistines, and immediately the whole host of the Philistines was
thrown into disorder and fled in great terror. "It was a very great
trembling;" a supernatural panic seized the host. Saul and his 600 men,
a band which speedily increased to 10,000, perceiving the confusion,
pursued the army of the Philistines, and the tide of battle rolled on as
far as to Bethaven, halfway between Michmash and Bethel. The Philistines
were totally routed. "So the Lord saved Israel that day." While pursuing
the Philistines, Saul rashly adjured the people, saying, "Cursed be the
man that eateth any food until evening." But though faint and weary, the
Israelites "smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon" (a
distance of from 15 to 20 miles). Jonathan had, while passing through
the wood in pursuit of the Philistines, tasted a little of the honeycomb
which was abundant there ([Sa1 14:27](../kjv/sa1014.htm#027).md). This was
afterwards discovered by Saul ([Sa1 14:42](../kjv/sa1014.htm#042).md), and
he threatened to put his son to death. The people, however, interposed,
saying, "There shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground." He
whom God had so signally owned, who had "wrought this great salvation in
Israel," must not die. "Then Saul went up from following the
Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place" (1 Sam.
14:24-46); and thus the campaign against the Philistines came to an end.
This was Saul's second great military success. Saul's reign, however,
continued to be one of almost constant war against his enemies round
about ([Sa1 14:47](../kjv/sa1014.htm#047.md), [Sa1
14:48](../kjv/sa1014.htm#048).md), in all of which he proved victorious.
The war against the Amalekites is the only one which is recorded at
length (1 Sam. 15). These oldest and hereditary ([Exo
17:8](../kjv/exo017.htm#008); [Num 14:43](../kjv/num014.htm#043).md)
enemies of Israel occupied the territory to the south and south-west of
Palestine. Samuel summoned Saul to execute the "ban" which God had
pronounced ([Deu 25:17](../kjv/deu025.htm#017).md) on this cruel and
relentless foe of Israel. The cup of their iniquity was now full. This
command was "the test of his moral qualification for being king." Saul
proceeded to execute the divine command; and gathering the people
together, marched from Telaim ([Sa1 15:4](../kjv/sa1015.htm#004).md)
against the Amalekites, whom he smote "from Havilah until thou comest to
Shur," utterly destroying "all the people with the edge of the sword",
i.e., all that fell into his hands. He was, however, guilty of rebellion
and disobedience in sparing Agag their king, and in conniving at his
soldiers' sparing the best of the sheep and cattle; and Samuel,
following Saul to Gilgal, in the Jordan valley, said unto him, "Because
thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he also hath rejected thee from
being king" ([Sa1 15:23](../kjv/sa1015.htm#023).md). The kingdom was rent
from Saul and was given to another, even to David, whom the Lord chose
to be Saul's successor, and whom Samuel anointed ([Sa1
16:1](../kjv/sa1016.htm#001).md). From that day "the spirit of the Lord
departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him." He
and Samuel parted only to meet once again at one of the schools of the
prophets. David was now sent for as a "cunning player on an harp" ([Sa1
16:16](../kjv/sa1016.htm#016), [Sa1 16:18](../kjv/sa1016.htm#018).md), to
play before Saul when the evil spirit troubled him, and thus was
introduced to the court of Saul. He became a great favourite with the
king. At length David returned to his father's house and to his wonted
avocation as a shepherd for perhaps some three years. The Philistines
once more invaded the land, and gathered their army between Shochoh and
Azekah, in Ephes-dammim, on the southern slope of the valley of Elah.
Saul and the men of Israel went forth to meet them, and encamped on the
northern slope of the same valley which lay between the two armies. It
was here that David slew Goliath of Gath, the champion of the
Philistines (1 Sam. 17:4-54), an exploit which led to the flight and
utter defeat of the Philistine army. Saul now took David permanently
into his service ([Sa1 18:2](../kjv/sa1018.htm#002).md); but he became
jealous of him ([Sa1 18:9](../kjv/sa1018.htm#009).md), and on many
occasions showed his enmity toward him ([Sa1
18:10](../kjv/sa1018.htm#010), [Sa1 18:11](../kjv/sa1018.htm#011).md), his
enmity ripening into a purpose of murder which at different times he
tried in vain to carry out. After some time the Philistines "gathered
themselves together" in the plain of Esdraelon, and pitched their camp
at Shunem, on the slope of Little Hermon; and Saul "gathered all Israel
together," and "pitched in Gilboa" ([Sa1 28:3](../kjv/sa1028.htm#003).md).
Being unable to discover the mind of the Lord, Saul, accompanied by two
of his retinue, betook himself to the "witch of Endor," some 7 or 8
miles distant. Here he was overwhelmed by the startling communication
that was mysteriously made to him by Samuel ([Sa1
28:16](../kjv/sa1028.htm#016).md), who appeared to him. "He fell
straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the
words of Samuel" ([Sa1 28:20](../kjv/sa1028.htm#020).md). The Philistine
host "fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled before the
Philistines, and fell down slain in Mount Gilboa" ([Sa1
31:1](../kjv/sa1031.htm#001).md). In his despair at the disaster that had
befallen his army, Saul "took a sword and fell upon it." And the
Philistines on the morrow "found Saul and his three sons fallen in Mount
Gilboa." Having cut off his head, they sent it with his weapons to
Philistia, and hung up the skull in the temple of Dagon at Ashdod. They
suspended his headless body, with that of Jonathan, from the walls of
Bethshan. The men of Jabesh-gilead afterwards removed the bodies from
this position; and having burnt the flesh, they buried the bodies under
a tree at Jabesh. The remains were, however, afterwards removed to the
family sepulchre at Zelah ([Sa2 21:13](../kjv/sa2021.htm#013.md), [Sa2
21:14](../kjv/sa2021.htm#014)). (See DAVID.) (3..md) "Who is also called
Paul" (q.v.), the circumcision name of the apostle, given to him,
perhaps, in memory of King Saul ([Act 7:58](../kjv/act007.htm#058.md); [Act
8:1](../kjv/act008.htm#001); [Act 9:1](../kjv/act009.htm#001).md).

<span id="003">**Saviour**</span> One who saves from any form or degree
of evil. In its highest sense the word indicates the relation sustained
by our Lord to his redeemed ones, he is their Saviour. The great message
of the gospel is about salvation and the Saviour. It is the "gospel of
salvation." Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ secures to the sinner a
personal interest in the work of redemption. Salvation is redemption
made effectual to the individual by the power of the Holy Spirit.

<span id="004">**Scapegoat**</span> Lev. 16:8-26; R.V., "the goat for
Azazel" (q.v.), the name given to the goat which was taken away into the
wilderness on the day of Atonement ([Lev 16:20](../kjv/lev016.htm#020).md).
The priest made atonement over the scapegoat, laying Israel's guilt upon
it, and then sent it away, the goat bearing "upon him all their
iniquities unto a land not inhabited." At a later period an evasion or
modification of the law of Moses was introduced by the Jews. "The goat
was conducted to a mountain named Tzuk, situated at a distance of ten
Sabbath days' journey, or about six and a half English miles, from
Jerusalem. At this place the Judean desert was supposed to commence; and
the man in whose charge the goat was sent out, while setting him free,
was instructed to push the unhappy beast down the slope of the mountain
side, which was so steep as to insure the death of the goat, whose bones
were broken by the fall. The reason of this barbarous custom was that on
one occasion the scapegoat returned to Jerusalem after being set free,
which was considered such an evil omen that its recurrence was prevented
for the future by the death of the goat" (Twenty-one Years' Work in the
Holy Land). This mountain is now called el-Muntar.

<span id="005">**Scarlet**</span> This dye was obtained by the Egyptians
from the shell-fish Carthamus tinctorius; and by the Hebrews from the
Coccus ilicis, an insect which infests oak trees, called kermes by the
Arabians. This colour was early known ([Gen
38:28](../kjv/gen038.htm#028).md). It was one of the colours of the ephod
([Exo 28:6](../kjv/exo028.htm#006).md), the girdle ([Exo
28:8](../kjv/exo028.htm#008).md), and the breastplate ([Exo
28:15](../kjv/exo028.htm#015).md) of the high priest. It is also mentioned
in various other connections ([Jos 2:18](../kjv/jos002.htm#018.md); [Sa2
1:24](../kjv/sa2001.htm#024); [Lam 4:5](../kjv/lam004.htm#005.md); [Nah
2:3](../kjv/nah002.htm#003).md). A scarlet robe was in mockery placed on
our Lord ([Mat 27:28](../kjv/mat027.htm#028.md); [Luk
23:11](../kjv/luk023.htm#011).md). "Sins as scarlet" ([Isa
1:18](../kjv/isa001.htm#018).md), i.e., as scarlet robes "glaring and
habitual." Scarlet and crimson were the firmest of dyes, and thus not
easily washed out.

<span id="006">**Sceptre**</span> (Heb. shebet = Gr. skeptron ),
properly a staff or rod. As a symbol of authority, the use of the
sceptre originated in the idea that the ruler was as a shepherd of his
people ([Gen 49:10](../kjv/gen049.htm#010.md); [Num
24:17](../kjv/num024.htm#017); [Psa 45:6](../kjv/psa045.htm#006.md); [Isa
14:5](../kjv/isa014.htm#005).md). There is no example on record of a
sceptre having ever been actually handled by a Jewish king.

<span id="007">**Sceva**</span> An implement, a Jew, chief of the
priests at Ephesus ([Act 19:13](../kjv/act019.htm#013).md); i.e., the head
of one of the twenty-four courses of the house of Levi. He had seven
sons, who "took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the
name of the Lord Jesus," in imitation of Paul. They tried their method
of exorcism on a fierce demoniac, and failed. His answer to them was to
this effect ([Act 19:15](../kjv/act019.htm#015).md): "The Jesus whom you
invoke is One whose authority I acknowledge; and the Paul whom you name
I recognize to be a servant or messenger of God; but what sort of men
are ye who have been empowered to act as you do by neither?" (Lindsay on
the Acts of the Apostles.)

<span id="008">**Schism**</span> A separation, an alienation causing
divisions among Christians, who ought to be united ([Co1
12:25](../kjv/co1012.htm#025).md).

<span id="009">**Schoolmaster**</span> The law so designated by Paul
([Gal 3:24](../kjv/gal003.htm#024), [Gal 3:25](../kjv/gal003.htm#025).md).
As so used, the word does not mean teacher, but pedagogue (shortened
into the modern page), i.e., one who was entrusted with the supervision
of a family, taking them to and from the school, being responsible for
their safety and manners. Hence the pedagogue was stern and severe in
his discipline. Thus the law was a pedagogue to the Jews, with a view to
Christ, i.e., to prepare for faith in Christ by producing convictions of
guilt and helplessness. The office of the pedagogue ceased when "faith
came", i.e., the object of that faith, the seed, which is Christ.
