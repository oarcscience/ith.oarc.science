<span id="000">**Areopagite**</span> A member of the court of Areopagus
([Act 17:34](../kjv/act017.htm#034).md).

<span id="001">**Areopagus**</span> The Latin form of the Greek word
rendered "Mars' hill." But it denotes also the council or court of
justice which met in the open air on the hill. It was a rocky height to
the west of the Acropolis at Athens, on the south-east summit of which
the council was held which was constituted by Solon, and consisted of
nine archons or chief magistrates who were then in office, and the
ex-archons of blameless life. On this hill of Mars (Gr. Ares ) Paul
delivered his memorable address to the "men of Athens" ([Act
17:22](../kjv/act017.htm#022).md).

<span id="002">**Aretas**</span> The father-in-law of Herod Antipas, and
king of Arabia Petraea. His daughter returned to him on the occasion of
her husband's entering into an adulterous alliance with Herodias, the
wife of Herod-Philip, his half-brother ([Luk
3:19](../kjv/luk003.htm#019), [Luk 3:20](../kjv/luk003.htm#020.md); [Mar
6:17](../kjv/mar006.htm#017); [Mat 14:3](../kjv/mat014.htm#003).md). This
led to a war between Aretas and Herod Antipas. Herod's army was wholly
destroyed (A.D. 36). Aretas, taking advantage of the complications of
the times on account of the death of the Emperor Tiberius (A.D. 37),
took possession of Damascus ([Co2 11:32](../kjv/co2011.htm#032.md); compare
[Act 9:25](../kjv/act009.htm#025).md). At this time Paul returned to
Damascus from Arabia.

<span id="003">**Argob**</span> Stony heap, an "island," as it has been
called, of rock about 30 miles by 20, rising 20 or 30 feet above the
table-land of Bashan; a region of crags and chasms wild and rugged in
the extreme. On this "island" stood sixty walled cities, ruled over by
Og. It is called Trachonitis ("the rugged region") in the New Testament
([Luk 3:1](../kjv/luk003.htm#001).md). These cities were conquered by the
Israelites ([Deu 3:4](../kjv/deu003.htm#004.md); [Kg1
4:13](../kjv/kg1004.htm#013).md). It is now called the Lejah. Here "sixty
walled cities are still traceable in a space of 308 square miles. The
architecture is ponderous and massive. Solid walls 4 feet thick, and
stones on one another without cement; the roofs enormous slabs of
basaltic rock, like iron; the doors and gates are of stone 18 inches
thick, secured by ponderous bars. The land bears still the appearance of
having been called the 'land of giants' under the giant Og." "I have
more than once entered a deserted city in the evening, taken possession
of a comfortable house, and spent the night in peace. Many of the houses
in the ancient cities of Bashan are perfect, as if only finished
yesterday. The walls are sound, the roofs unbroken, and even the window
- shutters in their places. These ancient cities of Bashan probably
contain the very oldest specimens of domestic architecture in the world"
(Porter's Giant Cities). (See BASHAN.)

<span id="004">**Arieh**</span> The lion, the name of one of the
body-guard slain with Pekahiah at Samaria ([Kg2
15:25](../kjv/kg2015.htm#025).md) by the conspirator Pekah.

<span id="005">**Ariel**</span> The lion of God. (1.) One of the chief
men sent by Ezra to procure Levites for the sanctuary ([Ezr
8:16](../kjv/ezr008.htm#016)). (2..md) A symbolic name for Jerusalem ([Isa
29:1](../kjv/isa029.htm#001), [Isa 29:2](../kjv/isa029.htm#002.md), [Isa
29:7](../kjv/isa029.htm#007).md) as "victorious under God," and in [Eze
43:15](../kjv/eze043.htm#015), [Eze 43:16](../kjv/eze043.htm#016.md), for
the altar (marg., Heb. 'ariel ) of burnt offerings, the secret of
Israel's lion-like strength.

<span id="006">**Arimathea**</span> A "city of the Jews" ([Luk
23:51](../kjv/luk023.htm#051).md), the birth-place of Joseph in whose
sepulchre our Lord was laid ([Mat 27:57](../kjv/mat027.htm#057.md), [Mat
27:60](../kjv/mat027.htm#060); [Joh 19:38](../kjv/joh019.htm#038).md). It
is probably the same place as Ramathaim in Ephraim, and the birth-place
of Samuel ([Sa1 1:1](../kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md), [Sa1
1:19](../kjv/sa1001.htm#019).md). Others identify it with Ramleh in Dan, or
Rama (q.v.) in Benjamin ([Mat 2:18](../kjv/mat002.htm#018).md).

<span id="007">**Arioch**</span> Lion-like, venerable. (1.) A king of
Ellasar who was confederate with Chedorlamer ([Gen
14:1](../kjv/gen014.htm#001), [Gen 14:9](../kjv/gen014.htm#009).md). The
tablets recently discovered by Mr. Pinches (see CHALDEA) show the true
reading is Eri-Aku of Larsa. This Elamite name meant "servant of the
moon-god." It was afterwards changed into Rimsin, "Have mercy, O
moon-god." (2.) [Dan 2:14](../kjv/dan002.htm#014.md).

<span id="008">**Aristarchus**</span> Best ruler, native of Thessalonica
([Act 20:4](../kjv/act020.htm#004).md), a companion of Paul ([Act
19:29](../kjv/act019.htm#029); [Act 27:2](../kjv/act027.htm#002).md). He
was Paul's "fellow-prisoner" at Rome ([Col 4:10](../kjv/col004.htm#010.md);
[Plm 1:24](../kjv/plm001.htm#024).md).

<span id="009">**Aristobulus**</span> A Roman mentioned in Paul's
Epistle to the Romans ([Rom 16:10](../kjv/rom016.htm#010).md), whose
"household" is greeted.
