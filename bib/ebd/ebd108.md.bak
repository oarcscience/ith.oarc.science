<span id="000">**Drink, Strong**</span> (Heb. shekar ), an intoxicating
liquor ([Jdg 13:4](../kjv/jdg013.htm#004.md); [Luk
1:15](../kjv/luk001.htm#015); [Isa 5:11](../kjv/isa005.htm#011.md); [Mic
2:11](../kjv/mic002.htm#011).md) distilled from corn, honey, or dates. The
effects of the use of strong drink are referred to in [Psa
107:27](../kjv/psa107.htm#027); [Isa 24:20](../kjv/isa024.htm#020.md); [Isa
49:26](../kjv/isa049.htm#026); [Isa 51:17](../kjv/isa051.htm#017.md). Its
use prohibited, [Pro 20:1](../kjv/pro020.htm#001). (See WINE..md)

<span id="001">**Drink-offering**</span> Consisted of wine ([Num
15:5](../kjv/num015.htm#005); [Hos 9:4](../kjv/hos009.htm#004).md) poured
around the altar ([Exo 30:9](../kjv/exo030.htm#009).md). Joined with
meat-offerings ([Num 6:15](../kjv/num006.htm#015.md), [Num
6:17](../kjv/num006.htm#017); [Kg2 16:13](../kjv/kg2016.htm#013.md); [Joe
1:9](../kjv/joe001.htm#009), [Joe 1:13](../kjv/joe001.htm#013.md); [Joe
2:14](../kjv/joe002.htm#014).md), presented daily ([Exo
29:40](../kjv/exo029.htm#040).md), on the Sabbath ([Num
28:9](../kjv/num028.htm#009).md), and on feast-days ([Num
28:14](../kjv/num028.htm#014).md). One-fourth of an hin of wine was
required for one lamb, one-third for a ram, and one-half for a bullock
([Num 15:5](../kjv/num015.htm#005); [Num 28:7](../kjv/num028.htm#007.md),
[Num 28:14](../kjv/num028.htm#014).md). "Drink offerings of blood" ([Psa
16:4](../kjv/psa016.htm#004).md) is used in allusion to the heathen
practice of mingling the blood of animals sacrificed with wine or water,
and pouring out the mixture in the worship of the gods, and the idea
conveyed is that the psalmist would not partake of the abominations of
the heathen.

<span id="002">**Dromedary**</span> ([Isa 60:6](../kjv/isa060.htm#006).md),
an African or Arabian species of camel having only one hump, while the
Bactrian camel has two. It is distinguished from the camel only as a
trained saddle-horse is distinguished from a cart-horse. It is
remarkable for its speed ([Jer 2:23](../kjv/jer002.htm#023).md). Camels are
frequently spoken of in patriarchal times ([Gen
12:16](../kjv/gen012.htm#016); [Gen 24:10](../kjv/gen024.htm#010.md); [Gen
30:43](../kjv/gen030.htm#043); [Gen 31:17](../kjv/gen031.htm#017.md),
etc.). They were used for carrying burdens ([Gen
37:25](../kjv/gen037.htm#025); [Jdg 6:5](../kjv/jdg006.htm#005).md), and
for riding ([Gen 24:64](../kjv/gen024.htm#064).md). The hair of the camel
falls off of itself in spring, and is woven into coarse cloths and
garments ([Mat 3:4](../kjv/mat003.htm#004)). (See CAMEL..md)

<span id="003">**Dropsy**</span> Mentioned only in [Luk
14:2](../kjv/luk014.htm#002.md). The man afflicted with it was cured by
Christ on the Sabbath.

<span id="004">**Dross**</span> The impurities of silver separated from
the one in the process of melting ([Pro 25:4](../kjv/pro025.htm#004.md);
[Pro 26:23](../kjv/pro026.htm#023.md); [Psa
119:119](../kjv/psa119.htm#119).md). It is also used to denote the base
metal itself, probably before it is smelted, in [Isa
1:22](../kjv/isa001.htm#022), [Isa 1:25](../kjv/isa001.htm#025.md).

<span id="005">**Drought**</span> From the middle of May to about the
middle of August the land of Palestine is dry. It is then the "drought
of summer" ([Gen 31:40](../kjv/gen031.htm#040.md); [Psa
32:4](../kjv/psa032.htm#004).md), and the land suffers ([Deu
28:23](../kjv/deu028.htm#023); [Psa 102:4](../kjv/psa102.htm#004).md),
vegetation being preserved only by the dews ([Hag
1:11](../kjv/hag001.htm#011)). (See DEW..md)

<span id="006">**Drown**</span> ([Exo 15:4](../kjv/exo015.htm#004.md); [Amo
8:8](../kjv/amo008.htm#008); [Heb 11:29](../kjv/heb011.htm#029).md).
Drowning was a mode of capital punishment in use among the Syrians, and
was known to the Jews in the time of our Lord. To this he alludes in
[Mat 18:6](../kjv/mat018.htm#006.md).

<span id="007">**Drunk**</span> The first case of intoxication on record
is that of Noah ([Gen 9:21](../kjv/gen009.htm#021).md). The sin of
drunkenness is frequently and strongly condemned ([Rom
13:13](../kjv/rom013.htm#013); [Co1 6:9](../kjv/co1006.htm#009.md), [Co1
6:10](../kjv/co1006.htm#010); [Eph 5:18](../kjv/eph005.htm#018.md); [Th1
5:7](../kjv/th1005.htm#007), [Th1 5:8](../kjv/th1005.htm#008).md). The sin
of drinking to excess seems to have been not uncommon among the
Israelites. The word is used figuratively, when men are spoken of as
being drunk with sorrow, and with the wine of God's wrath ([Isa
63:6](../kjv/isa063.htm#006); [Jer 51:57](../kjv/jer051.htm#057.md); [Eze
23:33](../kjv/eze023.htm#033).md). To "add drunkenness to thirst" ([Deu
29:19](../kjv/deu029.htm#019), A.V..md) is a proverbial expression,
rendered in the Revised Version "to destroy the moist with the dry",
i.e., the well-watered equally with the dry land, meaning that the
effect of such walking in the imagination of their own hearts would be
to destroy one and all.

<span id="008">**Drusilla**</span> Third and youngest daughter of Herod
Agrippa I. ([Act 12:1](../kjv/act012.htm#001.md), [Act
12:20](../kjv/act012.htm#020).md). Felix, the Roman Procurator of Judea,
induced her to leave her husband, Azizus, the king of Emesa, and become
his wife. She was present with Felix when Paul reasoned of
"righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come" ([Act
24:24](../kjv/act024.htm#024).md). She and her son perished in the eruption
of Mount Versuvius, A.D. 79.

<span id="009">**Duke**</span> Derived from the Latin dux , meaning "a
leader;" Arabic, "a sheik." This word is used to denote the phylarch or
chief of a tribe (Gen. 36:15-43; [Exo 15:15](../kjv/exo015.htm#015.md);
[Ch1 1:51](../kjv/ch1001.htm#051).md).
