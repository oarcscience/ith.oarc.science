<span id="000">**Minstrel**</span> ([Mat 9:23](../kjv/mat009.htm#023).md),
a flute-player. Such music was a usual accompaniment of funerals. In
[Kg2 3:15](../kjv/kg2003.htm#015.md) it denotes a player on a stringed
instrument.

<span id="001">**Mint**</span> (Gr. heduosmon , i.e., "having a sweet
smell"), one of the garden herbs of which the Pharisees paid tithes
([Mat 23:23](../kjv/mat023.htm#023.md); [Luk
11:42](../kjv/luk011.htm#042).md). It belongs to the labiate family of
plants. The species most common in Syria is the Mentha sylvestris, the
wild mint, which grows much larger than the garden mint (M. sativa). It
was much used in domestic economy as a condiment, and also as a
medicine. The paying of tithes of mint was in accordance with the Mosaic
law ([Deu 14:22](../kjv/deu014.htm#022).md), but the error of the Pharisees
lay in their being more careful about this little matter of the mint
than about weightier matters.

<span id="002">**Miracle**</span> An event in the external world brought
about by the immediate agency or the simple volition of God, operating
without the use of means capable of being discerned by the senses, and
designed to authenticate the divine commission of a religious teacher
and the truth of his message ([Joh 2:18](../kjv/joh002.htm#018.md); [Mat
12:38](../kjv/mat012.htm#038).md). It is an occurrence at once above nature
and above man. It shows the intervention of a power that is not limited
by the laws either of matter or of mind, a power interrupting the fixed
laws which govern their movements, a supernatural power. "The suspension
or violation of the laws of nature involved in miracles is nothing more
than is constantly taking place around us. One force counteracts
another: vital force keeps the chemical laws of matter in abeyance; and
muscular force can control the action of physical force. When a man
raises a weight from the ground, the law of gravity is neither suspended
nor violated, but counteracted by a stronger force. The same is true as
to the walking of Christ on the water and the swimming of iron at the
command of the prophet. The simple and grand truth that the universe is
not under the exclusive control of physical forces, but that everywhere
and always there is above, separate from and superior to all else, an
infinite personal will, not superseding, but directing and controlling
all physical causes, acting with or without them." God ordinarily
effects his purpose through the agency of second causes; but he has the
power also of effecting his purpose immediately and without the
intervention of second causes, i.e., of invading the fixed order, and
thus of working miracles. Thus we affirm the possibility of miracles,
the possibility of a higher hand intervening to control or reverse
nature's ordinary movements. In the New Testament these four Greek words
are principally used to designate miracles: (1.) Semeion , a "sign",
i.e., an evidence of a divine commission; an attestation of a divine
message ([Mat 12:38](../kjv/mat012.htm#038.md), [Mat
12:39](../kjv/mat012.htm#039); [Mat 16:1](../kjv/mat016.htm#001.md), [Mat
16:4](../kjv/mat016.htm#004); [Mar 8:11](../kjv/mar008.htm#011.md); [Luk
11:16](../kjv/luk011.htm#016); [Luk 23:8](../kjv/luk023.htm#008.md); [Joh
2:11](../kjv/joh002.htm#011), [Joh 2:18](../kjv/joh002.htm#018.md), [Joh
2:23](../kjv/joh002.htm#023); [Act 6:8](../kjv/act006.htm#008), etc..md); a
token of the presence and working of God; the seal of a higher power.
(2.) Terata , "wonders;" wonder-causing events; portents; producing
astonishment in the beholder ([Act 2:19](../kjv/act002.htm#019)). (3..md)
Dunameis , "might works;" works of superhuman power ([Act
2:22](../kjv/act002.htm#022); [Rom 15:19](../kjv/rom015.htm#019.md); [Th2
2:9](../kjv/th2002.htm#009)); of a new and higher power. (4..md) Erga ,
"works;" the works of Him who is "wonderful in working" ([Joh
5:20](../kjv/joh005.htm#020), [Joh 5:36](../kjv/joh005.htm#036).md).
Miracles are seals of a divine mission. The sacred writers appealed to
them as proofs that they were messengers of God. Our Lord also appealed
to miracles as a conclusive proof of his divine mission ([Joh
5:20](../kjv/joh005.htm#020), [Joh 5:36](../kjv/joh005.htm#036.md); [Joh
10:25](../kjv/joh010.htm#025), [Joh 10:38](../kjv/joh010.htm#038).md).
Thus, being out of the common course of nature and beyond the power of
man, they are fitted to convey the impression of the presence and power
of God. Where miracles are there certainly God is. The man, therefore,
who works a miracle affords thereby clear proof that he comes with the
authority of God; they are his credentials that he is God's messenger.
The teacher points to these credentials, and they are a proof that he
speaks with the authority of God. He boldly says, "God bears me witness,
both with signs and wonders, and with diverse miracles." The credibility
of miracles is established by the evidence of the senses on the part of
those who are witnesses of them, and to all others by the testimony of
such witnesses. The witnesses were competent, and their testimony is
trustworthy. Unbelievers, following Hume, deny that any testimony can
prove a miracle, because they say miracles are impossible. We have shown
that miracles are possible, and surely they can be borne witness to.
Surely they are credible when we have abundant and trustworthy evidence
of their occurrence. They are credible just as any facts of history well
authenticated are credible. Miracles, it is said, are contrary to
experience. Of course they are contrary to our experience, but that does
not prove that they were contrary to the experience of those who
witnessed them. We believe a thousand facts, both of history and of
science, that are contrary to our experience, but we believe them on the
ground of competent testimony. An atheist or a pantheist must, as a
matter of course, deny the possibility of miracles; but to one who
believes in a personal God, who in his wisdom may see fit to interfere
with the ordinary processes of nature, miracles are not impossible, nor
are they incredible. (See Table Miracles Recorded in the Old Testament
and Table Miracles Recorded in the Gospels.)

<span id="003">**Miriam**</span> Their rebellion. (1.) The sister of
Moses and Aaron ([Exo 2:4](../kjv/exo002.htm#004.md); 1 Chr, [Ch1
6:3](../kjv/ch1006.htm#003).md). Her name is prominent in the history of
the Exodus. She is called "the prophetess" ([Exo
15:20](../kjv/exo015.htm#020).md). She took the lead in the song of triumph
after the passage of the Red Sea. She died at Kadesh during the second
encampment at that place, toward the close of the wanderings in the
wilderness, and was buried there ([Num 20:1](../kjv/num020.htm#001).md).
(See AARON; MOSES.) (2.) [Ch1 4:17](../kjv/ch1004.htm#017.md), one of the
descendants of Judah.

<span id="004">**Misdeem**</span> [Deu 32:27](../kjv/deu032.htm#027.md),
R.V.). The Authorized Version reads, "should behave themselves
strangely;" i.e., not recognize the truth, misunderstand or mistake the
cause of Israel's ruin, which was due to the fact that God had forsaken
them on account of their apostasy.

<span id="005">**Misgab**</span> Height, a town of Moab, or simply, the
height = the citadel, some fortress so called; or perhaps a general name
for the highlands of Moab, as some think ([Jer
48:1](../kjv/jer048.htm#001)). In [Isa 25:12](../kjv/isa025.htm#012.md),
the word is rendered "high fort."

<span id="006">**Mishael**</span> Who is like God! (1.) A Levite; the
eldest of the three sons of Uzziel ([Exo 6:22](../kjv/exo006.htm#022).md).
(2.) One of the three Hebrew youths who were trained with Daniel in
Babylon ([Dan 1:11](../kjv/dan001.htm#011.md), [Dan
1:19](../kjv/dan001.htm#019).md), and promoted to the rank of Magi. He and
his companions were afterwards cast into the burning fiery furnace for
refusing to worship the idol the king had set up, from which they were
miraculously delivered (Dan. 3:13-30). His Chaldean name was Meshach
(q.v.).

<span id="007">**Mishal**</span> A city of the tribe of Asher ([Jos
21:30](../kjv/jos021.htm#030); [Ch1 6:74](../kjv/ch1006.htm#074).md). It is
probably the modern Misalli, on the shore near Carmel.

<span id="008">**Misham**</span> Their cleansing or their beholding, a
Benjamite, one of the sons of Elpaal ([Ch1
8:12](../kjv/ch1008.htm#012).md).

<span id="009">**Misheal**</span> [Jos 19:26](../kjv/jos019.htm#026).md), a
town of Asher, probably the same as Mishal.
