<span id="000">**Moloch**</span> King, the name of the national god of
the Ammonites, to whom children were sacrificed by fire. He was the
consuming and destroying and also at the same time the purifying fire.
In [Amo 5:26](../kjv/amo005.htm#026.md), "your Moloch" of the Authorized
Version is "your king" in the Revised Version (Compare [Act
7:43](../kjv/act007.htm#043).md). Solomon ([Kg1
11:7](../kjv/kg1011.htm#007).md) erected a high place for this idol on the
Mount of Olives, and from that time till the days of Josiah his worship
continued ([Kg2 23:10](../kjv/kg2023.htm#010.md), [Kg2
23:13](../kjv/kg2023.htm#013).md). In the days of Jehoahaz it was partially
restored, but after the Captivity wholly disappeared. He is also called
Molech ([Lev 18:21](../kjv/lev018.htm#021.md); [Lev
20:2](../kjv/lev020.htm#002), etc..md), Milcom ([Kg1
11:5](../kjv/kg1011.htm#005), [Kg1 11:33](../kjv/kg1011.htm#033), etc..md),
and Malcham ([Zep 1:5](../kjv/zep001.htm#005).md). This god became Chemosh
among the Moabites.

<span id="001">**Money**</span> Of uncoined money the first notice we
have is in the history of Abraham ([Gen 13:2](../kjv/gen013.htm#002.md);
[Gen 20:16](../kjv/gen020.htm#016); [Gen 24:35](../kjv/gen024.htm#035).md).
Next, this word is used in connection with the purchase of the cave of
Machpelah ([Gen 23:16](../kjv/gen023.htm#016).md), and again in connection
with Jacob's purchase of a field at Shalem ([Gen
33:18](../kjv/gen033.htm#018), [Gen 33:19](../kjv/gen033.htm#019).md) for
"an hundred pieces of money" = an hundred Hebrew kesitahs (q.v.), i.e.,
probably pieces of money, as is supposed, bearing the figure of a lamb.
The history of Joseph affords evidence of the constant use of money,
silver of a fixed weight. This appears also in all the subsequent
history of the Jewish people, in all their internal as well as foreign
transactions. There were in common use in trade silver pieces of a
definite weight, shekels, half-shekels, and quarter-shekels. But these
were not properly coins, which are pieces of metal authoritatively
issued, and bearing a stamp. Of the use of coined money we have no early
notice among the Hebrews. The first mentioned is of Persian coinage, the
daric ([Ezr 2:69](../kjv/ezr002.htm#069.md); [Neh
7:70](../kjv/neh007.htm#070).md) and the 'adarkon ([Ezr
8:27](../kjv/ezr008.htm#027)). The daric (q.v..md) was a gold piece current
in Palestine in the time of Cyrus. As long as the Jews, after the Exile,
lived under Persian rule, they used Persian coins. These gave place to
Greek coins when Palestine came under the dominion of the Greeks (331
B.C.), the coins consisting of gold, silver, and copper pieces. The
usual gold pieces were staters (q.v.), and the silver coins tetradrachms
and drachmas. In the year 140 B.C., Antiochus VII. gave permission to
Simon the Maccabee to coin Jewish money. Shekels (q.v.) were then coined
bearing the figure of the almond rod and the pot of manna.

<span id="002">**Money-changer**</span> ([Mat
21:12](../kjv/mat021.htm#012); [Mar 11:15](../kjv/mar011.htm#015.md); [Joh
2:15](../kjv/joh002.htm#015).md). Every Israelite from twenty years and
upwards had to pay ([Exo 30:13](../kjv/exo030.htm#013).md) into the sacred
treasury half a shekel every year as an offering to Jehovah, and that in
the exact Hebrew half-shekel piece. There was a class of men, who
frequented the temple courts, who exchanged at a certain premium foreign
moneys for these half-shekels to the Jews who came up to Jerusalem from
all parts of the world. (See PASSOVER.) When our Lord drove the
traffickers out of the temple, these money-changers fared worst. Their
tables were overturned and they themselves were expelled.

<span id="003">**Month**</span> Among the Egyptians the month of thirty
days each was in use long before the time of the Exodus, and formed the
basis of their calculations. From the time of the institution of the
Mosaic law the month among the Jews was lunar. The cycle of religious
feasts depended on the moon. The commencement of a month was determined
by the observation of the new moon. The number of months in the year was
usually twelve ([Kg1 4:7](../kjv/kg1004.htm#007.md); [Ch1
27:1](../kjv/ch1027.htm#001).md); but every third year an additional month
(ve-Adar) was inserted, so as to make the months coincide with the
seasons. "The Hebrews and Phoenicians had no word for month save 'moon,'
and only saved their calendar from becoming vague like that of the
Moslems by the interpolation of an additional month. There is no
evidence at all that they ever used a true solar year such as the
Egyptians possessed. The latter had twelve months of thirty days and
five epagomenac or odd days.", Palestine Quarterly, January 1889. See

<span id="004">**Moon**</span> Heb. yareah, from its paleness ([Ezr
6:15](../kjv/ezr006.htm#015).md), and lebanah, the "white" ([Sol
6:10](../kjv/sol006.htm#010); [Isa 24:23](../kjv/isa024.htm#023).md), was
appointed by the Creator to be with the sun "for signs, and for seasons,
and for days, and years" ([Gen 1:14](../kjv/gen001.htm#014).md). A lunation
was among the Jews the period of a month, and several of their festivals
were held on the day of the new moon. It is frequently referred to along
with the sun ([Jos 10:12](../kjv/jos010.htm#012.md); [Psa
72:5](../kjv/psa072.htm#005), [Psa 72:7](../kjv/psa072.htm#007.md), [Psa
72:17](../kjv/psa072.htm#017); [Psa 89:36](../kjv/psa089.htm#036.md), [Psa
89:37](../kjv/psa089.htm#037); [Ecc 12:2](../kjv/ecc012.htm#002.md); [Isa
24:23](../kjv/isa024.htm#023), etc..md), and also by itself ([Psa
8:3](../kjv/psa008.htm#003); [Psa 121:6](../kjv/psa121.htm#006).md). The
great brilliance of the moon in Eastern countries led to its being early
an object of idolatrous worship ([Deu 4:19](../kjv/deu004.htm#019.md); [Deu
17:3](../kjv/deu017.htm#003); [Job 31:26](../kjv/job031.htm#026).md), a
form of idolatry against which the Jews were warned ([Deu
4:19](../kjv/deu004.htm#019); [Deu 17:3](../kjv/deu017.htm#003).md). They,
however, fell into this idolatry, and offered incense ([Kg2
23:5](../kjv/kg2023.htm#005); [Jer 8:2](../kjv/jer008.htm#002).md), and
also cakes of honey, to the moon ([Jer 7:18](../kjv/jer007.htm#018.md);
[Jer 44:17](../kjv/jer044.htm#017), [Jer 44:25](../kjv/jer044.htm#025).md).

<span id="005">**Mordecai**</span> The son of Jair, of the tribe of
Benjamin. It has been alleged that he was carried into captivity with
Jeconiah, and hence that he must have been at least one hundred and
twenty-nine years old in the twelfth year of Ahasuerus (Xerxes). But the
words of Esther do not necessarily lead to this conclusion. It was
probably Kish of whom it is said ([Est 2:6](../kjv/est002.htm#006).md) that
he "had been carried away with the captivity." He resided at Susa, the
metropolis of Persia. He adopted his cousin Hadassah (Esther), an orphan
child, whom he tenderly brought up as his own daughter. When she was
brought into the king's harem and made queen in the room of the deposed
queen Vashti, he was promoted to some office in the court of Ahasuerus,
and was one of those who "sat in the king's gate" ([Est
2:21](../kjv/est002.htm#021).md). While holding this office, he discovered
a plot of the eunuchs to put the king to death, which, by his vigilance,
was defeated. His services to the king in this matter were duly recorded
in the royal chronicles. Haman (q.v.) the Agagite had been raised to the
highest position at court. Mordecai refused to bow down before him; and
Haman, being stung to the quick by the conduct of Mordecai, resolved to
accomplish his death in a wholesale destruction of the Jewish exiles
throughout the Persian empire ([Est 3:8](../kjv/est003.htm#008).md).
Tidings of this cruel scheme soon reached the ears of Mordecai, who
communicated with Queen Esther regarding it, and by her wise and bold
intervention the scheme was frustrated. The Jews were delivered from
destruction, Mordecai was raised to a high rank, and Haman was executed
on the gallows he had by anticipation erected for Mordecai (Esther
6:2-7:10). In memory of the signal deliverance thus wrought for them,
the Jews to this day celebrate the feast ([Est
9:26](../kjv/est009.htm#026)) of Purim (q.v..md).

<span id="006">**Moreh**</span> An archer, teacher; fruitful. (1.) A
Canaanite probably who inhabited the district south of Shechem, between
Mounts Ebal and Gerizim, and gave his name to the "plain" there ([Gen
12:6](../kjv/gen012.htm#006)). Here at this "plain," or rather (R.V..md)
"oak," of Moreh, Abraham built his first altar in the land of Palestine;
and here the Lord appeared unto him. He afterwards left this plain and
moved southward, and pitched his tent between Bethel on the west and Hai
on the east ([Gen 12:7](../kjv/gen012.htm#007.md), [Gen
12:8](../kjv/gen012.htm#008).md).

<span id="007">**Moreh, The Hill of**</span> Probably identical with
"little Hermon," the modern Jebel ed-Duhy, or perhaps one of the lower
spurs of this mountain. It is a gray ridge parallel to Gilboa on the
north; and between the two lay the battle-field, the plain of Jezreel
(q.v.), where Gideon overthrew the Midianites ([Jdg
7:1](../kjv/jdg007.htm#001).md).

<span id="008">**Moresheth-gath**</span> Possession of the wine-press,
the birthplace of the prophet Micah ([Mic 1:14](../kjv/mic001.htm#014).md),
who is called the "Morasthite" ([Jer 26:18](../kjv/jer026.htm#018).md).
This place was probably a suburb of Gath.

<span id="009">**Moriah**</span> The chosen of Jehovah. Some contend
that Mount Gerizim is meant, but most probably we are to regard this as
one of the hills of Jerusalem. Here Solomon's temple was built, on the
spot that had been the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite ([Sa2
24:24](../kjv/sa2024.htm#024), [Sa2 24:25](../kjv/sa2024.htm#025.md); [Ch2
3:1](../kjv/ch2003.htm#001).md). It is usually included in Zion, to the
north-east of which it lay, and from which it was separated by the
Tyropoean valley. This was "the land of Moriah" to which Abraham went to
offer up his son Isaac ([Gen 22:2](../kjv/gen022.htm#002).md). It has been
supposed that the highest point of the temple hill, which is now covered
by the Mohammedan Kubbetes-Sakhrah, or "Dome of the Rock," is the actual
site of Araunah's threshing-floor. Here also, one thousand years after
Abraham, David built an altar and offered sacrifices to God. (See
JERUSALEM; NUMBERING THE PEOPLE.)
