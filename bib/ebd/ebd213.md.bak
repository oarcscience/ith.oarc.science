<span id="000">**Judah, Kingdom of**</span> When the disruption took
place at Shechem, at first only the tribe of Judah followed the house of
David. But very soon after the tribe of Benjamin joined the tribe of
Judah, and Jerusalem became the capital of the new kingdom ([Jos
18:28](../kjv/jos018.htm#028).md), which was called the kingdom of Judah.
It was very small in extent, being only about the size of the Scottish
county of Perth. For the first sixty years the kings of Judah aimed at
re-establishing their authority over the kingdom of the other ten
tribes, so that there was a state of perpetual war between them. For the
next eighty years there was no open war between them. For the most part
they were in friendly alliance, co-operating against their common
enemies, especially against Damascus. For about another century and a
half Judah had a somewhat checkered existence after the termination of
the kingdom of Israel till its final overthrow in the destruction of the
temple (588 B.C.) by Nebuzar-adan, who was captain of Nebuchadnezzar's
body-guard ([Kg2 25:8](../kjv/kg2025.htm#008).md). The kingdom maintained a
separate existence for three hundred and eighty-nine years. It occupied
an area of 3,435 square miles. (See ISRAEL, KINGDOM OF.)

<span id="001">**Judas**</span> The Graecized form of Judah. (1.) The
patriarch ([Mat 1:2](../kjv/mat001.htm#002.md), [Mat
1:3](../kjv/mat001.htm#003)). (2..md) Son of Simon ([Joh
6:71](../kjv/joh006.htm#071); [Joh 13:2](../kjv/joh013.htm#002.md), [Joh
13:26](../kjv/joh013.htm#026).md), surnamed Iscariot, i.e., a man of
Kerioth ([Jos 15:25](../kjv/jos015.htm#025).md). His name is uniformly the
last in the list of the apostles, as given in the synoptic (i.e., the
first three) Gospels. The evil of his nature probably gradually unfolded
itself till "Satan entered into him" ([Joh
13:27](../kjv/joh013.htm#027).md), and he betrayed our Lord ([Joh
18:3](../kjv/joh018.htm#003).md). Afterwards he owned his sin with "an
exceeding bitter cry," and cast the money he had received as the wages
of his iniquity down on the floor of the sanctuary, and "departed and
went and hanged himself" ([Mat 27:5](../kjv/mat027.htm#005).md). He
perished in his guilt, and "went unto his own place" ([Act
1:25](../kjv/act001.htm#025).md). The statement in [Act
1:18](../kjv/act001.htm#018.md) that he "fell headlong and burst asunder in
the midst, and all his bowels gushed out," is in no way contrary to that
in [Mat 27:5](../kjv/mat027.htm#005.md). The suicide first hanged himself,
perhaps over the valley of Hinnom, "and the rope giving way, or the
branch to which he hung breaking, he fell down headlong on his face, and
was crushed and mangled on the rocky pavement below." Why such a man was
chosen to be an apostle we know not, but it is written that "Jesus knew
from the beginning who should betray him" ([Joh
6:64](../kjv/joh006.htm#064).md). Nor can any answer be satisfactorily
given to the question as to the motives that led Judas to betray his
Master. "Of the motives that have been assigned we need not care to fix
on any one as that which simply led him on. Crime is, for the most part,
the result of a hundred motives rushing with bewildering fury through
the mind of the criminal." (3.) A Jew of Damascus ([Act
9:11](../kjv/act009.htm#011).md), to whose house Ananias was sent. The
street called "Straight" in which it was situated is identified with the
modern "street of bazaars," where is still pointed out the so-called
"house of Judas." (4.) A Christian teacher, surnamed Barsabas. He was
sent from Jerusalem to Antioch along with Paul and Barnabas with the
decision of the council ([Act 15:22](../kjv/act015.htm#022.md), [Act
15:27](../kjv/act015.htm#027), [Act 15:32](../kjv/act015.htm#032).md). He
was a "prophet" and a "chief man among the brethren."

<span id="002">**Jude**</span> =Judas Among the apostles there were two
who bore this name, (1.) Judas ([Jde 1:1](../kjv/jde001.htm#001.md); [Mat
13:55](../kjv/mat013.htm#055); [Joh 14:22](../kjv/joh014.htm#022.md); [Act
1:13](../kjv/act001.htm#013).md), called also Lebbaeus or Thaddaeus ([Mat
10:3](../kjv/mat010.htm#003); [Mar 3:18](../kjv/mar003.htm#018).md); and
(2.) Judas Iscariot ([Mat 10:4](../kjv/mat010.htm#004.md); [Mar
3:19](../kjv/mar003.htm#019).md). He who is called "the brother of James"
([Luk 6:16](../kjv/luk006.htm#016).md), may be the same with the Judas
surnamed Lebbaeus. The only thing recorded regarding him is in [Joh
14:22](../kjv/joh014.htm#022.md).

<span id="003">**Jude, Epistle of**</span> The author was "Judas, the
brother of James" the Less ([Jde 1:1](../kjv/jde001.htm#001).md), called
also Lebbaeus ([Mat 10:3](../kjv/mat010.htm#003).md) and Thaddaeus ([Mar
3:18](../kjv/mar003.htm#018).md). The genuineness of this epistle was early
questioned, and doubts regarding it were revived at the time of the
Reformation; but the evidences in support of its claims are complete. It
has all the marks of having proceeded from the writer whose name it
bears. There is nothing very definite to determine the time and place at
which it was written. It was apparently written in the later period of
the apostolic age, for when it was written there were persons still
alive who had heard the apostles preach ([Jde
1:17](../kjv/jde001.htm#017).md). It may thus have been written about A.D.
66 or 70, and apparently in Palestine. The epistle is addressed to
Christians in general ([Jde 1:1](../kjv/jde001.htm#001).md), and its design
is to put them on their guard against the misleading efforts of a
certain class of terrorists to which they were exposed. The style of the
epistle is that of an "impassioned invective, in the impetuous whirlwind
of which the writer is hurried along, collecting example after example
of divine vengeance on the ungodly; heaping epithet upon epithet, and
piling image upon image, and, as it were, labouring for words and images
strong enough to depict the polluted character of the licentious
apostates against whom he is warning the Church; returning again and
again to the subject, as though all language was insufficient to give an
adequate idea of their profligacy, and to express his burning hatred of
their perversion of the doctrines of the gospel." The striking
resemblance this epistle bears to 2 Peter suggests the idea that the
author of the one had seen the epistle of the other. The doxology with
which the epistle concludes is regarded as the finest in the New
Testament.

<span id="004">**Judea**</span> After the Captivity this name was
applied to the whole of the country west of the Jordan ([Hag
1:1](../kjv/hag001.htm#001), [Hag 1:14](../kjv/hag001.htm#014.md); [Hag
2:2](../kjv/hag002.htm#002).md). But under the Romans, in the time of
Christ, it denoted the southernmost of the three divisions of Palestine
([Mat 2:1](../kjv/mat002.htm#001), [Mat 2:5](../kjv/mat002.htm#005.md);
[Mat 3:1](../kjv/mat003.htm#001); [Mat 4:25](../kjv/mat004.htm#025).md),
although it was also sometimes used for Palestine generally ([Act
28:21](../kjv/act028.htm#021).md). The province of Judea, as distinguished
from Galilee and Samaria, included the territories of the tribes of
Judah, Benjamin, Dan, Simeon, and part of Ephraim. Under the Romans it
was a part of the province of Syria, and was governed by a procurator.

<span id="005">**Judge**</span> (Heb. shophet , pl. shophetim ),
properly a magistrate or ruler, rather than one who judges in the sense
of trying a cause. This is the name given to those rulers who presided
over the affairs of the Israelites during the interval between the death
of Joshua and the accession of Saul ([Jdg 2:18](../kjv/jdg002.htm#018).md),
a period of general anarchy and confusion. "The office of judges or
regents was held during life, but it was not hereditary, neither could
they appoint their successors. Their authority was limited by the law
alone, and in doubtful cases they were directed to consult the divine
King through the priest by Urim and Thummim ([Num
27:21](../kjv/num027.htm#021).md). Their authority extended only over those
tribes by whom they had been elected or acknowledged. There was no
income attached to their office, and they bore no external marks of
dignity. The only cases of direct divine appointment are those of Gideon
and Samson, and the latter stood in the peculiar position of having been
from before his birth ordained 'to begin to deliver Israel.' Deborah was
called to deliver Israel, but was already a judge. Samuel was called by
the Lord to be a prophet but not a judge, which ensued from the high
gifts the people recognized as dwelling in him; and as to Eli, the
office of judge seems to have devolved naturally or rather ex officio
upon him." Of five of the judges, Tola ([Jdg
10:1](../kjv/jdg010.htm#001)), Jair ([Jdg 10:3](../kjv/jdg010.htm#003).md),
Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon ([Jdg 12:8](../kjv/jdg012.htm#008).md), we have no
record at all beyond the bare fact that they were judges. Sacred history
is not the history of individuals but of the kingdom of God in its
onward progress. In [Exo 2:14](../kjv/exo002.htm#014.md) Moses is so
styled. This fact may indicate that while for revenue purposes the
"taskmasters" were over the people, they were yet, just as at a later
time when under the Romans, governed by their own rulers.

<span id="006">**Judges, Book of**</span> Is so called because it
contains the history of the deliverance and government of Israel by the
men who bore the title of the "judges." The book of Ruth originally
formed part of this book, but about A.D. 450 it was separated from it
and placed in the Hebrew scriptures immediately after the Song of
Solomon. The book contains, (1.) An introduction (Judg. 1 - 3:6),
connecting it with the previous narrative in Joshua, as a "link in the
chain of books." (2.) The history of the thirteen judges (Judg. 3:7 -
16:31) see table: Thirteen Judges Years FIRST PERIOD (Judg. 3:7 - 5)

periods 410 Samson's exploits probably synchronize with the period
immediately preceding the national repentance and reformation under
Samuel ([Sa1 7:2](../kjv/sa1007.htm#002).md). After Samson came Eli, who
was both high priest and judge. He directed the civil and religious
affairs of the people for forty years, at the close of which the
Philistines again invaded the land and oppressed it for twenty years.
Samuel was raised up to deliver the people from this oppression, and he
judged Israel for some twelve years, when the direction of affairs fell
into the hands of Saul, who was anointed king. If Eli and Samuel are
included, there were then fifteen judges. But the chronology of this
whole period is uncertain. (3.) The historic section of the book is
followed by an appendix (Judg. 17 - 21), which has no formal connection
with that which goes before. It records (a) the conquest ([Jdg
17:1](../kjv/jdg017.htm#001), 18.md) of Laish by a portion of the tribe of
Dan; and (b) the almost total extinction of the tribe of Benjamin by the
other tribes, in consequence of their assisting the men of Gibeah (Judg.
19 - 21). This section properly belongs to the period only a few years
after the death of Joshua. It shows the religious and moral degeneracy
of the people. The author of this book was most probably Samuel. The
internal evidence both of the first sixteen chapters and of the appendix
warrants this conclusion. It was probably composed during Saul's reign,
or at the very beginning of David's. The words in [Jdg
18:30](../kjv/jdg018.htm#030), [Jdg 18:31](../kjv/jdg018.htm#031.md), imply
that it was written after the taking of the ark by the Philistines, and
after it was set up at Nob ([Sa1 21:1](../kjv/sa1021.htm#001).md). In
David's reign the ark was at Gibeon ([Ch1 16:39](../kjv/ch1016.htm#039).md)

<span id="007">**Judgment Hall**</span> Gr. praitorion ([Joh
18:28](../kjv/joh018.htm#028), [Joh 18:33](../kjv/joh018.htm#033.md); [Joh
19:9](../kjv/joh019.htm#009); [Mat 27:27](../kjv/mat027.htm#027).md),
"common hall." In all these passages the Revised Version renders
"palace." In [Mar 15:16](../kjv/mar015.htm#016.md) the word is rendered
"Praetorium" (q.v.), which is a Latin word, meaning literally the
residence of the praetor, and then the governor's residence in general,
though not a praetor. Throughout the Gospels the word "praitorion" has
this meaning (Compare [Act 23:35](../kjv/act023.htm#035).md). Pilate's
official residence when he was in Jerusalem was probably a part of the
fortress of Antonia. The trial of our Lord was carried on in a room or
office of the palace. The "whole band" spoken of by Mark were gathered
together in the palace court.

<span id="008">**Judgment, The final**</span> The sentence that will be
passed on our actions at the last day (Matt. 25; [Rom
14:10](../kjv/rom014.htm#010), [Rom 14:11](../kjv/rom014.htm#011.md); [Co2
5:10](../kjv/co2005.htm#010); [Th2 1:7](../kjv/th2001.htm#007).md). The
judge is Jesus Christ, as mediator. All judgment is committed to him
([Act 17:31](../kjv/act017.htm#031); [Joh 5:22](../kjv/joh005.htm#022.md),
[Joh 5:27](../kjv/joh005.htm#027); [Rev 1:7](../kjv/rev001.htm#007).md).
"It pertains to him as mediator to complete and publicly manifest the
salvation of his people and the overthrow of his enemies, together with
the glorious righteousness of his work in both respects." The persons to
be judged are, (1.) the whole race of Adam without a single exception
(Matt. 25:31-46; [Co1 15:51](../kjv/co1015.htm#051.md), [Co1
15:52](../kjv/co1015.htm#052); [Rev 20:11](../kjv/rev020.htm#011).md); and
(2.) the fallen angels ([Pe2 2:4](../kjv/pe2002.htm#004.md); [Jde
1:6](../kjv/jde001.htm#006).md). The rule of judgment is the standard of
God's law as revealed to men, the heathen by the law as written on their
hearts ([Luk 12:47](../kjv/luk012.htm#047.md), [Luk
12:48](../kjv/luk012.htm#048); [Rom 2:12](../kjv/rom002.htm#012).md); the
Jew who "sinned in the law shall be judged by the law" ([Rom
2:12](../kjv/rom002.htm#012).md); the Christian enjoying the light of
revelation, by the will of God as made known to him ([Mat
11:20](../kjv/mat011.htm#020); [Joh 3:19](../kjv/joh003.htm#019).md). Then
the secrets of all hearts will be brought to light ([Co1
4:5](../kjv/co1004.htm#005); [Luk 8:17](../kjv/luk008.htm#017.md); [Luk
12:2](../kjv/luk012.htm#002), [Luk 12:3](../kjv/luk012.htm#003).md) to
vindicate the justice of the sentence pronounced. The time of the
judgment will be after the resurrection ([Heb
9:27](../kjv/heb009.htm#027); [Act 17:31](../kjv/act017.htm#031).md). As
the Scriptures represent the final judgment "as certain \[[Ecc
11:9](../kjv/ecc011.htm#009.md)\], universal \[[Co2
5:10](../kjv/co2005.htm#010.md)\], righteous \[[Rom
2:5](../kjv/rom002.htm#005.md)\], decisive \[[Co1
15:52](../kjv/co1015.htm#052.md)\], and eternal as to its consequences
\[[Heb 6:2](../kjv/heb006.htm#002.md)\], let us be concerned for the
welfare of our immortal interests, flee to the refuge set before us,
improve our precious time, depend on the merits of the Redeemer, and
adhere to the dictates of the divine word, that we may be found of him
in peace."

<span id="009">**Judgments of God**</span> (1.) The secret decisions of
God's will ([Psa 110:5](../kjv/psa110.htm#005.md); [Psa
36:6](../kjv/psa036.htm#006)). (2..md) The revelations of his will ([Exo
21:1](../kjv/exo021.htm#001); [Deu 6:20](../kjv/deu006.htm#020.md); Ps.
119:7-175). (3.) The infliction of punishment on the wicked ([Exo
6:6](../kjv/exo006.htm#006); [Exo 12:12](../kjv/exo012.htm#012.md); [Eze
25:11](../kjv/eze025.htm#011); [Rev 16:7](../kjv/rev016.htm#007).md), such
as is mentioned in Gen. 7; [Gen 19:24](../kjv/gen019.htm#024.md), [Gen
19:25](../kjv/gen019.htm#025); [Jdg 1:6](../kjv/jdg001.htm#006.md), [Jdg
1:7](../kjv/jdg001.htm#007); [Act 5:1](../kjv/act005.htm#001.md), etc.
