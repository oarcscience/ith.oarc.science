<span id="000">**Pelethites**</span> Mentioned always along with the
Cherethites, and only in the time of David. The word probably means
"runners" or "couriers," and may denote that while forming part of
David's bodyguard, they were also sometimes employed as couriers ([Sa2
8:18](../kjv/sa2008.htm#018); [Sa2 20:7](../kjv/sa2020.htm#007.md), [Sa2
20:23](../kjv/sa2020.htm#023); [Kg1 1:38](../kjv/kg1001.htm#038.md), [Kg1
1:44](../kjv/kg1001.htm#044); [Ch1 18:17](../kjv/ch1018.htm#017).md). Some,
however, think that these are the names simply of two Philistine tribes
from which David selected his body-guard. They are mentioned along with
the Gittites ([Sa2 15:18](../kjv/sa2015.htm#018).md), another body of
foreign troops whom David gathered round him.

<span id="001">**Pelicans**</span> Are frequently met with at the waters
of Merom and the Sea of Galilee. The pelican is ranked among unclean
birds ([Lev 11:18](../kjv/lev011.htm#018.md); [Deu
14:17](../kjv/deu014.htm#017).md). It is of an enormous size, being about 6
feet long, with wings stretching out over 12 feet. The Hebrew name
(kaath, i.e., "vomiter") of this bird is incorrectly rendered
"cormorant" in the Authorized Version of [Isa
34:11](../kjv/isa034.htm#011) and [Zep 2:14](../kjv/zep002.htm#014.md), but
correctly in the Revised Version. It receives its Hebrew name from its
habit of storing in its pouch large quantities of fish, which it
disgorges when it feeds its young. Two species are found on the Syrian
coast, the Pelicanus onocrotalus, or white pelican, and the Pelicanus
crispus, or Dalmatian pelican.

<span id="002">**Penny**</span> (Gr. denarion ), a silver coin of the
value of about 7 1/2d. or 8d. of our present money. It is thus rendered
in the New Testament, and is more frequently mentioned than any other
coin ([Mat 18:28](../kjv/mat018.htm#028.md); [Mat
20:2](../kjv/mat020.htm#002), [Mat 20:9](../kjv/mat020.htm#009.md), [Mat
20:13](../kjv/mat020.htm#013); [Mar 6:37](../kjv/mar006.htm#037.md); [Mar
14:5](../kjv/mar014.htm#005), etc..md). It was the daily pay of a Roman
soldier in the time of Christ. In the reign of Edward III. an English
penny was a labourer's day's wages. This was the "tribute money" with
reference to which our Lord said, "Whose image and superscription is
this?" When they answered, "Caesar's," he replied, "Render therefore to
Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are
God's" ([Mat 22:19](../kjv/mat022.htm#019.md); [Mar
12:15](../kjv/mar012.htm#015).md).

<span id="003">**Pentateuch**</span> The five-fold volume, consisting of
the first five books of the Old Testament. This word does not occur in
Scripture, nor is it certainly known when the roll was thus divided into
five portions Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. Probably
that was done by the LXX. translators. Some modern critics speak of a
Hexateuch, introducing the Book of Joshua as one of the group. But this
book is of an entirely different character from the other books, and has
a different author. It stands by itself as the first of a series of
historical books beginning with the entrance of the Israelites into
Canaan. (See JOSHUA.) The books composing the Pentateuch are properly
but one book, the "Law of Moses," the "Book of the Law of Moses," the
"Book of Moses," or, as the Jews designate it, the "Torah" or "Law."
That in its present form it "proceeds from a single author is proved by
its plan and aim, according to which its whole contents refer to the
covenant concluded between Jehovah and his people, by the
instrumentality of Moses, in such a way that everything before his time
is perceived to be preparatory to this fact, and all the rest to be the
development of it. Nevertheless, this unity has not been stamped upon it
as a matter of necessity by the latest redactor: it has been there from
the beginning, and is visible in the first plan and in the whole
execution of the work.", Keil, Einl. i. d. A. T. A certain school of
critics have set themselves to reconstruct the books of the Old
Testament. By a process of "scientific study" they have discovered that
the so-called historical books of the Old Testament are not history at
all, but a miscellaneous collection of stories, the inventions of many
different writers, patched together by a variety of editors! As regards
the Pentateuch, they are not ashamed to attribute fraud, and even
conspiracy, to its authors, who sought to find acceptance to their work
which was composed partly in the age of Josiah, and partly in that of
Ezra and Nehemiah, by giving it out to be the work of Moses! This is not
the place to enter into the details of this controversy. We may say
frankly, however, that we have no faith in this "higher criticism." It
degrades the books of the Old Testament below the level of fallible
human writings, and the arguments on which its speculations are built
are altogether untenable. The evidences in favour of the Mosaic
authorship of the Pentateuch are conclusive. We may thus state some of
them briefly:, (1.) These books profess to have been written by Moses in
the name of God ([Exo 17:14](../kjv/exo017.htm#014.md); [Exo
24:3](../kjv/exo024.htm#003), [Exo 24:4](../kjv/exo024.htm#004.md), [Exo
24:7](../kjv/exo024.htm#007); [Exo 32:7](../kjv/exo032.htm#007.md), [Exo
32:30](../kjv/exo032.htm#030); [Exo 34:27](../kjv/exo034.htm#027.md); [Lev
26:46](../kjv/lev026.htm#046); [Lev 27:34](../kjv/lev027.htm#034.md); [Deu
31:9](../kjv/deu031.htm#009), [Deu 31:24](../kjv/deu031.htm#024.md), [Deu
31:25](../kjv/deu031.htm#025)). (2..md) This also is the uniform and
persistent testimony of the Jews of all sects in all ages and countries
(Compare [Jos 8:31](../kjv/jos008.htm#031.md), [Jos
8:32](../kjv/jos008.htm#032); [Kg1 2:3](../kjv/kg1002.htm#003.md); [Jer
7:22](../kjv/jer007.htm#022); [Ezr 6:18](../kjv/ezr006.htm#018.md); [Neh
8:1](../kjv/neh008.htm#001); [Mal 4:4](../kjv/mal004.htm#004.md); [Mat
22:24](../kjv/mat022.htm#024); [Act 15:21](../kjv/act015.htm#021)). (3..md)
Our Lord plainly taught the Mosaic authorship of these books ([Mat
5:17](../kjv/mat005.htm#017), [Mat 5:18](../kjv/mat005.htm#018.md); [Mat
19:8](../kjv/mat019.htm#008); [Mat 22:31](../kjv/mat022.htm#031.md), [Mat
22:32](../kjv/mat022.htm#032); [Mat 23:2](../kjv/mat023.htm#002.md); [Mar
10:9](../kjv/mar010.htm#009); [Mar 12:26](../kjv/mar012.htm#026.md); [Luk
16:31](../kjv/luk016.htm#031); [Luk 20:37](../kjv/luk020.htm#037.md); [Luk
24:26](../kjv/luk024.htm#026), [Luk 24:27](../kjv/luk024.htm#027.md), [Luk
24:44](../kjv/luk024.htm#044); [Joh 3:14](../kjv/joh003.htm#014.md); [Joh
5:45](../kjv/joh005.htm#045), [Joh 5:46](../kjv/joh005.htm#046.md), [Joh
5:47](../kjv/joh005.htm#047); [Joh 6:32](../kjv/joh006.htm#032.md), [Joh
6:49](../kjv/joh006.htm#049); [Joh 7:19](../kjv/joh007.htm#019.md), [Joh
7:22](../kjv/joh007.htm#022).md). In the face of this fact, will any one
venture to allege either that Christ was ignorant of the composition of
the Bible, or that, knowing the true state of the case, he yet
encouraged the people in the delusion they clung to? (4.) From the time
of Joshua down to the time of Ezra there is, in the intermediate
historical books, a constant reference to the Pentateuch as the "Book of
the Law of Moses." This is a point of much importance, inasmuch as the
critics deny that there is any such reference; and hence they deny the
historical character of the Pentateuch. As regards the Passover, e.g.,
we find it frequently spoken of or alluded to in the historical books
following the Pentateuch, showing that the "Law of Moses" was then
certainly known. It was celebrated in the time of Joshua ([Jos
5:10](../kjv/jos005.htm#010), cf. [Jos 4:19](../kjv/jos004.htm#019).md),
Hezekiah (2 Chr. 30), Josiah (2 Kings 23; 2 Chr. 35), and Zerubbabel
([Ezr 6:19](../kjv/ezr006.htm#019).md), and is referred to in such passages
as [Kg2 23:22](../kjv/kg2023.htm#022.md); [Ch2
35:18](../kjv/ch2035.htm#018); [Kg1 9:25](../kjv/kg1009.htm#025.md) ("three
times in a year"); [Ch2 8:13](../kjv/ch2008.htm#013.md). Similarly we might
show frequent references to the Feast of Tabernacles and other Jewish
institutions, although we do not admit that any valid argument can be
drawn from the silence of Scripture in such a case. An examination of
the following texts, [Kg1 2:9](../kjv/kg1002.htm#009.md); [Kg2
14:6](../kjv/kg2014.htm#006); [Ch2 23:18](../kjv/ch2023.htm#018.md); [Ch2
25:4](../kjv/ch2025.htm#004); [Ch2 34:14](../kjv/ch2034.htm#014.md); [Ezr
3:2](../kjv/ezr003.htm#002); [Ezr 7:6](../kjv/ezr007.htm#006.md); [Dan
9:11](../kjv/dan009.htm#011), [Dan 9:13](../kjv/dan009.htm#013.md), will
also plainly show that the "Law of Moses" was known during all these
centuries. Granting that in the time of Moses there existed certain oral
traditions or written records and documents which he was divinely led to
make use of in his history, and that his writing was revised by inspired
successors, this will fully account for certain peculiarities of
expression which critics have called "anachronisms" and
"contradictions," but in no way militates against the doctrine that
Moses was the original author of the whole of the Pentateuch. It is not
necessary for us to affirm that the whole is an original composition;
but we affirm that the evidences clearly demonstrate that Moses was the
author of those books which have come down to us bearing his name. The
Pentateuch is certainly the basis and necessary preliminary of the whole
of the Old Testament history and literature. (See DEUTERONOMY.)

<span id="004">**Pentecost**</span> I.e., "fiftieth", found only in the
New Testament ([Act 2:1](../kjv/act002.htm#001.md); [Act
20:16](../kjv/act020.htm#016); [Co1 16:8](../kjv/co1016.htm#008).md). The
festival so named is first spoken of in [Exo
23:16](../kjv/exo023.htm#016.md) as "the feast of harvest," and again in
[Exo 34:22](../kjv/exo034.htm#022.md) as "the day of the firstfruits" ([Num
28:26](../kjv/num028.htm#026).md). From the sixteenth of the month of Nisan
(the second day of the Passover), seven complete weeks, i.e., forty-nine
days, were to be reckoned, and this feast was held on the fiftieth day.
The manner in which it was to be kept is described in [Lev
23:15](../kjv/lev023.htm#015); [Num 28:27](../kjv/num028.htm#027.md).
Besides the sacrifices prescribed for the occasion, every one was to
bring to the Lord his "tribute of a free-will offering" ([Deu
16:9](../kjv/deu016.htm#009).md). The purpose of this feast was to
commemorate the completion of the grain harvest. Its distinguishing
feature was the offering of "two leavened loaves" made from the new corn
of the completed harvest, which, with two lambs, were waved before the
Lord as a thank offering. The day of Pentecost is noted in the Christian
Church as the day on which the Spirit descended upon the apostles, and
on which, under Peter's preaching, so many thousands were converted in
Jerusalem (Acts 2).

<span id="005">**Penuel**</span> Face of God, a place not far from
Succoth, on the east of the Jordan and north of the river Jabbok. It is
also called "Peniel." Here Jacob wrestled ([Gen
32:24](../kjv/gen032.htm#024).md) "with a man" ("the angel", [Hos
12:4](../kjv/hos012.htm#004.md). Jacob says of him, "I have seen God face
to face") "till the break of day." A town was afterwards built there
([Jdg 8:8](../kjv/jdg008.htm#008); [Kg1 12:25](../kjv/kg1012.htm#025).md).
The men of this place refused to succour Gideon and his little army when
they were in pursuit of the Midianites (Judg. 8:1-21). On his return,
Gideon slew the men of this city and razed its lofty watch-tower to the
ground.

<span id="006">**Peor**</span> Opening. (1.) A mountain peak ([Num
23:28](../kjv/num023.htm#028).md) to which Balak led Balaam as a last
effort to induce him to pronounce a curse upon Israel. When he looked on
the tribes encamped in the acacia groves below him, he could not refrain
from giving utterance to a remarkable benediction ([Num
24:1](../kjv/num024.htm#001).md). Balak was more than ever enraged at
Balaam, and bade him flee for his life. But before he went he gave
expression to that wonderful prediction regarding the future of this
mysterious people, whose "goodly tents" were spread out before him, and
the coming of a "Star" out of Jacob and a "Scepter" out of Israel ([Num
24:14](../kjv/num024.htm#014)). (2..md) A Moabite divinity, called also
"Baal-peor" ([Num 25:3](../kjv/num025.htm#003.md), [Num
25:5](../kjv/num025.htm#005), [Num 25:18](../kjv/num025.htm#018.md);
compare [Deu 3:29](../kjv/deu003.htm#029).md).

<span id="007">**Perazim, Mount**</span> Mount of breaches, only in [Isa
28:21](../kjv/isa028.htm#021). It is the same as BAAL-PERAZIM (q.v..md),
where David gained a victory over the Philistines ([Sa2
5:20](../kjv/sa2005.htm#020).md).

<span id="008">**Peres**</span> Divided, one of the mysterious words
"written over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall" of
king Belshazzar's palace ([Dan 5:28](../kjv/dan005.htm#028).md). (See
MENE.)

<span id="009">**Perez**</span> =Pharez (q.v.), breach, the son of Judah
([Neh 11:4](../kjv/neh011.htm#004).md). "The chief of all the captains of
the host for the first month" in the reign of David was taken from his
family ([Ch1 27:3](../kjv/ch1027.htm#003).md). Four hundred and sixty-eight
of his "sons" came back from captivity with Zerubbabel, who himself was
one of them ([Ch1 9:4](../kjv/ch1009.htm#004.md); [Neh
11:6](../kjv/neh011.htm#006).md).
