<span id="000">**Leviticus**</span> The third book of the Pentateuch; so
called in the Vulgate, after the LXX., because it treats chiefly of the
Levitical service. In the first section of the book (Lev. 1 - 17), which
exhibits the worship itself, there is, (1.) A series of laws (Lev. 1 -
7) regarding sacrifices, burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, and
thank-offerings (Lev. 1 - 3), sin-offerings and trespass-offerings (Lev.
4; 5), followed by the law of the priestly duties in connection with the
offering of sacrifices (Lev. 6; 7). (2.) An historical section (Lev. 8 -
10), giving an account of the consecration of Aaron and his sons (Lev.
8); Aaron's first offering for himself and the people (Lev. 9); Nadab
and Abihu's presumption in offering "strange fire before Jehovah," and
their punishment (Lev. 10). (3.) Laws concerning purity, and the
sacrifices and ordinances for putting away impurity (Lev. 11 - 16). An
interesting fact may be noted here. Canon Tristram, speaking of the
remarkable discoveries regarding the flora and fauna of the Holy Land by
the Palestine Exploration officers, makes the following statement: "Take
these two catalogues of the clean and unclean animals in the books of
Leviticus \[11\] and Deuteronomy \[14\]. There are eleven in Deuteronomy
which do not occur in Leviticus, and these are nearly all animals and
birds which are not found in Egypt or the Holy Land, but which are
numerous in the Arabian desert. They are not named in Leviticus a few
weeks after the departure from Egypt; but after the people were
thirty-nine years in the desert they are named, a strong proof that the
list in Deuteronomy was written at the end of the journey, and the list
in Leviticus at the beginning. It fixes the writing of that catalogue to
one time and period only, viz., that when the children of Israel were
familiar with the fauna and the flora of the desert" (Palest. Expl.
Quart., Jan. 1887). (4.) Laws marking the separation between Israel and
the heathen (Lev. 17 - 20). (5.) Laws about the personal purity of the
priests, and their eating of the holy things (Lev. 20; 21); about the
offerings of Israel, that they were to be without blemish (Lev.
22:17-33); and about the due celebration of the great festivals (Lev.
23; 25). (6.) Then follow promises and warnings to the people regarding
obedience to these commandments, closing with a section on vows. The
various ordinances contained in this book were all delivered in the
space of a month (Compare [Exo 40:17](../kjv/exo040.htm#017.md); [Num
1:1](../kjv/num001.htm#001).md), the first month of the second year after
the Exodus. It is the third book of Moses. No book contains more of the
very words of God. He is almost throughout the whole of it the direct
speaker. This book is a prophecy of things to come, a shadow whereof the
substance is Christ and his kingdom. The principles on which it is to be
interpreted are laid down in the Epistle to the Hebrews. It contains in
its complicated ceremonial the gospel of the grace of God.

<span id="001">**Levy**</span> ([Kg1 4:6](../kjv/kg1004.htm#006.md), R.V.;
[Kg1 5:13](../kjv/kg1005.htm#013).md), forced service. The service of
tributaries was often thus exacted by kings. Solomon raised a "great
levy" of 30,000 men, about two per cent. of the population, to work for
him by courses on Lebanon. Adoram ([Kg1 12:18](../kjv/kg1012.htm#018).md)
presided over this forced labour service (Ger. Frohndienst; Fr. corvee).

<span id="002">**Lewdness**</span> ([Act 18:14](../kjv/act018.htm#014).md),
villainy or wickedness, not lewdness in the modern sense of the word.
The word "lewd" is from the Saxon, and means properly "ignorant,"
"unlearned," and hence low, vicious ([Act 17:5](../kjv/act017.htm#005).md).

<span id="003">**Libertine**</span> Found only [Act
6:9](../kjv/act006.htm#009.md), one who once had been a slave, but who had
been set at liberty, or the child of such a person. In this case the
name probably denotes those descendants of Jews who had been carried
captives to Rome as prisoners of war by Pompey and other Roman generals
in the Syrian wars, and had afterwards been liberated. In A.D. 19 these
manumitted Jews were banished from Rome. Many of them found their way to
Jerusalem, and there established a synagogue.

<span id="004">**Libnah**</span> Transparency; whiteness. (1.) One of
the stations of the Israelites in the wilderness ([Num
33:20](../kjv/num033.htm#020), [Num 33:21](../kjv/num033.htm#021)). (2..md)
One of the royal cities of the Canaanites taken by Joshua ([Jos
10:29](../kjv/jos010.htm#029); [Jos 12:15](../kjv/jos012.htm#015).md). It
became one of the Levitical towns in the tribe of Judah ([Jos
21:13](../kjv/jos021.htm#013).md), and was strongly fortified. Sennacherib
laid siege to it ([Kg2 19:8](../kjv/kg2019.htm#008.md); [Isa
37:8](../kjv/isa037.htm#008).md). It was the native place of Hamutal, the
queen of Josiah ([Kg2 23:31](../kjv/kg2023.htm#031).md). It stood near
Lachish, and has been identified with the modern Arak el-Menshiyeh.

<span id="005">**Libni**</span> White, one of the two sons of Gershon,
the son of Levi ([Exo 6:17](../kjv/exo006.htm#017.md); [Num
3:18](../kjv/num003.htm#018), [Num 3:21](../kjv/num003.htm#021).md).

<span id="006">**Libya**</span> The country of the Ludim ([Gen
10:13](../kjv/gen010.htm#013).md), Northern Africa, a large tract lying
along the Mediterranean, to the west of Egypt ([Act
2:10](../kjv/act002.htm#010).md). Cyrene was one of its five cities.

<span id="007">**Lice**</span> (Heb. kinnim ), the creatures employed in
the third plague sent upon Egypt ([Exo 8:16](../kjv/exo008.htm#016).md).
They were miraculously produced from the dust of the land. "The
entomologists Kirby and Spence place these minute but disgusting insects
in the very front rank of those which inflict injury upon man. A
terrible list of examples they have collected of the ravages of this and
closely allied parasitic pests." The plague of lice is referred to in
[Psa 105:31](../kjv/psa105.htm#031.md). Some have supposed that the word
denotes not lice properly, but gnats. Others, with greater probability,
take it to mean the "tick" which is much larger than lice.

<span id="008">**Lie**</span> An intentional violation of the truth.
Lies are emphatically condemned in Scripture ([Joh
8:44](../kjv/joh008.htm#044); [Ti1 1:9](../kjv/ti1001.htm#009.md), [Ti1
1:10](../kjv/ti1001.htm#010); [Rev 21:27](../kjv/rev021.htm#027.md); [Rev
22:15](../kjv/rev022.htm#015).md). Mention is made of the lies told by good
men, as by Abraham ([Gen 12:12](../kjv/gen012.htm#012.md), [Gen
12:13](../kjv/gen012.htm#013); [Gen 20:2](../kjv/gen020.htm#002).md), Isaac
([Gen 26:7](../kjv/gen026.htm#007).md), and Jacob ([Gen
27:24](../kjv/gen027.htm#024).md); also by the Hebrew midwives ([Exo
1:15](../kjv/exo001.htm#015).md), by Michal ([Sa1
19:14](../kjv/sa1019.htm#014).md), and by David ([Sa1
20:6](../kjv/sa1020.htm#006)). (See ANANIAS..md)

<span id="009">**Lieutenant**</span> (only in A.V. [Est
3:12](../kjv/est003.htm#012); [Est 8:9](../kjv/est008.htm#009.md); [Est
9:3](../kjv/est009.htm#003); [Ezr 8:36](../kjv/ezr008.htm#036).md), a
governor or viceroy of a Persian province having both military and civil
power. Correctly rendered in the Revised Version "satrap."
