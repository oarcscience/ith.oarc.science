<span id="000">**Rithmah**</span> Wild broom, a station in the
wilderness ([Num 33:18](../kjv/num033.htm#018), [Num
33:19](../kjv/num033.htm#019)), the "broom valley," or "valley of broom
bushes," the place apparently of the original encampment of Israel, near
Kadesh.

<span id="001">**River**</span> (1.) Heb. 'aphik , properly the channel
or ravine that holds water ([Sa2 22:16](../kjv/sa2022.htm#016)),
translated "brook," "river," "stream," but not necessarily a perennial
stream ([Eze 6:3](../kjv/eze006.htm#003); [Eze
31:12](../kjv/eze031.htm#012); [Eze 32:6](../kjv/eze032.htm#006); [Eze
34:13](../kjv/eze034.htm#013)). (2.) Heb. nahal , in winter a "torrent,"
in summer a "wady" or valley ([Gen 32:23](../kjv/gen032.htm#023); [Deu
2:24](../kjv/deu002.htm#024); [Deu 3:16](../kjv/deu003.htm#016); [Isa
30:28](../kjv/isa030.htm#028); [Lam 2:18](../kjv/lam002.htm#018); [Eze
47:9](../kjv/eze047.htm#009)). These winter torrents sometimes come down
with great suddenness and with desolating force. A distinguished
traveler thus describes his experience in this matter:, "I was encamped
in Wady Feiran , near the base of Jebel Serbal, when a tremendous
thunderstorm burst upon us. After little more than an hour's rain, the
water rose so rapidly in the previously dry wady that I had to run for
my life, and with great difficulty succeeded in saving my tent and
goods; my boots, which I had not time to pick up, were washed away. In
less than two hours a dry desert wady upwards of 300 yards broad was
turned into a foaming torrent from 8 to 10 feet deep, roaring and
tearing down and bearing everything upon it, tangled masses of
tamarisks, hundreds of beautiful palm trees, scores of sheep and goats,
camels and donkeys, and even men, women, and children, for a whole
encampment of Arabs was washed away a few miles above me. The storm
commenced at five in the evening; at half-past nine the waters were
rapidly subsiding, and it was evident that the flood had spent its
force." (Compare [Mat 7:27](../kjv/mat007.htm#027); [Luk
6:49](../kjv/luk006.htm#049).) (3.) Nahar , a "river" continuous and
full, a perennial stream, as the Jordan, the Euphrates ([Gen
2:10](../kjv/gen002.htm#010); [Gen 15:18](../kjv/gen015.htm#018); [Deu
1:7](../kjv/deu001.htm#007); [Psa 66:6](../kjv/psa066.htm#006); [Eze
10:15](../kjv/eze010.htm#015)). (4.) Tel'alah , a conduit, or
water-course ([Kg1 18:32](../kjv/kg1018.htm#032); [Kg2
18:17](../kjv/kg2018.htm#017); [Kg2 20:20](../kjv/kg2020.htm#020); [Job
38:25](../kjv/job038.htm#025); [Eze 31:4](../kjv/eze031.htm#004)). (5.)
Peleg , properly "waters divided", i.e., streams divided, throughout the
land ([Psa 1:3](../kjv/psa001.htm#003)); "the rivers \[i.e.,
'divisions'\] of waters" ([Job 20:17](../kjv/job020.htm#017); [Job
29:6](../kjv/job029.htm#006); [Pro 5:16](../kjv/pro005.htm#016)). (6.)
Ye'or , i.e., "great river", probably from an Egyptian word ( Aur ),
commonly applied to the Nile ([Gen 41:1](../kjv/gen041.htm#001)), but
also to other rivers ([Job 28:10](../kjv/job028.htm#010); [Isa
33:21](../kjv/isa033.htm#021)). (7.) Yubhal , "a river" ([Jer
17:8](../kjv/jer017.htm#008)), a full flowing stream. (8.) 'Ubhal , "a
river" ([Dan 8:2](../kjv/dan008.htm#002)).

<span id="002">**River of Egypt**</span> (1.) Heb. nahar mitsraim ,
denotes in [Gen 15:18](../kjv/gen015.htm#018) the Nile, or its eastern
branch ([Ch2 9:26](../kjv/ch2009.htm#026)). (2.) In [Num
34:5](../kjv/num034.htm#005) (R.V., "brook of Egypt") the Hebrew word is
nahal, denoting a stream flowing rapidly in winter, or in the rainy
season. This is a desert stream on the borders of Egypt. It is now
called the Wady el-'Arish . The present boundary between Egypt and
Palestine is about midway between this wady and Gaza. (See [Num
34:5](../kjv/num034.htm#005); [Jos 15:4](../kjv/jos015.htm#004), [Jos
15:47](../kjv/jos015.htm#047); [Kg1 8:65](../kjv/kg1008.htm#065); [Kg2
24:7](../kjv/kg2024.htm#007); [Isa 27:12](../kjv/isa027.htm#012); [Eze
47:19](../kjv/eze047.htm#019). In all these passages the R.V. has
"brook" and the A.V. "river.")

<span id="003">**River of Gad**</span> Probably the Arno ([Sa2
24:5](../kjv/sa2024.htm#005)).

<span id="004">**River of God**</span> ([Psa
65:9](../kjv/psa065.htm#009)), as opposed to earthly streams, denoting
that the divine resources are inexhaustible, or the sum of all
fertilizing streams that water the earth ([Gen
2:10](../kjv/gen002.htm#010)).

<span id="005">**Rivers of Babylon**</span> ([Psa
137:1](../kjv/psa137.htm#001)), i.e., of the whole country of Babylonia,
e.g., the Tigris, Euphrates, Chalonas, the Ulai, and the numerous
canals.

<span id="006">**Rivers of Damascus**</span> The Abana and Pharpar ([Kg2
5:12](../kjv/kg2005.htm#012)).

<span id="007">**Rivers of Judah**</span> ([Joe
3:18](../kjv/joe003.htm#018)), the watercourses of Judea.

<span id="008">**Rizpah**</span> Coal; hot stone, the daughter of Aiah,
and one of Saul's concubines. She was the mother of Armoni and
Mephibosheth ([Sa2 3:7](../kjv/sa2003.htm#007); [Sa2
21:8](../kjv/sa2021.htm#008), [Sa2 21:10](../kjv/sa2021.htm#010), [Sa2
21:11](../kjv/sa2021.htm#011)). It happened that a grievous famine,
which lasted for three years, fell upon the land during the earlier half
of David's reign at Jerusalem. This calamity was sent "for Saul and for
his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites." David inquired of the
Gibeonites what satisfaction they demanded, and was answered that
nothing would compensate for the wrong Saul had done to them but the
death of seven of Saul's sons. David accordingly delivered up to them
the two sons of Rizpah and five of the sons of Merab (q.v.), Saul's
eldest daughter, whom she bore to Adriel. These the Gibeonites put to
death, and hung up their bodies before the Lord at the sanctuary at
Gibeah. Rizpah thereupon took her place on the rock of Gibeah (q.v.),
and for five months watched the suspended bodies of her children, to
prevent them from being devoured by the beasts and birds of prey, till
they were at length taken down and buried by David. Her marriage to
Abner was the occasion of a quarrel between him and Ishbosheth, which
led to Abner's going over to the side of David ([Sa2
3:17](../kjv/sa2003.htm#017)).

<span id="009">**Road**</span> ([Sa1 27:10](../kjv/sa1027.htm#010);
R.V., "raid"), an inroad, an incursion. This word is never used in
Scripture in the sense of a way or path.
