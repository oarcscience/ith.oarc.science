<span id="000">**Tirhakah**</span> The last king of Egypt of the
Ethiopian (the fifteenth) dynasty. He was the brother-in-law of So
(q.v.). He probably ascended the throne about 692 B.C., having been
previously king of Ethiopia ([Kg2 19:9](../kjv/kg2019.htm#009.md); [Isa
37:9](../kjv/isa037.htm#009).md), which with Egypt now formed one nation.
He was a great warrior, and but little is known of him. The Assyrian
armies under Esarhaddon, and again under Assur-bani-pal, invaded Egypt
and defeated Tirhakah, who afterwards retired into Ethiopia, where he
died, after reigning twenty-six years.

<span id="001">**Tirshatha**</span> A word probably of Persian origin,
meaning "severity," denoting a high civil dignity. The Persian governor
of Judea is so called ([Ezr 2:63](../kjv/ezr002.htm#063.md); [Neh
7:65](../kjv/neh007.htm#065), [Neh 7:70](../kjv/neh007.htm#070).md).
Nehemiah is called by this name in [Neh 8:9](../kjv/neh008.htm#009.md);
[Neh 10:1](../kjv/neh010.htm#001), and the "governor" (pehah.md) in [Neh
5:18](../kjv/neh005.htm#018.md). Probably, therefore, tirshatha = pehah =
the modern pasha.

<span id="002">**Tirza**</span> Pleasantness. (1.) An old royal city of
the Canaanites, which was destroyed by Joshua ([Jos
12:24](../kjv/jos012.htm#024).md). Jeroboam chose it for his residence, and
he removed to it from Shechem, which at first he made the capital of his
kingdom. It remained the chief residence of the kings of Israel till
Omri took Samaria ([Kg1 14:17](../kjv/kg1014.htm#017.md); [Kg1
15:21](../kjv/kg1015.htm#021); [Kg1 16:6](../kjv/kg1016.htm#006.md), [Kg1
16:8](../kjv/kg1016.htm#008), etc..md). Here Zimri perished amid the flames
of the palace to which in his despair he had set fire ([Kg1
16:18](../kjv/kg1016.htm#018).md), and here Menahem smote Shallum ([Kg2
15:14](../kjv/kg2015.htm#014), [Kg2 15:16](../kjv/kg2015.htm#016).md).
Solomon refers to its beauty ([Sol 6:4](../kjv/sol006.htm#004).md). It has
been identified with the modern mud hamlet Teiasir, 11 miles north of
Shechem. Others, however, would identify it with Telluza, a village
about 6 miles east of Samaria. (2.) The youngest of Zelophehad's five
daughters ([Num 26:33](../kjv/num026.htm#033.md); [Jos
17:3](../kjv/jos017.htm#003).md).

<span id="003">**Tishbite**</span> Elijah the prophet was thus named
([Kg1 17:1](../kjv/kg1017.htm#001); [Kg1 21:17](../kjv/kg1021.htm#017.md),
[Kg1 21:28](../kjv/kg1021.htm#028), etc..md). In [Kg1
17:1](../kjv/kg1017.htm#001.md) the word rendered "inhabitants" is in the
original the same as that rendered "Tishbite," hence that verse may be
read as in the LXX., "Elijah the Tishbite of Tishbi in Gilead." Some
interpret this word as meaning "stranger," and read the verse, "Elijah
the stranger from among the strangers in Gilead." This designation is
probably given to the prophet as denoting that his birthplace was
Tishbi, a place in Upper Galilee (mentioned in the apocryphal book of
Tobit), from which for some reason he migrated into Gilead. Josephus,
the Jewish historian (Ant. [Kg1 8:13](../kjv/kg1008.htm#013.md), [Kg1
8:2](../kjv/kg1008.htm#002).md), however, supposes that Tishbi was some
place in the land of Gilead. It has been identified by some with
el-Ishtib, a some place 22 miles due south of the Sea of Galilee, among
the mountains of Gilead.

<span id="004">**Tisri**</span> The first month of the civil year, and
the seventh of the ecclesiastical year. See ETHANIM ([Kg1
8:2](../kjv/kg1008.htm#002).md). Called in the Assyrian inscriptions
Tasaritu, i.e. "beginning."

<span id="005">**Tithe**</span> A tenth of the produce of the earth
consecrated and set apart for special purposes. The dedication of a
tenth to God was recognized as a duty before the time of Moses. Abraham
paid tithes to Melchizedek ([Gen 14:20](../kjv/gen014.htm#020.md); [Heb
7:6](../kjv/heb007.htm#006).md); and Jacob vowed unto the Lord and said,
"Of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee."
The first Mosaic law on this subject is recorded in [Lev
27:30](../kjv/lev027.htm#030.md). Subsequent legislation regulated the
destination of the tithes ([Num 18:21](../kjv/num018.htm#021.md), [Num
18:26](../kjv/num018.htm#026); [Deu 12:5](../kjv/deu012.htm#005.md), [Deu
12:6](../kjv/deu012.htm#006), [Deu 12:11](../kjv/deu012.htm#011.md), [Deu
12:17](../kjv/deu012.htm#017); [Deu 14:22](../kjv/deu014.htm#022.md), [Deu
14:23](../kjv/deu014.htm#023).md). The paying of the tithes was an
important part of the Jewish religious worship. In the days of Hezekiah
one of the first results of the reformation of religion was the
eagerness with which the people brought in their tithes ([Ch2
31:5](../kjv/ch2031.htm#005), [Ch2 31:6](../kjv/ch2031.htm#006).md). The
neglect of this duty was sternly rebuked by the prophets ([Amo
4:4](../kjv/amo004.htm#004); [Mal 3:8](../kjv/mal003.htm#008).md). It
cannot be affirmed that the Old Testament law of tithes is binding on
the Christian Church, nevertheless the principle of this law remains,
and is incorporated in the gospel ([Co1 9:13](../kjv/co1009.htm#013.md),
[Co1 9:14](../kjv/co1009.htm#014).md); and if, as is the case, the motive
that ought to prompt to liberality in the cause of religion and of the
service of God be greater now than in Old Testament times, then
Christians ought to go beyond the ancient Hebrew in consecrating both
themselves and their substance to God. Every Jew was required by the
Levitical law to pay three tithes of his property (1.) one tithe for the
Levites; (2.) one for the use of the temple and the great feasts; and
(3.) one for the poor of the land.

<span id="006">**Tittle**</span> A point, ([Mat
5:18](../kjv/mat005.htm#018); [Luk 16:17](../kjv/luk016.htm#017).md), the
minute point or stroke added to some letters of the Hebrew alphabet to
distinguish them from others which they resemble; hence, the very least
point.

<span id="007">**Titus**</span> Honourable, was with Paul and Barnabas
at Antioch, and accompanied them to the council at Jerusalem ([Gal
2:1](../kjv/gal002.htm#001); [Act 15:2](../kjv/act015.htm#002).md),
although his name nowhere occurs in the Acts of the Apostles. He appears
to have been a Gentile, and to have been chiefly engaged in ministering
to Gentiles; for Paul sternly refused to have him circumcised, inasmuch
as in his case the cause of gospel liberty was at stake. We find him, at
a later period, with Paul and Timothy at Ephesus, whence he was sent by
Paul to Corinth for the purpose of getting the contributions of the
church there in behalf of the poor saints at Jerusalem sent forward
([Co2 8:6](../kjv/co2008.htm#006); [Co2 12:18](../kjv/co2012.htm#018).md).
He rejoined the apostle when he was in Macedonia, and cheered him with
the tidings he brought from Corinth ([Co2 7:6](../kjv/co2007.htm#006).md).
After this his name is not mentioned till after Paul's first
imprisonment, when we find him engaged in the organization of the church
in Crete, where the apostle had left him for this purpose ([Tit
1:5](../kjv/tit001.htm#005).md). The last notice of him is in [Ti2
4:10](../kjv/ti2004.htm#010.md), where we find him with Paul at Rome during
his second imprisonment. From Rome he was sent into Dalmatia, no doubt
on some important missionary errand. We have no record of his death. He
is not mentioned in the Acts.

<span id="008">**Titus, Epistle to**</span> Was probably written about
the same time as the first epistle to Timothy, with which it has many
affinities. "Both letters were addressed to persons left by the writer
to preside in their respective churches during his absence. Both letters
are principally occupied in describing the qualifications to be sought
for in those whom they should appoint to offices in the church; and the
ingredients of this description are in both letters nearly the same.
Timothy and Titus are likewise cautioned against the same prevailing
corruptions, and in particular against the same misdirection of their
cares and studies. This affinity obtains not only in the subject of the
letters, which from the similarity of situation in the persons to whom
they were addressed might be expected to be somewhat alike, but extends
in a great variety of instances to the phrases and expressions. The
writer accosts his two friends with the same salutation, and passes on
to the business of his letter by the same transition (compare [Ti1
1:2](../kjv/ti1001.htm#002), [Ti1 1:3](../kjv/ti1001.htm#003.md) with [Tit
1:4](../kjv/tit001.htm#004), [Tit 1:5](../kjv/tit001.htm#005.md); [Ti1
1:4](../kjv/ti1001.htm#004) with [Tit 1:13](../kjv/tit001.htm#013.md), [Tit
1:14](../kjv/tit001.htm#014); [Tit 3:9](../kjv/tit003.htm#009.md); [Ti1
4:12](../kjv/ti1004.htm#012) with [Tit 2:7](../kjv/tit002.htm#007.md), [Tit
2:15](../kjv/tit002.htm#015).md)." Paley's Horce Paulince. The date of its
composition may be concluded from the circumstance that it was written
after Paul's visit to Crete ([Tit 1:5](../kjv/tit001.htm#005).md). That
visit could not be the one referred to in [Act
27:7](../kjv/act027.htm#007.md), when Paul was on his voyage to Rome as a
prisoner, and where he continued a prisoner for two year. We may
warrantably suppose that after his release Paul sailed from Rome into
Asia and took Crete by the way, and that there he left Titus "to set in
order the things that were wanting." Thence he went to Ephesus, where he
left Timothy, and from Ephesus to Macedonia, where he wrote First
Timothy, and thence to Nicopolis in Epirus, from which place he wrote to
Titus, about A.D. 66 or 67. In the subscription to the epistle it is
said to have been written from "Nicopolis of Macedonia," but no such
place is known. The subscriptions to the epistles are of no authority,
as they are not authentic.

<span id="009">**Tob, The Land of**</span> A district on the east of
Jordan, about 13 miles south-east of the Sea of Galilee, to which
Jephthah fled from his brethren ([Jdg 11:3](../kjv/jdg011.htm#003.md), [Jdg
11:5](../kjv/jdg011.htm#005).md). It was on the northern boundary of Perea,
between Syria and the land of Ammon ([Sa2 10:6](../kjv/sa2010.htm#006.md),
[Sa2 10:8](../kjv/sa2010.htm#008).md). Its modern name is Taiyibeh.
