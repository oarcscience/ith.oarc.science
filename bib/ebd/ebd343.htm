<P><A NAME="000"><B>Sidon</B></A>     Fishing; fishery, <A HREF="../kjv/gen010.htm#015">Gen 10:15</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gen010.htm#019">Gen 10:19</A> (A.V. marg., Tzidon; R.V., Zidon); <A HREF="../kjv/mat011.htm#021">Mat 11:21</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/mat011.htm#022">Mat 11:22</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/luk006.htm#017">Luk 6:17</A>. (See ZIDON.)

<P><A NAME="001"><B>Signet</B></A>     A seal used to attest documents (<A HREF="../kjv/dan006.htm#008">Dan 6:8</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/dan006.htm#012">Dan 6:12</A>). In <A HREF="../kjv/dan006.htm#017">Dan 6:17</A>, this word properly denotes a ring. The impression of a signet ring on fine clay has recently been discovered among the ruins at Nineveh. It bears the name and title of an Egyptian king. Two actual signet rings of ancient Egyptian monarchs (Cheops and Horus) have also been discovered. When digging a shaft close to the south wall of the temple area, the engineers of the Palestine Exploration Fund, at a depth of 12 feet below the surface, came upon a pavement of polished stones, formerly one of the streets of the city. Under this pavement they found a stratum of 16 feet of concrete, and among this concrete, 10 feet down, they found a signet stone bearing the inscription, in Old Hebrew characters, &quot;Haggai, son of Shebaniah.&quot; It has been asked, Might not this be the actual seal of Haggai the prophet? We know that he was in Jerusalem after the Captivity; and it is somewhat singular that he alone of all the minor prophets makes mention of a signet (<A HREF="../kjv/hag002.htm#023">Hag 2:23</A>). (See SEAL.)

<P><A NAME="002"><B>Sihon</B></A>     Striking down. The whole country on the east of Jordan, from the Arnon to the Jabbok, was possessed by the Amorites, whose king, Sihon, refused to permit the Israelites to pass through his territory, and put his army in array against them. The Israelites went forth against him to battle, and gained a complete victory. The Amorites were defeated; Sihon, his sons, and all his people were smitten with the sword, his walled towns were captured, and the entire country of the Amorites was taken possession of by the Israelites (<A HREF="../kjv/num021.htm#021">Num 21:21</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/deu002.htm#024">Deu 2:24</A>). The country from the Jabbok to Hermon was at this time ruled by Og, the last of the Rephaim. He also tried to prevent the progress of the Israelites, but was utterly routed, and all his cities and territory fell into the hands of the Israelites (compare <A HREF="../kjv/num021.htm#033">Num 21:33</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/deu003.htm#001">Deu 3:1</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa135.htm#010">Psa 135:10</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa136.htm#017">Psa 136:17</A>). These two victories gave the Israelites possession of the country on the east of Jordan, from the Arnon to the foot of Hermon. The kingdom of Sihon embraced about 1,500 square miles, while that of Og was more than 3,000 square miles.

<P><A NAME="003"><B>Sihor</B></A>     (Correctly Shihor) Black; dark the name given to the river Nile in <A HREF="../kjv/isa023.htm#003">Isa 23:3</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer002.htm#018">Jer 2:18</A>. In <A HREF="../kjv/jos013.htm#003">Jos 13:3</A> it is probably &quot;the river of Egypt&quot;, i.e., the Wady el-Arish (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1013.htm#005">Ch1 13:5</A>), which flows &quot;before Egypt&quot;, i.e., in a north-easterly direction from Egypt, and enters the sea about 50 miles south-west of Gaza. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Silas</B></A>     Wood, a prominent member of the church at Jerusalem; also called Silvanus. He and Judas, surnamed Barsabas, were chosen by the church there to accompany Paul and Barnabas on their return to Antioch from the council of the apostles and elders (<A HREF="../kjv/act015.htm#022">Act 15:22</A>), as bearers of the decree adopted by the council. He assisted Paul there in his evangelistic labours, and was also chosen by him to be his companion on his second missionary tour (<A HREF="../kjv/act016.htm#019">Act 16:19</A>). He is referred to in the epistles under the name of Silvanus (<A HREF="../kjv/co2001.htm#019">Co2 1:19</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/th1001.htm#001">Th1 1:1</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/th2001.htm#001">Th2 1:1</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/pe1005.htm#012">Pe1 5:12</A>). There is no record of the time or place of his death.

<P><A NAME="005"><B>Silk</B></A>     Heb.  demeshek , &quot;damask,&quot; silk cloth manufactured at Damascus, <A HREF="../kjv/amo003.htm#012">Amo 3:12</A>. A.V., &quot;in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch;&quot; R.V., &quot;in the corner of a couch, and on the silken cushions of a bed&quot; (marg., &quot;in Damascus on a bed&quot;). Heb.  meshi , (<A HREF="../kjv/eze016.htm#010">Eze 16:10</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/eze016.htm#013">Eze 16:13</A>, rendered &quot;silk&quot;). In <A HREF="../kjv/gen041.htm#042">Gen 41:42</A> (marg. A.V.), <A HREF="../kjv/pro031.htm#022">Pro 31:22</A> (R.V., &quot;fine linen&quot;), the word &quot;silk&quot; ought to be &quot;fine linen.&quot; Silk was common in New Testament times (<A HREF="../kjv/rev018.htm#012">Rev 18:12</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Silla</B></A>     A highway; a twig, only in <A HREF="../kjv/kg2012.htm#020">Kg2 12:20</A>. If taken as a proper name (as in the LXX. and other versions), the locality is unknown.

<P><A NAME="007"><B>Siloah, The pool of</B></A>     Heb.  shelah ; i.e., &quot;the dart&quot;, <A HREF="../kjv/neh003.htm#015">Neh 3:15</A>; with the art. shiloah, &quot;sending,&quot; <A HREF="../kjv/isa008.htm#006">Isa 8:6</A> (compare <A HREF="../kjv/isa007.htm#003">Isa 7:3</A>) =Siloam (q.v.). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Siloam, Pool of</B></A>     Sent or sending. Here a notable miracle was wrought by our Lord in giving sight to the blind (<A HREF="../kjv/joh009.htm#007">Joh 9:7</A>). It has been identified with the Birket Silwan in the lower Tyropoeon valley, to the south-east of the hill of Zion. The water which flows into this pool intermittently by a subterranean channel springs from the &quot;Fountain of the Virgin&quot; (q.v.). The length of this channel, which has several windings, is 1,750 feet, though the direct distance is only 1,100 feet. The pool is 53 feet in length from north to south, 18 feet wide, and 19 deep. The water passes from it by a channel cut in the rock into the gardens below. (See EN-ROGEL.) Many years ago (1880) a youth, while wading up the conduit by which the water enters the pool, accidentally discovered an inscription cut in the rock, on the eastern side, about 19 feet from the pool. This is the oldest extant Hebrew record of the kind. It has with great care been deciphered by scholars, and has been found to be an account of the manner in which the tunnel was constructed. Its whole length is said to be &quot;twelve hundred cubits;&quot; and the inscription further notes that the workmen, like the excavators of the Mont Cenis Tunnel, excavated from both ends, meeting in the middle. Some have argued that the inscription was cut in the time of Solomon; others, with more probability, refer it to the reign of Hezekiah. A more ancient tunnel was discovered in 1889 some 20 feet below the ground. It is of smaller dimensions, but more direct in its course. It is to this tunnel that Isaiah (<A HREF="../kjv/isa008.htm#006">Isa 8:6</A>) probably refers. The Siloam inscription above referred to was surreptitiously cut from the wall of the tunnel in 1891 and broken into fragments. These were, however, recovered by the efforts of the British Consul at Jerusalem, and have been restored to their original place.

<P><A NAME="009"><B>Siloam, Tower of</B></A>     Mentioned only <A HREF="../kjv/luk013.htm#004">Luk 13:4</A>. The place here spoken of is the village now called Silwan, or Kefr Silwan, on the east of the valley of Kidron, and to the north-east of the pool. It stands on the west slope of the Mount of Olives. As illustrative of the movement of small bands of Canaanites from place to place, and the intermingling of Canaanites and Israelites even in small towns in earlier times, M.C. Ganneau records the following curious fact: &quot;Among the inhabitants of the village (of Siloam) there are a hundred or so domiciled for the most part in the lower quarter, and forming a group apart from the rest, called Dhiabrye, i.e., men of Dhiban. It appears that at some remote period a colony from the capital of king Mesha (Dibon-Moab) crossed the Jordan and fixed itself at the gates of Jerusalem at Silwan. The memory of this migration is still preserved; and I am assured by the people themselves that many of their number are installed in other villages round Jerusalem&quot; (quoted by Henderson, Palestine).
