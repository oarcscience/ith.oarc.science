<span id="000">**Amalekite**</span> A tribe that dwelt in Arabia
Petraea, between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea. They were not the
descendants of Amalek, the son of Eliphaz, for they existed in the days
of Abraham ([Gen 14:7](../kjv/gen014.htm#007).md). They were probably a
tribe that migrated from the shores of the Persian Gulf and settled in
Arabia. They dwelt in the land of the south...from Havilah until thou
comest to Shur' ([Num 13:29](../kjv/num013.htm#029.md); [Sa1
15:7](../kjv/sa1015.htm#007).md). They were a pastoral, and hence a nomadic
race. Their kings bore the hereditary name of Agag ([Num
24:7](../kjv/num024.htm#007); [Sa1 15:8](../kjv/sa1015.htm#008).md). They
attempted to stop the Israelites when they marched through their
territory ([Deu 25:18](../kjv/deu025.htm#018).md), attacking them at
Rephidim ([Exo 17:8](../kjv/exo017.htm#008.md); compare [Deu
25:17](../kjv/deu025.htm#017); [Sa1 15:2](../kjv/sa1015.htm#002).md). They
afterwards attacked the Israelites at Hormah ([Num
14:45](../kjv/num014.htm#045).md). We read of them subsequently as in
league with the Moabites ([Jdg 3:13](../kjv/jdg003.htm#013).md) and the
Midianites ([Jdg 6:3](../kjv/jdg006.htm#003).md). Saul finally desolated
their territory and destroyed their power ([Sa1
14:48](../kjv/sa1014.htm#048); [Sa1 15:3](../kjv/sa1015.htm#003).md), and
David recovered booty from them ([Sa1 30:18](../kjv/sa1030.htm#018).md). In
the Babylonian inscriptions they are called Sute, in those of Egypt
Sittiu, and the Amarna tablets include them under the general name of
Khabbati, or 'plunderers.'

<span id="001">**Amana**</span> Perennial. (1.) The Hebrew margin of
[Kg2 5:12](../kjv/kg2005.htm#012.md) gives this as another reading of Abana
(q.v.), a stream near Damascus. (2.) A mountain ([Sol
4:8](../kjv/sol004.htm#008).md), probably the southern summit of
Anti-Libanus, at the base of which are the sources of the Abana.

<span id="002">**Amariah**</span> Said by Jehovah. (1.) One of the
descendants of Aaron by Eleazar ([Ch1 6:7](../kjv/ch1006.htm#007.md), [Ch1
6:52](../kjv/ch1006.htm#052).md). He was probably the last of the high
priests of Eleazar's line prior to the transfer of that office to Eli,
of the line of Ithamar. (2.) A Levite, son of Hebron, of the lineage of
Moses ([Ch1 23:19](../kjv/ch1023.htm#019.md); [Ch1
24:23](../kjv/ch1024.htm#023)). (3..md) A 'chief priest' who took an active
part in the reformation under Jehoshaphat ([Ch2
19:11](../kjv/ch2019.htm#011).md); probably the same as mentioned in [Ch1
6:9](../kjv/ch1006.htm#009). (4.) [Ch1 6:11](../kjv/ch1006.htm#011.md);
[Ezr 7:3](../kjv/ezr007.htm#003). (5..md) One of the high priests in the
time of Hezekiah ([Ch2 31:15](../kjv/ch2031.htm#015)). (6..md) [Zep
1:1](../kjv/zep001.htm#001). (7.) [Neh 11:4](../kjv/neh011.htm#004.md).
(8.) [Neh 10:3](../kjv/neh010.htm#003). (9..md) [Ezr
10:42](../kjv/ezr010.htm#042.md).

<span id="003">**Amasa**</span> Burden. (1.) The son of Abigail, a
sister of king David ([Ch1 2:17](../kjv/ch1002.htm#017.md); [Sa2
17:25](../kjv/sa2017.htm#025).md). He was appointed by David to command the
army in room of his cousin Joab ([Sa2 19:13](../kjv/sa2019.htm#013).md),
who afterwards treacherously put him to death as a dangerous rival ([Sa2
20:4](../kjv/sa2020.htm#004)). (2..md) A son of Hadlai, and chief of
Ephraim ([Ch2 28:12](../kjv/ch2028.htm#012).md) in the reign of Ahaz.

<span id="004">**Amasai**</span> Burdensome. (1.) A Levite, son of
Elkanah, of the ancestry of Samuel ([Ch1 6:25](../kjv/ch1006.htm#025.md),
[Ch1 6:35](../kjv/ch1006.htm#035)). (2..md) The leader of a body of men who
joined David in the "stronghold," probably of Adullam ([Ch1
12:18](../kjv/ch1012.htm#018)). (3..md) One of the priests appointed to
precede the ark with blowing of trumpets on its removal from the house
of Obed-edom ([Ch1 15:24](../kjv/ch1015.htm#024)). (4..md) The father of a
Levite, one of the two Kohathites who took a prominent part at the
instance of Hezekiah in the cleansing of the temple ([Ch2
29:12](../kjv/ch2029.htm#012).md).

<span id="005">**Amashai**</span> The son of Azareel, appointed by
Nehemiah to reside at Jerusalem and do the work of the temple ([Neh
11:13](../kjv/neh011.htm#013).md).

<span id="006">**Amasiah**</span> Burden of (i.e., "sustained by")
Jehovah, the "son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the
Lord," a captain over thousands under Jehoshaphat ([Ch2
17:16](../kjv/ch2017.htm#016.md); compare [Jdg
5:9](../kjv/jdg005.htm#009).md).

<span id="007">**Amaziah**</span> Strengthened by Jehovah. (1.) A
Levite, son of Hilkiah, of the descendants of Ethan the Merarite ([Ch1
6:45](../kjv/ch1006.htm#045)). (2..md) The son and successor of Joash, and
eighth king of the separate kingdom of Judah([Kg2
14:1](../kjv/kg2014.htm#001).md). He began his reign by punishing the
murderers of his father ([Kg2 14:5](../kjv/kg2014.htm#005.md); [Ch2
25:3](../kjv/ch2025.htm#003).md). He was the first to employ a mercenary
army of 100,000 Israelite soldiers, which he did in his attempt to bring
the Edomites again under the yoke of Judah ([Ch2
25:5](../kjv/ch2025.htm#005), [Ch2 25:6](../kjv/ch2025.htm#006).md). He was
commanded by a prophet of the Lord to send back the mercenaries, which
he did ([Ch2 25:7](../kjv/ch2025.htm#007.md), [Ch2
25:13](../kjv/ch2025.htm#013).md), much to their annoyance. His obedience
to this command was followed by a decisive victory over the Edomites
([Ch2 25:14](../kjv/ch2025.htm#014).md). Amaziah began to worship some of
the idols he took from the Edomites, and this was his ruin, for he was
vanquished by Joash, king of Israel, whom he challenged to battle. The
disaster he thus brought upon Judah by his infatuation in proclaiming
war against Israel probably occasioned the conspiracy by which he lost
his life ([Kg2 14:8](../kjv/kg2014.htm#008.md), [Kg2
14:19](../kjv/kg2014.htm#019).md). He was slain at Lachish, whither he had
fled, and his body was brought upon horses to Jerusalem, where it was
buried in the royal sepulchre ([Kg2 14:19](../kjv/kg2014.htm#019.md), [Kg2
14:20](../kjv/kg2014.htm#020); [Ch2 25:27](../kjv/ch2025.htm#027.md), [Ch2
25:28](../kjv/ch2025.htm#028)). (3..md) A priest of the golden calves at
Bethel ([Amo 7:10](../kjv/amo007.htm#010)). (4..md) The father of Joshah,
one of the Simeonite chiefs in the time of Hezekiah ([Ch1
4:34](../kjv/ch1004.htm#034).md).

<span id="008">**Ambassador**</span> In the Old Testament the Hebrew
word tsir, meaning "one who goes on an errand," is rendered thus ([Jos
9:4](../kjv/jos009.htm#004); [Pro 13:17](../kjv/pro013.htm#017.md); [Isa
18:2](../kjv/isa018.htm#002); [Jer 49:14](../kjv/jer049.htm#014.md); [Oba
1:1](../kjv/oba001.htm#001).md). This is also the rendering of melits,
meaning "an interpreter," in [Ch2 32:31](../kjv/ch2032.htm#031.md); and of
malak, a "messenger," in [Ch2 35:21](../kjv/ch2035.htm#021.md); [Isa
30:4](../kjv/isa030.htm#004); [Isa 33:7](../kjv/isa033.htm#007.md); [Eze
17:15](../kjv/eze017.htm#015.md). This is the name used by the apostle as
designating those who are appointed by God to declare his will ([Co2
5:20](../kjv/co2005.htm#020); [Eph 6:20](../kjv/eph006.htm#020).md). The
Hebrews on various occasions and for various purposes had recourse to
the services of ambassadors, e.g., to contract alliances ([Jos
9:4](../kjv/jos009.htm#004).md), to solicit favours ([Num
20:14](../kjv/num020.htm#014).md), to remonstrate when wrong was done ([Jdg
11:12](../kjv/jdg011.htm#012).md), to condole with a young king on the
death of his father ([Sa2 10:2](../kjv/sa2010.htm#002).md), and to
congratulate a king on his accession to the throne ([Kg1
5:1](../kjv/kg1005.htm#001).md). To do injury to an ambassador was to
insult the king who sent him ([Sa2 10:5](../kjv/sa2010.htm#005).md).

<span id="009">**Amber**</span> ([Eze 1:4](../kjv/eze001.htm#004.md), [Eze
1:27](../kjv/eze001.htm#027); [Eze 8:2](../kjv/eze008.htm#002.md). Heb.,
hashmal , rendered by the LXX. elektron, and by the Vulgate electrum), a
metal compounded of silver and gold. Some translate the word by
"polished brass," others "fine brass," as in [Rev
1:15](../kjv/rev001.htm#015); [Rev 2:18](../kjv/rev002.htm#018.md). It was
probably the mixture now called electrum. The word has no connection,
however, with what is now called amber, which is a gummy substance,
reckoned as belonging to the mineral kingdom though of vegetable origin,
a fossil resin.
