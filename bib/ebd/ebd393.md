<span id="000">**Zidon**</span> A fishery, a town on the Mediterranean
coast, about 25 miles north of Tyre. It received its name from the
"first-born" of Canaan, the grandson of Noah ([Gen
10:15](../kjv/gen010.htm#015), [Gen 10:19](../kjv/gen010.htm#019)). It
was the first home of the Phoenicians on the coast of Palestine, and
from its extensive commercial relations became a "great" city ([Jos
11:8](../kjv/jos011.htm#008); [Jos 19:28](../kjv/jos019.htm#028)). It
was the mother city of Tyre. It lay within the lot of the tribe of
Asher, but was never subdued ([Jdg 1:31](../kjv/jdg001.htm#031)). The
Zidonians long oppressed Israel ([Jdg 10:12](../kjv/jdg010.htm#012)).
From the time of David its glory began to wane, and Tyre, its "virgin
daughter" ([Isa 23:12](../kjv/isa023.htm#012)), rose to its place of
pre-eminence. Solomon entered into a matrimonial alliance with the
Zidonians, and thus their form of idolatrous worship found a place in
the land of Israel ([Kg1 11:1](../kjv/kg1011.htm#001), [Kg1
11:33](../kjv/kg1011.htm#033)). This city was famous for its
manufactures and arts, as well as for its commerce ([Kg1
5:6](../kjv/kg1005.htm#006); [Ch1 22:4](../kjv/ch1022.htm#004); [Eze
27:8](../kjv/eze027.htm#008)). It is frequently referred to by the
prophets ([Isa 23:2](../kjv/isa023.htm#002), [Isa
23:4](../kjv/isa023.htm#004), [Isa 23:12](../kjv/isa023.htm#012); [Jer
25:22](../kjv/jer025.htm#022); [Jer 27:3](../kjv/jer027.htm#003); [Jer
47:4](../kjv/jer047.htm#004); [Eze 27:8](../kjv/eze027.htm#008); [Eze
28:21](../kjv/eze028.htm#021), [Eze 28:22](../kjv/eze028.htm#022); [Eze
32:30](../kjv/eze032.htm#030); [Joe 3:4](../kjv/joe003.htm#004)). Our
Lord visited the "coasts" of Tyre and Zidon = Sidon (q.v.), [Mat
15:21](../kjv/mat015.htm#021); [Mar 7:24](../kjv/mar007.htm#024); [Luk
4:26](../kjv/luk004.htm#026); and from this region many came forth to
hear him preaching ([Mar 3:8](../kjv/mar003.htm#008); [Luk
6:17](../kjv/luk006.htm#017)). From Sidon, at which the ship put in
after leaving Caesarea, Paul finally sailed for Rome ([Act
27:3](../kjv/act027.htm#003), [Act 27:4](../kjv/act027.htm#004)). This
city is now a town of 10,000 inhabitants, with remains of walls built in
the twelfth century A.D. In 1855, the sarcophagus of Eshmanezer was
discovered. From a Phoenician inscription on its lid, it appears that he
was a "king of the Sidonians," probably in the third century B.C., and
that his mother was a priestess of Ashtoreth, "the goddess of the
Sidonians." In this inscription Baal is mentioned as the chief god of
the Sidonians.

<span id="001">**Zif**</span> Brightness; splendour; i.e., "the flower
month," mentioned only in [Kg1 6:1](../kjv/kg1006.htm#001), [Kg1
6:37](../kjv/kg1006.htm#037), as the "second month." It was called Iyar
by the later Jews. (See MONTH.)

<span id="002">**Ziha**</span> Drought. (1.) The name of a family of
Nethinim ([Ezr 2:43](../kjv/ezr002.htm#043); [Neh
7:46](../kjv/neh007.htm#046)). (2.) A ruler among the Nethinim ([Neh
11:21](../kjv/neh011.htm#021)).

<span id="003">**Ziklag**</span> A town in the Negeb, or south country
of Judah ([Jos 15:31](../kjv/jos015.htm#031)), in the possession of the
Philistines when David fled to Gath from Ziph with all his followers.
Achish, the king, assigned him Ziklag as his place of residence. There
he dwelt for over a year and four months. From this time it pertained to
the kings of Judah ([Sa1 27:6](../kjv/sa1027.htm#006)). During his
absence with his army to join the Philistine expedition against the
Israelites ([Sa1 29:11](../kjv/sa1029.htm#011)), it was destroyed by the
Amalekites ([Sa1 30:1](../kjv/sa1030.htm#001), [Sa1
30:2](../kjv/sa1030.htm#002)), whom David, however, pursued and utterly
routed, returning all the captives ([Sa1 30:26](../kjv/sa1030.htm#026)).
Two days after his return from this expedition, David received tidings
of the disastrous battle of Gilboa and of the death of Saul (2 Sam.
1:1-16). He now left Ziklag and returned to Hebron, along with his two
wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, and his band of 600 men. It has been
identified with 'Asluj , a heap of ruins south of Beersheba. Conder,
however, identifies it with Khirbet Zuheilikah, ruins found on three
hills half a mile apart, some seventeen miles north-west of Beersheba,
on the confines of Philistia, Judah, and Amalek.

<span id="004">**Zillah**</span> Shadow, one of the wives of Lamech, of
the line of Cain, and mother of Tubal-cain ([Gen
4:19](../kjv/gen004.htm#019), [Gen 4:22](../kjv/gen004.htm#022)).

<span id="005">**Zilpah**</span> Drooping, Leah's handmaid, and the
mother of Gad and Asher ([Gen 30:9](../kjv/gen030.htm#009)).

<span id="006">**Zilthai**</span> Shadow (i.e., protection) of Jehovah.
(1.) A Benjamite ([Ch1 8:20](../kjv/ch1008.htm#020)). (2.) One of the
captains of the tribe of Manasseh who joined David at Ziklag ([Ch1
12:20](../kjv/ch1012.htm#020)).

<span id="007">**Zimmah**</span> Mischief. (1.) A Gershonite Levite
([Ch1 6:20](../kjv/ch1006.htm#020)). (2.) Another Gershonite Levite
([Ch1 6:42](../kjv/ch1006.htm#042)). (3.) The father of Joah ([Ch2
29:12](../kjv/ch2029.htm#012)).

<span id="008">**Zimran**</span> Vine-dressers; celebrated, one of the
sons of Abraham by Keturah ([Gen 25:2](../kjv/gen025.htm#002)).

<span id="009">**Zimri**</span> Praise-worthy. (1.) A son of Salu, slain
by Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, because of his wickedness in bringing a
Midianitish woman into his tent ([Num 25:6](../kjv/num025.htm#006)).
(2.) Murdered Elah at Tirzah, and succeeded him on the throne of Israel
([Kg1 16:8](../kjv/kg1016.htm#008)). He reigned only seven days, for
Omri, whom the army elected as king, laid siege to Tirzah, whereupon
Zimri set fire to the palace and perished amid its ruins ([Kg1
16:11](../kjv/kg1016.htm#011)). Omri succeeded to the throne only after
four years of fierce war with Tibni, another claimant to the throne.
