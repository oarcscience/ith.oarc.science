<span id="000">**Jeiel**</span> Snatched away by God. (1.) A descendant
of Benjamin ([Ch1 9:35](../kjv/ch1009.htm#035); [Ch1
8:29](../kjv/ch1008.htm#029)). (2.) One of the Levites who took part in
praising God on the removal of the ark to Jerusalem ([Ch1
16:5](../kjv/ch1016.htm#005)). (3.) [Ch2 29:13](../kjv/ch2029.htm#013).
A Levite of the sons of Asaph. (4.) [Ch2 26:11](../kjv/ch2026.htm#011).
A scribe. (5.) [Ch1 5:7](../kjv/ch1005.htm#007). A Reubenite chief. (6.)
One of the chief Levites, who made an offering for the restoration of
the Passover by Josiah ([Ch2 35:9](../kjv/ch2035.htm#009)). (7.) [Ezr
8:13](../kjv/ezr008.htm#013). (8.) [Ezr 10:43](../kjv/ezr010.htm#043).

<span id="001">**Jemima**</span> Dove, the eldest of Job's three
daughters born after his time of trial ([Job
42:14](../kjv/job042.htm#014)).

<span id="002">**Jephthah**</span> Whom God sets free, or the breaker
through, a "mighty man of valour" who delivered Israel from the
oppression of the Ammonites (Judg. 11:1-33), and judged Israel six years
([Jdg 12:7](../kjv/jdg012.htm#007)). He has been described as "a wild,
daring, Gilead mountaineer, a sort of warrior Elijah." After forty-five
years of comparative quiet Israel again apostatized, and in "process of
time the children of Ammon made war against Israel" ([Jdg
11:5](../kjv/jdg011.htm#005)). In their distress the elders of Gilead
went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob, to which he had fled when
driven out wrongfully by his brothers from his father's inheritance (2),
and the people made him their head and captain. The "elders of Gilead"
in their extremity summoned him to their aid, and he at once undertook
the conduct of the war against Ammon. Twice he sent an embassy to the
king of Ammon, but in vain. War was inevitable. The people obeyed his
summons, and "the spirit of the Lord came upon him." Before engaging in
war he vowed that if successful he would offer as a "burnt-offering"
whatever would come out of the door of his house first to meet him on
his return. The defeat of the Ammonites was complete. "He smote them
from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto
the plain of the vineyards \[Heb. 'Abel Keramim \], with a very great
slaughter" ([Jdg 11:33](../kjv/jdg011.htm#033)). The men of Ephraim
regarded themselves as insulted in not having been called by Jephthah to
go with him to war against Ammon. This led to a war between the men of
Gilead and Ephraim ([Jos 12:4](../kjv/jos012.htm#004)), in which many of
the Ephraimites perished. (See SHIBBOLETH.) "Then died Jephthah the
Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead" ([Jos
12:7](../kjv/jos012.htm#007)).

<span id="003">**Jephthah's vow**</span> ([Jdg
11:30](../kjv/jdg011.htm#030), [Jdg 11:31](../kjv/jdg011.htm#031)).
After a crushing defeat of the Ammonites, Jephthah returned to his own
house, and the first to welcome him was his own daughter. This was a
terrible blow to the victor, and in his despair he cried out, "Alas, my
daughter! thou hast brought me very low... I have opened my mouth unto
the Lord, and cannot go back." With singular nobleness of spirit she
answered, "Do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy
mouth." She only asked two months to bewail her maidenhood with her
companions upon the mountains. She utters no reproach against her
father's rashness, and is content to yield her life since her father has
returned a conqueror. But was it so? Did Jephthah offer up his daughter
as a "burnt-offering"? This question has been much debated, and there
are many able commentators who argue that such a sacrifice was actually
offered. We are constrained, however, by a consideration of Jephthah's
known piety as a true worshipper of Jehovah, his evident acquaintance
with the law of Moses, to which such sacrifices were abhorrent ([Lev
18:21](../kjv/lev018.htm#021); [Lev 20:2](../kjv/lev020.htm#002); [Deu
12:31](../kjv/deu012.htm#031)), and the place he holds in the roll of
the heroes of the faith in the Epistle to the Hebrews ([Heb
11:32](../kjv/heb011.htm#032)), to conclude that she was only doomed to
a life of perpetual celibacy.

<span id="004">**Jephunneh**</span> Nimble, or a beholder. (1.) The
father of Caleb, who was Joshua's companion in exploring Canaan ([Num
13:6](../kjv/num013.htm#006)), a Kenezite ([Jos
14:14](../kjv/jos014.htm#014)). (2.) One of the descendants of Asher
([Ch1 7:38](../kjv/ch1007.htm#038)).

<span id="005">**Jerahmeel**</span> Loving God. (1.) The son of Hezron,
the brother of Caleb ([Ch1 2:9](../kjv/ch1002.htm#009), [Ch1
2:25](../kjv/ch1002.htm#025), [Ch1 2:26](../kjv/ch1002.htm#026), etc.).
(2.) The son of Kish, a Levite ([Ch1 24:29](../kjv/ch1024.htm#029)).
(3.) Son of Hammelech ([Jer 36:26](../kjv/jer036.htm#026)).

<span id="006">**Jeremiah**</span> Raised up or appointed by Jehovah.
(1.) A Gadite who joined David in the wilderness ([Ch1
12:10](../kjv/ch1012.htm#010)). (2.) A Gadite warrior ([Ch1
12:13](../kjv/ch1012.htm#013)). (3.) A Benjamite slinger who joined
David at Ziklag ([Ch1 12:4](../kjv/ch1012.htm#004)). (4.) One of the
chiefs of the tribe of Manasseh on the east of Jordan ([Ch1
5:24](../kjv/ch1005.htm#024)). (5.) The father of Hamutal ([Kg2
23:31](../kjv/kg2023.htm#031)), the wife of Josiah. (6.) One of the
"greater prophets" of the Old Testament, son of Hilkiah (q.v.), a priest
of Anathoth ([Jer 1:1](../kjv/jer001.htm#001); [Jer
32:6](../kjv/jer032.htm#006)). He was called to the prophetical office
when still young ([Jer 1:6](../kjv/jer001.htm#006)), in the thirteenth
year of Josiah (628 B.C.). He left his native place, and went to reside
in Jerusalem, where he greatly assisted Josiah in his work of
reformation (2 Kings 23:1-25). The death of this pious king was bewailed
by the prophet as a national calamity ([Ch2
35:25](../kjv/ch2035.htm#025)). During the three years of the reign of
Jehoahaz we find no reference to Jeremiah, but in the beginning of the
reign of Jehoiakim the enmity of the people against him broke out in
bitter persecution, and he was placed apparently under restraint ([Jer
36:5](../kjv/jer036.htm#005)). In the fourth year of Jehoiakim he was
commanded to write the predictions given to him, and to read them to the
people on the fast-day. This was done by Baruch his servant in his
stead, and produced much public excitement. The roll was read to the
king. In his recklessness he seized the roll, and cut it to pieces, and
cast it into the fire, and ordered both Baruch and Jeremiah to be
apprehended. Jeremiah procured another roll, and wrote in it the words
of the roll the king had destroyed, and "many like words" besides ([Jer
36:32](../kjv/jer036.htm#032)). He remained in Jerusalem, uttering from
time to time his words of warning, but without effect. He was there when
Nebuchadnezzar besieged the city ([Jer 37:4](../kjv/jer037.htm#004),
[Jer 37:5](../kjv/jer037.htm#005)), 589 B.C.. The rumour of the approach
of the Egyptians to aid the Jews in this crisis induced the Chaldeans to
withdraw and return to their own land. This, however, was only for a
time. The prophet, in answer to his prayer, received a message from God
announcing that the Chaldeans would come again and take the city, and
burn it with fire ([Jer 37:7](../kjv/jer037.htm#007), [Jer
37:8](../kjv/jer037.htm#008)). The princes, in their anger at such a
message by Jeremiah, cast him into prison (Jer. 37:15 - 38:13). He was
still in confinement when the city was taken (588 B.C.). The Chaldeans
released him, and showed him great kindness, allowing him to choose the
place of his residence. He accordingly went to Mizpah with Gedaliah, who
had been made governor of Judea. Johanan succeeded Gedaliah, and
refusing to listen to Jeremiah's counsels, went down into Egypt, taking
Jeremiah and Baruch with him ([Jer 43:6](../kjv/jer043.htm#006)). There
probably the prophet spent the remainder of his life, in vain seeking
still to turn the people to the Lord, from whom they had so long
revolted (Jer. 44). He lived till the reign of Evil-Merodach, son of
Nebuchadnezzar, and must have been about ninety years of age at his
death. We have no authentic record of his death. He may have died at
Tahpanhes, or, according to a tradition, may have gone to Babylon with
the army of Nebuchadnezzar; but of this there is nothing certain.

<span id="007">**Jeremiah, Book of**</span> Consists of twenty-three
separate and independent sections, arranged in five books. I. The
introduction, chapter 1. II. Reproofs of the sins of the Jews,
consisting of seven sections: (1.) Jer. 2 (2.) Jer. 3 - 6 (3.) Jer. 7 -
10 (4.) Jer. 11 - 13 (5.) Jer. 14 - 17:18 (6.) [Jer
17:19](../kjv/jer017.htm#019) (7.) Jer. 21 - 24 III. A general review of
all nations, in two sections: (1.)Jer. 46 - 49 (2.) Jer. 25; with an
historical appendix of three sections: (a.) Jer. 26 (b.) Jer. 27 (c.)
Jer. 28, 29 IV. Two sections picturing the hopes of better times: (1.)
Jer. 30, 31 (2.) Jer. 32, 33; to which is added an historical appendix
in three sections: (a.) [Jer 34:1](../kjv/jer034.htm#001) (b.) [Jer
34:8](../kjv/jer034.htm#008) (c.) Jer. 35 V. The conclusion, in two
sections: (1.) Jer. 36 (2.) [Jer 45:1](../kjv/jer045.htm#001) In Egypt,
after an interval, Jeremiah is supposed to have added three sections,
viz., Jer. 37 - 39; 40 - 43; and 44. The principal Messianic prophecies
are found in [Jer 23:1](../kjv/jer023.htm#001); [Jer
31:31](../kjv/jer031.htm#031); and [Jer 33:14](../kjv/jer033.htm#014).
Jeremiah's prophecies are noted for the frequent repetitions found in
them of the same words and phrases and imagery. They cover the period of
about 30 years. They are not recorded in the order of time. When and
under what circumstances this book assumed its present form we know not.
The LXX. Version of this book is, in its arrangement and in other
particulars, singularly at variance with the original. The LXX. omits
[Jer 10:6](../kjv/jer010.htm#006); [Jer 27:19](../kjv/jer027.htm#019);
[Jer 29:16](../kjv/jer029.htm#016); [Jer 33:14](../kjv/jer033.htm#014);
[Jer 39:4](../kjv/jer039.htm#004); [Jer 52:2](../kjv/jer052.htm#002),
[Jer 52:3](../kjv/jer052.htm#003), [Jer 52:15](../kjv/jer052.htm#015),
[Jer 52:28](../kjv/jer052.htm#028), etc. About 2,700 words in all of the
original are omitted. These omissions, etc., are capricious and
arbitrary, and render the version unreliable.

<span id="008">**Jericho**</span> Place of fragrance, a fenced city in
the midst of a vast grove of palm trees, in the plain of Jordan, over
against the place where that river was crossed by the Israelites ([Jos
3:16](../kjv/jos003.htm#016)). Its site was near the 'Ain es-Sultan ,
Elisha's Fountain ([Kg2 2:19](../kjv/kg2002.htm#019)), about 5 miles
west of Jordan. It was the most important city in the Jordan valley
([Num 22:1](../kjv/num022.htm#001); [Num 34:15](../kjv/num034.htm#015)),
and the strongest fortress in all the land of Canaan. It was the key to
Western Palestine. This city was taken in a very remarkable manner by
the Israelites (Josh. 6). God gave it into their hands. The city was
"accursed" (Heb. herem , "devoted" to Jehovah), and accordingly ([Jos
6:17](../kjv/jos006.htm#017); compare [Lev
27:28](../kjv/lev027.htm#028), [Lev 27:29](../kjv/lev027.htm#029); [Deu
13:16](../kjv/deu013.htm#016)) all the inhabitants and all the spoil of
the city were to be destroyed, "only the silver, and the gold, and the
vessels of brass and of iron" were reserved and "put into the treasury
of the house of Jehovah" ([Jos 6:24](../kjv/jos006.htm#024); compare
[Num 31:22](../kjv/num031.htm#022), [Num 31:23](../kjv/num031.htm#023),
[Num 31:50](../kjv/num031.htm#050)). Only Rahab "and her father's
household, and all that she had," were preserved from destruction,
according to the promise of the spies ([Jos
2:14](../kjv/jos002.htm#014)). In one of the Amarna tablets Adoni-zedec
(q.v.) writes to the king of Egypt informing him that the 'Abiri
(Hebrews) had prevailed, and had taken the fortress of Jericho, and were
plundering "all the king's lands." It would seem that the Egyptian
troops had before this been withdrawn from Palestine. This city was
given to the tribe of Benjamin ([Jos 18:21](../kjv/jos018.htm#021)), and
it was inhabited in the time of the Judges ([Jdg
3:13](../kjv/jdg003.htm#013); [Sa2 10:5](../kjv/sa2010.htm#005)). It is
not again mentioned till the time of David ([Sa2
10:5](../kjv/sa2010.htm#005)). "Children of Jericho" were among the
captives who returned under Zerubbabel [Ezr
2:34](../kjv/ezr002.htm#034); [Neh 7:36](../kjv/neh007.htm#036)). Hiel
(q.v.) the Bethelite attempted to make it once more a fortified city
([Kg1 16:34](../kjv/kg1016.htm#034)). Between the beginning and the end
of his undertaking all his children were cut off. In New Testament times
Jericho stood some distance to the south-east of the ancient one, and
near the opening of the valley of Achor. It was a rich and flourishing
town, having a considerable trade, and celebrated for the palm trees
which adorned the plain around. It was visited by our Lord on his last
journey to Jerusalem. Here he gave sight to two blind men ([Mat
20:29](../kjv/mat020.htm#029); [Mar 10:46](../kjv/mar010.htm#046)), and
brought salvation to the house of Zacchaeus the publican ([Luk
19:2](../kjv/luk019.htm#002)). The poor hamlet of er-Riha, the
representative of modern Jericho, is situated some two miles farther to
the east. It is in a ruinous condition, having been destroyed by the
Turks in 1840. "The soil of the plain," about the middle of which the
ancient city stood, "is unsurpassed in fertility; there is abundance of
water for irrigation, and many of the old aqueducts are almost perfect;
yet nearly the whole plain is waste and desolate... The climate of
Jericho is exceedingly hot and unhealthy. This is accounted for by the
depression of the plain, which is about 1,200 feet below the level of
the sea." There were three different Jerichos, on three different sites,
the Jericho of Joshua, the Jericho of Herod, and the Jericho of the
Crusades. Er-Riha, the modern Jericho, dates from the time of the
Crusades. Dr. Bliss has found in a hollow scooped out for some purpose
or other near the foot of the biggest mound above the Sultan's Spring
specimens of Amorite or pre-Israelitish pottery precisely identical with
what he had discovered on the site of ancient Lachish. He also traced in
this place for a short distance a mud brick wall in situ, which he
supposes to be the very wall that fell before the trumpets of Joshua.
The wall is not far from the foot of the great precipice of Quarantania
and its numerous caverns, and the spies of Joshua could easily have fled
from the city and been speedily hidden in these vastnesses.

<span id="009">**Jerimoth**</span> Heights. (1.) One of the sons of Bela
([Ch1 7:7](../kjv/ch1007.htm#007)). (2.) [Ch1
24:30](../kjv/ch1024.htm#030), a Merarite Levite. (3.) A Benjamite
slinger who joined David at Ziklag ([Ch1 12:5](../kjv/ch1012.htm#005)).
(4.) A Levitical musician under Heman his father ([Ch1
25:4](../kjv/ch1025.htm#004)). (5.) [Ch1 27:19](../kjv/ch1027.htm#019),
ruler of Naphtali. (6.) One of David's sons ([Ch2
11:18](../kjv/ch2011.htm#018)). (7.) A Levite, one of the overseers of
the temple offerings ([Ch2 31:13](../kjv/ch2031.htm#013)) in the reign
of Hezekiah.
