<span id="000">**Snow**</span> Common in Palestine in winter ([Psa
147:16](../kjv/psa147.htm#016).md). The snow on the tops of the Lebanon
range is almost always within view throughout the whole year. The word
is frequently used figuratively by the sacred writers ([Job
24:19](../kjv/job024.htm#019); [Psa 51:7](../kjv/psa051.htm#007.md); [Psa
68:14](../kjv/psa068.htm#014); [Isa 1:18](../kjv/isa001.htm#018).md). It is
mentioned only once in the historical books ([Sa2
23:20](../kjv/sa2023.htm#020).md). It was "carried to Tyre, Sidon, and
Damascus as a luxury, and labourers sweltering in the hot harvest-fields
used it for the purpose of cooling the water which they drank ([Pro
25:13](../kjv/pro025.htm#013); [Jer 18:14](../kjv/jer018.htm#014).md). No
doubt Herod Antipas, at his feasts in Tiberias, enjoyed also from this
very source the modern luxury of ice-water."

<span id="001">**So**</span> (Nubian, Sabako), an Ethiopian king who
brought Egypt under his sway. He was bribed by Hoshea to help him
against the Assyrian monarch Shalmaneser ([Kg2
17:4](../kjv/kg2017.htm#004).md). This was a return to the policy that had
been successful in the reign of Jeroboam I.

<span id="002">**Soap**</span> ([Jer 2:22](../kjv/jer002.htm#022.md); [Mal
3:2](../kjv/mal003.htm#002); Heb. borith .md), properly a vegetable alkali,
obtained from the ashes of certain plants, particularly the salsola kali
(saltwort), which abounds on the shores of the Dead Sea and of the
Mediterranean. It does not appear that the Hebrews were acquainted with
what is now called "soap," which is a compound of alkaline carbonates
with oleaginous matter. The word "purely" in [Isa
1:25](../kjv/isa001.htm#025) (R.V., "thoroughly;" marg., "as with lye".md)
is lit. "as with bor." This word means "clearness," and hence also that
which makes clear, or pure, alkali. "The ancients made use of alkali
mingled with oil, instead of soap ([Job 9:30](../kjv/job009.htm#030).md),
and also in smelting metals, to make them melt and flow more readily and
purely" (Gesenius).

<span id="003">**Socho**</span> A fence; hedge, ([Ch1
4:18](../kjv/ch1004.htm#018); R.V., Soco.md) = Sochoh ([Kg1
4:10](../kjv/kg1004.htm#010); R.V., Socoh.md), Shochoh ([Sa1
17:1](../kjv/sa1017.htm#001); R.V., Socoh.md), Shoco ([Ch2
11:7](../kjv/ch2011.htm#007); R.V., Soco.md), Shocho ([Ch2
28:18](../kjv/ch2028.htm#018); R.V., Soco.md), a city in the plain or
lowland of Judah, where the Philistines encamped when they invaded Judah
after their defeat at Michmash. It lay on the northern side of the
valley of Elah (Wady es-Sunt). It has been identified with the modern
Khurbet Shuweikeh, about 14 miles south-west of Jerusalem. In this
campaign Goliath was slain, and the Philistines were completely routed.

<span id="004">**Sodom**</span> Burning; the walled, a city in the vale
of Siddim ([Gen 13:10](../kjv/gen013.htm#010); 14:1-16.md). The wickedness
of its inhabitants brought down upon it fire from heaven, by which it
was destroyed (Gen. 18:16-33; 19:1-29; [Deu
23:17](../kjv/deu023.htm#017).md). This city and its awful destruction are
frequently alluded to in Scripture ([Deu 29:23](../kjv/deu029.htm#023.md);
[Deu 32:32](../kjv/deu032.htm#032); [Isa 1:9](../kjv/isa001.htm#009.md),
[Isa 1:10](../kjv/isa001.htm#010); [Isa 3:9](../kjv/isa003.htm#009.md);
[Isa 13:19](../kjv/isa013.htm#019); [Jer 23:14](../kjv/jer023.htm#014.md);
[Eze 16:46](../kjv/eze016.htm#046); [Zep 2:9](../kjv/zep002.htm#009.md);
[Mat 10:15](../kjv/mat010.htm#015); [Rom 9:29](../kjv/rom009.htm#029.md);
[Pe2 2:6](../kjv/pe2002.htm#006), etc..md). No trace of it or of the other
cities of the plain has been discovered, so complete was their
destruction. Just opposite the site of Zoar, on the south-west coast of
the Dead Sea, is a range of low hills, forming a mass of mineral salt
called Jebel Usdum, "the hill of Sodom." It has been concluded, from
this and from other considerations, that the cities of the plain stood
at the southern end of the Dead Sea. Others, however, with much greater
probability, contend that they stood at the northern end of the sea.

<span id="005">**Sodoma**</span> ([Rom 9:29](../kjv/rom009.htm#029.md);
R.V., "Sodom"), the Greek form for Sodom.

<span id="006">**Sodomites**</span> Those who imitated the licentious
wickedness of Sodom ([Deu 23:17](../kjv/deu023.htm#017.md); [Kg1
14:24](../kjv/kg1014.htm#024); [Rom 1:26](../kjv/rom001.htm#026.md), [Rom
1:27](../kjv/rom001.htm#027).md). Asa destroyed them "out of the land"
([Kg1 15:12](../kjv/kg1015.htm#012).md), as did also his son Jehoshaphat
([Kg1 22:46](../kjv/kg1022.htm#046).md).

<span id="007">**Solomon**</span> Peaceful, (Heb. Shelomoh ), David's
second son by Bathsheba, i.e., the first after their legal marriage (2
Sam. 12). He was probably born about 1035 B.C. ([Ch1
22:5](../kjv/ch1022.htm#005); [Ch1 29:1](../kjv/ch1029.htm#001).md). He
succeeded his father on the throne in early manhood, probably about
sixteen or eighteen years of age. Nathan, to whom his education was
entrusted, called him Jedidiah, i.e., "beloved of the Lord" ([Sa2
12:24](../kjv/sa2012.htm#024), [Sa2 12:25](../kjv/sa2012.htm#025).md). He
was the first king of Israel "born in the purple." His father chose him
as his successor, passing over the claims of his elder sons: "Assuredly
Solomon my son shall reign after me." His history is recorded in 1 Kings
1 - 11 and 2 Chr. 1 - 9. His elevation to the throne took place before
his father's death, and was hastened on mainly by Nathan and Bathsheba,
in consequence of the rebellion of Adonijah (1 Kings 1:5-40). During his
long reign of forty years the Hebrew monarchy gained its highest
splendour. This period has well been called the "Augustan age" of the
Jewish annals. The first half of his reign was, however, by far the
brighter and more prosperous; the latter half was clouded by the
idolatries into which he fell, mainly from his heathen intermarriages
([Kg1 11:1](../kjv/kg1011.htm#001); [Kg1 14:21](../kjv/kg1014.htm#021.md),
[Kg1 14:31](../kjv/kg1014.htm#031).md). See map, The Extent of Solomon's
Empire Before his death David gave parting instructions to his son ([Kg1
2:1](../kjv/kg1002.htm#001); [Ch1 22:7](../kjv/ch1022.htm#007); 28.md). As
soon as he had settled himself in his kingdom, and arranged the affairs
of his extensive empire, he entered into an alliance with Egypt by the
marriage of the daughter of Pharaoh ([Kg1 3:1](../kjv/kg1003.htm#001).md),
of whom, however, nothing further is recorded. He surrounded himself
with all the luxuries and the external grandeur of an Eastern monarch,
and his government prospered. He entered into an alliance with Hiram,
king of Tyre, who in many ways greatly assisted him in his numerous
undertakings. (See HIRAM.) For some years before his death David was
engaged in the active work of collecting materials ([Ch1
29:6](../kjv/ch1029.htm#006); [Ch2 2:3](../kjv/ch2002.htm#003).md) for
building a temple in Jerusalem as a permanent abode for the ark of the
covenant. He was not permitted to build the house of God ([Ch1
22:8](../kjv/ch1022.htm#008).md); that honour was reserved to his son
Solomon. (See TEMPLE.) After the completion of the temple, Solomon
engaged in the erection of many other buildings of importance in
Jerusalem and in other parts of his kingdom. For the long space of
thirteen years he was engaged in the erection of a royal palace on Ophel
([Kg1 7:1](../kjv/kg1007.htm#001).md). It was 100 cubits long, 50 broad,
and 30 high. Its lofty roof was supported by forty-five cedar pillars,
so that the hall was like a forest of cedar wood, and hence probably it
received the name of "The House of the Forest of Lebanon." In front of
this "house" was another building, which was called the Porch of
Pillars, and in front of this again was the "Hall of Judgment," or
Throneroom ([Kg1 7:7](../kjv/kg1007.htm#007.md); [Kg1
10:18](../kjv/kg1010.htm#018); [Ch2 9:17](../kjv/ch2009.htm#017).md), "the
King's Gate," where he administered justice and gave audience to his
people. This palace was a building of great magnificence and beauty. A
portion of it was set apart as the residence of the queen consort, the
daughter of Pharaoh. From the palace there was a private staircase of
red and scented sandal wood which led up to the temple. Solomon also
constructed great works for the purpose of securing a plentiful supply
of water for the city ([Ecc 2:4](../kjv/ecc002.htm#004).md). He then built
Millo (LXX., "Acra") for the defense of the city, completing a line of
ramparts around it ([Kg1 9:15](../kjv/kg1009.htm#015.md), [Kg1
9:24](../kjv/kg1009.htm#024); [Kg1 11:27](../kjv/kg1011.htm#027).md). He
erected also many other fortifications for the defense of his kingdom at
various points where it was exposed to the assault of enemies ([Kg1
9:15](../kjv/kg1009.htm#015); [Ch2 8:2](../kjv/ch2008.htm#002).md). Among
his great undertakings must also be mentioned the building of Tadmor
(q.v.) in the wilderness as a commercial depot, as well as a military
outpost. During his reign Palestine enjoyed great commercial prosperity.
Extensive traffic was carried on by land with Tyre and Egypt and Arabia,
and by sea with Spain and India and the coasts of Africa, by which
Solomon accumulated vast stores of wealth and of the produce of all
nations ([Kg1 9:26](../kjv/kg1009.htm#026.md); [Kg1
10:11](../kjv/kg1010.htm#011), [Kg1 10:12](../kjv/kg1010.htm#012.md); [Ch2
8:17](../kjv/ch2008.htm#017), [Ch2 8:18](../kjv/ch2008.htm#018.md); [Ch2
9:21](../kjv/ch2009.htm#021).md). This was the "golden age" of Israel. The
royal magnificence and splendour of Solomon's court were unrivaled. He
had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, an evidence at
once of his pride, his wealth, and his sensuality. The maintenance of
his household involved immense expenditure. The provision required for
one day was "thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of
meal, ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred
sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallow-deer, and fatted fowl"
([Kg1 4:22](../kjv/kg1004.htm#022), [Kg1 4:23](../kjv/kg1004.htm#023).md).
Solomon's reign was not only a period of great material prosperity, but
was equally remarkable for its intellectual activity. He was the leader
of his people also in this uprising amongst them of new intellectual
life. "He spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand
and five. And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon
even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of
beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes" ([Kg1
4:32](../kjv/kg1004.htm#032), [Kg1 4:33](../kjv/kg1004.htm#033).md). His
fame was spread abroad through all lands, and men came from far and near
"to hear the wisdom of Solomon." Among others thus attracted to
Jerusalem was "the queen of the south" ([Mat
12:42](../kjv/mat012.htm#042).md), the queen of Sheba, a country in Arabia
Felix. "Deep, indeed, must have been her yearning, and great his fame,
which induced a secluded Arabian queen to break through the immemorial
custom of her dreamy land, and to put forth the energy required for
braving the burdens and perils of so long a journey across a wilderness.
Yet this she undertook, and carried it out with safety." ([Kg1
10:1](../kjv/kg1010.htm#001); [Ch2 9:1](../kjv/ch2009.htm#001)..md) She was
filled with amazement by all she saw and heard: "there was no more
spirit in her." After an interchange of presents she returned to her
native land. But that golden age of Jewish history passed away. The
bright day of Solomon's glory ended in clouds and darkness. His decline
and fall from his high estate is a sad record. Chief among the causes of
his decline were his polygamy and his great wealth. "As he grew older he
spent more of his time among his favourites. The idle king living among
these idle women, for 1,000 women, with all their idle and mischievous
attendants, filled the palaces and pleasure-houses which he had built
([Kg1 11:3](../kjv/kg1011.htm#003).md), learned first to tolerate and then
to imitate their heathenish ways. He did not, indeed, cease to believe
in the God of Israel with his mind. He did not cease to offer the usual
sacrifices in the temple at the great feasts. But his heart was not
right with God; his worship became merely formal; his soul, left empty
by the dying out of true religious fervour, sought to be filled with any
religious excitement which offered itself. Now for the first time a
worship was publicly set up amongst the people of the Lord which was not
simply irregular or forbidden, like that of Gideon ([Jdg
8:27](../kjv/jdg008.htm#027).md), or the Danites ([Jdg
18:30](../kjv/jdg018.htm#030), [Jdg 18:31](../kjv/jdg018.htm#031).md), but
was downright idolatrous." ([Kg1 11:7](../kjv/kg1011.htm#007.md); [Kg2
23:13](../kjv/kg2023.htm#013)..md) This brought upon him the divine
displeasure. His enemies prevailed against him ([Kg1
11:14](../kjv/kg1011.htm#014), [Kg1 11:23](../kjv/kg1011.htm#023.md), [Kg1
11:26](../kjv/kg1011.htm#026).md), and one judgment after another fell upon
the land. And now the end of all came, and he died, after a reign of
forty years, and was buried in the city of David, and "with him was
buried in the city of David, and "with him was buried the short-lived
glory and unity of Israel." "He leaves behind him but one weak and
worthless son, to dismember his kingdom and disgrace his name." "The
kingdom of Solomon," says Rawlinson, "is one of the most striking facts
in the Biblical history. A petty nation, which for hundreds of years has
with difficulty maintained a separate existence in the midst of warlike
tribes, each of which has in turn exercised dominion over it and
oppressed it, is suddenly raised by the genius of a soldier-monarch to
glory and greatness. An empire is established which extends from the
Euphrates to the borders of Egypt, a distance of 450 miles; and this
empire, rapidly constructed, enters almost immediately on a period of
peace which lasts for half a century. Wealth, grandeur, architectural
magnificence, artistic excellence, commercial enterprise, a position of
dignity among the great nations of the earth, are enjoyed during this
space, at the end of which there is a sudden collapse. The ruling nation
is split in twain, the subject-races fall off, the pre-eminence lately
gained being wholly lost, the scene of struggle, strife, oppression,
recovery, in-glorious submission, and desperate effort, re-commences.",

<span id="008">**Solomon, Song of**</span> Called also, after the
Vulgate, the "Canticles." It is the "song of songs" ([Sol
1:1](../kjv/sol001.htm#001).md), as being the finest and most precious of
its kind; the noblest song, "das Hohelied," as Luther calls it. The
Solomonic authorship of this book has been called in question, but
evidences, both internal and external, fairly establish the traditional
view that it is the product of Solomon's pen. It is an allegorical poem
setting forth the mutual love of Christ and the Church, under the emblem
of the bridegroom and the bride. (Compare [Mat
9:15](../kjv/mat009.htm#015); [Joh 3:29](../kjv/joh003.htm#029.md); [Eph
5:23](../kjv/eph005.htm#023), [Eph 5:27](../kjv/eph005.htm#027.md), [Eph
5:29](../kjv/eph005.htm#029); [Rev 19:7](../kjv/rev019.htm#007.md); [Rev
21:2](../kjv/rev021.htm#002), [Rev 21:9](../kjv/rev021.htm#009.md); [Rev
22:17](../kjv/rev022.htm#017.md). Compare also Ps. 45; [Isa
54:4](../kjv/isa054.htm#004); [Isa 62:4](../kjv/isa062.htm#004.md), [Isa
62:5](../kjv/isa062.htm#005); [Jer 2:2](../kjv/jer002.htm#002.md); [Jer

<span id="009">**Solomon's Porch**</span> ([Joh
10:23](../kjv/joh010.htm#023); [Act 3:11](../kjv/act003.htm#011.md); [Act
5:12](../kjv/act005.htm#012).md), a colonnade, or cloister probably, on the
eastern side of the temple. It is not mentioned in connection with the
first temple, but Josephus mentions a porch, so called, in Herod's
temple (q.v.).
