<span id="000">**Colossians, Epistle to the**</span> Was written by Paul
at Rome during his first imprisonment there ([Act
28:16](../kjv/act028.htm#016), [Act 28:30](../kjv/act028.htm#030).md),
probably in the spring of A.D. 57, or, as some think, 62, and soon after
he had written his Epistle to the Ephesians. Like some of his other
epistles (e.g., those to Corinth), this seems to have been written in
consequence of information which had somehow been conveyed to him of the
internal state of the church there ([Col 1:4](../kjv/col001.htm#004).md).
Its object was to counteract false teaching. A large part of it is
directed against certain speculatists who attempted to combine the
doctrines of Oriental mysticism and asceticism with Christianity,
thereby promising the disciples the enjoyment of a higher spiritual life
and a deeper insight into the world of spirits. Paul argues against such
teaching, showing that in Christ Jesus they had all things. He sets
forth the majesty of his redemption. The mention of the "new moon" and
"sabbath days" ([Col 2:16](../kjv/col002.htm#016).md) shows also that there
were here Judaizing teachers who sought to draw away the disciples from
the simplicity of the gospel. Like most of Paul's epistles, this
consists of two parts, a doctrinal and a practical. (1.) The doctrinal
part comprises the first two chapters. His main theme is developed in
chapter 2. He warns them against being drawn away from Him in whom dwelt
all the fulness of the Godhead, and who was the head of all spiritual
powers. Christ was the head of the body of which they were members; and
if they were truly united to him, what needed they more? (2.) The
practical part of the epistle (Col. 3-4) enforces various duties
naturally flowing from the doctrines expounded. They are exhorted to
mind things that are above ([Col 3:1](../kjv/col003.htm#001).md), to
mortify every evil principle of their nature, and to put on the new man
([Col 3:5](../kjv/col003.htm#005).md). Many special duties of the Christian
life are also insisted upon as the fitting evidence of the Christian
character. Tychicus was the bearer of the letter, as he was also of that
to the Ephesians and to Philemon, and he would tell them of the state of
the apostle ([Col 4:7](../kjv/col004.htm#007).md). After friendly greetings
([Col 4:10](../kjv/col004.htm#010).md), he bids them interchange this
letter with that he had sent to the neighbouring church of Laodicea. He
then closes this brief but striking epistle with his usual autograph
salutation. There is a remarkable resemblance between this epistle and
that to the Ephesians (q.v.). The genuineness of this epistle has not
been called in question.

<span id="001">**Comforter**</span> The designation of the Holy Ghost
([Joh 14:16](../kjv/joh014.htm#016), [Joh 14:26](../kjv/joh014.htm#026.md);
[Joh 15:26](../kjv/joh015.htm#026); [Joh 16:7](../kjv/joh016.htm#007.md);
R.V. marg., "or Advocate, or Helper; Gr. paracletos "). The same Greek
word thus rendered is translated "Advocate" in [Jo1
2:1](../kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md) as applicable to Christ. It means properly
"one who is summoned to the side of another" to help him in a court of
justice by defending him, "one who is summoned to plead a cause."
"Advocate" is the proper rendering of the word in every case where it
occurs. It is worthy of notice that although Paul nowhere uses the word
paracletos, he yet presents the idea it embodies when he speaks of the
"intercession" both of Christ and the Spirit ([Rom
8:27](../kjv/rom008.htm#027), [Rom 8:34](../kjv/rom008.htm#034).md).

<span id="002">**Coming of Christ**</span> (1.) with reference to his
first advent "in the fulness of the time" ([Jo1
5:20](../kjv/jo1005.htm#020); [Jo2 1:7](../kjv/jo2001.htm#007)), or (2..md)
with reference to his coming again the second time at the last day ([Act
1:11](../kjv/act001.htm#011); [Act 3:20](../kjv/act003.htm#020.md), [Act
3:21](../kjv/act003.htm#021); [Th1 4:15](../kjv/th1004.htm#015.md); [Ti2
4:1](../kjv/ti2004.htm#001); [Heb 9:28](../kjv/heb009.htm#028).md). The
expression is used metaphorically of the introduction of the gospel into
any place ([Joh 15:22](../kjv/joh015.htm#022.md); [Eph
2:17](../kjv/eph002.htm#017).md), the visible establishment of his kingdom
in the world ([Mat 16:28](../kjv/mat016.htm#028).md), the conferring on his
people of the peculiar tokens of his love ([Joh
14:18](../kjv/joh014.htm#018), [Joh 14:23](../kjv/joh014.htm#023.md), [Joh
14:28](../kjv/joh014.htm#028).md), and his executing judgment on the wicked
([Th2 2:8](../kjv/th2002.htm#008).md).

<span id="003">**Commandments, The Ten**</span> ([Exo
34:28](../kjv/exo034.htm#028); [Deu 10:4](../kjv/deu010.htm#004.md), marg.
"ten words") i.e., the Decalogue (q.v.), is a summary of the immutable
moral law. These commandments were first given in their written form to
the people of Israel when they were encamped at Sinai, about fifty days
after they came out of Egypt (Ex. 19:10-25). They were written by the
finger of God on two tables of stone. The first tables were broken by
Moses when he brought them down from the mount ([Exo
32:19](../kjv/exo032.htm#019).md), being thrown by him on the ground. At
the command of God he took up into the mount two other tables, and God
wrote on them "the words that were on the first tables" ([Exo
34:1](../kjv/exo034.htm#001).md). These tables were afterwards placed in
the ark of the covenant ([Deu 10:5](../kjv/deu010.htm#005.md); [Kg1
8:9](../kjv/kg1008.htm#009).md). Their subsequent history is unknown. They
are as a whole called "the covenant" ([Deu
4:13](../kjv/deu004.htm#013).md), and "the tables of the covenant" ([Deu
9:9](../kjv/deu009.htm#009), [Deu 9:11](../kjv/deu009.htm#011.md); [Heb
9:4](../kjv/heb009.htm#004).md), and "the testimony." They are obviously
"ten" in number, but their division is not fixed, hence different
methods of numbering them have been adopted. The Jews make the "Preface"
one of the commandments, and then combine the first and second. The
Roman Catholics and Lutherans combine the first and second and divide
the tenth into two. The Jews and Josephus divide them equally. The
Lutherans and Roman Catholics refer three commandments to the first
table and seven to the second. The Greek and Reformed Churches refer
four to the first and six to the second table. The Samaritans add to the
second that Gerizim is the mount of worship. (See LAW.)

<span id="004">**Communion**</span> Fellowship with God (Gen. 18:17-33;
[Exo 33:9](../kjv/exo033.htm#009); [Num 12:7](../kjv/num012.htm#007.md),
[Num 12:8](../kjv/num012.htm#008).md), between Christ and his people ([Joh
14:23](../kjv/joh014.htm#023).md), by the Spirit ([Co2
13:14](../kjv/co2013.htm#014); [Phi 2:1](../kjv/phi002.htm#001).md), of
believers with one another ([Eph 4:1](../kjv/eph004.htm#001).md). The
Lord's Supper is so called ([Co1 10:16](../kjv/co1010.htm#016.md), [Co1
10:17](../kjv/co1010.htm#017).md), because in it there is fellowship
between Christ and his disciples, and of the disciples with one another.

<span id="005">**Conaniah**</span> Whom Jehovah hath set, a Levite
placed over the tithes brought into the temple ([Ch2
35:9](../kjv/ch2035.htm#009).md).

<span id="006">**Concision**</span> (Gr. katatome ; i.e., "mutilation"),
a term used by Paul contemptuously of those who were zealots for
circumcision ([Phi 3:2](../kjv/phi003.htm#002).md). Instead of the warning,
"Beware of the circumcision" (peritome) i.e., of the party who pressed
on Gentile converts the necessity of still observing that ordinance, he
says, "Beware of the concision;" as much as to say, "This circumcision
which they vaunt of is in Christ only as the gashings and mutilations of
idolatrous heathen."

<span id="007">**Concubine**</span> In the Bible denotes a female
conjugally united to a man, but in a relation inferior to that of a
wife. Among the early Jews, from various causes, the difference between
a wife and a concubine was less marked than it would be amongst us. The
concubine was a wife of secondary rank. There are various laws recorded
providing for their protection ([Exo 21:7](../kjv/exo021.htm#007.md); [Deu
21:10](../kjv/deu021.htm#010).md), and setting limits to the relation they
sustained to the household to which they belonged ([Gen
21:14](../kjv/gen021.htm#014); [Gen 25:6](../kjv/gen025.htm#006).md). They
had no authority in the family, nor could they share in the household
government. The immediate cause of concubinage might be gathered from
the conjugal histories of Abraham and Jacob (Gen. 16; 30). But in
process of time the custom of concubinage degenerated, and laws were
made to restrain and regulate it ([Exo 21:7](../kjv/exo021.htm#007).md).
Christianity has restored the sacred institution of marriage to its
original character, and concubinage is ranked with the sins of
fornication and adultery ([Mat 19:5](../kjv/mat019.htm#005.md); [Co1
7:2](../kjv/co1007.htm#002).md).

<span id="008">**Concupiscence**</span> Desire, [Rom
7:8](../kjv/rom007.htm#008) (R.V., "coveting".md); [Col
3:5](../kjv/col003.htm#005) (R.V., "desire".md). The "lust of
concupiscence" ([Th1 4:5](../kjv/th1004.htm#005.md); R.V., "passion of
lust") denotes evil desire, indwelling sin.

<span id="009">**Conduit**</span> A water-course or channel ([Job
38:25](../kjv/job038.htm#025).md). The "conduit of the upper pool" ([Isa
7:3](../kjv/isa007.htm#003).md) was formed by Hezekiah for the purpose of
conveying the waters from the upper pool in the valley of Gihon to the
west side of the city of David ([Kg2 18:17](../kjv/kg2018.htm#017.md); [Kg2
20:20](../kjv/kg2020.htm#020); [Ch2 32:30](../kjv/ch2032.htm#030).md). In
carrying out this work he stopped "the waters of the fountains which
were without the city" i.e., "the upper water-course of Gihon" - and
conveyed it down from the west through a canal into the city, so that in
case of a siege the inhabitants of the city might have a supply of
water, which would thus be withdrawn from the enemy. (See SILOAM.) There
are also the remains of a conduit which conducted water from the
so-called "Pools of Solomon," beyond Bethlehem, into the city. Water is
still conveyed into the city from the fountains which supplied these
pools by a channel which crosses the valley of Hinnom.
