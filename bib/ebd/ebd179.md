<span id="000">**Hind**</span> Heb. 'ayalah ([Sa2
22:34](../kjv/sa2022.htm#034); [Psa 18:33](../kjv/psa018.htm#033), etc.)
and 'ayeleth (Ps. 22, title), the female of the hart or stag. It is
referred to as an emblem of activity ([Gen
49:21](../kjv/gen049.htm#021)), gentleness ([Pro
5:19](../kjv/pro005.htm#019)), feminine modesty ([Sol
2:7](../kjv/sol002.htm#007); [Sol 3:5](../kjv/sol003.htm#005)), earnest
longing ([Psa 42:1](../kjv/psa042.htm#001)), timidity ([Psa
29:9](../kjv/psa029.htm#009)). In the title of Ps. 22, the word probably
refers to some tune bearing that name.

<span id="001">**Hinge**</span> (Heb. tsir ), that on which a door
revolves. "Doors in the East turn rather on pivots than on what we term
hinges. In Syria, and especially in the Hauran, there are many ancient
doors, consisting of stone slabs with pivots carved out of the same
piece inserted in sockets above and below, and fixed during the building
of the house" ([Pro 26:14](../kjv/pro026.htm#014)).

<span id="002">**Hinnom**</span> A deep, narrow ravine separating Mount
Zion from the so-called "Hill of Evil Counsel." It took its name from
"some ancient hero, the son of Hinnom." It is first mentioned in [Jos
15:8](../kjv/jos015.htm#008). It had been the place where the idolatrous
Jews burned their children alive to Moloch and Baal. A particular part
of the valley was called Tophet, or the "fire-stove," where the children
were burned. After the Exile, in order to show their abhorrence of the
locality, the Jews made this valley the receptacle of the offal of the
city, for the destruction of which a fire was, as is supposed, kept
constantly burning there. The Jews associated with this valley these two
ideas, (1.) that of the sufferings of the victims that had there been
sacrificed; and (2.) that of filth and corruption. It became thus to the
popular mind a symbol of the abode of the wicked hereafter. It came to
signify hell as the place of the wicked. "It might be shown by infinite
examples that the Jews expressed hell, or the place of the damned, by
this word. The word Gehenna \[the Greek contraction of Hinnom \] was
never used in the time of Christ in any other sense than to denote the
place of future punishment." About this fact there can be no question.
In this sense the word is used eleven times in our Lord's discourses
([Mat 23:33](../kjv/mat023.htm#033); [Luk 12:5](../kjv/luk012.htm#005);
[Mat 5:22](../kjv/mat005.htm#022), etc.).

<span id="003">**Hiram**</span> High-born. (1.) Generally "Huram," one
of the sons of Bela ([Ch1 8:5](../kjv/ch1008.htm#005)). (2.) Also
"Huram" and "Horam," king of Tyre. He entered into an alliance with
David, and assisted him in building his palace by sending him able
workmen, and also cedar-trees and fir-trees from Lebanon ([Sa2
5:11](../kjv/sa2005.htm#011); [Ch1 14:1](../kjv/ch1014.htm#001)). After
the death of David he entered into a similar alliance with Solomon, and
assisted him greatly in building the temple ([Kg1
5:1](../kjv/kg1005.htm#001); [Kg1 9:11](../kjv/kg1009.htm#011); [Ch2
2:3](../kjv/ch2002.htm#003)). He also took part in Solomon's traffic to
the Eastern Seas ([Kg1 9:27](../kjv/kg1009.htm#027); [Kg1
10:11](../kjv/kg1010.htm#011); [Ch2 8:18](../kjv/ch2008.htm#018); [Ch2
9:10](../kjv/ch2009.htm#010)). (3.) The "master workman" whom Hiram sent
to Solomon. He was the son of a widow of Dan, and of a Tyrian father. In
[Ch2 2:13](../kjv/ch2002.htm#013) "Huram my father" should be Huram Abi,
the word "Abi" (rendered here "my father") being regarded as a proper
name, or it may perhaps be a title of distinction given to Huram, and
equivalent to "master." (Compare [Kg1 7:14](../kjv/kg1007.htm#014); [Ch2
4:16](../kjv/ch2004.htm#016).) He cast the magnificent brazen works for
Solomon's temple in clay-beds in the valley of Jordan, between Succoth
and Zarthan.

<span id="004">**Hireling**</span> A labourer employed on hire for a
limited time ([Job 7:1](../kjv/job007.htm#001); [Job
14:6](../kjv/job014.htm#006); [Mar 1:20](../kjv/mar001.htm#020)). His
wages were paid as soon as his work was over ([Lev
19:13](../kjv/lev019.htm#013)). In the time of our Lord a day's wage was
a "penny" (q.v.) i.e., a Roman denarius ([Mat
20:1](../kjv/mat020.htm#001)).

<span id="005">**Hiss**</span> To express contempt ([Job
27:23](../kjv/job027.htm#023)). The destruction of the temple is thus
spoken of ([Kg1 9:8](../kjv/kg1009.htm#008)). Zechariah ([Zac
10:8](../kjv/zac010.htm#008)) speaks of the Lord gathering the house of
Judah as it were with a hiss: "I will hiss for them." This expression
may be "derived from the noise made to attract bees in hiving, or from
the sound naturally made to attract a person's attention."

<span id="006">**Hittites**</span> Palestine and Syria appear to have
been originally inhabited by three different tribes. (1.) The Semites,
living on the east of the isthmus of Suez. They were nomadic and
pastoral tribes. (2.) The Phoenicians, who were merchants and traders;
and (3.) the Hittites, who were the warlike element of this
confederation of tribes. They inhabited the whole region between the
Euphrates and Damascus, their chief cities being Carchemish on the
Euphrates, and Kadesh, now Tell Neby Mendeh, in the Orontes valley,
about six miles south of the Lake of Homs. These Hittites seem to have
risen to great power as a nation, as for a long time they were
formidable rivals of the Egyptian and Assyrian empires. In the book of
Joshua they always appear as the dominant race to the north of Galilee.
Somewhere about the twenty-third century B.C. the Syrian confederation,
led probably by the Hittites, arched against Lower Egypt, which they
took possession of, making Zoan their capital. Their rulers were the
Hyksos, or shepherd kings. They were at length finally driven out of
Egypt. Rameses II. sought vengeance against the "vile Kheta," as he
called them, and encountered and defeated them in the great battle of
Kadesh, four centuries after Abraham. (See JOSHUA.) They are first
referred to in Scripture in the history of Abraham, who bought from
Ephron the Hittite the field and the cave of Machpelah ([Gen
15:20](../kjv/gen015.htm#020) :23:3-18). They were then settled at
Kirjath-arba. From this tribe Esau took his first two wives ([Gen
26:34](../kjv/gen026.htm#034); [Gen 36:2](../kjv/gen036.htm#002)). They
are afterwards mentioned in the usual way among the inhabitants of the
Promised Land ([Exo 23:28](../kjv/exo023.htm#028)). They were closely
allied to the Amorites, and are frequently mentioned along with them as
inhabiting the mountains of Palestine. When the spies entered the land
they seem to have occupied with the Amorites the mountain region of
Judah ([Num 13:29](../kjv/num013.htm#029)). They took part with the
other Canaanites against the Israelites ([Jos
9:1](../kjv/jos009.htm#001); [Jos 11:3](../kjv/jos011.htm#003)). After
this there are few references to them in Scripture. Mention is made of
"Ahimelech the Hittite" ([Sa1 26:6](../kjv/sa1026.htm#006)), and of
"Uriah the Hittite," one of David's chief officers ([Sa2
23:39](../kjv/sa2023.htm#039); [Ch1 11:41](../kjv/ch1011.htm#041)). In
the days of Solomon they were a powerful confederation in the north of
Syria, and were ruled by "kings." They are met with after the Exile
still a distinct people ([Ezr 9:1](../kjv/ezr009.htm#001); compare [Neh
13:23](../kjv/neh013.htm#023)). The Hebrew merchants exported horses
from Egypt not only for the kings of Israel, but also for the Hittites
([Kg1 10:28](../kjv/kg1010.htm#028), [Kg1
10:29](../kjv/kg1010.htm#029)). From the Egyptian monuments we learn
that "the Hittites were a people with yellow skins and 'Mongoloid'
features, whose receding foreheads, oblique eyes, and protruding upper
jaws are represented as faithfully on their own monuments as they are on
those of Egypt, so that we cannot accuse the Egyptian artists of
caricaturing their enemies. The Amorites, on the contrary, were a tall
and handsome people. They are depicted with white skins, blue eyes, and
reddish hair, all the characteristics, in fact, of the white race"
(Sayce's The Hittites). The original seat of the Hittite tribes was the
mountain ranges of Taurus. They belonged to Asia. Minor, and not to
Syria.

<span id="007">**Hivites**</span> One of the original tribes scattered
over Palestine, from Hermon to Gibeon in the south. The name is
interpreted as "midlanders" or "villagers" ([Gen
10:17](../kjv/gen010.htm#017); [Ch1 1:15](../kjv/ch1001.htm#015)). They
were probably a branch of the Hittites. At the time of Jacob's return to
Canaan, Hamor the Hivite was the "prince of the land" (Gen. 24:2-28).
They are next mentioned during the Conquest ([Jos
9:7](../kjv/jos009.htm#007); [Jos 11:19](../kjv/jos011.htm#019)). They
principally inhabited the northern confines of Western Palestine ([Jos
11:3](../kjv/jos011.htm#003); [Jdg 3:3](../kjv/jdg003.htm#003)). A
remnant of them still existed in the time of Solomon ([Kg1
9:20](../kjv/kg1009.htm#020)).

<span id="008">**Hizkiah**</span> An ancestor of the prophet Zephaniah
([Zep 1:1](../kjv/zep001.htm#001)).

<span id="009">**Hizkijah**</span> ([Neh 10:17](../kjv/neh010.htm#017)),
one who sealed the covenant.
