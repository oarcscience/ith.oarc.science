<span id="000">**Muth-labben**</span> Occurring only in the title of
Psalm 9, title. Some interpret the words as meaning "on the death of
Labben," some unknown person. Others render the word, "on the death of
the son;" i.e., of Absalom ([Sa2 18:33](../kjv/sa2018.htm#033).md). Others
again have taken the word as the name of a musical instrument, or as the
name of an air to which the psalm was sung.

<span id="001">**Muzzle**</span> Grain in the East is usually thrashed
by the sheaves being spread out on a floor, over which oxen and cattle
are driven to and fro, till the grain is trodden out. Moses ordained
that the ox was not to be muzzled while thrashing. It was to be allowed
to eat both the grain and the straw ([Deu 25:4](../kjv/deu025.htm#004).md).
(See AGRICULTURE.)

<span id="002">**Myra**</span> One of the chief towns of Lycia, in Asia
Minor, about 2 1/2 miles from the coast ([Act
27:5](../kjv/act027.htm#005).md). Here Paul removed from the Adramyttian
ship in which he had sailed from Caesarea, and entered into the
Alexandrian ship, which was afterwards wrecked at Melita ([Act
27:39](../kjv/act027.htm#039).md).

<span id="003">**Myrrh**</span> Heb. mor . (1.) First mentioned as a
principal ingredient in the holy anointing oil ([Exo
30:23](../kjv/exo030.htm#023).md). It formed part of the gifts brought by
the wise men from the east, who came to worship the infant Jesus ([Mat
2:11](../kjv/mat002.htm#011).md). It was used in embalming ([Joh
19:39](../kjv/joh019.htm#039).md), also as a perfume ([Est
2:12](../kjv/est002.htm#012); [Psa 45:8](../kjv/psa045.htm#008.md); [Pro
7:17](../kjv/pro007.htm#017).md). It was a custom of the Jews to give those
who were condemned to death by crucifixion "wine mingled with myrrh" to
produce insensibility. This drugged wine was probably partaken of by the
two malefactors, but when the Roman soldiers pressed it upon Jesus "he
received it not" ([Mar 15:23](../kjv/mar015.htm#023)). (See GALL..md) This
was the gum or viscid white liquid which flows from a tree resembling
the acacia, found in Africa and Arabia, the Balsamodendron myrrha of
botanists. The "bundle of myrrh" in [Sol 1:13](../kjv/sol001.htm#013.md) is
rather a "bag" of myrrh or a scent-bag. (2.) Another word lot is also
translated "myrrh" ([Gen 37:25](../kjv/gen037.htm#025.md); [Gen
43:11](../kjv/gen043.htm#011); R.V., marg., "or ladanum".md). What was
meant by this word is uncertain. It has been thought to be the chestnut,
mastich, stacte, balsam, turpentine, pistachio nut, or the lotus. It is
probably correctly rendered by the Latin word ladanum , the Arabic ladan
, an aromatic juice of a shrub called the Cistus or rock rose, which has
the same qualities, though in a slight degree, of opium, whence a
decoction of opium is called laudanum. This plant was indigenous to
Syria and Arabia.

<span id="004">**Myrtle**</span> [Isa 41:19](../kjv/isa041.htm#019.md);
[Neh 8:15](../kjv/neh008.htm#015); [Zac 1:8](../kjv/zac001.htm#008).md),
Hebrew hadas, known in the East by the name as, the Myrtus communis of
the botanist. "Although no myrtles are now found on the mount (of
Olives), excepting in the gardens, yet they still exist in many of the
glens about Jerusalem, where we have often seen its dark shining leaves
and white flowers. There are many near Bethlehem and about Hebron,
especially near Dewir Dan, the ancient Debir. It also sheds its
fragrance on the sides of Carmel and of Tabor, and fringes the clefts of
the Leontes in its course through Galilee. We meet with it all through
Central Palestine" (Tristram).

<span id="005">**Mysia**</span> A province in the north-west of Asia
Minor. On his first voyage to Europe ([Act 16:7](../kjv/act016.htm#007.md),
[Act 16:8](../kjv/act016.htm#008).md) Paul passed through this province and
embarked at its chief port Troas.

<span id="006">**Mystery**</span> The calling of the Gentiles into the
Christian Church, so designated ([Eph 1:9](../kjv/eph001.htm#009.md), [Eph
1:10](../kjv/eph001.htm#010); [Eph 3:8](../kjv/eph003.htm#008.md); [Col
1:25](../kjv/col001.htm#025).md); a truth undiscoverable except by
revelation, long hid, now made manifest. The resurrection of the dead
([Co1 15:51](../kjv/co1015.htm#051).md), and other doctrines which need to
be explained but which cannot be fully understood by finite intelligence
([Mat 13:11](../kjv/mat013.htm#011); [Rom 11:25](../kjv/rom011.htm#025.md);
[Co1 13:2](../kjv/co1013.htm#002).md); the union between Christ and his
people symbolized by the marriage union ([Eph
5:31](../kjv/eph005.htm#031), [Eph 5:32](../kjv/eph005.htm#032.md); compare
[Eph 6:19](../kjv/eph006.htm#019).md); the seven stars and the seven
candlesticks ([Rev 1:20](../kjv/rev001.htm#020).md); and the woman clothed
in scarlet ([Rev 17:7](../kjv/rev017.htm#007).md), are also in this sense
mysteries. The anti-Christian power working in his day is called by the
apostle ([Th2 2:7](../kjv/th2002.htm#007).md) the "mystery of iniquity."

<span id="007">**Naam**</span> Pleasantness, one of the three sons of
Caleb, the son of Jephunneh ([Ch1 4:15](../kjv/ch1004.htm#015).md).

<span id="008">**Naamah**</span> The beautiful. (1.) The daughter of
Lamech and Zillah ([Gen 4:22](../kjv/gen004.htm#022)). (2..md) The daughter
of the king of Ammon, one of the wives of Solomon, the only one who
appears to have borne him a son, viz., Rehoboam ([Kg1
14:21](../kjv/kg1014.htm#021), [Kg1 14:31](../kjv/kg1014.htm#031)). (3..md)
A city in the plain of Judah ([Jos 15:41](../kjv/jos015.htm#041).md),
supposed by some to be identified with Na'aneh , some 5 miles south-east
of Makkedah.

<span id="009">**Naaman**</span> Pleasantness, a Syrian, the commander
of the armies of Benhadad II. in the time of Joram, king of Israel. He
was afflicted with leprosy; and when the little Hebrew slave-girl that
waited on his wife told her of a prophet in Samaria who could cure her
master, he obtained a letter from Benhadad and proceeded with it to
Joram. The king of Israel suspected in this some evil design against
him, and rent his clothes. Elisha the prophet hearing of this, sent for
Naaman, and the strange interview which took place is recorded in 2
Kings 5. The narrative contains all that is known of the Syrian
commander. He was cured of his leprosy by dipping himself seven times in
the Jordan, according to the word of Elisha. His cure is alluded to by
our Lord ([Luk 4:27](../kjv/luk004.htm#027).md).
