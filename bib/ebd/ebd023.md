<span id="000">**Ananiah**</span> Protected by Jehovah, the name of a
town in the tribe of Benjamin between Nob and Hazor ([Neh
11:32](../kjv/neh011.htm#032).md). It is probably the modern Beit Hanina, a
small village 3 miles north of Jerusalem.

<span id="001">**Ananias**</span> A common Jewish name, the same as
Hananiah. (1.) One of the members of the church at Jerusalem, who
conspired with his wife Sapphira to deceive the brethren, and who fell
down and immediately expired after he had uttered the falsehood ([Act
5:5](../kjv/act005.htm#005).md). By common agreement the members of the
early Christian community devoted their property to the work of
furthering the gospel and of assisting the poor and needy. The proceeds
of the possessions they sold were placed at the disposal of the apostles
([Act 4:36](../kjv/act004.htm#036), [Act 4:37](../kjv/act004.htm#037).md).
Ananias might have kept his property had he so chosen; but he professed
agreement with the brethren in the common purpose, and had of his own
accord devoted it all, as he said, to these sacred ends. Yet he retained
a part of it for his own ends, and thus lied in declaring that he had
given it all. "The offense of Ananias and Sapphira showed contempt of
God, vanity and ambition in the offenders, and utter disregard of the
corruption which they were bringing into the society. Such sin,
committed in despite of the light which they possessed, called for a
special mark of divine indignation." (2.) A Christian at Damascus ([Act
9:10](../kjv/act009.htm#010).md). He became Paul's instructor; but when or
by what means he himself became a Christian we have no information. He
was "a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the
Jews which dwelt" at Damascus ([Act 22:12](../kjv/act022.htm#012)). (3..md)
The high priest before whom Paul was brought in the procuratorship of
Felix ([Act 23:2](../kjv/act023.htm#002.md), [Act
23:5](../kjv/act023.htm#005), [Act 23:24](../kjv/act023.htm#024).md). He
was so enraged at Paul's noble declaration, "I have lived in all good
conscience before God until this day," that he commanded one of his
attendants to smite him on the mouth. Smarting under this unprovoked
insult, Paul quickly replied, "God shall smite thee, thou whited wall."
Being reminded that Ananias was the high priest, to whose office all
respect was to be paid, he answered, "I wist not, brethren, that he was
the high priest" ([Act 23:5](../kjv/act023.htm#005).md). This expression
has occasioned some difficulty, as it is scarcely probable that Paul
should have been ignorant of so public a fact. The expression may mean
(a.) that Paul had at the moment overlooked the honour due to the high
priest; or (b.) as others think, that Paul spoke ironically, as if he
had said, "The high priest breaking the law! God's high priest a tyrant
and a lawbreaker! I see a man in white robes, and have heard his voice,
but surely it cannot, it ought not to be, the voice of the high priest."
(See Dr. Lindsay on Acts, in loco.) (c.) Others think that from defect
of sight Paul could not observe that the speaker was the high priest. In
all this, however, it may be explained, Paul, with all his excellency,
comes short of the example of his divine Master, who, when he was
reviled, reviled not again.

<span id="002">**Anath**</span> An answer; i.e., to "prayer", the father
of Shamgar, who was one of the judges of Israel ([Jdg
3:31](../kjv/jdg003.htm#031).md).

<span id="003">**Anathema**</span> Anything laid up or suspended; hence
anything laid up in a temple or set apart as sacred. In this sense the
form of the word is anathema, once in plural used in the Greek New
Testament, in [Luk 21:5](../kjv/luk021.htm#005.md), where it is rendered
"gifts." In the LXX. the form anathema is generally used as the
rendering of the Hebrew word herem, derived from a verb which means (1.)
to consecrate or devote; and (2.) to exterminate. Any object so devoted
to the Lord could not be redeemed ([Num 18:14](../kjv/num018.htm#014.md);
[Lev 27:28](../kjv/lev027.htm#028), [Lev 27:29](../kjv/lev027.htm#029).md);
and hence the idea of exterminating connected with the word. The Hebrew
verb (haram) is frequently used of the extermination of idolatrous
nations. It had a wide range of application. The anathema or herem was a
person or thing irrevocably devoted to God ([Lev
27:21](../kjv/lev027.htm#021), [Lev 27:28](../kjv/lev027.htm#028).md); and
"none devoted shall be ransomed. He shall surely be put to death" ([Lev
27:29](../kjv/lev027.htm#029).md). The word therefore carried the idea of
devoted to destruction ([Num 21:2](../kjv/num021.htm#002.md), [Num
21:3](../kjv/num021.htm#003); [Jos 6:17](../kjv/jos006.htm#017).md); and
hence generally it meant a thing accursed. In [Deu
7:26](../kjv/deu007.htm#026.md) an idol is called a herem = anathema, a
thing accursed. In the New Testament this word always implies
execration. In some cases an individual denounces an anathema on himself
unless certain conditions are fulfilled ([Act
23:12](../kjv/act023.htm#012), [Act 23:14](../kjv/act023.htm#014.md), [Act
23:21](../kjv/act023.htm#021).md). "To call Jesus accursed" \[anathema\]
([Co1 12:3](../kjv/co1012.htm#003).md) is to pronounce him execrated or
accursed. If any one preached another gospel, the apostle says, "let him
be accursed" ([Gal 1:8](../kjv/gal001.htm#008.md), [Gal
1:9](../kjv/gal001.htm#009).md); i.e., let his conduct in so doing be
accounted accursed. In [Rom 9:3](../kjv/rom009.htm#003.md), the expression
"accursed" (anathema) from Christ, i.e., excluded from fellowship or
alliance with Christ, has occasioned much difficulty. The apostle here
does not speak of his wish as a possible thing. It is simply a vehement
expression of feeling, showing how strong was his desire for the
salvation of his people. The anathema in [Co1
16:22](../kjv/co1016.htm#022.md) denotes simply that they who love not the
Lord are rightly objects of loathing and execration to all holy beings;
they are guilty of a crime that merits the severest condemnation; they
are exposed to the just sentence of "everlasting destruction from the
presence of the Lord."

<span id="004">**Anathoth**</span> The name of one of the cities of
refuge, in the tribe of Benjamin ([Jos 21:18](../kjv/jos021.htm#018).md).
The Jews, as a rule, did not change the names of the towns they found in
Palestine; hence this town may be regarded as deriving its name from the
goddess Anat. It was the native place of Abiezer, one of David's
"thirty" ([Sa2 23:27](../kjv/sa2023.htm#027).md), and of Jehu, another of
his mighty men ([Ch1 12:3](../kjv/ch1012.htm#003).md). It is chiefly
notable, however, as the birth-place and usual residence of Jeremiah
([Jer 1:1](../kjv/jer001.htm#001); [Jer 11:21](../kjv/jer011.htm#021.md);
[Jer 29:27](../kjv/jer029.htm#027); [Jer 32:7](../kjv/jer032.htm#007).md).
It suffered greatly from the army of Sennacherib, and only 128 men
returned to it from the Exile ([Neh 7:27](../kjv/neh007.htm#027.md); [Ezr
2:23](../kjv/ezr002.htm#023).md). It lay about 3 miles north of Jerusalem.
It has been identified with the small and poor village of Anata,
containing about 100 inhabitants.

<span id="005">**Anchor**</span> From [Act
27:29](../kjv/act027.htm#029), [Act 27:30](../kjv/act027.htm#030.md), [Act
27:40](../kjv/act027.htm#040.md), it would appear that the Roman vessels
carried several anchors, which were attached to the stern as well as to
the prow. The Roman anchor, like the modern one, had two teeth or
flukes. In [Heb 6:19](../kjv/heb006.htm#019.md) the word is used
metaphorically for that which supports or keeps one steadfast in the
time of trial or of doubt. It is an emblem of hope. "If you fear, put
all your trust in God: that anchor holds."

<span id="006">**Ancient of Days**</span> An expression applied to
Jehovah three times in the vision of Daniel ([Dan
7:9](../kjv/dan007.htm#009), [Dan 7:13](../kjv/dan007.htm#013.md), [Dan
7:22](../kjv/dan007.htm#022).md) in the sense of eternal. In contrast with
all earthly kings, his days are past reckoning.

<span id="007">**Andrew**</span> Manliness, a Greek name; one of the
apostles of our Lord. He was of Bethsaida in Galilee ([Joh
1:44](../kjv/joh001.htm#044).md), and was the brother of Simon Peter ([Mat
4:18](../kjv/mat004.htm#018); [Mat 10:2](../kjv/mat010.htm#002).md). On one
occasion John the Baptist, whose disciple he then was, pointing to
Jesus, said, "Behold the Lamb of God" ([Joh
1:40](../kjv/joh001.htm#040).md); and Andrew, hearing him, immediately
became a follower of Jesus, the first of his disciples. After he had
been led to recognize Jesus as the Messiah, his first care was to bring
also his brother Simon to Jesus. The two brothers seem to have after
this pursued for a while their usual calling as fishermen, and did not
become the stated attendants of the Lord till after John's imprisonment
([Mat 4:18](../kjv/mat004.htm#018), [Mat 4:19](../kjv/mat004.htm#019.md);
[Mar 1:16](../kjv/mar001.htm#016), [Mar 1:17](../kjv/mar001.htm#017).md).
Very little is related of Andrew. He was one of the confidential
disciples ([Joh 6:8](../kjv/joh006.htm#008.md); [Joh
12:22](../kjv/joh012.htm#022).md), and with Peter, James, and John inquired
of our Lord privately regarding his future coming ([Mar
13:3](../kjv/mar013.htm#003).md). He was present at the feeding of the five
thousand ([Joh 6:9](../kjv/joh006.htm#009).md), and he introduced the
Greeks who desired to see Jesus ([Joh 12:22](../kjv/joh012.htm#022).md);
but of his subsequent history little is known. It is noteworthy that
Andrew thrice brings others to Christ, (1) Peter; (2) the lad with the
loaves; and (3) certain Greeks. These incidents may be regarded as a key
to his character.

<span id="008">**Andronicus**</span> Man-conquering, a Jewish Christian,
the kinsman and fellow prisoner of Paul ([Rom
16:7](../kjv/rom016.htm#007).md); "of note among the apostles."

<span id="009">**Anem**</span> Two fountains, a Levitical city in the
tribe of Issachar ([Ch1 6:73](../kjv/ch1006.htm#073).md). It is also called
En-gannim (q.v.) in [Jos 19:21](../kjv/jos019.htm#021.md); the modern
Jenin.
