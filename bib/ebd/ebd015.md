<span id="000">**Ahithophel**</span> Brother of insipidity or impiety, a
man greatly renowned for his sagacity among the Jews. At the time of
Absalom's revolt he deserted David ([Psa 41:9](../kjv/psa041.htm#009.md);
[Psa 55:12](../kjv/psa055.htm#012).md) and espoused the cause of Absalom
([Sa2 15:12](../kjv/sa2015.htm#012).md). David sent his old friend Hushai
back to Absalom, in order that he might counteract the counsel of
Ahithophel ([Sa2 15:31](../kjv/sa2015.htm#031).md). This end was so far
gained that Ahithophel saw he had no longer any influence, and
accordingly he at once left the camp of Absalom and returned to Giloh,
his native place where, after arranging his worldly affairs, he hanged
himself, and was buried in the sepulchre of his fathers (2 Sam.
17:1-23). He was the type of Judas ([Psa 41:9](../kjv/psa041.htm#009).md).

<span id="001">**Ahitub**</span> Brother of goodness = good. (1.) The
son of Phinehas. On the death of his grandfather Eli he succeeded to the
office of high priest, and was himself succeeded by his son Ahijah ([Sa1
14:3](../kjv/sa1014.htm#003); [Sa1 22:9](../kjv/sa1022.htm#009.md), [Sa1
22:11](../kjv/sa1022.htm#011), [Sa1 22:12](../kjv/sa1022.htm#012.md), [Sa1
22:20](../kjv/sa1022.htm#020)). (2..md) The father of Zadok, who was made
high priest by Saul after the extermination of the family of Ahimelech
([Ch1 6:7](../kjv/ch1006.htm#007), [Ch1 6:8](../kjv/ch1006.htm#008.md);
[Sa2 8:17](../kjv/sa2008.htm#017).md).

<span id="002">**Ahlab**</span> Fatness, a town of Asher lying within
the unconquered Phoenician border ([Jdg 1:31](../kjv/jdg001.htm#031).md),
north-west of the Sea of Galilee; commonly identified with Giscala, now
el-Jish.

<span id="003">**Ahoah**</span> Brotherly, one of the sons of Bela, the
son of Benjamin ([Ch1 8:4](../kjv/ch1008.htm#004).md). He is also called
Ahiah ([Ch1 8:7](../kjv/ch1008.htm#007).md) and Iri ([Ch1
7:7](../kjv/ch1007.htm#007).md). His descendants were called Ahohites ([Sa2
23:9](../kjv/sa2023.htm#009), [Sa2 23:28](../kjv/sa2023.htm#028).md).

<span id="004">**Ahohite**</span> An epithet applied to Dodo, one of
Solomon's captains ([Ch1 27:4](../kjv/ch1027.htm#004).md); to his son
Eleazar, one of David's three mightiest heroes ([Sa2
23:9](../kjv/sa2023.htm#009); [Ch1 11:12](../kjv/ch1011.htm#012).md); and
to Zalmon, one of the thirty ([Sa2 23:28](../kjv/sa2023.htm#028.md); [Ch1
11:29](../kjv/ch1011.htm#029).md), from their descent from Ahoah.

<span id="005">**Aholah**</span> She has her own tent, a name used by
Ezekiel ([Eze 23:4](../kjv/eze023.htm#004.md), [Eze
23:5](../kjv/eze023.htm#005), [Eze 23:36](../kjv/eze023.htm#036.md), [Eze
23:44](../kjv/eze023.htm#044).md) as a symbol of the idolatry of the
kingdom of Israel. This kingdom is described as a lewd woman, an
adulteress, given up to the abominations and idolatries of the Egyptians
and Assyrians. Because of her crimes, she was carried away captive, and
ceased to be a kingdom. (Compare [Psa 78:67](../kjv/psa078.htm#067.md);
[Kg1 12:25](../kjv/kg1012.htm#025); [Ch2 11:13](../kjv/ch2011.htm#013)..md)

<span id="006">**Aholiab**</span> Tent of the father, an artist of the
tribe of Dan, appointed to the work of preparing materials for the
tabernacle ([Exo 31:6](../kjv/exo031.htm#006.md); [Exo
35:34](../kjv/exo035.htm#034); [Exo 36:1](../kjv/exo036.htm#001.md), [Exo
36:2](../kjv/exo036.htm#002); [Exo 38:23](../kjv/exo038.htm#023).md).

<span id="007">**Aholibah**</span> My tent is in her, the name of an
imaginary harlot, applied symbolically to Jerusalem, because she had
abandoned the worship of the true God and given herself up to the
idolatries of foreign nations. ([Eze 23:4](../kjv/eze023.htm#004.md), [Eze
23:11](../kjv/eze023.htm#011), [Eze 23:22](../kjv/eze023.htm#022.md), [Eze
23:36](../kjv/eze023.htm#036), [Eze 23:44](../kjv/eze023.htm#044).md).

<span id="008">**Aholibamah**</span> Tent of the height, the name given
to Judith, the daughter of Beeri = Anah ([Gen
26:34](../kjv/gen026.htm#034); [Gen 36:2](../kjv/gen036.htm#002).md), when
she became the wife of Esau. A district among the mountains of Edom,
probably near Mount Hor, was called after her name, or it may be that
she received her name from the district. From her descended three tribes
of Edomites, founded by her three sons.

<span id="009">**Ai**</span> Ruins. (1.) One of the royal cities of the
Canaanites ([Jos 10:1](../kjv/jos010.htm#001.md); [Gen
12:8](../kjv/gen012.htm#008); [Gen 13:3](../kjv/gen013.htm#003).md). It was
the scene of Joshua's defeat, and afterwards of his victory. It was the
second Canaanite city taken by Israel ([Jos 7:2](../kjv/jos007.htm#002.md);
8:1-29). It lay rebuilt and inhibited by the Benjamites ([Ezr
2:28](../kjv/ezr002.htm#028); [Neh 7:32](../kjv/neh007.htm#032.md); [Neh
11:31](../kjv/neh011.htm#031).md). It lay to the east of Bethel, "beside
Beth-aven." The spot which is most probably the site of this ancient
city is Haiyan, 2 miles east from Bethel. It lay up the Wady Suweinit, a
steep, rugged valley, extending from the Jordan valley to Bethel. (2.)A
city in the Ammonite territory ([Jer 49:3](../kjv/jer049.htm#003).md). Some
have thought that the proper reading of the word is Ar ([Isa
15:1](../kjv/isa015.htm#001).md).
