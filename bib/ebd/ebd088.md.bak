<span id="000">**Coney**</span> (Heb. shaphan ; i.e., "the hider"), an
animal which inhabits the mountain gorges and the rocky districts of
Arabia Petraea and the Holy Land. "The conies are but a feeble folk, yet
make they their houses in the rocks" ([Pro
30:26](../kjv/pro030.htm#026); [Psa 104:18](../kjv/psa104.htm#018).md).
They are gregarious, and "exceeding wise" ([Pro
30:24](../kjv/pro030.htm#024).md), and are described as chewing the cud
([Lev 11:5](../kjv/lev011.htm#005); [Deu 14:7](../kjv/deu014.htm#007).md).
The animal intended by this name is known among naturalists as the Hyrax
Syriacus. It is neither a ruminant nor a rodent, but is regarded as akin
to the rhinoceros. When it is said to "chew the cud," the Hebrew word so
used does not necessarily imply the possession of a ruminant stomach.
"The lawgiver speaks according to appearances; and no one can watch the
constant motion of the little creature's jaws, as it sits continually
working its teeth, without recognizing the naturalness of the
expression" (Tristram, Natural History of the Bible). It is about the
size and colour of a rabbit, though clumsier in structure, and without a
tail. Its feet are not formed for digging, and therefore it has its home
not in burrows but in the clefts of the rocks. "Coney" is an obsolete
English word for "rabbit."

<span id="001">**Confection**</span> ([Exo
30:35](../kjv/exo030.htm#035.md), "ointment" in [Exo
30:25](../kjv/exo030.htm#025); R.V., "perfume".md). The Hebrew word so
rendered is derived from a root meaning to compound oil and perfume.

<span id="002">**Confectionaries**</span> Only in [Sa1
8:13](../kjv/sa1008.htm#013.md), those who make confections, i.e.,
perfumers, who compound species and perfumes.

<span id="003">**Confession**</span> (1.) An open profession of faith
([Luk 12:8](../kjv/luk012.htm#008)). (2..md) An acknowledment of sins to
God ([Lev 16:21](../kjv/lev016.htm#021.md); [Ezr
9:5](../kjv/ezr009.htm#005); [Dan 9:3](../kjv/dan009.htm#003).md), and to a
neighbour whom we have wronged ([Jam 5:16](../kjv/jam005.htm#016.md); [Mat
18:15](../kjv/mat018.htm#015).md).

<span id="004">**Congregation**</span> (Heb. kahal ), the Hebrew people
collectively as a holy community ([Num 15:15](../kjv/num015.htm#015).md).
Every circumcised Hebrew from twenty years old and upward was a member
of the congregation. Strangers resident in the land, if circumcised,
were, with certain exceptions ([Exo 12:19](../kjv/exo012.htm#019.md); [Num
9:14](../kjv/num009.htm#014); [Deu 23:1](../kjv/deu023.htm#001).md),
admitted to the privileges of citizenship, and spoken of as members of
the congregation ([Exo 12:19](../kjv/exo012.htm#019.md); [Num
9:14](../kjv/num009.htm#014); [Num 15:15](../kjv/num015.htm#015).md). The
congregation were summonded together by the sound of two silver
trumpets, and they met at the door of the tabernacle ([Num
10:3](../kjv/num010.htm#003)\].md) These assemblies were convened for the
purpose of engaging in solemn religious services ([Exo
12:27](../kjv/exo012.htm#027); [Num 25:6](../kjv/num025.htm#006.md); [Joe
2:15](../kjv/joe002.htm#015).md), or of receiving new commandments ([Exo
19:7](../kjv/exo019.htm#007), [Exo 19:8](../kjv/exo019.htm#008).md). The
elders, who were summonded by the sound of one trumpet ([Num
10:4](../kjv/num010.htm#004).md), represented on various occasions the
whole congregation ([Exo 3:16](../kjv/exo003.htm#016.md); [Exo
12:21](../kjv/exo012.htm#021); [Exo 17:5](../kjv/exo017.htm#005.md); [Exo
24:1](../kjv/exo024.htm#001).md). After the conquest of Canaan, the people
were assembled only on occasions of the highest national importance
(Judg. 20; [Ch2 30:5](../kjv/ch2030.htm#005.md); [Ch2
34:29](../kjv/ch2034.htm#029); [Sa1 10:17](../kjv/sa1010.htm#017.md); [Sa2
5:1](../kjv/sa2005.htm#001); [Kg1 12:20](../kjv/kg1012.htm#020.md); [Kg2
11:19](../kjv/kg2011.htm#019); [Kg2 21:24](../kjv/kg2021.htm#024.md); [Kg2
23:30](../kjv/kg2023.htm#030).md). In subsequent times the congregation was
represented by the Sanhedrim; and the name synagogue, applied in the
Septuagint version exclusively to the congregation, came to be used to
denote the places of worship established by the Jews. (See CHURCH.) In
[Act 13:43](../kjv/act013.htm#043.md), where alone it occurs in the New
Testament, it is the same word as that rendered "synagogue" (q.v.) in
[Act 13:42](../kjv/act013.htm#042.md), and is so rendered in [Act
13:43](../kjv/act013.htm#043.md) in R.V.

<span id="005">**Congregation, Mount of the**</span> ([Isa
14:13](../kjv/isa014.htm#013).md), has been supposed to refer to the place
where God promised to meet with his people ([Exo
25:22](../kjv/exo025.htm#022); [Exo 29:42](../kjv/exo029.htm#042.md), [Exo
29:43](../kjv/exo029.htm#043).md) i.e., the mount of the Divine presence,
Mount Zion. But here the king of Babylon must be taken as expressing
himself according to his own heathen notions, and not according to those
of the Jews. The "mount of the congregation" will therefore in this case
mean the northern mountain, supposed by the Babylonians to be the
meeting-place of their gods. In the Babylonian inscriptions mention is
made of a mountain which is described as "the mighty mountain of Bel,
whose head rivals heaven, whose root is the holy deep."This mountain was
regarded in their mythology as the place where the gods had their seat.

<span id="006">**Conscience**</span> That faculty of the mind, or inborn
sense of right and wrong, by which we judge of the moral character of
human conduct. It is common to all men. Like all our other faculties, it
has been perverted by the Fall ([Joh 16:2](../kjv/joh016.htm#002.md); [Act
26:9](../kjv/act026.htm#009); [Rom 2:15](../kjv/rom002.htm#015).md). It is
spoken of as "defiled" ([Tit 1:15](../kjv/tit001.htm#015).md), and "seared"
([Ti1 4:2](../kjv/ti1004.htm#002).md). A "conscience void of offence" is to
be sought and cultivated ([Act 24:16](../kjv/act024.htm#016.md); [Rom
9:1](../kjv/rom009.htm#001); [Co2 1:12](../kjv/co2001.htm#012.md); [Ti1
1:5](../kjv/ti1001.htm#005), [Ti1 1:19](../kjv/ti1001.htm#019.md); [Pe1
3:21](../kjv/pe1003.htm#021).md).

<span id="007">**Consecration**</span> The devoting or setting apart of
anything to the worship or service of God. The race of Abraham and the
tribe of Levi were thus consecrated ([Exo 13:2](../kjv/exo013.htm#002.md),
[Exo 13:12](../kjv/exo013.htm#012), [Exo 13:15](../kjv/exo013.htm#015.md);
[Num 3:12](../kjv/num003.htm#012).md). The Hebrews devoted their fields and
cattle, and sometimes the spoils of war, to the Lord ([Lev
27:28](../kjv/lev027.htm#028), [Lev 27:29](../kjv/lev027.htm#029).md).
According to the Mosaic law the first-born both of man and beast were
consecrated to God. In the New Testament, Christians are regarded as
consecrated to the Lord ([Pe1 2:9](../kjv/pe1002.htm#009).md).

<span id="008">**Consolation of Israel**</span> A name for the Messiah
in common use among the Jews, probably suggested by [Isa
12:1](../kjv/isa012.htm#001); [Isa 49:13](../kjv/isa049.htm#013.md). The
Greek word thus rendered ([Luk 2:25](../kjv/luk002.htm#025.md), paraklesis
) is kindred to that translated "Comforter" in [Joh
14:16](../kjv/joh014.htm#016.md), etc. parakletos .

<span id="009">**Constellation**</span> A cluster of stars, or stars
which appear to be near each other in the heavens, and which astronomers
have reduced to certain figures (as the "Great Bear," the "Bull," etc.)
for the sake of classification and of memory. In [Isa
13:10](../kjv/isa013.htm#010.md), where this word only occurs, it is the
rendering of the Hebrew kesil i.e., "fool." This was the Hebrew name of
the constellation Orion ([Job 9:9](../kjv/job009.htm#009.md); [Job
38:31](../kjv/job038.htm#031).md), a constellation which represented
Nimrod, the symbol of folly and impiety. The word some interpret by "the
giant" in this place, "some heaven-daring rebel who was chained to the
sky for his impiety."
