<span id="000">**Middal-Edar**</span> Tower of the flock, a place 2
miles south of Jerusalem, near the Bethlehem road ([Gen
35:21](../kjv/gen035.htm#021)). (See EDAR..md)

<span id="001">**Migdal-el**</span> Tower of God, a fortified city of
Naphtali ([Jos 19:38](../kjv/jos019.htm#038).md), supposed by some to be
identical with Magdala (q.v.).

<span id="002">**Migdal-gad**</span> Tower of fortune, a town in the
plains of Judah, probably the modern el-Mejdel, a little to the
north-east of Ascalon ([Jos 15:37](../kjv/jos015.htm#037).md).

<span id="003">**Migdol**</span> Tower. (1.) A strongly-fortified place
12 miles from Pelusium, in the north of Egypt ([Jer
44:1](../kjv/jer044.htm#001); [Jer 46:14](../kjv/jer046.htm#014).md). This
word is rendered "tower" in [Eze 29:10](../kjv/eze029.htm#010.md), but the
margin correctly retains the name Migdol, "from Migdol to Syene;" i.e.,
from Migdol in the north to Syene in the south in other words, the whole
of Egypt. (2.) A place mentioned in the passage of the Red Sea ([Exo
14:2](../kjv/exo014.htm#002); [Num 33:7](../kjv/num033.htm#007.md), [Num
33:8](../kjv/num033.htm#008).md). It is probably to be identified with Bir
Suweis, about 2 miles from Suez.

<span id="004">**Migron**</span> Precipice or landslip, a place between
Aiath and Michmash ([Isa 10:28](../kjv/isa010.htm#028).md). The town of the
same name mentioned in [Sa1 14:2](../kjv/sa1014.htm#002.md) was to the
south of this.

<span id="005">**Mikloth**</span> Staves. (1.) An officer under Dodai,
in the time of David and Solomon ([Ch1 27:4](../kjv/ch1027.htm#004).md).
(2.) A Benjamite ([Ch1 8:32](../kjv/ch1008.htm#032.md); [Ch1
9:37](../kjv/ch1009.htm#037), [Ch1 9:38](../kjv/ch1009.htm#038).md).

<span id="006">**Milaiai**</span> Eloquent, a Levitical musician ([Neh
12:36](../kjv/neh012.htm#036).md) who took part in the dedication of the
wall of Jerusalem.

<span id="007">**Mildew**</span> (the rendering of a Hebrew word meaning
"to be yellow," yellowness), the result of cutting east winds blighting
and thus rendering the grain unproductive ([Deu
28:22](../kjv/deu028.htm#022); [Kg1 8:37](../kjv/kg1008.htm#037.md); [Ch2
6:28](../kjv/ch2006.htm#028).md).

<span id="008">**Mile**</span> (from Lat. mille , "a thousand;" [Mat
5:41](../kjv/mat005.htm#041).md), a Roman measure of 1,000 paces of 5 feet
each. Thus the Roman mile has 1618 yards, being 142 yards shorter than
the English mile.

<span id="009">**Miletus**</span> (Miletum, [Ti2
4:20](../kjv/ti2004.htm#020).md), a seaport town and the ancient capital of
Ionia, about 36 miles south of Ephesus. On his voyage from Greece to
Syria, Paul touched at this port, and delivered that noble and pathetic
address to the elders ("presbyters," [Act 20:28](../kjv/act020.htm#028).md)
of Ephesus recorded in Acts 20:15-35. The site of Miletus is now some 10
miles from the coast. (See EPHESIANS, EPISTLE TO.)
