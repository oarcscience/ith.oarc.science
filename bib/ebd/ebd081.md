<span id="000">**Chinnereth**</span> Lyre, the singular form of the word
([Deu 3:17](../kjv/deu003.htm#017); [Jos 19:35](../kjv/jos019.htm#035).md),
which is also used in the plural form, Chinneroth, the name of a fenced
city which stood near the shore of the lake of Galilee, a little to the
south of Tiberias. The town seems to have given its name to a district,
as appears from [Kg1 15:20](../kjv/kg1015.htm#020.md), where the plural
form of the word is used. The Sea of Chinnereth ([Num
34:11](../kjv/num034.htm#011); [Jos 13:27](../kjv/jos013.htm#027).md), or
of Chinneroth ([Jos 12:3](../kjv/jos012.htm#003).md), was the "lake of
Gennesaret" or "sea of Tiberias" ([Deu 3:17](../kjv/deu003.htm#017.md);
[Jos 11:2](../kjv/jos011.htm#002).md). Chinnereth was probably an ancient
Canaanitish name adopted by the Israelites into their language.

<span id="001">**Chios**</span> Mentioned in [Act
20:15](../kjv/act020.htm#015.md), an island in the Egean Sea, about 5 miles
distant from the mainland, having a roadstead, in the shelter of which
Paul and his companions anchored for a night when on his third
missionary return journey. It is now called Scio.

<span id="002">**Chisleu**</span> The name adopted from the Babylonians
by the Jews after the Captivity for the third civil, or ninth
ecclesiastical, month ([Neh 1:1](../kjv/neh001.htm#001.md); [Zac
7:1](../kjv/zac007.htm#001).md). It corresponds nearly with the moon in
November.

<span id="003">**Chittim**</span> Or Kittim, a plural form ([Gen
10:4](../kjv/gen010.htm#004).md), the name of a branch of the descendants
of Javan, the "son" of Japheth. Balaam foretold ([Num
24:24](../kjv/num024.htm#024).md) "that ships shall come from the coast of
Chittim, and afflict Eber." Daniel prophesied ([Dan
11:30](../kjv/dan011.htm#030).md) that the ships of Chittim would come
against the king of the north. It probably denotes Cyprus, whose ancient
capital was called Kition by the Greeks. The references elsewhere made
to Chittim ([Isa 23:1](../kjv/isa023.htm#001.md), [Isa
23:12](../kjv/isa023.htm#012); [Jer 2:10](../kjv/jer002.htm#010.md); [Eze
27:6](../kjv/eze027.htm#006).md) are to be explained on the ground that
while the name originally designated the Phoenicians only, it came
latterly to be used of all the islands and various settlements on the
sea-coasts which they had occupied, and then of the people who succeeded
them when the Phoenician power decayed. Hence it designates generally
the islands and coasts of the Mediterranean and the races that inhabit
them.

<span id="004">**Chiun**</span> Occurs only in [Amo
5:26](../kjv/amo005.htm#026) (R.V. marg., "shrine".md). The LXX. translated
the word by Rhephan, which became corrupted into Remphan, as used by
Stephen ([Act 7:43](../kjv/act007.htm#043); but R.V., "Rephan".md).
Probably the planet Saturn is intended by the name. Astrologers
represented this planet as baleful in its influences, and hence the
Phoenicians offered to it human sacrifices, especially children.

<span id="005">**Chloe**</span> Verdure, a female Christian ([Co1
1:11](../kjv/co1001.htm#011).md), some of whose household had informed Paul
of the divided state of the Corinthian church. Nothing is known of her.

<span id="006">**Chor-ashan**</span> Smoking furnace, one of the places
where "David himself and his men were wont to haunt" ([Sa1
30:30](../kjv/sa1030.htm#030), [Sa1 30:31](../kjv/sa1030.htm#031).md). It
is probably identical with Ashan ([Jos 15:42](../kjv/jos015.htm#042.md);
[Jos 19:7](../kjv/jos019.htm#007).md), a Simeonite city in the Negeb, i.e.,
the south, belonging to Judah. The word ought, according to another
reading, to be "Bor-ashan."

<span id="007">**Chorazin**</span> Named along with Bethsaida and
Capernaum as one of the cities in which our Lord's "mighty works" were
done, and which was doomed to woe because of signal privileges neglected
([Mat 11:21](../kjv/mat011.htm#021.md); [Luk
10:13](../kjv/luk010.htm#013).md). It has been identified by general
consent with the modern Kerazeh, about 2 1/2 miles up the Wady Kerazeh
from Capernaum; i.e., Tell Hum.

<span id="008">**Chosen**</span> Spoken of warriors ([Exo
15:4](../kjv/exo015.htm#004); [Jdg 20:16](../kjv/jdg020.htm#016).md), of
the Hebrew nation ([Psa 105:43](../kjv/psa105.htm#043.md); [Deu
7:7](../kjv/deu007.htm#007).md), of Jerusalem as the seat of the temple
([Kg1 11:13](../kjv/kg1011.htm#013).md). Christ is the "chosen" of God
([Isa 42:1](../kjv/isa042.htm#001).md); and the apostles are "chosen" for
their work ([Act 10:41](../kjv/act010.htm#041).md). It is said with regard
to those who do not profit by their opportunities that "many are called,
but few are chosen" ([Mat 20:16](../kjv/mat020.htm#016).md). (See
ELECTION.)

<span id="009">**Chozeba**</span> ([Ch1 4:22](../kjv/ch1004.htm#022).md),
the same as Chezib and Achzib, a place in the lowlands of Judah ([Gen
38:5](../kjv/gen038.htm#005); [Jos 15:44](../kjv/jos015.htm#044).md).
