<span id="000">**Syntyche**</span> Fortunate; affable, a female member
of the church at Philippi, whom Paul beseeches to be of one mind with
Euodias ([Phi 4:2](../kjv/phi004.htm#002.md), [Phi
4:3](../kjv/phi004.htm#003).md).

<span id="001">**Syracuse**</span> A city on the south-east coast of
Sicily, where Paul landed and remained three days when on his way to
Rome ([Act 28:12](../kjv/act028.htm#012).md). It was distinguished for its
magnitude and splendour. It is now a small town of some 13,000
inhabitants.

<span id="002">**Syria**</span> (Heb. Aram ), the name in the Old
Testament given to the whole country which lay to the north-east of
Phoenicia, extending to beyond the Euphrates and the Tigris. Mesopotamia
is called ([Gen 24:10](../kjv/gen024.htm#010.md); [Deu
23:4](../kjv/deu023.htm#004)) Aram-naharain (= Syria of the two rivers.md),
also Padan-aram ([Gen 25:20](../kjv/gen025.htm#020).md). Other portions of
Syria were also known by separate names, as Aram-maahah ([Ch1
19:6](../kjv/ch1019.htm#006).md), Aram-beth-rehob ([Sa2
10:6](../kjv/sa2010.htm#006).md), Aram-zobah ([Sa2
10:6](../kjv/sa2010.htm#006), [Sa2 10:8](../kjv/sa2010.htm#008).md). All
these separate little kingdoms afterwards became subject to Damascus. In
the time of the Romans, Syria included also a part of Palestine and Asia
Minor. "From the historic annals now accessible to us, the history of
Syria may be divided into three periods:, The first, the period when the
power of the Pharaohs was dominant over the fertile fields or plains of
Syria and the merchant cities of Tyre and Sidon, and when such mighty
conquerors as Thothmes III. and Rameses II. could claim dominion and
levy tribute from the nations from the banks of the Euphrates to the
borders of the Libyan desert. Second, this was followed by a short
period of independence, when the Jewish nation in the south was growing
in power, until it reached its early zenith in the golden days of
Solomon; and when Tyre and Sidon were rich cities, sending their traders
far and wide, over land and sea, as missionaries of civilization, while
in the north the confederate tribes of the Hittites held back the armies
of the kings of Assyria. The third, and to us most interesting, period
is that during which the kings of Assyria were dominant over the plains
of Syria; when Tyre, Sidon, Ashdod, and Jerusalem bowed beneath the
conquering armies of Shalmaneser, Sargon, and Sennacherib; and when at
last Memphis and Thebes yielded to the power of the rulers of Nineveh
and Babylon, and the kings of Assyria completed with terrible fulness
the bruising of the reed of Egypt so clearly foretold by the Hebrew
prophets." - Boscawen.

<span id="003">**Syriac**</span> ([Kg2 18:26](../kjv/kg2018.htm#026.md);
[Ezr 4:7](../kjv/ezr004.htm#007); [Dan 2:4](../kjv/dan002.htm#004).md),
more correctly rendered "Aramaic," including both the Syriac and the
Chaldee languages. In the New Testament there are several Syriac words,
such as "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" ([Mar
15:34](../kjv/mar015.htm#034); [Mat 27:46](../kjv/mat027.htm#046.md) gives
the Heb. form, " Eli, Eli "), " Raca " ([Mat
5:22](../kjv/mat005.htm#022).md), " Ephphatha " ([Mar
7:34](../kjv/mar007.htm#034).md), " Maran-atha " ([Co1
16:22](../kjv/co1016.htm#022).md). A Syriac version of the Old Testament,
containing all the canonical books, along with some apocryphal books
(called the Peshitto, i.e., simple translation, and not a paraphrase),
was made early in the second century, and is therefore the first
Christian translation of the Old Testament. It was made directly from
the original, and not from the LXX. Version. The New Testament was also
translated from Greek into Syriac about the same time. It is noticeable
that this version does not contain the Second and Third Epistles of
John, 2 Peter, Jude, and the Apocalypse. These were, however, translated
subsequently and placed in the version. (See VERSION.)

<span id="004">**Syrophenician**</span> "a Greek, a Syrophenician by
nation" ([Mar 7:26](../kjv/mar007.htm#026).md), i.e., a Gentile born in the
Phoenician part of Syria. (See PHENICIA.) When our Lord retired into the
borderland of Tyre and Sidon ([Mat 15:21](../kjv/mat015.htm#021).md), a
Syro-phoenician woman came to him, and earnestly besought him, in behalf
of her daughter, who was grievously afflicted with a demon. Her faith in
him was severely tested by his silence ([Mat
15:23](../kjv/mat015.htm#023).md), refusal ([Mat
15:24](../kjv/mat015.htm#024).md), and seeming reproach that it was not
meet to cast the children's bread to dogs ([Mat
15:26](../kjv/mat015.htm#026).md). But it stood the test, and her petition
was graciously granted, because of the greatness of her faith ([Mat
15:28](../kjv/mat015.htm#028).md).

<span id="005">**Taanach**</span> A sandy place, an ancient royal city
of the Canaanites, on the south-western border of the plain of
Esdraelon, 4 miles south of Megiddo. Its king was conquered by Joshua
([Jos 12:21](../kjv/jos012.htm#021).md). It was assigned to the Levites of
the family of Kohath ([Jos 17:11](../kjv/jos017.htm#011.md); [Jos
21:25](../kjv/jos021.htm#025).md). It is mentioned in the song of Deborah
([Jdg 5:19](../kjv/jdg005.htm#019).md). It is identified with the small
modern village of Ta'annuk .

<span id="006">**Taanath-shiloh**</span> Approach to Shiloh, a place on
the border of Ephraim ([Jos 16:6](../kjv/jos016.htm#006).md), probably the
modern T'ana , a ruin 7 miles south-east of Shechem, on the ridge east
of the Mukhnah plain.

<span id="007">**Tabbaoth**</span> Impressions; rings, "the children
of," returned from the Captivity ([Ezr 2:43](../kjv/ezr002.htm#043).md).

<span id="008">**Tabbath**</span> Famous, a town in the tribe of Ephraim
([Jdg 7:22](../kjv/jdg007.htm#022).md), to the south of Bethshean, near the
Jordan.

<span id="009">**Tabeal**</span> Goodness of God, the father of one whom
the kings of Syria and Samaria in vain attempted to place on the throne
of Ahaz ([Isa 7:6](../kjv/isa007.htm#006).md).
