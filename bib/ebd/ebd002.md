<span id="000">**Abel-shittim**</span> Meadow of the acacias, frequently
called simply "Shittim" ([Num 25:1](../kjv/num025.htm#001); [Jos
2:1](../kjv/jos002.htm#001); [Mic 6:5](../kjv/mic006.htm#005)), a place
on the east of Jordan, in the plain of Moab, nearly opposite Jericho. It
was the forty-second encampment of the Israelites, their last
resting-place before they crossed the Jordan ([Num
33:49](../kjv/num033.htm#049); [Num 22:1](../kjv/num022.htm#001); [Num
26:3](../kjv/num026.htm#003); [Num 31:12](../kjv/num031.htm#012);
compare [Num 25:1](../kjv/num025.htm#001); [Num
31:16](../kjv/num031.htm#016)).

<span id="001">**Abez**</span> Tin, or white, a town in the tribe of
Issachar ([Jos 19:20](../kjv/jos019.htm#020)), at the north of the plain
of Esdraelon. It is probably identified with the ruins of el-Beida.

<span id="002">**Abia**</span> My father is the Lord, the Greek form of
Abijah, or Abijam ([Mat 1:7](../kjv/mat001.htm#007)), instead of Abiah
([Ch1 7:8](../kjv/ch1007.htm#008)). In [Luk 1:5](../kjv/luk001.htm#005),
the name refers to the head of the eighth of the twenty-four courses
into which David divided the priests ([Ch1
24:10](../kjv/ch1024.htm#010)).

<span id="003">**Abi-albon**</span> Father of strength; i.e., "valiant",
one of David's body-guard of thirty mighty men ([Sa2
23:31](../kjv/sa2023.htm#031)); called also Abiel ([Ch1
11:32](../kjv/ch1011.htm#032)).

<span id="004">**Abiasaph**</span> Father of gathering; the gatherer,
the youngest of the three sons of Korah the Levite, head of a family of
Korhites ([Exo 6:24](../kjv/exo006.htm#024)); called Ebisaph ([Ch1
6:37](../kjv/ch1006.htm#037)).

<span id="005">**Abiathar**</span> Father of abundance, or my father
excels, the son of Ahimelech the high priest. He was the tenth high
priest, and the fourth in descent from Eli. When his father was slain
with the priests of Nob, he escaped, and bearing with him the ephod, he
joined David, who was then in the cave of Adullam ([Sa1
22:20](../kjv/sa1022.htm#020); [Sa1 23:6](../kjv/sa1023.htm#006)). He
remained with David, and became priest of the party of which he was the
leader ([Sa1 30:7](../kjv/sa1030.htm#007)). When David ascended the
throne of Judah, Abiathar was appointed high priest ([Ch1
15:11](../kjv/ch1015.htm#011); [Kg1 2:26](../kjv/kg1002.htm#026)) and
the "king's companion" ([Ch1 27:34](../kjv/ch1027.htm#034)). Meanwhile
Zadok, of the house of Eleazar, had been made high priest. These
appointments continued in force till the end of David's reign ([Kg1
4:4](../kjv/kg1004.htm#004)). Abiathar was deposed (the sole historical
instance of the deposition of a high priest) and banished to his home at
Anathoth by Solomon, because he took part in the attempt to raise
Adonijah to the throne. The priesthood thus passed from the house of
Ithamar ([Sa1 2:30](../kjv/sa1002.htm#030); [Kg1
1:19](../kjv/kg1001.htm#019); [Kg1 2:26](../kjv/kg1002.htm#026), [Kg1
2:27](../kjv/kg1002.htm#027)). Zadok now became sole high priest. In
[Mar 2:26](../kjv/mar002.htm#026), reference is made to an occurrence in
"the days of Abiathar the high priest." But from 1 Sam. 22, we learn
explicitly that this event took place when Ahimelech, the father of
Abiathar, was high priest. The apparent discrepancy is satisfactorily
explained by interpreting the words in Mark as referring to the
life-time of Abiathar, and not to the term of his holding the office of
high priest. It is not implied in Mark that he was actual high priest at
the time referred to. Others, however, think that the loaves belonged to
Abiathar, who was at that time ([Lev 24:9](../kjv/lev024.htm#009)) a
priest, and that he either himself gave them to David, or persuaded his
father to give them.

<span id="006">**Abib**</span> An ear of corn, the month of
newly-ripened grain ([Exo 13:4](../kjv/exo013.htm#004); [Exo
23:15](../kjv/exo023.htm#015)); the first of the Jewish ecclesiastical
year, and the seventh of the civil year. It began about the time of the
vernal equinox, on 21st March. It was called Nisan, after the Captivity
([Neh 2:1](../kjv/neh002.htm#001)). On the fifteenth day of the month,
harvest was begun by gathering a sheaf of barley, which was offered unto
the Lord on the sixteenth ([Lev 23:4](../kjv/lev023.htm#004)).

<span id="007">**Abida**</span> Or Abidah - Father of knowledge;
knowing, one of the five sons of Midian, who was the son of Abraham by
Keturah ([Ch1 1:33](../kjv/ch1001.htm#033)), and apparently the chief of
an Arab tribe.

<span id="008">**Abidan**</span> Father of judgment; judge, head of the
tribe of Benjamin at the Exodus ([Num 1:11](../kjv/num001.htm#011); [Num
2:22](../kjv/num002.htm#022)).

<span id="009">**Abiel**</span> Father (i.e., "possessor") of God =
"pious." (1.) The son of Zeror and father of Ner, who was the
grandfather of Saul ([Sa1 14:51](../kjv/sa1014.htm#051); [Ch1
8:33](../kjv/ch1008.htm#033); [Ch1 9:39](../kjv/ch1009.htm#039)). In
[Sa1 9:1](../kjv/sa1009.htm#001), he is called the "father," probably
meaning the grandfather, of Kish. (2.) An Arbathite, one of David's
warriors ([Ch1 11:32](../kjv/ch1011.htm#032)); called also Abi-albon
([Sa2 23:31](../kjv/sa2023.htm#031)).
