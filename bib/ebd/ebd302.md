<span id="000">**Publius**</span> "The chief man of the island" of Malta
([Act 28:7](../kjv/act028.htm#007).md), who courteously entertained Paul
and his shipwrecked companions for three days, till they found a more
permanent place of residence; for they remained on the island for three
months, till the stormy season had passed. The word here rendered "chief
man" (protos) is supposed by some to be properly a Maltese term, the
official title of the governor.

<span id="001">**Pudens**</span> Bashful, a Christian at Rome, who sent
his greetings to Timothy ([Ti2 4:21](../kjv/ti2004.htm#021).md). (See
CLAUDIA.)

<span id="002">**Pul**</span> (1.) An Assyrian king. It has been a
question whether he was identical with Tiglath-pileser III. (q.v.), or
was his predecessor. The weight of evidence is certainly in favour of
their identity. Pul was the throne-name he bore in Babylonia as king of
Babylon, and Tiglath-pileser the throne-name he bore as king of Assyria.
He was the founder of what is called the second Assyrian empire. He
consolidated and organized his conquests on a large scale. He subdued
Northern Syria and Hamath, and the kings of Syria rendered him homage
and paid him tribute. His ambition was to found in Western Asia a
kingdom which should embrace the whole civilized world, having Nineveh
as its centre. Menahem, king of Israel, gave him the enormous tribute of
a thousand talents of silver, "that his hand might be with him" ([Kg2
15:19](../kjv/kg2015.htm#019); [Ch1 5:26](../kjv/ch1005.htm#026).md). The
fact that this tribute could be paid showed the wealthy condition of the
little kingdom of Israel even in this age of disorder and misgovernment.
Having reduced Syria, he turned his arms against Babylon, which he
subdued. The Babylonian king was slain, and Babylon and other Chaldean
cities were taken, and Pul assumed the title of "King of Sumer \[i.e.,
Shinar\] and Accad." He was succeeded by Shalmanezer IV. (2.) A
geographical name in [Isa 66:19](../kjv/isa066.htm#019.md). Probably = Phut
([Gen 10:6](../kjv/gen010.htm#006); [Jer 46:9](../kjv/jer046.htm#009.md),
R.V. "Put;" [Eze 27:10](../kjv/eze027.htm#010).md).

<span id="003">**Pulpit**</span> ([Neh 8:4](../kjv/neh008.htm#004).md).
(See EZRA.)

<span id="004">**Pulse**</span> ([Dan 1:12](../kjv/dan001.htm#012.md), [Dan
1:16](../kjv/dan001.htm#016).md), R.V. "herbs," vegetable food in general.

<span id="005">**Punishment**</span> The New Testament lays down the
general principles of good government, but contains no code of laws for
the punishment of offenders. Punishment proceeds on the principle that
there is an eternal distinction between right and wrong, and that this
distinction must be maintained for its own sake. It is not primarily
intended for the reformation of criminals, nor for the purpose of
deterring others from sin. These results may be gained, but crime in
itself demands punishment. (See MURDER; THEFT.) Endless, of the
impenitent and unbelieving. The rejection of this doctrine "cuts the
ground from under the gospel... blots out the attribute of retributive
justice; transmutes sin into misfortune instead of guilt; turns all
suffering into chastisement; converts the piacular work of Christ into
moral influence... The attempt to retain the evangelical theology in
connection with it is futile" (Shedd).

<span id="006">**Pur**</span> Or purim, a lot, lots, a festival
instituted by the Jews ([Est 9:24](../kjv/est009.htm#024).md) in ironical
commemoration of Haman's consultation of the Pur (a Persian word), for
the purpose of ascertaining the auspicious day for executing his cruel
plot against their nation. It became a national institution by the
common consent of the Jews, and is observed by them to the present day,
on the 14th and 15th of the month Adar, a month before the Passover.

<span id="007">**Purification**</span> The process by which a person
unclean, according to the Levitical law, and thereby cut off from the
sanctuary and the festivals, was restored to the enjoyment of all these
privileges. The great annual purification of the people was on the Day
of Atonement (q.v.). But in the details of daily life there were special
causes of ceremonial uncleanness which were severally provided for by
ceremonial laws enacted for each separate case. For example, the case of
the leper (Lev. 13, 14), and of the house defiled by leprosy ([Lev
14:49](../kjv/lev014.htm#049.md); see also [Mat
8:2](../kjv/mat008.htm#002).md). Uncleanness from touching a dead body
([Num 19:11](../kjv/num019.htm#011); [Hos 9:4](../kjv/hos009.htm#004.md);
[Hag 2:13](../kjv/hag002.htm#013); [Mat 23:27](../kjv/mat023.htm#027.md);
[Luk 11:44](../kjv/luk011.htm#044).md). The case of the high priest and of
the Nazarite ([Lev 21:1](../kjv/lev021.htm#001.md), [Lev
21:10](../kjv/lev021.htm#010), [Lev 21:11](../kjv/lev021.htm#011.md); [Num
6:6](../kjv/num006.htm#006), [Num 6:7](../kjv/num006.htm#007.md); [Eze
44:25](../kjv/eze044.htm#025).md). Purification was effected by bathing and
washing the clothes ([Lev 14:8](../kjv/lev014.htm#008.md), [Lev
14:9](../kjv/lev014.htm#009).md); by washing the hands ([Deu
21:6](../kjv/deu021.htm#006); [Mat 27:24](../kjv/mat027.htm#024).md);
washing the hands and feet ([Exo 30:18](../kjv/exo030.htm#018.md); [Heb
6:2](../kjv/heb006.htm#002.md), "baptisms", R.V. marg., "washings;" [Heb
9:10](../kjv/heb009.htm#010).md); sprinkling with blood and water ([Exo
24:5](../kjv/exo024.htm#005); [Heb 9:19](../kjv/heb009.htm#019).md), etc.
Allusions to this rite are found in [Psa 26:6](../kjv/psa026.htm#006.md);
[Psa 51:7](../kjv/psa051.htm#007); [Eze 36:25](../kjv/eze036.htm#025.md);
[Heb 10:22](../kjv/heb010.htm#022.md).

<span id="008">**Purse**</span> (1.) Gr. balantion , a bag ([Luk
10:4](../kjv/luk010.htm#004); [Luk 22:35](../kjv/luk022.htm#035.md), [Luk
22:36](../kjv/luk022.htm#036)). (2..md) Gr. zone , properly a girdle ([Mat
10:9](../kjv/mat010.htm#009); [Mar 6:8](../kjv/mar006.htm#008).md), a
money-belt. As to our Lord's sending forth his disciples without money
in their purses, the remark has been made that in this "there was no
departure from the simple manners of the country. At this day the farmer
sets out on excursions quite as extensive without a para in his purse;
and a modern Moslem prophet of Tarshisha thus sends forth his apostles
over this identical region. No traveler in the East would hesitate to
throw himself on the hospitality of any village." Thomson's Land and the
Book. (See SCRIP.)

<span id="009">**Put, Phut**</span> (1.) One of the sons of Ham ([Gen
10:6](../kjv/gen010.htm#006)). (2..md) A land or people from among whom
came a portion of the mercenary troops of Egypt, [Jer
46:9](../kjv/jer046.htm#009.md) (A.V., "Libyans," but correctly, R.V.,
"Put"); [Eze 27:10](../kjv/eze027.htm#010.md); [Eze
30:5](../kjv/eze030.htm#005) (A.V., "Libya;" R.V., "Put".md); [Eze
38:5](../kjv/eze038.htm#005); [Nah 3:9](../kjv/nah003.htm#009.md).
