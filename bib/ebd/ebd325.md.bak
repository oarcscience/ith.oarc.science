<span id="000">**Sea of Glass**</span> A figurative expression used in
[Rev 4:6](../kjv/rev004.htm#006) and [Rev 15:2](../kjv/rev015.htm#002.md).
According to the interpretation of some, "this calm, glass-like sea,
which is never in storm, but only interfused with flame, represents the
counsels of God, those purposes of righteousness and love which are
often fathomless but never obscure, always the same, though sometimes
glowing with holy anger." (Compare [Psa 36:6](../kjv/psa036.htm#006.md);
[Psa 77:19](../kjv/psa077.htm#019); [Rom 11:33](../kjv/rom011.htm#033)..md)

<span id="001">**Seah**</span> In land measure, a space of 50 cubits
long by 50 broad. In measure of capacity, a seah was a little over one
peck. (See MEASURE and see Tables of Weights, Measures and Money.)

<span id="002">**Seal**</span> Commonly a ring engraved with some device
([Gen 38:18](../kjv/gen038.htm#018.md), [Gen
38:25](../kjv/gen038.htm#025).md). Jezebel "wrote letters in Ahab's name,
and sealed them with his seal" ([Kg1 21:8](../kjv/kg1021.htm#008).md).
Seals are frequently mentioned in Jewish history ([Deu
32:34](../kjv/deu032.htm#034); [Neh 9:38](../kjv/neh009.htm#038.md); [Neh
10:1](../kjv/neh010.htm#001); [Est 3:12](../kjv/est003.htm#012.md); [Sol
8:6](../kjv/sol008.htm#006); [Isa 8:16](../kjv/isa008.htm#016.md); [Jer
22:24](../kjv/jer022.htm#024); [Jer 32:44](../kjv/jer032.htm#044.md),
etc.). Sealing a document was equivalent to the signature of the owner
of the seal. "The use of a signet-ring by the monarch has recently
received a remarkable illustration by the discovery of an impression of
such a signet on fine clay at Koyunjik, the site of the ancient Nineveh.
This seal appears to have been impressed from the bezel of a metallic
finger-ring. It is an oval, 2 inches in length by 1 inch wide, and bears
the image, name, and titles of the Egyptian king Sabaco" (Rawlinson's
Hist. Illus. of the O.T., p. 46). The actual signet-rings of two
Egyptian kings (Cheops and Horus) have been discovered. (See SIGNET.)
The use of seals is mentioned in the New Testament only in connection
with the record of our Lord's burial ([Mat
27:66](../kjv/mat027.htm#066).md). The tomb was sealed by the Pharisees and
chief priests for the purpose of making sure that the disciples would
not come and steal the body away ([Mat 27:63](../kjv/mat027.htm#063.md),
[Mat 27:64](../kjv/mat027.htm#064).md). The mode of doing this was probably
by stretching a cord across the stone and sealing it at both ends with
sealing-clay. When God is said to have sealed the Redeemer, the meaning
is, that he has attested his divine mission ([Joh
6:27](../kjv/joh006.htm#027).md). Circumcision is a seal, an attestation of
the covenant ([Rom 4:11](../kjv/rom004.htm#011).md). Believers are sealed
with the Spirit, as God's mark put upon them ([Eph
1:13](../kjv/eph001.htm#013); [Eph 4:30](../kjv/eph004.htm#030).md).
Converts are by Paul styled the seal of his apostleship, i.e., they are
its attestation ([Co1 9:2](../kjv/co1009.htm#002).md). Seals and sealing
are frequently mentioned in the book of Revelation ([Rev
5:1](../kjv/rev005.htm#001); [Rev 6:1](../kjv/rev006.htm#001.md); [Rev
7:3](../kjv/rev007.htm#003); [Rev 10:4](../kjv/rev010.htm#004.md); [Rev
22:10](../kjv/rev022.htm#010).md).

<span id="003">**Seasons**</span> ([Gen 8:22](../kjv/gen008.htm#022).md).
See AGRICULTURE; MONTH.

<span id="004">**Seba**</span> (1.) One of the sons of Cush ([Gen
10:7](../kjv/gen010.htm#007)). (2..md) The name of a country and nation
([Isa 43:3](../kjv/isa043.htm#003); [Isa 45:14](../kjv/isa045.htm#014).md)
mentioned along with Egypt and Ethiopia, and therefore probably in
north-eastern Africa. The ancient name of Meroe. The kings of Sheba and
Seba are mentioned together in [Psa 72:10](../kjv/psa072.htm#010.md).

<span id="005">**Sebat**</span> The eleventh month of the Hebrew year,
extending from the new moon of February to that of March ([Zac
1:7](../kjv/zac001.htm#007)). Assyrian sabatu, "storm." (See MONTH..md)

<span id="006">**Secacah**</span> Enclosure, one of the six cities in
the wilderness of Judah, noted for its "great cistern" ([Jos
15:61](../kjv/jos015.htm#061).md). It has been identified with the ruin
Sikkeh, east of Bethany.

<span id="007">**Sechu**</span> A hill or watch-tower, a place between
Gibeah and Ramah noted for its "great well" ([Sa1
19:22](../kjv/sa1019.htm#022).md); probably the modern Suweikeh, south of
Beeroth.

<span id="008">**Sect**</span> (Gr. hairesis , usually rendered
"heresy", [Act 24:14](../kjv/act024.htm#014.md); [Ch1
11:19](../kjv/ch1011.htm#019); [Gal 5:20](../kjv/gal005.htm#020), etc..md),
meaning properly "a choice," then "a chosen manner of life," and then "a
religious party," as the "sect" of the Sadducees ([Act
5:17](../kjv/act005.htm#017).md), of the Pharisees ([Act
15:5](../kjv/act015.htm#005).md), the Nazarenes, i.e., Christians ([Act
24:5](../kjv/act024.htm#005).md). It afterwards came to be used in a bad
sense, of those holding pernicious error, divergent forms of belief
([Pe2 2:1](../kjv/pe2002.htm#001); [Gal 5:20](../kjv/gal005.htm#020).md).

<span id="009">**Secundus**</span> Second, a Christian of Thessalonica
who accompanied Paul into Asia ([Act 20:4](../kjv/act020.htm#004).md).
