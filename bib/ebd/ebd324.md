<span id="000">**Schools of the Prophets**</span> ([Sa1
19:18](../kjv/sa1019.htm#018); [Kg2 2:3](../kjv/kg2002.htm#003.md), [Kg2
2:5](../kjv/kg2002.htm#005), [Kg2 2:7](../kjv/kg2002.htm#007.md), [Kg2
2:12](../kjv/kg2002.htm#012), [Kg2 2:15](../kjv/kg2002.htm#015).md) were
instituted for the purpose of training young men for the prophetical and
priestly offices. (See PROPHET; SAMUEL.)

<span id="001">**Scorpions**</span> Mentioned along with serpents ([Deu
8:15](../kjv/deu008.htm#015).md). Used also figuratively to denote wicked
persons ([Eze 2:6](../kjv/eze002.htm#006.md); [Luk
10:19](../kjv/luk010.htm#019).md); also a particular kind of scourge or
whip ([Kg1 12:11](../kjv/kg1012.htm#011).md). Scorpions were a species of
spider. They abounded in the Jordan valley.

<span id="002">**Scourging**</span> ([Kg1
12:11](../kjv/kg1012.htm#011).md). Variously administered. In no case were
the stripes to exceed forty ([Deu 25:3](../kjv/deu025.htm#003.md); compare
[Co2 11:24](../kjv/co2011.htm#024).md). In the time of the apostles, in
consequence of the passing of what was called the Porcian law, no Roman
citizen could be scourged in any case (Acts 16:22-37). (See BASTINADO.)
In the scourging of our Lord ([Mat 27:26](../kjv/mat027.htm#026.md); [Mar
15:15](../kjv/mar015.htm#015).md) the words of prophecy ([Isa
53:5](../kjv/isa053.htm#005).md) were fulfilled.

<span id="003">**Scribes**</span> Anciently held various important
offices in the public affairs of the nation. The Hebrew word so rendered
(sopher) is first used to designate the holder of some military office
([Jdg 5:14](../kjv/jdg005.htm#014.md); A.V., "pen of the writer;" R.V.,
"the marshal's staff;" marg., "the staff of the scribe"). The scribes
acted as secretaries of state, whose business it was to prepare and
issue decrees in the name of the king ([Sa2
8:17](../kjv/sa2008.htm#017); [Sa2 20:25](../kjv/sa2020.htm#025.md); [Ch1
18:16](../kjv/ch1018.htm#016); [Ch1 24:6](../kjv/ch1024.htm#006.md); [Kg1
4:3](../kjv/kg1004.htm#003); [Kg2 12:9](../kjv/kg2012.htm#009.md);
18:18-37, etc.). They discharged various other important public duties
as men of high authority and influence in the affairs of state. There
was also a subordinate class of scribes, most of whom were Levites. They
were engaged in various ways as writers. Such, for example, was Baruch,
who "wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord" ([Jer
36:4](../kjv/jer036.htm#004), [Jer 36:32](../kjv/jer036.htm#032).md). In
later times, after the Captivity, when the nation lost its independence,
the scribes turned their attention to the law, gaining for themselves
distinction by their intimate acquaintance with its contents. On them
devolved the duty of multiplying copies of the law and of teaching it to
others ([Ezr 7:6](../kjv/ezr007.htm#006.md), [Ezr
7:10](../kjv/ezr007.htm#010); [Neh 8:1](../kjv/neh008.htm#001.md), [Neh
8:4](../kjv/neh008.htm#004), [Neh 8:9](../kjv/neh008.htm#009.md), [Neh
8:13](../kjv/neh008.htm#013).md). It is evident that in New Testament times
the scribes belonged to the sect of the Pharisees, who supplemented the
ancient written law by their traditions (Matt. 23), thereby obscuring it
and rendering it of none effect. The titles "scribes" and "lawyers"
(q.v.) are in the Gospels interchangeable ([Mat
22:35](../kjv/mat022.htm#035); [Mar 12:28](../kjv/mar012.htm#028.md); [Luk
20:39](../kjv/luk020.htm#039), etc..md). They were in the time of our Lord
the public teachers of the people, and frequently came into collision
with him. They afterwards showed themselves greatly hostile to the
apostles ([Act 4:5](../kjv/act004.htm#005.md); [Act
6:12](../kjv/act006.htm#012).md). Some of the scribes, however, were men of
a different spirit, and showed themselves friendly to the gospel and its
preachers. Thus Gamaliel advised the Sanhedrin, when the apostles were
before them charged with "teaching in this name," to "refrain from these
men and let them alone" ([Act 5:34](../kjv/act005.htm#034.md); compare [Act
23:9](../kjv/act023.htm#009).md).

<span id="004">**Scrip**</span> A small bag or wallet usually fastened
to the girdle ([Sa1 17:40](../kjv/sa1017.htm#040).md); "a shepherd's bag."
In the New Testament it is the rendering of Gr. pera , which was a bag
carried by travelers and shepherds, generally made of skin ([Mat
10:10](../kjv/mat010.htm#010); [Mar 6:8](../kjv/mar006.htm#008.md); [Luk
9:3](../kjv/luk009.htm#003); [Luk 10:4](../kjv/luk010.htm#004).md). The
name "scrip" is meant to denote that the bag was intended to hold
scraps, fragments, as if scraped off from larger articles, trifles.

<span id="005">**Scripture**</span> Invariably in the New Testament
denotes that definite collection of sacred books, regarded as given by
inspiration of God, which we usually call the Old Testament ([Ti2
3:15](../kjv/ti2003.htm#015), [Ti2 3:16](../kjv/ti2003.htm#016.md); [Joh
20:9](../kjv/joh020.htm#009); [Gal 3:22](../kjv/gal003.htm#022.md); [Pe2
1:20](../kjv/pe2001.htm#020).md). It was God's purpose thus to perpetuate
his revealed will. From time to time he raised up men to commit to
writing in an infallible record the revelation he gave. The "Scripture,"
or collection of sacred writings, was thus enlarged from time to time as
God saw necessary. We have now a completed "Scripture," consisting of
the Old and New Testaments. The Old Testament canon in the time of our
Lord was precisely the same as that which we now possess under that
name. He placed the seal of his own authority on this collection of
writings, as all equally given by inspiration ([Mat
5:17](../kjv/mat005.htm#017); [Mat 7:12](../kjv/mat007.htm#012.md); [Mat
22:40](../kjv/mat022.htm#040); [Luk 16:29](../kjv/luk016.htm#029.md), [Luk
16:31](../kjv/luk016.htm#031)). (See BIBLE; CANON..md)

<span id="006">**Scythian**</span> The Scythians consisted of "all the
pastoral tribes who dwelt to the north of the Black Sea and the Caspian,
and were scattered far away toward the east. Of this vast country but
little was anciently known. Its modern representative is Russia, which,
to a great extent, includes the same territories." They were the
descendants of Japheth ([Gen 9:27](../kjv/gen009.htm#027).md). It appears
that in apostolic times there were some of this people that embraced
Christianity ([Col 3:11](../kjv/col003.htm#011).md).

<span id="007">**Sea, The**</span> (Heb. yam ), signifies (1.) "the
gathering together of the waters," the ocean ([Gen
1:10](../kjv/gen001.htm#010)); (2..md) a river, as the Nile ([Isa
19:5](../kjv/isa019.htm#005).md), the Euphrates ([Isa
21:1](../kjv/isa021.htm#001); [Jer 51:36](../kjv/jer051.htm#036)); (3..md)
the Red Sea ([Exo 14:16](../kjv/exo014.htm#016.md), [Exo
14:27](../kjv/exo014.htm#027); [Exo 15:4](../kjv/exo015.htm#004), etc..md);
(4.) the Mediterranean ([Exo 23:31](../kjv/exo023.htm#031.md); [Num
34:6](../kjv/num034.htm#006), [Num 34:7](../kjv/num034.htm#007.md); [Jos
15:47](../kjv/jos015.htm#047); [Psa 80:11](../kjv/psa080.htm#011.md),
etc.); (5.) the "sea of Galilee," an inland fresh-water lake, and (6.)
the Dead Sea or "salt sea" ([Gen 14:3](../kjv/gen014.htm#003.md); [Num
34:3](../kjv/num034.htm#003), [Num 34:12](../kjv/num034.htm#012), etc..md).
The word "sea" is used symbolically in [Isa
60:5](../kjv/isa060.htm#005.md), where it probably means the nations around
the Mediterranean. In [Dan 7:3](../kjv/dan007.htm#003.md), [Rev
13:1](../kjv/rev013.htm#001.md) it may mean the tumultuous changes among
the nations of the earth.

<span id="008">**Sea of Jazer**</span> ([Jer
48:32](../kjv/jer048.htm#032).md), a lake, now represented by some ponds in
the high valley in which the Ammonite city of Jazer lies, the ruins of
which are called Sar.

<span id="009">**Sea, The Molten**</span> The great laver made by
Solomon for the use of the priests in the temple, described in [Kg1
7:23](../kjv/kg1007.htm#023); [Ch2 4:2](../kjv/ch2004.htm#002.md). It stood
in the south-eastern corner of the inner court. It was 5 cubits high, 10
in diameter from brim to brim, and 30 in circumference. It was placed on
the backs of twelve oxen, standing with their faces outward. It was
capable of containing two or three thousand baths of water (compare [Ch2
4:5](../kjv/ch2004.htm#005).md), which was originally supplied by the
Gibeonites, but was afterwards brought by a conduit from the pools of
Bethlehem. It was made of "brass" (copper), which Solomon had taken from
the captured cities of Hadarezer, the king of Zobah ([Ch1
18:8](../kjv/ch1018.htm#008).md). Ahaz afterwards removed this laver from
the oxen, and placed it on a stone pavement ([Kg2
16:17](../kjv/kg2016.htm#017).md). It was destroyed by the Chaldeans ([Kg2
25:13](../kjv/kg2025.htm#013).md).
