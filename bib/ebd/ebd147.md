<span id="000">**Geshem**</span> Or Gashmu, firmness, probably chief of
the Arabs south of Palestine, one of the enemies of the Jews after the
return from Babylon ([Neh 2:19](../kjv/neh002.htm#019); [Neh
6:1](../kjv/neh006.htm#001), [Neh 6:2](../kjv/neh006.htm#002)). He
united with Sanballat and Tobiah in opposing the rebuilding of the wall
of Jerusalem.

<span id="001">**Geshur**</span> Bridge, the name of a district or
principality of Syria near Gilead, between Mount Hermon and the Lake of
Tiberias ([Sa2 15:8](../kjv/sa2015.htm#008); [Ch1
2:23](../kjv/ch1002.htm#023)). The Geshurites probably inhabited the
rocky fastness of Argob, the modern Lejah, in the north-east corner of
Bashan. In the time of David it was ruled by Talmai, whose daughter he
married, and who was the mother of Absalom, who fled to Geshur after the
murder of Amnon ([Sa2 13:37](../kjv/sa2013.htm#037)).

<span id="002">**Geshurites**</span> (1.) The inhabitants of Geshur.
They maintained friendly relations with the Israelites on the east of
Jordan ([Jos 12:5](../kjv/jos012.htm#005); [Jos
13:11](../kjv/jos013.htm#011), [Jos 13:13](../kjv/jos013.htm#013)). (2.)
Another aboriginal people of Palestine who inhabited the south-west
border of the land. Geshuri in [Jos 13:2](../kjv/jos013.htm#002) should
be "the Geshurite," not the Geshurites mentioned in [Jos
13:11](../kjv/jos013.htm#011), [Jos 13:13](../kjv/jos013.htm#013), but
the tribe mentioned in [Sa1 27:8](../kjv/sa1027.htm#008).

<span id="003">**Gethsemane**</span> Oil-press, the name of an
olive-yard at the foot of the Mount of Olives, to which Jesus was wont
to retire ([Luk 22:39](../kjv/luk022.htm#039)) with his disciples, and
which is specially memorable as being the scene of his agony ([Mar
14:32](../kjv/mar014.htm#032); [Joh 18:1](../kjv/joh018.htm#001); [Luk
22:44](../kjv/luk022.htm#044)). The plot of ground pointed out as
Gethsemane is now surrounded by a wall, and is laid out as a modern
European flower-garden. It contains eight venerable olive-trees, the age
of which cannot, however, be determined. The exact site of Gethsemane is
still in question. Dr. Thomson (The Land and the Book) says: "When I
first came to Jerusalem, and for many years afterward, this plot of
ground was open to all whenever they chose to come and meditate beneath
its very old olive trees. The Latins, however, have within the last few
years succeeded in gaining sole possession, and have built a high wall
around it... The Greeks have invented another site a little to the north
of it... My own impression is that both are wrong. The position is too
near the city, and so close to what must have always been the great
thoroughfare eastward, that our Lord would scarcely have selected it for
retirement on that dangerous and dismal night... I am inclined to place
the garden in the secluded vale several hundred yards to the north-east
of the present Gethsemane."

<span id="004">**Gezer**</span> A precipice, an ancient royal
Canaanitish city ([Jos 10:33](../kjv/jos010.htm#033); [Jos
12:12](../kjv/jos012.htm#012)). It was allotted with its suburbs to the
Kohathite Levites ([Jos 21:21](../kjv/jos021.htm#021); [Ch1
6:67](../kjv/ch1006.htm#067)). It stood between the lower Beth-horon and
the sea ([Jos 16:3](../kjv/jos016.htm#003); [Kg1
9:17](../kjv/kg1009.htm#017)). It was the last point to which David
pursued the Philistines ([Sa2 5:25](../kjv/sa2005.htm#025); [Ch1
14:16](../kjv/ch1014.htm#016)) after the battle of Baal-perazim. The
Canaanites retained possession of it till the time of Solomon, when the
king of Egypt took it and gave it to Solomon as a part of the dowry of
the Egyptian princess whom he married ([Kg1
9:15](../kjv/kg1009.htm#015)). It is identified with Tell el-Jezer,
about 10 miles south-west of Beth-horon. It is mentioned in the Amarna
tablets.

<span id="005">**Ghost**</span> An old Saxon word equivalent to soul or
spirit. It is the translation of the Hebrew nephesh and the Greek pneuma
, both meaning "breath," "life," "spirit," the "living principle" ([Job
11:20](../kjv/job011.htm#020); [Jer 15:9](../kjv/jer015.htm#009); [Mat
27:50](../kjv/mat027.htm#050); [Joh 19:30](../kjv/joh019.htm#030)). The
expression "to give up the ghost" means to die ([Lam
1:19](../kjv/lam001.htm#019); [Gen 25:17](../kjv/gen025.htm#017); [Gen
35:29](../kjv/gen035.htm#029); [Gen 49:33](../kjv/gen049.htm#033); [Job
3:11](../kjv/job003.htm#011)). (See HOLY GHOST.)

<span id="006">**Giants**</span> (1.) Heb. nephilim , meaning "violent"
or "causing to fall" ([Gen 6:4](../kjv/gen006.htm#004)). These were the
violent tyrants of those days, those who fell upon others. The word may
also be derived from a root signifying "wonder," and hence "monsters" or
"prodigies." In [Num 13:33](../kjv/num013.htm#033) this name is given to
a Canaanitish tribe, a race of large stature, "the sons of Anak." The
Revised Version, in these passages, simply transliterates the original,
and reads "Nephilim." (2.) Heb. rephaim , a race of giants ([Deu
3:11](../kjv/deu003.htm#011)) who lived on the east of Jordan, from whom
was descended. They were probably the original inhabitants of the land
before the immigration of the Canaanites. They were conquered by
Chedorlaomer ([Gen 14:5](../kjv/gen014.htm#005)), and their territories
were promised as a possession to Abraham ([Gen
15:20](../kjv/gen015.htm#020)). The Anakim, Zuzim, and Emim were
branches of this stock. In [Job 26:5](../kjv/job026.htm#005) (R.V.,
"they that are deceased;" marg., "the shades," the "Rephaim") and [Isa
14:9](../kjv/isa014.htm#009) this Hebrew word is rendered (A.V.) "dead."
It means here "the shades," the departed spirits in Sheol. In [Sa2
21:16](../kjv/sa2021.htm#016), [Sa2 21:18](../kjv/sa2021.htm#018), [Sa2
21:20](../kjv/sa2021.htm#020), 33, "the giant" is (A.V.) the rendering
of the singular form ha raphah, which may possibly be the name of the
father of the four giants referred to here, or of the founder of the
Rephaim. The Vulgate here reads "Arapha," whence Milton (in Samson
Agonistes) has borrowed the name "Harapha." (See also [Ch1
20:5](../kjv/ch1020.htm#005), [Ch1 20:6](../kjv/ch1020.htm#006), [Ch1
20:8](../kjv/ch1020.htm#008); [Deu 2:11](../kjv/deu002.htm#011), [Deu
2:20](../kjv/deu002.htm#020); [Deu 3:13](../kjv/deu003.htm#013); [Jos
15:8](../kjv/jos015.htm#008), etc., where the word is similarly rendered
"giant.") It is rendered "dead" in (A.V.) [Psa
88:10](../kjv/psa088.htm#010); [Pro 2:18](../kjv/pro002.htm#018); [Pro
9:18](../kjv/pro009.htm#018); [Pro 21:16](../kjv/pro021.htm#016) : in
all these places the Revised Version marg. has "the shades." (See also
[Isa 26:14](../kjv/isa026.htm#014).) (3.) Heb. 'Anakim ([Deu
2:10](../kjv/deu002.htm#010), [Deu 2:11](../kjv/deu002.htm#011), [Deu
2:21](../kjv/deu002.htm#021); [Jos 11:21](../kjv/jos011.htm#021), [Jos
11:22](../kjv/jos011.htm#022); [Jos 14:12](../kjv/jos014.htm#012), [Jos
14:15](../kjv/jos014.htm#015); called "sons of Anak," [Num
13:33](../kjv/num013.htm#033); "children of Anak," [Num
13:22](../kjv/num013.htm#022); [Jos 15:14](../kjv/jos015.htm#014)), a
nomad race of giants descended from Arba ([Jos
14:15](../kjv/jos014.htm#015)), the father of Anak, that dwelt in the
south of Palestine near Hebron ([Gen 23:2](../kjv/gen023.htm#002); [Jos
15:13](../kjv/jos015.htm#013)). They were a Cushite tribe of the same
race as the Philistines and the Egyptian shepherd kings. David on
several occasions encountered them ([Sa2 21:15](../kjv/sa2021.htm#015)).
From this race sprung Goliath ([Sa1 17:4](../kjv/sa1017.htm#004)). (4.)
Heb. 'emin , a warlike tribe of the ancient Canaanites. They were
"great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims" ([Gen
14:5](../kjv/gen014.htm#005); [Deu 2:10](../kjv/deu002.htm#010), [Deu
2:11](../kjv/deu002.htm#011)). (5.) Heb. Zamzummim (q.v.), [Deu
2:20](../kjv/deu002.htm#020) so called by the Amorites. (6.) Heb. gibbor
([Job 16:14](../kjv/job016.htm#014)), a mighty one, i.e., a champion or
hero. In its plural form (gibborim) it is rendered "mighty men" (2 Sam.
23:8-39; [Kg1 1:8](../kjv/kg1001.htm#008); 1 Chr. 11:9-47; [Ch1
29:24](../kjv/ch1029.htm#024).) The band of six hundred whom David
gathered around him when he was a fugitive were so designated. They were
divided into three divisions of two hundred each, and thirty divisions
of twenty each. The captains of the thirty divisions were called "the
thirty," the captains of the two hundred "the three," and the captain
over the whole was called "chief among the captains" ([Sa2
23:8](../kjv/sa2023.htm#008)). The sons born of the marriages mentioned
in [Gen 6:4](../kjv/gen006.htm#004) are also called by this Hebrew name.

<span id="007">**Gibbethon**</span> A height, a city of the Philistines
in the territory of Dan, given to the Kohathites ([Jos
19:44](../kjv/jos019.htm#044); [Jos 21:23](../kjv/jos021.htm#023)).
Nadab the king of Israel, while besieging it, was slain under its walls
by Baasha, one of his own officers ([Kg1 15:27](../kjv/kg1015.htm#027)).
It was in the possession of the Philistines after the secession of the
ten tribes ([Ch2 11:13](../kjv/ch2011.htm#013), [Ch2
11:14](../kjv/ch2011.htm#014)).

<span id="008">**Gibeah**</span> A hill or hill-town, "of Benjamin"
([Sa1 13:15](../kjv/sa1013.htm#015)), better known as "Gibeah of Saul"
([Sa1 11:4](../kjv/sa1011.htm#004); [Isa 10:29](../kjv/isa010.htm#029)).
It was here that the terrible outrage was committed on the Levite's
concubine which led to the almost utter extirpation of the tribe of
Benjamin (Judg. 19; 20), only six hundred men surviving after a
succession of disastrous battles. This was the birthplace of Saul, and
continued to be his residence after he became king ([Sa1
10:26](../kjv/sa1010.htm#026); [Sa1 11:4](../kjv/sa1011.htm#004); [Sa1
15:34](../kjv/sa1015.htm#034)). It was reckoned among the ancient
sanctuaries of Palestine ([Sa1 10:26](../kjv/sa1010.htm#026); [Sa1
15:34](../kjv/sa1015.htm#034); [Sa1 23:19](../kjv/sa1023.htm#019); [Sa1
26:1](../kjv/sa1026.htm#001); [Sa2 21:6](../kjv/sa2021.htm#006)), and
hence it is called "Gibeah of God" ([Sa1 10:5](../kjv/sa1010.htm#005),
R.V. marg.). It has been identified with the modern Tell el-Ful (i.e.,
"hill of the bean"), about 3 miles north of Jerusalem.

<span id="009">**Gibeah of Judah**</span> ([Jos
15:57](../kjv/jos015.htm#057)), a city in the mountains of Judah, the
modern Jeba, on a hill in the Wady Musurr, about 71/2 miles
west-south-west of Bethlehem.
