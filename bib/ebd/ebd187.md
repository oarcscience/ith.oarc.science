------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Iim**</span> Ruins. (1.) A city in the south of Judah
([Jos 15:29](../kjv/jos015.htm#029)). (2..md) One of the stations of the
Israelites in the wilderness ([Num 33:45](../kjv/num033.htm#045).md).

<span id="001">**Ije-abarim**</span> Ruins of Abarim, the forty-seventh
station of the Israelites in the wilderness, "in the border of Moab"
([Num 33:44](../kjv/num033.htm#044).md).

<span id="002">**Ijon**</span> A ruin, a city of Naphtali, captured by
Ben-hadad of Syria at the instance of Asa ([Kg1
15:20](../kjv/kg1015.htm#020).md), and afterwards by Tiglath-pileser of
Assyria ([Kg2 15:29](../kjv/kg2015.htm#029).md) in the reign of Pekah; now
el-Khiam.

<span id="003">**Ilai**</span> An Ahohite, one of David's chief warriors
([Ch1 11:29](../kjv/ch1011.htm#029).md); called also Zalmon ([Sa2
23:28](../kjv/sa2023.htm#028).md).

<span id="004">**Illyricum**</span> A country to the north-west of
Macedonia, on the eastern shores of the Adriatic, now almost wholly
comprehended in Dalmatia, a name formerly given to the southern part of
Illyricum ([Ti2 4:10](../kjv/ti2004.htm#010).md). It was traversed by Paul
in his third missionary journey ([Rom 15:19](../kjv/rom015.htm#019).md). It
was the farthest district he had reached in preaching the gospel of
Christ. This reference to Illyricum is in harmony with [Act
20:2](../kjv/act020.htm#002.md), inasmuch as the apostle's journey over the
parts of Macedonia would bring him to the borders of Illyricum.

<span id="005">**Imagery**</span> Only in the phrase "chambers of his
imagery" ([Eze 8:12](../kjv/eze008.htm#012)). (See CHAMBER..md)

<span id="006">**Imla**</span> Replenisher, the father of Micaiah the
prophet ([Ch2 18:7](../kjv/ch2018.htm#007.md), [Ch2
18:8](../kjv/ch2018.htm#008).md).

<span id="007">**Immanuel**</span> God with us. In the Old Testament it
occurs only in [Isa 7:14](../kjv/isa007.htm#014.md) and [Isa
8:8](../kjv/isa008.htm#008.md). Most Christian interpreters have regarded
these words as directly and exclusively a prophecy of our Saviour, an
interpretation borne out by the words of the evangelist Matthew ([Mat
1:23](../kjv/mat001.htm#023).md).

<span id="008">**Immer**</span> Talkative. (1.) The head of the
sixteenth priestly order ([Ch1 24:14](../kjv/ch1024.htm#014)). (2..md) [Jer
20:1](../kjv/jer020.htm#001). (3.) [Ezr 2:37](../kjv/ezr002.htm#037.md);
[Neh 7:40](../kjv/neh007.htm#040). (4..md) [Ezr
2:59](../kjv/ezr002.htm#059); [Neh 7:61](../kjv/neh007.htm#061). (5..md)
The father of Zadok ([Neh 3:29](../kjv/neh003.htm#029).md).

<span id="009">**Immortality**</span> Perpetuity of existence. The
doctrine of immortality is taught in the Old Testament. It is plainly
implied in the writings of Moses ([Gen 5:22](../kjv/gen005.htm#022.md),
[Gen 5:24](../kjv/gen005.htm#024); [Gen 25:8](../kjv/gen025.htm#008.md);
[Gen 37:35](../kjv/gen037.htm#035); [Gen 47:9](../kjv/gen047.htm#009.md);
[Gen 49:29](../kjv/gen049.htm#029.md), compare [Heb
11:13](../kjv/heb011.htm#013); [Exo 3:6](../kjv/exo003.htm#006.md), compare
[Mat 22:23](../kjv/mat022.htm#023).md). It is more clearly and fully taught
in the later books ([Isa 14:9](../kjv/isa014.htm#009.md); [Psa
17:15](../kjv/psa017.htm#015); [Psa 49:15](../kjv/psa049.htm#015.md); [Psa
73:24](../kjv/psa073.htm#024).md). It was thus a doctrine obviously well
known to the Jews. With the full revelation of the gospel this doctrine
was "brought to light" ([Ti2 1:10](../kjv/ti2001.htm#010.md); 1 Cor. 15;
[Co2 5:1](../kjv/co2005.htm#001); [Th1 4:13](../kjv/th1004.htm#013).md).
