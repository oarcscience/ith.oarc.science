<span id="000">**Raisins**</span> Dried grapes; mentioned [Sa1
25:18](../kjv/sa1025.htm#018); [Sa1 30:12](../kjv/sa1030.htm#012); [Sa2
16:1](../kjv/sa2016.htm#001); [Ch1 12:40](../kjv/ch1012.htm#040).

<span id="001">**Rakkath**</span> Shore-town, a "fenced city" of the
tribe of Naphtali ([Jos 19:35](../kjv/jos019.htm#035)). The old name of
Tiberias, according to the Rabbins.

<span id="002">**Rakkon**</span> A place upon the shore, a town
belonging to Dan ([Jos 19:46](../kjv/jos019.htm#046)). It is now Tell
er-Rakkeit, 6 miles north of Joppa, on the sea-shore, near the mouth of
the river 'Aujeh , i.e., "yellow water." (See KANAH.)

<span id="003">**Ram**</span> Exalted. (1.) The son of Hezron, and one
of the ancestors of the royal line ([Rut 4:19](../kjv/rut004.htm#019)).
The margin of [Ch1 2:9](../kjv/ch1002.htm#009), also [Mat
1:3](../kjv/mat001.htm#003), [Mat 1:4](../kjv/mat001.htm#004) and [Luk
3:33](../kjv/luk003.htm#033), have "Aram." (2.) One of the sons of
Jerahmeel ([Ch1 2:25](../kjv/ch1002.htm#025), [Ch1
2:27](../kjv/ch1002.htm#027)). (3.) A person mentioned in [Job
32:2](../kjv/job032.htm#002) as founder of a clan to which Elihu
belonged. The same as Aram of [Gen 22:21](../kjv/gen022.htm#021).

<span id="004">**Rama**</span> ([Mat 2:18](../kjv/mat002.htm#018)), the
Greek form of

<span id="005">**Ramah**</span> (1.) A city first mentioned in [Jos
18:25](../kjv/jos018.htm#025), near Gibeah of Benjamin. It was fortified
by Baasha, king of Israel ([Kg1 15:17](../kjv/kg1015.htm#017); [Ch2
16:1](../kjv/ch2016.htm#001)). Asa, king of Judah, employed Benhadad the
Syrian king to drive Baasha from this city ([Kg1
15:18](../kjv/kg1015.htm#018), [Kg1 15:20](../kjv/kg1015.htm#020)).
Isaiah ([Isa 10:29](../kjv/isa010.htm#029)) refers to it, and also
Jeremiah, who was once a prisoner there among the other captives of
Jerusalem when it was taken by Nebuchadnezzar ([Jer
39:8](../kjv/jer039.htm#008); [Jer 40:1](../kjv/jer040.htm#001)).
Rachel, whose tomb lies close to Bethlehem, is represented as weeping in
Ramah ([Jer 31:15](../kjv/jer031.htm#015)) for her slaughtered children.
This prophecy is illustrated and fulfilled in the re-awakening of
Rachel's grief at the slaughter of the infants in Bethlehem ([Mat
2:18](../kjv/mat002.htm#018)). It is identified with the modern village
of er-Ram, between Gibeon and Beeroth, about 5 miles due north of
Jerusalem. (See SAMUEL.) (2.) A town identified with Rameh, on the
border of Asher, about 13 miles south-east of Tyre, "on a solitary hill
in the midst of a basin of green fields" ([Jos
19:29](../kjv/jos019.htm#029)). (3.) One of the "fenced cities" of
Naphtali ([Jos 19:36](../kjv/jos019.htm#036)), on a mountain slope,
about seven and a half miles west-south-west of Safed, and 15 miles west
of the north end of the Sea of Galilee, the present large and well-built
village of Rameh. (4.) The same as Ramathaim-zophim (q.v.), a town of
Mount Ephraim ([Sa1 1:1](../kjv/sa1001.htm#001), [Sa1
1:19](../kjv/sa1001.htm#019)). (5.) The same as Ramoth-gilead (q.v.),
[Kg2 8:29](../kjv/kg2008.htm#029); [Ch2 22:6](../kjv/ch2022.htm#006).

<span id="006">**Ramathaim-zophim**</span> The two heights of the
Zophites or of the watchers (only in [Sa1 1:1](../kjv/sa1001.htm#001)),
"in the land of Zuph" ([Sa1 9:5](../kjv/sa1009.htm#005)). Ramathaim is
another name for Ramah (4). One of the Levitical families descended from
Kohath, that of Zuph or Zophai ([Ch1 6:26](../kjv/ch1006.htm#026), [Ch1
6:35](../kjv/ch1006.htm#035)), had a district assigned to them in
Ephraim, which from this circumstance was called "the land of Zuph," and
hence the name of the town, "Zophim." It was the birth-place of Samuel
and the seat of his authority ([Sa1 2:11](../kjv/sa1002.htm#011); [Sa1
7:17](../kjv/sa1007.htm#017)). It is frequently mentioned in the history
of that prophet and of David ([Sa1 15:34](../kjv/sa1015.htm#034); [Sa1
16:13](../kjv/sa1016.htm#013); [Sa1 19:18](../kjv/sa1019.htm#018)). Here
Samuel died and was buried ([Sa1 25:1](../kjv/sa1025.htm#001)). This
town has been identified with the modern Neby Samwil ("the prophet
Samuel"), about 4 or 5 miles north-west of Jerusalem. But there is no
certainty as to its precise locality. Some have supposed that it may be
identical with Arimathea of the New Testament. (See MIZPAH).

<span id="007">**Ramath-lehi**</span> Elevation of Lehi, or the jawbone
height; i.e., the Ramah of Lehi ([Jdg 15:15](../kjv/jdg015.htm#015)).
The phrase "in the jaw," [Jdg 15:19](../kjv/jdg015.htm#019), Authorized
Version, is in the margin, also in the Revised Version, "in Lehi." Here
Samson slew a thousand Philistines with a jawbone.

<span id="008">**Ramath-mizpeh**</span> The height of Mizpeh or of the
watch-tower ([Jos 13:26](../kjv/jos013.htm#026)), a place mentioned as
one of the limits of Gad. There were two Mizpehs on the east of the
Jordan. This was the Mizpeh where Jacob and Laban made a covenant,
"Mizpeh of Gilead," called also Galeed and Jegar-sahadutha. It has been
identified with the modern es-Salt, where the roads from Jericho and
from Shechem to Damascus unite, about 25 miles east of the Jordan and 13
south of the Jabbok.

<span id="009">**Ramath of the South**</span> (Heb. Ramathnegeb ). The
Heb. negeb is the general designation for south or south-west of Judah.
This was one of the towns of Simeon ([Jos 19:8](../kjv/jos019.htm#008)).
It is the same as "south Ramoth" ([Sa1 30:27](../kjv/sa1030.htm#027);
R.V., "Ramoth of the south"). Its site is doubtful. Some have thought it
another name for Baalath-beer.
