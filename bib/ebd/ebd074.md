<span id="000">**Caterpillar**</span> The consumer. Used in the Old
Testament ([Kg1 8:37](../kjv/kg1008.htm#037.md); [Ch2
6:28](../kjv/ch2006.htm#028); [Psa 78:46](../kjv/psa078.htm#046.md); [Isa
33:4](../kjv/isa033.htm#004)) as the translation of a word (hasil.md) the
root of which means "to devour" or "consume," and which is used also
with reference to the locust in [Deu 28:38](../kjv/deu028.htm#038.md). It
may have been a species of locust, or the name of one of the
transformations through which the locust passes, locust-grub. It is also
found ([Psa 105:34](../kjv/psa105.htm#034.md); [Jer
51:14](../kjv/jer051.htm#014), [Jer 51:27](../kjv/jer051.htm#027.md); R.V.,
"cankerworm") as the rendering of a different Hebrew word, yelek, a word
elsewhere rendered "cankerworm" (q.v.), [Joe
1:4](../kjv/joe001.htm#004); [Joe 2:25](../kjv/joe002.htm#025.md). (See
LOCUST.)

<span id="001">**Catholic Epistles**</span> The epistles of James,
Peter, John, and Jude; so called because they are addressed to
Christians in general, and not to any church or person in particular.

<span id="002">**Cattle**</span> Abounded in the Holy Land. To the
rearing and management of them the inhabitants chiefly devoted
themselves ([Deu 8:13](../kjv/deu008.htm#013.md); [Deu
12:21](../kjv/deu012.htm#021); [Sa1 11:5](../kjv/sa1011.htm#005.md); [Sa1
12:3](../kjv/sa1012.htm#003); [Psa 144:14](../kjv/psa144.htm#014.md); [Jer
3:24](../kjv/jer003.htm#024)). They may be classified as (1..md) Neat
cattle. Many hundreds of these were yearly consumed in sacrifices or
used for food. The finest herds were found in Bashan, beyond Jordan
([Num 32:4](../kjv/num032.htm#004).md). Large herds also pastured on the
wide fertile plains of Sharon. They were yoked to the plough ([Kg1
19:19](../kjv/kg1019.htm#019).md), and were employed for carrying burdens
([Ch1 12:40](../kjv/ch1012.htm#040).md). They were driven with a pointed
rod ([Jdg 3:31](../kjv/jdg003.htm#031)) or goad (q.v..md). According to the
Mosaic law, the mouths of cattle employed for the threshing-floor were
not to be muzzled, so as to prevent them from eating of the provender
over which they trampled ([Deu 25:4](../kjv/deu025.htm#004).md). Whosoever
stole and sold or slaughtered an ox must give five in satisfaction ([Exo
22:1](../kjv/exo022.htm#001).md); but if it was found alive in the
possession of him who stole it, he was required to make double
restitution only ([Exo 22:4](../kjv/exo022.htm#004).md). If an ox went
astray, whoever found it was required to bring it back to its owner
([Exo 23:4](../kjv/exo023.htm#004); [Deu 22:1](../kjv/deu022.htm#001.md),
[Deu 22:4](../kjv/deu022.htm#004).md). An ox and an ass could not be yoked
together in the plough ([Deu 22:10](../kjv/deu022.htm#010)). (2..md) Small
cattle. Next to herds of neat cattle, sheep formed the most important of
the possessions of the inhabitants of Palestine ([Gen
12:16](../kjv/gen012.htm#016); [Gen 13:5](../kjv/gen013.htm#005.md); [Gen
26:14](../kjv/gen026.htm#014); [Gen 21:27](../kjv/gen021.htm#027.md); [Gen
29:2](../kjv/gen029.htm#002), [Gen 29:3](../kjv/gen029.htm#003).md). They
are frequently mentioned among the booty taken in war ([Num
31:32](../kjv/num031.htm#032); [Jos 6:21](../kjv/jos006.htm#021.md); [Sa1
14:32](../kjv/sa1014.htm#032); [Sa1 15:3](../kjv/sa1015.htm#003).md). There
were many who were owners of large flocks ([Sa1
25:2](../kjv/sa1025.htm#002); [Sa2 12:2](../kjv/sa2012.htm#002.md), compare
[Job 1:3](../kjv/job001.htm#003).md). Kings also had shepherds "over their
flocks" ([Ch1 27:31](../kjv/ch1027.htm#031).md), from which they derived a
large portion of their revenue ([Sa2 17:29](../kjv/sa2017.htm#029.md); [Ch1
12:40](../kjv/ch1012.htm#040).md). The districts most famous for their
flocks of sheep were the plain of Sharon ([Isa
65:10](../kjv/isa065.htm#010).md), Mount Carmel ([Mic
7:14](../kjv/mic007.htm#014).md), Bashan and Gilead ([Mic
7:14](../kjv/mic007.htm#014).md). In patriarchal times the flocks of sheep
were sometimes tended by the daughters of the owners. Thus Rachel, the
daughter of Laban, kept her father's sheep ([Gen
29:9](../kjv/gen029.htm#009).md); as also Zipporah and her six sisters had
charge of their father Jethro's flocks ([Exo
2:16](../kjv/exo002.htm#016).md). Sometimes they were kept by hired
shepherds ([Joh 10:12](../kjv/joh010.htm#012).md), and sometimes by the
sons of the family ([Sa1 16:11](../kjv/sa1016.htm#011.md); [Sa1
17:15](../kjv/sa1017.htm#015).md). The keepers so familiarized their sheep
with their voices that they knew them, and followed them at their call.
Sheep, but more especially rams and lambs, were frequently offered in
sacrifice. The shearing of sheep was a great festive occasion ([Sa1
25:4](../kjv/sa1025.htm#004); [Sa2 13:23](../kjv/sa2013.htm#023).md). They
were folded at night, and guarded by their keepers against the attacks
of the lion ([Mic 5:8](../kjv/mic005.htm#008).md), the bear ([Sa1
17:34](../kjv/sa1017.htm#034).md), and the wolf ([Mat
10:16](../kjv/mat010.htm#016); [Joh 10:12](../kjv/joh010.htm#012).md). They
were liable to wander over the wide pastures and go astray ([Psa
119:176](../kjv/psa119.htm#176); [Isa 53:6](../kjv/isa053.htm#006.md); [Hos
4:16](../kjv/hos004.htm#016); [Mat 18:12](../kjv/mat018.htm#012).md). Goats
also formed a part of the pastoral wealth of Palestine ([Gen
15:9](../kjv/gen015.htm#009); [Gen 32:14](../kjv/gen032.htm#014.md); [Gen
37:31](../kjv/gen037.htm#031).md). They were used both for sacrifice and
for food ([Deu 14:4](../kjv/deu014.htm#004).md), especially the young males
([Gen 27:9](../kjv/gen027.htm#009), [Gen 27:14](../kjv/gen027.htm#014.md),
[Gen 27:17](../kjv/gen027.htm#017); [Jdg 6:19](../kjv/jdg006.htm#019.md);
[Jdg 13:15](../kjv/jdg013.htm#015); [Sa1 16:20](../kjv/sa1016.htm#020).md).
Goat's hair was used for making tent cloth ([Exo
26:7](../kjv/exo026.htm#007); [Exo 36:14](../kjv/exo036.htm#014).md), and
for mattresses and bedding ([Sa1 19:13](../kjv/sa1019.htm#013.md), [Sa1
19:16](../kjv/sa1019.htm#016)). (See GOAT..md)

<span id="003">**Caul**</span> (Heb. yothe'reth ; i.e., "something
redundant"), the membrane which covers the upper part of the liver ([Exo
29:13](../kjv/exo029.htm#013), [Exo 29:22](../kjv/exo029.htm#022.md); [Lev
3:4](../kjv/lev003.htm#004), [Lev 3:10](../kjv/lev003.htm#010.md), [Lev
3:15](../kjv/lev003.htm#015); [Lev 4:9](../kjv/lev004.htm#009.md); [Lev
7:4](../kjv/lev007.htm#004); marg., "midriff".md). In [Hos
13:8](../kjv/hos013.htm#008) (Heb. seghor ; i.e., "an enclosure".md) the
pericardium, or parts about the heart, is meant.

<span id="004">**Cauls**</span> In [Isa 3:18](../kjv/isa003.htm#018.md)
this word (Heb. shebisim ), in the marg. "networks," denotes network
caps to contain the hair, worn by females. Others explain it as meaning
"wreaths worn round the forehead, reaching from one ear to the other."

<span id="005">**Causeway**</span> A raised way, an ascent by steps, or
a raised slope between Zion and the temple ([Ch1
26:16](../kjv/ch1026.htm#016), [Ch1 26:18](../kjv/ch1026.htm#018).md). In
[Ch2 9:11](../kjv/ch2009.htm#011.md) the same word is translated "terrace."

<span id="006">**Cave**</span> There are numerous natural caves among
the limestone rocks of Syria, many of which have been artificially
enlarged for various purposes. The first notice of a cave occurs in the
history of Lot ([Gen 19:30](../kjv/gen019.htm#030).md). The next we read of
is the cave of Machpelah (q.v.), which Abraham purchased from the sons
of Heth ([Gen 25:9](../kjv/gen025.htm#009.md), [Gen
25:10](../kjv/gen025.htm#010).md). It was the burying-place of Sarah and of
Abraham himself, also of Isaac, Rebekah, Leah, and Jacob ([Gen
49:31](../kjv/gen049.htm#031); [Gen 50:13](../kjv/gen050.htm#013).md). The
cave of Makkedah, into which the five Amorite kings retired after their
defeat by Joshua ([Jos 10:16](../kjv/jos010.htm#016.md), [Jos
10:27](../kjv/jos010.htm#027)). The cave of Adullam (q.v..md), an immense
natural cavern, where David hid himself from Saul ([Sa1
22:1](../kjv/sa1022.htm#001), [Sa1 22:2](../kjv/sa1022.htm#002).md). The
cave of Engedi (q.v.), now called 'Ain Jidy , i.e., the "Fountain of the
Kid", where David cut off the skirt of Saul's robe ([Sa1
24:4](../kjv/sa1024.htm#004).md). Here he also found a shelter for himself
and his followers to the number of 600 ([Sa1
23:29](../kjv/sa1023.htm#029); [Sa1 24:1](../kjv/sa1024.htm#001).md). "On
all sides the country is full of caverns which might serve as
lurking-places for David and his men, as they do for outlaws at the
present day." The cave in which Obadiah hid the prophets ([Kg1
18:4](../kjv/kg1018.htm#004).md) was probably in the north, but it cannot
be identified. The cave of Elijah ([Kg1 19:9](../kjv/kg1019.htm#009).md),
and the "cleft" of Moses on Horeb ([Exo 33:22](../kjv/exo033.htm#022).md),
cannot be determined. In the time of Gideon the Israelites took refuge
from the Midianites in dens and caves, such as abounded in the mountain
regions of Manasseh ([Jdg 6:2](../kjv/jdg006.htm#002).md). Caves were
frequently used as dwelling-places ([Num 24:21](../kjv/num024.htm#021.md);
[Sol 2:14](../kjv/sol002.htm#014); [Jer 49:16](../kjv/jer049.htm#016.md);
[Oba 1:3](../kjv/oba001.htm#003).md). "The excavations at Deir Dubban, on
the south side of the wady leading to Santa Hanneh, are probably the
dwellings of the Horites," the ancient inhabitants of Idumea Proper. The
pits or cavities in rocks were also sometimes used as prisons ([Isa
24:22](../kjv/isa024.htm#022); [Isa 51:14](../kjv/isa051.htm#014.md); [Zac
9:11](../kjv/zac009.htm#011).md). Those which had niches in their sides
were occupied as burying-places ([Eze 32:23](../kjv/eze032.htm#023.md);
[Joh 11:38](../kjv/joh011.htm#038).md).

<span id="007">**Cedar**</span> (Heb. e'rez , Gr. kedros , Lat. cedrus
), a tree very frequently mentioned in Scripture. It was stately ([Eze
31:3](../kjv/eze031.htm#003).md), long-branched ([Psa
80:10](../kjv/psa080.htm#010); [Psa 92:12](../kjv/psa092.htm#012.md); [Eze
31:6](../kjv/eze031.htm#006).md), odoriferous ([Sol
4:11](../kjv/sol004.htm#011); [Hos 14:6](../kjv/hos014.htm#006).md),
durable, and therefore much used for boards, pillars, and ceilings ([Kg1
6:9](../kjv/kg1006.htm#009), [Kg1 6:10](../kjv/kg1006.htm#010.md); [Kg1
7:2](../kjv/kg1007.htm#002); [Jer 22:14](../kjv/jer022.htm#014).md), for
masts ([Eze 27:5](../kjv/eze027.htm#005).md), and for carved images ([Isa
44:14](../kjv/isa044.htm#014).md). It grew very abundantly in Palestine,
and particularly on Lebanon, of which it was "the glory" ([Isa
35:2](../kjv/isa035.htm#002); [Isa 60:13](../kjv/isa060.htm#013).md). Hiram
supplied Solomon with cedar trees from Lebanon for various purposes
connected with the construction of the temple and the king's palace
([Sa2 5:11](../kjv/sa2005.htm#011); [Sa2 7:2](../kjv/sa2007.htm#002.md),
[Sa2 7:7](../kjv/sa2007.htm#007); [Kg1 5:6](../kjv/kg1005.htm#006.md), [Kg1
5:8](../kjv/kg1005.htm#008), [Kg1 5:10](../kjv/kg1005.htm#010.md); [Kg1
6:9](../kjv/kg1006.htm#009), [Kg1 6:10](../kjv/kg1006.htm#010.md), [Kg1
6:15](../kjv/kg1006.htm#015), [Kg1 6:16](../kjv/kg1006.htm#016.md), [Kg1
6:18](../kjv/kg1006.htm#018), [Kg1 6:20](../kjv/kg1006.htm#020.md); [Kg1
7:2](../kjv/kg1007.htm#002), [Kg1 7:3](../kjv/kg1007.htm#003.md), [Kg1
7:7](../kjv/kg1007.htm#007), [Kg1 7:11](../kjv/kg1007.htm#011.md), [Kg1
7:12](../kjv/kg1007.htm#012); [Kg1 9:11](../kjv/kg1009.htm#011), etc..md).
Cedars were used also in the building of the second temple under
Zerubbabel ([Ezr 3:7](../kjv/ezr003.htm#007).md). Of the ancient cedars of
Lebanon there remain now only some seven or eight. They are not standing
together. But beside them there are found between three hundred and four
hundred of younger growth. They stand in an amphitheatre fronting the
west, about 6,400 feet above the level of the sea. The cedar is often
figuratively alluded to in the sacred Scriptures. "The mighty conquerors
of olden days, the despots of Assyria and the Pharaohs of Egypt, the
proud and idolatrous monarchs of Judah, the Hebrew commonwealth itself,
the warlike Ammonites of patriarchal times, and the moral majesty of the
Messianic age, are all compared to the towering cedar, in its royal
loftiness and supremacy ([Isa 2:13](../kjv/isa002.htm#013.md); [Eze
17:3](../kjv/eze017.htm#003), [Eze 17:22](../kjv/eze017.htm#022.md), [Eze
17:23](../kjv/eze017.htm#023), [Eze 31:3](../kjv/eze031.htm#003.md); [Amo
2:9](../kjv/amo002.htm#009); [Zac 11:1](../kjv/zac011.htm#001.md), [Zac
11:2](../kjv/zac011.htm#002); [Job 40:17](../kjv/job040.htm#017.md); [Psa
29:5](../kjv/psa029.htm#005); [Psa 80:10](../kjv/psa080.htm#010.md); [Psa
92:12](../kjv/psa092.htm#012), etc.md).", Groser's Scrip. Nat. Hist. (See
BOX-TREE.)

<span id="008">**Cedron**</span> The black torrent, the brook flowing
through the ravine below the eastern wall of Jerusalem ([Joh
18:1](../kjv/joh018.htm#001)). (See KIDRON..md)

<span id="009">**Ceiling**</span> The covering ([Kg1
7:3](../kjv/kg1007.htm#003), [Kg1 7:7](../kjv/kg1007.htm#007).md) of the
inside roof and walls of a house with planks of wood ([Ch2
3:5](../kjv/ch2003.htm#005); [Jer 22:14](../kjv/jer022.htm#014).md).
Ceilings were sometimes adorned with various ornaments in stucco, gold,
silver, gems, and ivory. The ceilings of the temple and of Solomon's
palace are described [Kg1 6:9](../kjv/kg1006.htm#009.md), [Kg1
6:15](../kjv/kg1006.htm#015); [Kg1 7:3](../kjv/kg1007.htm#003.md); [Ch2
3:5](../kjv/ch2003.htm#005), [Ch2 3:9](../kjv/ch2003.htm#009.md).
