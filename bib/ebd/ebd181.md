<span id="000">**Homer**</span> Heap, the largest of dry measures,
containing about 8 bushels or 1 quarter English = 10 ephahs ([Lev
27:16](../kjv/lev027.htm#016); [Num 11:32](../kjv/num011.htm#032).md) = a
COR. (See OMER.) "Half a homer," a grain measure mentioned only in [Hos
3:2](../kjv/hos003.htm#002.md).

<span id="001">**Honey**</span> (1.) Heb. ya'ar , occurs only [Sa1
14:25](../kjv/sa1014.htm#025), [Sa1 14:27](../kjv/sa1014.htm#027.md), [Sa1
14:29](../kjv/sa1014.htm#029); [Sol 5:1](../kjv/sol005.htm#001.md), where
it denotes the honey of bees. Properly the word signifies a forest or
copse, and refers to honey found in woods. (2.) Nopheth , honey that
drops ([Psa 19:10](../kjv/psa019.htm#010.md); [Pro
5:3](../kjv/pro005.htm#003); [Sol 4:11](../kjv/sol004.htm#011)). (3..md)
Debash denotes bee-honey ([Jdg 14:8](../kjv/jdg014.htm#008).md); but also
frequently a vegetable honey distilled from trees ([Gen
43:11](../kjv/gen043.htm#011); [Eze 27:17](../kjv/eze027.htm#017).md). In
these passages it may probably mean "dibs," or syrup of grapes, i.e.,
the juice of ripe grapes boiled down to one-third of its bulk. (4.)
Tsuph , the cells of the honey-comb full of honey ([Pro
16:24](../kjv/pro016.htm#024); [Psa 19:10](../kjv/psa019.htm#010)). (5..md)
"Wild honey" ([Mat 3:4](../kjv/mat003.htm#004).md) may have been the
vegetable honey distilled from trees, but rather was honey stored by
bees in rocks or in trees ([Deu 32:13](../kjv/deu032.htm#013.md); [Psa
81:16](../kjv/psa081.htm#016); [Sa1 14:25](../kjv/sa1014.htm#025).md).
Canaan was a "land flowing with milk and honey" ([Exo
3:8](../kjv/exo003.htm#008).md). Milk and honey were among the chief
dainties in the earlier ages, as they are now among the Bedawin; and
butter and honey are also mentioned among articles of food ([Isa
7:15](../kjv/isa007.htm#015).md). The ancients used honey instead of sugar
([Psa 119:103](../kjv/psa119.htm#103.md); [Pro
24:13](../kjv/pro024.htm#013).md); but when taken in great quantities it
caused nausea, a fact referred to in [Pro 25:16](../kjv/pro025.htm#016.md),
[Pro 25:17](../kjv/pro025.htm#017.md) to inculcate moderation in pleasures.
Honey and milk also are put for sweet discourse ([Sol
4:11](../kjv/sol004.htm#011).md).

<span id="002">**Hood**</span> (Heb. tsaniph ) a tiara round the head
([Isa 3:23](../kjv/isa003.htm#023); R.V., pl., "turbans".md). Rendered
"diadem," [Job 29:14](../kjv/job029.htm#014.md); high priest's "mitre,"
[Zac 3:5](../kjv/zac003.htm#005.md); "royal diadem," [Isa
62:3](../kjv/isa062.htm#003.md).

<span id="003">**Hoof**</span> A cleft hoof as of neat cattle ([Exo
10:26](../kjv/exo010.htm#026); [Eze 32:13](../kjv/eze032.htm#013).md);
hence also of the horse, though not cloven ([Isa
5:28](../kjv/isa005.htm#028).md). The "parting of the hoof" is one of the
distinctions between clean and unclean animals ([Lev
11:3](../kjv/lev011.htm#003); [Deu 14:7](../kjv/deu014.htm#007).md).

<span id="004">**Hook**</span> (1.) Heb. hah , a "ring" inserted in the
nostrils of animals to which a cord was fastened for the purpose of
restraining them ([Kg2 19:28](../kjv/kg2019.htm#028.md); [Isa
37:28](../kjv/isa037.htm#028), [Isa 37:29](../kjv/isa037.htm#029.md); [Eze
29:4](../kjv/eze029.htm#004); [Eze 38:4](../kjv/eze038.htm#004).md). "The
Orientals make use of this contrivance for curbing their work-beasts...
When a beast becomes unruly they have only to draw the cord on one side,
which, by stopping his breath, punishes him so effectually that after a
few repetitions he fails not to become quite tractable whenever he
begins to feel it" (Michaelis). So God's agents are never beyond his
control. (2.) Hakkah , a fish "hook" ([Job 41:2](../kjv/job041.htm#002.md),
Heb. Text, Job 40:25; [Isa 19:8](../kjv/isa019.htm#008.md); [Hab
1:15](../kjv/hab001.htm#015)). (3..md) Vav , a "peg" on which the curtains
of the tabernacle were hung ([Exo 26:32](../kjv/exo026.htm#032)). (4..md)
Tsinnah , a fish-hooks ([Amo 4:2](../kjv/amo004.htm#002)). (5..md) Mazleg ,
flesh-hooks ([Sa1 2:13](../kjv/sa1002.htm#013.md), [Sa1
2:14](../kjv/sa1002.htm#014).md), a kind of fork with three teeth for
turning the sacrifices on the fire, etc. (6.) Mazmeroth , pruning-hooks
([Isa 2:4](../kjv/isa002.htm#004); [Joe 3:10](../kjv/joe003.htm#010).md).
(7.) 'Agmon ([Job 41:2](../kjv/job041.htm#002), Heb. Text, Job 40:26.md),
incorrectly rendered in the Authorized Version. Properly a rush-rope for
binding animals, as in Revised Version margin.

<span id="005">**Hope**</span> One of the three main elements of
Christian character ([Co1 13:13](../kjv/co1013.htm#013).md). It is joined
to faith and love, and is opposed to seeing or possessing ([Rom
8:24](../kjv/rom008.htm#024); [Jo1 3:2](../kjv/jo1003.htm#002).md). "Hope
is an essential and fundamental element of Christian life, so essential
indeed, that, like faith and love, it can itself designate the essence
of Christianity ([Pe1 3:15](../kjv/pe1003.htm#015.md); [Heb
10:23](../kjv/heb010.htm#023).md). In it the whole glory of the Christian
vocation is centred ([Eph 1:18](../kjv/eph001.htm#018.md); [Eph
4:4](../kjv/eph004.htm#004).md)." Unbelievers are without this hope ([Eph
2:12](../kjv/eph002.htm#012); [Th1 4:13](../kjv/th1004.htm#013).md). Christ
is the actual object of the believer's hope, because it is in his second
coming that the hope of glory will be fulfilled ([Ti1
1:1](../kjv/ti1001.htm#001); [Col 1:27](../kjv/col001.htm#027.md); [Tit
2:13](../kjv/tit002.htm#013).md). It is spoken of as "lively", i.e., a
living, hope, a hope not frail and perishable, but having a perennial
life ([Pe1 1:3](../kjv/pe1001.htm#003).md). In [Rom
5:2](../kjv/rom005.htm#002.md) the "hope" spoken of is probably objective,
i.e., "the hope set before us," namely, eternal life (compare [Rom
12:12](../kjv/rom012.htm#012)). In [Jo1 3:3](../kjv/jo1003.htm#003.md) the
expression "hope in him" ought rather to be, as in the Revised Version,
"hope on him," i.e., a hope based on God.

<span id="006">**Hophni**</span> Pugilist or client, one of the two sons
of Eli, the high priest ([Sa1 1:3](../kjv/sa1001.htm#003.md); [Sa1
2:34](../kjv/sa1002.htm#034).md), who, because he was "very old," resigned
to them the active duties of his office. By their scandalous conduct
they brought down a curse on their father's house ([Sa1
2:22](../kjv/sa1002.htm#022), 12-27, [Sa1 2:27](../kjv/sa1002.htm#027.md);
[Sa1 3:11](../kjv/sa1003.htm#011).md). For their wickedness they were
called "sons of Belial," i.e., worthless men ([Sa1
2:12](../kjv/sa1002.htm#012).md). They both perished in the disastrous
battle with the Philistines at Aphek ([Sa1
4:11](../kjv/sa1004.htm#011)). (See PHINEHAS..md)

<span id="007">**Hophra**</span> I.e., PHARAOH-HOPHRA (called Apries by
the Greek historian Herodotus) king of Egypt (591-572 B.C.) in the time
of Zedekiah, king of Judah ([Jer 37:5](../kjv/jer037.htm#005.md) [Jer
44:30](../kjv/jer044.htm#030); [Eze 29:6](../kjv/eze029.htm#006.md), [Eze
29:7](../kjv/eze029.htm#007).md).

<span id="008">**Hor**</span> Mountain. (1.) One of the mountains of the
chain of Seir or Edom, on the confines of Idumea ([Num
20:22](../kjv/num020.htm#022); [Num 33:37](../kjv/num033.htm#037).md). It
was one of the stations of the Israelites in the wilderness ([Num
33:37](../kjv/num033.htm#037).md), which they reached in the circuitous
route they were obliged to take because the Edomites refused them a
passage through their territory. It was during the encampment here that
Aaron died ([Num 33:37](../kjv/num033.htm#037)). (See AARON..md) The
Israelites passed this mountain several times in their wanderings. It
bears the modern name of Jebel Harun, and is the highest and most
conspicuous of the whole range. It stands about midway between the Dead
Sea and the Elanitic gulf. It has two summits, in the hallow between
which it is supposed that Aaron died. Others, however, suppose that this
mountain is the modern Jebel Madurah, on the opposite, i.e., the
western, side of the Arabah. (2.) One of the marks of the northern
boundary of Palestine ([Num 34:7](../kjv/num034.htm#007.md), [Num
34:8](../kjv/num034.htm#008).md). Nowhere else mentioned. Perhaps it is one
of the peaks of Lebanon.

<span id="009">**Horeb**</span> Desert or mountain of the dried up
ground, a general name for the whole mountain range of which Sinai was
one of the summits ([Exo 3:1](../kjv/exo003.htm#001.md); [Exo
17:6](../kjv/exo017.htm#006); [Exo 33:6](../kjv/exo033.htm#006.md); [Psa
106:19](../kjv/psa106.htm#019), etc..md). The modern name of the whole
range is Jebel Musa. It is a huge mountain block, about 2 miles long by
about 1 in breadth, with a very spacious plain at its north-east end,
called the Er Rahah, in which the Israelites encamped for nearly a whole
year. (See SINAI.)
