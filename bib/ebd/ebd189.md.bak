<span id="000">**Ira**</span> Citizen; wakeful. (1.) A Tekoite, one of
David's thirty warriors ([Sa2 23:26](../kjv/sa2023.htm#026)). (2..md) An
Ithrite, also one of David's heroes ([Sa2
23:38](../kjv/sa2023.htm#038)). (3..md) A Jairite and priest, a royal
chaplain ([Sa2 20:26](../kjv/sa2020.htm#026).md) or confidential adviser
(compare [Sa2 8:18](../kjv/sa2008.htm#018.md); [Ch1
18:17](../kjv/ch1018.htm#017).md).

<span id="001">**Irad**</span> Runner; wild ass, one of the antediluvian
patriarchs, the father of Mehujael ([Gen 4:18](../kjv/gen004.htm#018).md),
and grandson of Cain.

<span id="002">**Iram**</span> Citizen, chief of an Edomite tribe in
Mount Seir ([Gen 36:43](../kjv/gen036.htm#043).md).

<span id="003">**Irha-heres**</span> According to some MSS., meaning
"city of destruction." Other MSS. read 'Irhahares ; rendered "city of
the sun", [Isa 19:18](../kjv/isa019.htm#018.md), where alone the word
occurs. This name may probably refer to Heliopolis. The prophecy here
points to a time when the Jews would so increase in number there as that
the city would fall under their influence. This might be in the time of
the Ptolemies. (See ON.)

<span id="004">**Iron**</span> Tubal-Cain is the first-mentioned worker
in iron ([Gen 4:22](../kjv/gen004.htm#022).md). The Egyptians wrought it at
Sinai before the Exodus. David prepared it in great abundance for the
temple ([Ch1 22:3](../kjv/ch1022.htm#003.md); [Ch1
29:7](../kjv/ch1029.htm#007).md). The merchants of Dan and Javan brought it
to the market of Tyre ([Eze 27:19](../kjv/eze027.htm#019).md). Various
instruments are mentioned as made of iron ([Deu
27:5](../kjv/deu027.htm#005); [Deu 19:5](../kjv/deu019.htm#005.md); [Jos
17:16](../kjv/jos017.htm#016), [Jos 17:18](../kjv/jos017.htm#018.md); [Sa1
17:7](../kjv/sa1017.htm#007); [Sa2 12:31](../kjv/sa2012.htm#031.md); [Kg2
6:5](../kjv/kg2006.htm#005), [Kg2 6:6](../kjv/kg2006.htm#006.md); [Ch1
22:3](../kjv/ch1022.htm#003); [Isa 10:34](../kjv/isa010.htm#034).md).
Figuratively, a yoke of iron ([Deu 28:48](../kjv/deu028.htm#048).md)
denotes hard service; a rod of iron ([Psa 2:9](../kjv/psa002.htm#009).md),
a stern government; a pillar of iron ([Jer
1:18](../kjv/jer001.htm#018).md), a strong support; a furnace of iron ([Deu
4:20](../kjv/deu004.htm#020).md), severe labour; a bar of iron ([Job
40:18](../kjv/job040.htm#018).md), strength; fetters of iron ([Psa
107:10](../kjv/psa107.htm#010).md), affliction; giving silver for iron
([Isa 60:17](../kjv/isa060.htm#017).md), prosperity.

<span id="005">**Irrigation**</span> As streams were few in Palestine,
water was generally stored up in winter in reservoirs, and distributed
through gardens in numerous rills, which could easily be turned or
diverted by the foot ([Deu 11:10](../kjv/deu011.htm#010).md). For purposes
of irrigation, water was raised from streams or pools by waterwheels, or
by a shaduf, commonly used on the banks of the Nile to the present day.

<span id="006">**Isaac**</span> Laughter. (1.) Israel, or the kingdom of
the ten tribes ([Amo 7:9](../kjv/amo007.htm#009.md), [Amo
7:16](../kjv/amo007.htm#016)). (2..md) The only son of Abraham by Sarah. He
was the longest lived of the three patriarchs ([Gen
21:1](../kjv/gen021.htm#001).md). He was circumcised when eight days old
([Gen 21:4](../kjv/gen021.htm#004).md); and when he was probably two years
old a great feast was held in connection with his being weaned. The next
memorable event in his life is that connected with the command of God
given to Abraham to offer him up as a sacrifice on a mountain in the
land of Moriah (Gen. 22). (See ABRAHAM.) When he was forty years of age
Rebekah was chosen for his wife (Gen. 24). After the death and burial of
his father he took up his residence at Beer-lahai-roi ([Gen
25:7](../kjv/gen025.htm#007).md), where his two sons, Esau and Jacob, were
born ([Gen 25:21](../kjv/gen025.htm#021).md), the former of whom seems to
have been his favourite son ([Gen 25:27](../kjv/gen025.htm#027.md), [Gen
25:28](../kjv/gen025.htm#028).md). In consequence of a famine ([Gen
26:1](../kjv/gen026.htm#001).md) Isaac went to Gerar, where he practiced
deception as to his relation to Rebekah, imitating the conduct of his
father in Egypt ([Gen 12:12](../kjv/gen012.htm#012).md) and in Gerar ([Gen
20:2](../kjv/gen020.htm#002).md). The Philistine king rebuked him for his
prevarication. After sojourning for some time in the land of the
Philistines, he returned to Beersheba, where God gave him fresh
assurance of covenant blessing, and where Abimelech entered into a
covenant of peace with him. The next chief event in his life was the
blessing of his sons ([Gen 27:1](../kjv/gen027.htm#001).md). He died at
Mamre, "being old and full of days" ([Gen
35:27](../kjv/gen035.htm#027).md), one hundred and eighty years old, and
was buried in the cave of Machpelah. In the New Testament reference is
made to his having been "offered up" by his father ([Heb
11:17](../kjv/heb011.htm#017); [Jam 2:21](../kjv/jam002.htm#021).md), and
to his blessing his sons ([Heb 11:20](../kjv/heb011.htm#020).md). As the
child of promise, he is contrasted with Ishmael ([Rom
9:7](../kjv/rom009.htm#007), [Rom 9:10](../kjv/rom009.htm#010.md); [Gal
4:28](../kjv/gal004.htm#028); [Heb 11:18](../kjv/heb011.htm#018).md). Isaac
is "at once a counterpart of his father in simple devoutness and purity
of life, and a contrast in his passive weakness of character, which in
part, at least, may have sprung from his relations to his mother and
wife. After the expulsion of Ishmael and Hagar, Isaac had no competitor,
and grew up in the shade of Sarah's tent, moulded into feminine softness
by habitual submission to her strong, loving will." His life was so
quiet and uneventful that it was spent "within the circle of a few
miles; so guileless that he let Jacob overreach him rather than
disbelieve his assurance; so tender that his mother's death was the
poignant sorrow of years; so patient and gentle that peace with his
neighbours was dearer than even such a coveted possession as a well of
living water dug by his own men; so grandly obedient that he put his
life at his father's disposal; so firm in his reliance on God that his
greatest concern through life was to honour the divine promise given to
his race." Geikie's Hours, etc.

<span id="007">**Isaiah**</span> (Heb. Yeshyahu , i.e., "the salvation
of Jehovah"). (1.) The son of Amoz ([Isa 1:1](../kjv/isa001.htm#001.md);
[Isa 2:1](../kjv/isa002.htm#001).md), who was apparently a man of humble
rank. His wife was called "the prophetess" ([Isa
8:3](../kjv/isa008.htm#003).md), either because she was endowed with the
prophetic gift, like Deborah ([Jdg 4:4](../kjv/jdg004.htm#004).md) and
Huldah ([Kg2 22:14](../kjv/kg2022.htm#014).md), or simply because she was
the wife of "the prophet" ([Isa 38:1](../kjv/isa038.htm#001).md). He had
two sons, who bore symbolical names. He exercised the functions of his
office during the reigns of Uzziah (or Azariah), Jotham, Ahaz, and
Hezekiah ([Isa 1:1](../kjv/isa001.htm#001).md). Uzziah reigned fifty-two
years (810-759 B.C.), and Isaiah must have begun his career a few years
before Uzziah's death, probably 762 B.C.. He lived till the fourteenth
year of Hezekiah, and in all likelihood outlived that monarch (who died
698 B.C.), and may have been contemporary for some years with Manasseh.
Thus Isaiah may have prophesied for the long period of at least
sixty-four years. His first call to the prophetical office is not
recorded. A second call came to him "in the year that King Uzziah died"
([Isa 6:1](../kjv/isa006.htm#001).md). He exercised his ministry in a
spirit of uncompromising firmness and boldness in regard to all that
bore on the interests of religion. He conceals nothing and keeps nothing
back from fear of man. He was also noted for his spirituality and for
his deep-toned reverence toward " the holy One of Israel." In early
youth Isaiah must have been moved by the invasion of Israel by the
Assyrian monarch Pul (q.v.), [Kg2 15:19](../kjv/kg2015.htm#019.md); and
again, twenty years later, when he had already entered on his office, by
the invasion of Tiglath-pileser and his career of conquest. Ahaz, king
of Judah, at this crisis refused to co-operate with the kings of Israel
and Syria in opposition to the Assyrians, and was on that account
attacked and defeated by Rezin of Damascus and Pekah of Samaria ([Kg2
16:5](../kjv/kg2016.htm#005); [Ch2 28:5](../kjv/ch2028.htm#005.md), [Ch2
28:6](../kjv/ch2028.htm#006).md). Ahaz, thus humbled, sided with Assyria,
and sought the aid of Tiglathpileser against Israel and Syria. The
consequence was that Rezin and Pekah were conquered and many of the
people carried captive to Assyria ([Kg2 15:29](../kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md);
[Kg2 16:9](../kjv/kg2016.htm#009); [Ch1 5:26](../kjv/ch1005.htm#026).md).
Soon after this Shalmaneser determined wholly to subdue the kingdom of
Israel. Samaria was taken and destroyed (722 B.C.). So long as Ahaz
reigned, the kingdom of Judah was unmolested by the Assyrian power; but
on his accession to the throne, Hezekiah (726 B.C.), who "rebelled
against the king of Assyria" ([Kg2 18:7](../kjv/kg2018.htm#007).md), in
which he was encouraged by Isaiah, who exhorted the people to place all
their dependence on Jehovah ([Isa 10:24](../kjv/isa010.htm#024.md); [Isa
37:6](../kjv/isa037.htm#006).md), entered into an alliance with the king of
Egypt ([Isa 30:2](../kjv/isa030.htm#002).md). This led the king of Assyria
to threaten the king of Judah, and at length to invade the land.
Sennacherib (701 B.C.) led a powerful army into Palestine. Hezekiah was
reduced to despair, and submitted to the Assyrians ([Kg2
18:14](../kjv/kg2018.htm#014).md). But after a brief interval war broke out
again, and again Sennacherib (q.v.) led an army into Palestine, one
detachment of which threatened Jerusalem (Isa. 36:2-22; [Isa
37:8](../kjv/isa037.htm#008).md). Isaiah on that occasion encouraged
Hezekiah to resist the Assyrians ([Isa 37:1](../kjv/isa037.htm#001).md),
whereupon Sennacherib sent a threatening letter to Hezekiah, which he
"spread before the Lord" ([Isa 37:14](../kjv/isa037.htm#014).md). The
judgment of God now fell on the Assyrian host. "Like Xerxes in Greece,
Sennacherib never recovered from the shock of the disaster in Judah. He
made no more expeditions against either Southern Palestine or Egypt."
The remaining years of Hezekiah's reign were peaceful ([Ch2
32:23](../kjv/ch2032.htm#023), [Ch2 32:27](../kjv/ch2032.htm#027).md).
Isaiah probably lived to its close, and possibly into the reign of
Manasseh, but the time and manner of his death are unknown. There is a
tradition that he suffered martyrdom in the heathen reaction in the time
of Manasseh (q.v.). (2.) One of the heads of the singers in the time of
David ([Ch1 25:3](../kjv/ch1025.htm#003.md), [Ch1
25:15](../kjv/ch1025.htm#015), "Jeshaiah"). (3..md) A Levite ([Ch1
26:25](../kjv/ch1026.htm#025)). (4.) [Ezr 8:7](../kjv/ezr008.htm#007.md).
(5.) [Neh 11:7](../kjv/neh011.htm#007.md).

<span id="008">**Isaiah, The Book of**</span> Consists of prophecies
delivered (Isa. 1) (1.) in the reign of Uzziah (Isa. 1 - 5), (2.) of
Jotham ([Isa 6:1](../kjv/isa006.htm#001)), (3.) Ahaz (Isa. 7 - 14:28.md),
(4.) the first half of Hezekiah's reign (Isa. 14:28 - 35), (5.) the
second half of Hezekiah's reign (Isa. 36 - 66). Thus, counting from the
fourth year before Uzziah's death (762 B.C.) to the last year of
Hezekiah (698 B.C.), Isaiah's ministry extended over a period of
sixty-four years. He may, however, have survived Hezekiah, and may have
perished in the way indicated above. The book, as a whole, has been
divided into three main parts: (1.) The first thirty-five chapters,
almost wholly prophetic, Israel's enemy Assyria, present the Messiah as
a mighty Ruler and King. (2.) Four chapters are historical (Isa. 36 -
39), relating to the times of Hezekiah. (3.) Prophetical (Isa. 40 - 66),
Israel's enemy Babylon, describing the Messiah as a suffering victim,
meek and lowly. The genuineness of the section Isa. 40 - 66 has been
keenly opposed by able critics. They assert that it must be the
production of a deutero-Isaiah, who lived toward the close of the
Babylonian captivity. This theory was originated by Koppe, a German
writer at the close of the last century. There are other portions of the
book also (e.g., Isa. 13; 24 - 27; and certain verses in Isa. 14 and
Isa. 21) which they attribute to some other prophet than Isaiah. Thus
they say that some five or seven, or even more, unknown prophets had a
hand in the production of this book. The considerations which have led
to such a result are various: (1.) They cannot, as some say, conceive it
possible that Isaiah, living in 700 B.C., could foretell the appearance
and the exploits of a prince called Cyrus, who would set the Jews free
from captivity one hundred and seventy years after. (2.) It is alleged
that the prophet takes the time of the Captivity as his standpoint, and
speaks of it as then present; and (3.) that there is such a difference
between the style and language of the closing section (Isa. 40 - 66) and
those of the preceding chapters as to necessitate a different
authorship, and lead to the conclusion that there were at least two
Isaiahs. But even granting the fact of a great diversity of style and
language, this will not necessitate the conclusion attempted to be drawn
from it. The diversity of subjects treated of and the peculiarities of
the prophet's position at the time the prophecies were uttered will
sufficiently account for this. The arguments in favour of the unity of
the book are quite conclusive. When the LXX. version was made (about 250
B.C.) the entire contents of the book were ascribed to Isaiah, the son
of Amoz. It is not called in question, moreover, that in the time of our
Lord the book existed in the form in which we now have it. Many
prophecies in the disputed portions are quoted in the New Testament as
the words of Isaiah ([Mat 3:3](../kjv/mat003.htm#003.md); [Luk
3:4](../kjv/luk003.htm#004.md); 4:16-41; [Joh
12:38](../kjv/joh012.htm#038); [Act 8:28](../kjv/act008.htm#028.md); [Rom
10:16](../kjv/rom010.htm#016).md). Universal and persistent tradition has
ascribed the whole book to one author. Besides this, the internal
evidence, the similarity in the language and style, in the thoughts and
images and rhetorical ornaments, all points to the same conclusion; and
its local colouring and allusions show that it is obviously of
Palestinian origin. The theory therefore of a double authorship of the
book, much less of a manifold authorship, cannot be maintained. The
book, with all the diversity of its contents, is one, and is, we
believe, the production of the great prophet whose name it bears.

Milcah and Lot ([Gen 11:29](../kjv/gen011.htm#029.md), [Gen
11:31](../kjv/gen011.htm#031).md).
