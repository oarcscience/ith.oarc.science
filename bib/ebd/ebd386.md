<span id="000">**Zabud**</span> Gift, the son of Nathan, who was "king's
friend" in the court of Solomon ([Kg1 4:5](../kjv/kg1004.htm#005)).

<span id="001">**Zabulon**</span> ([Mat 4:13](../kjv/mat004.htm#013),
[Mat 4:15](../kjv/mat004.htm#015); [Rev 7:8](../kjv/rev007.htm#008)).
See ZEBULUN.

<span id="002">**Zaccai**</span> Pure, one whose "sons" returned with
Zerubbabel to Jerusalem ([Ezr 2:9](../kjv/ezr002.htm#009); [Neh
7:14](../kjv/neh007.htm#014)). (See ZABBAI.)

<span id="003">**Zacchaeus**</span> Pure, a superintendent of customs; a
chief tax-gather (publicanus) at Jericho ([Luk
19:1](../kjv/luk019.htm#001)). "The collection of customs at Jericho,
which at this time produced and exported a considerable quantity of
balsam, was undoubtedly an important post, and would account for
Zacchaeus being a rich man." Being short of stature, he hastened on
before the multitude who were thronging about Christ as he passed
through Jericho on his way to Jerusalem, and climbed up a sycamore tree
that he might be able to see him. When our Lord reached the spot he
looked up to the publican among the branches, and addressing him by
name, told him to make haste and come down, as he intended that day to
abide at his house. This led to the remarkable interview recorded by the
evangelist, and to the striking parable of the ten pounds (Luke
19:12-27). At Er-riha (Jericho) there is a large, venerable-looking
square tower, which goes by the traditional name of the House of
Zacchaeus.

<span id="004">**Zaccur**</span> Mindful. (1.) Father of Shammua, who
was one of the spies sent out by Moses ([Num
13:4](../kjv/num013.htm#004)). (2.) A Merarite Levite ([Ch1
24:27](../kjv/ch1024.htm#027)). (3.) A son of Asaph, and chief of one of
the courses of singers as arranged by David ([Ch1
25:2](../kjv/ch1025.htm#002), [Ch1 25:10](../kjv/ch1025.htm#010)). (4.)
Son of Imri ([Neh 3:2](../kjv/neh003.htm#002)). (5.) A Levite ([Neh
10:12](../kjv/neh010.htm#012)). (6.) The son of Mattaniah ([Neh
13:13](../kjv/neh013.htm#013)).

<span id="005">**Zachariah**</span> Remembered by the Lord. (1.) Son of
Jeroboam II., king of Israel. On the death of his father there was an
interregnum of ten years, at the end of which he succeeded to the
throne, which he occupied only six months, having been put to death by
Shallum, who usurped the throne. "He did that which was evil in the
sight of the Lord, as his fathers had done" ([Kg2
14:29](../kjv/kg2014.htm#029); [Kg2 15:8](../kjv/kg2015.htm#008)). In
him the dynasty of Jehu came to an end. (2.) The father of Abi, who was
the mother of Hezekiah ([Kg2 18:2](../kjv/kg2018.htm#002)).

<span id="006">**Zacharias**</span> (1.) A priest of the course of Abia,
the eighth of the twenty-four courses into which the priests had been
originally divided by David (1 Chr. 23:1-19). Only four of these courses
or "families" of the priests returned from the Exile ([Ezr
2:36](../kjv/ezr002.htm#036)); but they were then re-distributed under
the old designations. The priests served at the temple twice each year,
and only for a week each time. Zacharias's time had come for this
service. During this period his home would be one of the chambers set
apart for the priests on the sides of the temple ground. The offering of
incense was one of the most solemn parts of the daily worship of the
temple, and lots were drawn each day to determine who should have this
great honour-an honour which no priest could enjoy more than once during
his lifetime. While Zacharias ministered at the golden altar of incense
in the holy place, it was announced to him by the angel Gabriel that his
wife Elisabeth, who was also of a priestly family, now stricken in
years, would give birth to a son who was to be called John, and that he
would be the forerunner of the long-expected Messiah ([Luk
1:12](../kjv/luk001.htm#012)). As a punishment for his refusing to
believe this message, he was struck dumb and "not able to speak until
the day that these things should be performed" ([Luk
1:20](../kjv/luk001.htm#020)). Nine months passed away, and Elisabeth's
child was born, and when in answer to their inquiry Zacharias wrote on a
"writing tablet," "His name is John," his mouth was opened, and he
praised God (Luke 1:60-79). The child (John the Baptist), thus "born out
of due time," "waxed strong in spirit" ([Luk
1:80](../kjv/luk001.htm#080)). (2.) The "son of Barachias," mentioned as
having been slain between the temple and the altar ([Mat
23:35](../kjv/mat023.htm#035); [Luk 11:51](../kjv/luk011.htm#051)).
"Barachias" here may be another name for Jehoiada, as some think. (See
ZECHARIAH.)

<span id="007">**Zacher**</span> Memorial, a son of Jehiel ([Ch1
8:31](../kjv/ch1008.htm#031); [Ch1 9:35](../kjv/ch1009.htm#035)); called
Zechariah ([Ch1 9:37](../kjv/ch1009.htm#037)).

<span id="008">**Zadok**</span> Righteous. (1.) A son of Ahitub, of the
line of Eleazer ([Sa2 8:17](../kjv/sa2008.htm#017); [Ch1
24:3](../kjv/ch1024.htm#003)), high priest in the time of David ([Sa2
20:25](../kjv/sa2020.htm#025)) and Solomon ([Kg1
4:4](../kjv/kg1004.htm#004)). He is first mentioned as coming to take
part with David at Hebron ([Ch1 12:27](../kjv/ch1012.htm#027), [Ch1
12:28](../kjv/ch1012.htm#028)). He was probably on this account made
ruler over the Aaronites ([Ch1 27:17](../kjv/ch1027.htm#017)). Zadok and
Abiathar acted as high priests on several important occasions ([Ch1
15:11](../kjv/ch1015.htm#011); [Sa2 15:24](../kjv/sa2015.htm#024), [Sa2
15:35](../kjv/sa2015.htm#035), [Sa2 15:36](../kjv/sa2015.htm#036)); but
when Adonijah endeavoured to secure the throne, Abiathar went with him,
and therefore Solomon "thrust him out from being high priest," and
Zadok, remaining faithful to David, became high priest alone ([Kg1
2:27](../kjv/kg1002.htm#027), [Kg1 2:35](../kjv/kg1002.htm#035); [Ch1
29:22](../kjv/ch1029.htm#022)). In him the line of Phinehas resumed the
dignity, and held it till the fall of Jerusalem. He was succeeded in his
sacred office by his son Azariah ([Kg1 4:2](../kjv/kg1004.htm#002);
compare [Ch1 6:3](../kjv/ch1006.htm#003)). (2.) The father of Jerusha,
who was wife of King Uzziah, and mother of King Jotham ([Kg2
15:33](../kjv/kg2015.htm#033); [Ch2 27:1](../kjv/ch2027.htm#001)). (3.)
"The scribe" set over the treasuries of the temple by Nehemiah along
with a priest and a Levite ([Neh 13:13](../kjv/neh013.htm#013)). (4.)
The sons of Baana, one of those who assisted in rebuilding the wall of
Jerusalem ([Neh 3:4](../kjv/neh003.htm#004)).

<span id="009">**Zair**</span> Little, a place probably east of the Dead
Sea, where Joram discomfited the host of Edom who had revolted from him
([Kg2 8:21](../kjv/kg2008.htm#021)).
