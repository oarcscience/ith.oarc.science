<span id="000">**Yoke-fellow**</span> ([Phi
4:3](../kjv/phi004.htm#003).md), one of the apostle's fellow-labourers.
Some have conjectured that Epaphroditus is meant. Wyckliffe renders the
phrase "the german fellow", i.e., "thee, germane \[= genuine\] comrade."

<span id="001">**Zaanaim**</span> Wanderings; the unloading of tents, so
called probably from the fact of nomads in tents encamping amid the
cities and villages of that region, a place in the north-west of Lake
Merom, near Kedesh, in Naphtali. Here Sisera was slain by Jael, "the
wife of Heber the Kenite," who had pitched his tent in the "plain
\[R.V., 'as far as the oak'\] of Zaanaim" ([Jdg
4:11](../kjv/jdg004.htm#011).md). It has been, however, suggested by some
that, following the LXX. and the Talmud, the letter b, which in Hebrew
means "in," should be taken as a part of the word following, and the
phrase would then be "unto the oak of Bitzanaim," a place which has been
identified with the ruins of Bessum, about half-way between Tiberias and
Mount Tabor.

<span id="002">**Zaanan**</span> Place of flocks, mentioned only in [Mic
1:11](../kjv/mic001.htm#011.md). It may be identified with Zenan, in the
plain country of Judah ([Jos 15:37](../kjv/jos015.htm#037).md).

<span id="003">**Zaanannim**</span> =Zaanaim ([Jos
19:33](../kjv/jos019.htm#033).md).

<span id="004">**Zaavan**</span> Terror, one of the "dukes of Edom"
([Gen 36:27](../kjv/gen036.htm#027).md); called also Zavan ([Ch1
1:42](../kjv/ch1001.htm#042).md).

<span id="005">**Zabad**</span> Gift. (1.) One of David's valiant men
([Ch1 11:41](../kjv/ch1011.htm#041).md), the descendant of Ahlai, of the
"children of Sheshan" ([Ch1 2:31](../kjv/ch1002.htm#031)). (2..md) A
descendant of Tahath ([Ch1 7:21](../kjv/ch1007.htm#021)). (3..md) The son
of Shemath. He conspired against Joash, king of Judah, and slew him
([Ch2 24:25](../kjv/ch2024.htm#025.md), [Ch2
24:26](../kjv/ch2024.htm#026).md). He is called also Jozachar ([Kg2
12:21](../kjv/kg2012.htm#021)). (4.) [Ezr 10:27](../kjv/ezr010.htm#027.md).
(5.) [Ezr 10:33](../kjv/ezr010.htm#033). (6..md) [Ezr
10:43](../kjv/ezr010.htm#043.md).

<span id="006">**Zabbai**</span> Wanderer; pure. (1.) [Ezr
10:28](../kjv/ezr010.htm#028). (2..md) The father of Baruch, who "earnestly
repaired" part of the wall of Jerusalem ([Neh
3:20](../kjv/neh003.htm#020); marg., "Zaccai".md).

<span id="007">**Zabbud**</span> Gift, [Ezr
8:14](../kjv/ezr008.htm#014.md).

<span id="008">**Zabdi**</span> Gift of Jehovah. (1.) An ancestor of
Achan ([Jos 7:1](../kjv/jos007.htm#001.md), [Jos
7:17](../kjv/jos007.htm#017), [Jos 7:18](../kjv/jos007.htm#018).md). He is
probably the "Zimri" of [Ch1 2:6](../kjv/ch1002.htm#006). (2..md) A
Benjamite ([Ch1 8:19](../kjv/ch1008.htm#019)). (3..md) Called "the
Shiphmite," one of David's officers, who had charge of his vineyards
([Ch1 27:27](../kjv/ch1027.htm#027)). (4..md) A Levite, one of the sons of
Asaph ([Neh 11:17](../kjv/neh011.htm#017).md); probably the same as Zichri
([Ch1 9:15](../kjv/ch1009.htm#015).md), and Zaccur ([Neh
12:35](../kjv/neh012.htm#035).md).

<span id="009">**Zabdiel**</span> Gift of God. (1.) The father of
Jashobeam, who was one of David's officers ([Ch1
27:2](../kjv/ch1027.htm#002)). (2..md) An overseer of the priests after the
Captivity ([Neh 11:14](../kjv/neh011.htm#014).md).
