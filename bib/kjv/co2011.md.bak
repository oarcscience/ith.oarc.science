### King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> Would to God ye could bear with me a little in
my folly: and indeed bear with me.  

<span id="002">2</span> For I am jealous over you with godly
[jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008.md): for I have espoused you to one
husband, that I may present you as a chaste
[virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009) to [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> But I fear, lest by any means, as the
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009) beguiled [Eve](../ebd/ebd127.htm#005.md)
through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the
simplicity that is in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> For if he that cometh preacheth another
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), whom we have not preached, or if ye
receive another [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), which ye have not
received, or another [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md), which ye have not
accepted, ye might well bear with him.  

<span id="005">5</span> For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very
chiefest apostles.  

<span id="006">6</span> But though I be rude in speech, yet not in
knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all
things.  

<span id="007">7</span> Have I committed an offence in abasing myself
that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) of God freely?  

<span id="008">8</span> I robbed other churches, taking
[wages](../ebd/ebd378.htm#004.md) of them, to do you service.  

<span id="009">9</span> And when I was present with you, and wanted, I
was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren
which came from [Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003.md) supplied: and in all
things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I
keep myself.  

<span id="010">10</span> As the truth of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of
[Achaia](../ebd/ebd006.htm#004.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Wherefore? because I love you not? God
knoweth.  

<span id="012">12</span> But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut
off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), they may be found even as we.  

<span id="013">13</span> For such are false apostles, deceitful workers,
transforming themselves into the apostles of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And no marvel; for
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md) himself is transformed into an
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of light.  

<span id="015">15</span> Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers
also be transformed as the ministers of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md); whose end shall be according to
their works.  

<span id="016">16</span> I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if
otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.  

<span id="017">17</span> That which I speak, I speak it not after the
Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.  

<span id="018">18</span> Seeing that many [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md)
after the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), I will
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) also.  

<span id="019">19</span> For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye
yourselves are [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> For ye suffer, if a man bring you into
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md), if a man devour you, if a man take of
you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.  

<span id="021">21</span> I speak as concerning reproach, as though we
had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I
am bold also.  

<span id="022">22</span> Are they [Hebrews](../ebd/ebd171.htm#001.md)? so
am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md)? so am I.  

<span id="023">23</span> Are they ministers of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)? (I speak as a fool.md) I am more; in
labours more abundant, in [stripes](../ebd/ebd352.htm#005.md) above
measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.  

<span id="024">24</span> Of the Jews five times received I forty
[stripes](../ebd/ebd352.htm#005.md) save one.  

<span id="025">25</span> Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I
stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in
the [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md);  

<span id="026">26</span> In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in
perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), in perils in the city, in perils in
the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), in perils in the sea, in perils
among false brethren;  

<span id="027">27</span> In weariness and painfulness, in
[watchings](../ebd/ebd379.htm#004.md) often, in hunger and thirst, in
fastings often, in cold and nakedness.  

<span id="028">28</span> Beside those things that are without, that
which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.  

<span id="029">29</span> Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is
offended, and I burn not?  

<span id="030">30</span> If I must needs [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md),
I will [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the things which concern mine
infirmities.  

<span id="031">31</span> The God and Father of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), which is
blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.  

<span id="032">32</span> In [Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md) the
governor under [Aretas](../ebd/ebd030.htm#002.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) kept the city of the Damascenes with a
[garrison](../ebd/ebd143.htm#007.md), desirous to apprehend me:  

<span id="033">33</span> And through a window in a
[basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009.md) was I let down by the wall, and escaped
his hands.
