### King James Version: Judges Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> And [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) the son
of [Jerubbaal](../ebd/ebd204.htm#002.md) went to
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md) unto his mother's brethren, and
communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's
father, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md), Whether is better for you, either that
all the sons of [Jerubbaal](../ebd/ebd204.htm#002.md), which are threescore
and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember
also that I am your bone and your [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And his mother's brethren spake of him in the
ears of all the men of [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md) all these words:
and their hearts inclined to follow [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md);
for they said, He is our brother.  

<span id="004">4</span> And they gave him threescore and ten
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) out
of the house of Baalberith, wherewith [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md)
hired vain and light persons, which followed him.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he went unto his father's house at
[Ophrah](../ebd/ebd279.htm#009.md), and slew his brethren the sons of
[Jerubbaal](../ebd/ebd204.htm#002.md), being threescore and ten persons,
upon one [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md): notwithstanding yet
[Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000.md) the youngest son of
[Jerubbaal](../ebd/ebd204.htm#002.md) was left; for he hid himself.  

<span id="006">6</span> And all the men of
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md) gathered together, and all the house of
[Millo](../ebd/ebd255.htm#004.md), and went, and made
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), by the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) of the [pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md)
that was in [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And when they told it to
[Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000.md), he went and stood in the top of
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Gerizim](../ebd/ebd146.htm#007.md), and
lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye
men of [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md), that God may hearken unto
you.  

<span id="008">8</span> The trees went forth on a time to
[anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008) a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over
them; and they said unto the [olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009.md) tree, Reign
thou over us.  

<span id="009">9</span> But the [olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009.md) tree said
unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God
and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?  

<span id="010">10</span> And the trees said to the
[fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001.md) tree, Come thou, and reign over us.  

<span id="011">11</span> But the [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001.md) tree said
unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md), and go to be promoted over the trees?  

<span id="012">12</span> Then said the trees unto the
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md), Come thou, and reign over us.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md) said unto
them, Should I leave my [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), which cheereth
God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?  

<span id="014">14</span> Then said all the trees unto the
[bramble](../ebd/ebd064.htm#001.md), Come thou, and reign over us.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the [bramble](../ebd/ebd064.htm#001.md) said
unto the trees, If in truth ye [anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008.md) me
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over you, then come and put your trust in
my [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md): and if not, let fire come out of the
[bramble](../ebd/ebd064.htm#001.md), and devour the cedars of
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> Now therefore, if ye have done truly and
sincerely, in that ye have made [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and if ye have dealt well with
[Jerubbaal](../ebd/ebd204.htm#002.md) and his house, and have done unto him
according to the deserving of his hands;  

<span id="017">17</span> (For my father fought for you, and adventured
his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of
[Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md):  

<span id="018">18</span> And ye are risen up against my father's house
this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), and have made
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md), the son of his maidservant,
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over the men of
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003), because he is your brother;.md)  

<span id="019">19</span> If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with
[Jerubbaal](../ebd/ebd204.htm#002.md) and with his house this day, then
rejoice ye in [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md), and let him also
rejoice in you:  

<span id="020">20</span> But if not, let fire come out from
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md), and devour the men of
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md), and the house of
[Millo](../ebd/ebd255.htm#004.md); and let fire come out from the men of
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md), and from the house of
[Millo](../ebd/ebd255.htm#004.md), and devour
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000.md) ran away,
and fled, and went to [Beer](../ebd/ebd050.htm#002.md), and dwelt there,
for fear of [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) his brother.  

<span id="022">22</span> When [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) had
reigned three years over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),  

<span id="023">23</span> Then God sent an evil
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) between
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) and the men of
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md); and the men of
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md) dealt treacherously with
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md):  

<span id="024">24</span> That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten
sons of [Jerubbaal](../ebd/ebd204.htm#002.md) might come, and their
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) be laid upon
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) their brother, which slew them; and
upon the men of [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md), which aided him in the
killing of his brethren.  

<span id="025">25</span> And the men of [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md)
set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed
all that came along that way by them: and it was told
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Gaal](../ebd/ebd140.htm#003.md) the son of
[Ebed](../ebd/ebd111.htm#008.md) came with his brethren, and went over to
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md): and the men of
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md) put their confidence in him.  

<span id="027">27</span> And they went out into the fields, and gathered
their vineyards, and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into the
house of their god, and did eat and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), and
cursed [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Gaal](../ebd/ebd140.htm#003.md) the son of
[Ebed](../ebd/ebd111.htm#008.md) said, Who is
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md), and who is
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md), that we should serve him? is not he
the son of [Jerubbaal](../ebd/ebd204.htm#002.md)? and
[Zebul](../ebd/ebd389.htm#001.md) his officer? serve the men of
[Hamor](../ebd/ebd161.htm#004.md) the father of
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md): for why should we serve him?  

<span id="029">29</span> And would to God this people were under my
hand! then would I remove [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md). And he
said to [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md), Increase thine army, and
come out.  

<span id="030">30</span> And when [Zebul](../ebd/ebd389.htm#001.md) the
ruler of the city heard the words of [Gaal](../ebd/ebd140.htm#003.md) the
son of [Ebed](../ebd/ebd111.htm#008), his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md)
was kindled.  

<span id="031">31</span> And he sent messengers unto
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) privily, saying, Behold,
[Gaal](../ebd/ebd140.htm#003) the son of [Ebed](../ebd/ebd111.htm#008.md)
and his brethren be come to [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md); and,
behold, they fortify the city against thee.  

<span id="032">32</span> Now therefore up by night, thou and the people
that is with thee, and lie in wait in the field:  

<span id="033">33</span> And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon
as the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) is up, thou shalt rise early, and
set upon the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him
come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find
occasion.  

<span id="034">34</span> And [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) rose up,
and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait
against [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md) in four companies.  

<span id="035">35</span> And [Gaal](../ebd/ebd140.htm#003.md) the son of
[Ebed](../ebd/ebd111.htm#008.md) went out, and stood in the entering of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) of the city: and
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) rose up, and the people that were
with him, from lying in wait.  

<span id="036">36</span> And when [Gaal](../ebd/ebd140.htm#003.md) saw the
people, he said to [Zebul](../ebd/ebd389.htm#001.md), Behold, there come
people down from the top of the mountains. And
[Zebul](../ebd/ebd389.htm#001.md) said unto him, Thou seest the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) of the mountains as if they were men.  

<span id="037">37</span> And [Gaal](../ebd/ebd140.htm#003.md) spake again,
and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and
another company come along by the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md) of
[Meonenim](../ebd/ebd248.htm#004.md).  

<span id="038">38</span> Then said [Zebul](../ebd/ebd389.htm#001.md) unto
him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who is
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md), that we should serve him? is not
this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight
with them.  

<span id="039">39</span> And [Gaal](../ebd/ebd140.htm#003.md) went out
before the men of [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md), and fought with
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md).  

<span id="040">40</span> And [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) chased
him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even
unto the entering of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md).  

<span id="041">41</span> And [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) dwelt at
Arumah: and [Zebul](../ebd/ebd389.htm#001.md) thrust out
[Gaal](../ebd/ebd140.htm#003.md) and his brethren, that they should not
dwell in [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md).  

<span id="042">42</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the
people went out into the field; and they told
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md).  

<span id="043">43</span> And he took the people, and divided them into
three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold,
the people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them,
and smote them.  

<span id="044">44</span> And [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md), and the
company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of
the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) of the city: and the two other
companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew
them.  

<span id="045">45</span> And [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) fought
against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people
that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with
[salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008.md).  

<span id="046">46</span> And when all the men of the tower of
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md) heard that, they entered into an hold
of the house of the god Berith.  

<span id="047">47</span> And it was told
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md), that all the men of the tower of
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md) were gathered together.  

<span id="048">48</span> And [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) gat him
up to [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Zalmon](../ebd/ebd387.htm#000.md), he
and all the people that were with him; and
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000) took an [axe](../ebd/ebd037.htm#003.md)
in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid
it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were with him, What ye
have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.  

<span id="049">49</span> And all the people likewise cut down every man
his bough, and followed [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md), and put them
to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of
the tower of [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md) died also, about a
thousand men and women.  

<span id="050">50</span> Then went [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) to
[Thebez](../ebd/ebd363.htm#005.md), and encamped against
[Thebez](../ebd/ebd363.htm#005.md), and took it.  

<span id="051">51</span> But there was a strong tower within the city,
and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and
shut it to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.  

<span id="052">52</span> And [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) came
unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of
the tower to burn it with fire.  

<span id="053">53</span> And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone
upon Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull.  

<span id="054">54</span> Then he called hastily unto the young man his
armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), and slay me, that men say not of me, A
women slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.  

<span id="055">55</span> And when the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) saw that
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) was dead, they departed every man
unto his place.  

<span id="056">56</span> Thus God rendered the wickedness of
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md), which he did unto his father, in
slaying his seventy brethren:  

<span id="057">57</span> And all the evil of the men of
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md) did God render upon their heads: and
upon them came the [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) of
[Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000.md) the son of
[Jerubbaal](../ebd/ebd204.htm#002.md).
