### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD said unto
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), Thou and thy sons and thy father's house
with thee shall bear the iniquity of the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md): and thou and thy sons with thee
shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.  

<span id="002">2</span> And thy brethren also of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006.md), the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of thy father, bring thou with thee, that
they may be joined unto thee, and [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) unto
thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) before the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge
of all the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md): only they shall not come
nigh the vessels of the [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md) and the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), that neither they, nor ye also, die.  

<span id="004">4</span> And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the
charge of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), for all the service of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md): and a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) shall not come nigh unto you.  

<span id="005">5</span> And ye shall keep the charge of the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md), and the charge of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md): that there be no wrath any more upon the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the
Levites from among the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): to
you they are given as a [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005.md) for the LORD, to
do the service of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep
your priest's office for everything of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), and within the vail; and ye shall serve:
I have given your priest's office unto you as a service of
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005): and the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md)
that cometh nigh shall be put to death.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), Behold, I also have given thee the
charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); unto thee have I given them
by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.  

<span id="009">9</span> This shall be thine of the most holy things,
reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) of theirs, and every
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) of
theirs, and every trespass [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) of theirs
which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy
sons.  

<span id="010">10</span> In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every
male shall eat it: it shall be holy unto thee.  

<span id="011">11</span> And this is thine; the heave
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) of their
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005.md), with all the wave offerings of the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): I have given them unto
thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for
ever: every one that is [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) in thy house
shall eat of it.  

<span id="012">12</span> All the best of the oil, and all the best of
the [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), and of the
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md), the firstfruits of them which they shall
offer unto the LORD, them have I given thee.  

<span id="013">13</span> And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which
they shall bring unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) in thine house shall eat of it.  

<span id="014">14</span> Every thing devoted in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) shall be thine.  

<span id="015">15</span> Every thing that openeth the matrix in all
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), which they bring unto the LORD, whether
it be of men or beasts, shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn of
man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt
thou redeem.  

<span id="016">16</span> And those that are to be redeemed from a month
old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of
five shekels, after the [shekel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#009.md) of the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md), which is twenty gerahs.  

<span id="017">17</span> But the firstling of a
[cow](../ebd/ebd092.htm#001.md), or the firstling of a
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), or the firstling of a
[goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001.md), thou shalt not redeem; they are holy:
thou shalt sprinkle their [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), and shalt burn their
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) for an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md)
made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of them
shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are
thine.  

<span id="019">19</span> All the heave offerings of the holy things,
which the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) offer unto the
LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a
statute for ever: it is a [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of
[salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008.md) for ever before the LORD unto thee and to
thy seed with thee.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), Thou shalt have no inheritance in their
land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and
thine inheritance among the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And, behold, I have given the children of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006.md) all the tenth in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) for an inheritance, for their service
which they serve, even the service of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> Neither must the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) henceforth come nigh the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), lest they bear
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), and die.  

<span id="023">23</span> But the Levites shall do the service of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), and they shall bear their
iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations,
that among the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) they have no
inheritance.  

<span id="024">24</span> But the tithes of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), which they offer as an heave
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) unto the LORD, I have given to the
Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) they shall have no inheritance.  

<span id="025">25</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="026">26</span> Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them,
When ye take of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) the
tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye
shall offer up an heave [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) of it for the
LORD, even a tenth part of the [tithe](../ebd/ebd368.htm#005.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And this your heave
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) shall be reckoned unto you, as though
it were the [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md) of the threshingfloor, and as
the [fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007.md) of the winepress.  

<span id="028">28</span> Thus ye also shall offer an heave
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) unto the LORD of all your tithes,
which ye receive of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); and
ye shall give thereof the LORD's heave [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md)
to [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every
heave [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) of the LORD, of all the best
thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.  

<span id="030">30</span> Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye
have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the
Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of
the winepress.  

<span id="031">31</span> And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your
households: for it is your reward for your service in the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> And ye shall bear no
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) by reason of it, when ye have heaved from
it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), lest ye die.
