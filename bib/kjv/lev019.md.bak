### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak unto all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and say unto them, Ye shall be holy:
for I the LORD your God am holy.  

<span id="003">3</span> Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his
father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.  

<span id="004">4</span> Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves
molten gods: I am the LORD your God.  

<span id="005">5</span> And if ye offer a
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye
shall offer it at your own will.  

<span id="006">6</span> It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and
on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be
burnt in the fire.  

<span id="007">7</span> And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it
is abominable; it shall not be accepted.  

<span id="008">8</span> Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear
his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD:
and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.  

<span id="009">9</span> And when ye reap the
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md) of your land, thou shalt not wholly
reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings
of thy [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And thou shalt not
[glean](../ebd/ebd150.htm#003.md) thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather
every [grape](../ebd/ebd154.htm#004.md) of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave
them for the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) and
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md): I am the LORD your God.  

<span id="011">11</span> Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely,
neither lie one to another.  

<span id="012">12</span> And ye shall not swear by my name falsely,
neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither
rob him: the [wages](../ebd/ebd378.htm#004.md) of him that is hired shall
not abide with thee all night until the morning.  

<span id="014">14</span> Thou shalt not [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md)
the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md), but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.  

<span id="015">15</span> Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment:
thou shalt not respect the person of the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md),
nor honor the person of the mighty: but in
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) shalt thou
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) thy neighbour.  

<span id="016">16</span> Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer
among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of thy neighbour; I am the LORD.  

<span id="017">17</span> Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart:
thou shalt in any [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) rebuke thy neighbour,
and not suffer [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) upon him.  

<span id="018">18</span> Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge
against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself: I am the LORD.  

<span id="019">19</span> Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let
thy [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) gender with a diverse kind: thou
shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment
mingled of [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md) and woollen come upon thee.  

<span id="020">20</span> And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that
is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor
freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to
death, because she was not free.  

<span id="021">21</span> And he shall bring his trespass
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) unto the LORD, unto the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), even a
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md) for a trespass
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
make an [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for him with the
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md) of the trespass
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) before the LORD for his
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) which he hath done: and the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) which he hath done shall be forgiven him.  

<span id="023">23</span> And when ye shall come into the land, and shall
have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) thereof as uncircumcised: three years
shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.  

<span id="024">24</span> But in the fourth year all the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD
withal.  

<span id="025">25</span> And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) thereof, that it may yield unto you the
increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.  

<span id="026">26</span> Ye shall not eat any thing with the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md): neither shall ye use enchantment, nor
observe times.  

<span id="027">27</span> Ye shall not round the corners of your heads,
neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy
[beard](../ebd/ebd049.htm#000.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> Ye shall not make any cuttings in your
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) for the dead, nor print any marks upon
you: I am the LORD.  

<span id="029">29</span> Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to
be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of
wickedness.  

<span id="030">30</span> Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md): I am the LORD.  

<span id="031">31</span> Regard not them that have familiar spirits,
neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your
God.  

<span id="032">32</span> Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and
honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.  

<span id="033">33</span> And if a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md)
sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.  

<span id="034">34</span> But the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) that
dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou
shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): I am the LORD your God.  

<span id="035">35</span> Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in
meteyard, in weight, or in measure.  

<span id="036">36</span> Just balances, just
[weights](../ebd/ebd380.htm#006), a just [ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003.md),
and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you
out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="037">37</span> Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and
all my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.
