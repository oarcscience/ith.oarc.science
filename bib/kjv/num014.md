### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> And all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) lifted up their voice, and cried;
and the people wept that night.  

<span id="002">2</span> And all the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) murmured against
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) and against
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md): and the whole
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) said unto them, Would God that we
had died in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md)! or would God we
had died in this [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md)!  

<span id="003">3</span> And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this
land, to fall by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), that our wives and
our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md)?  

<span id="004">4</span> And they said one to another, Let us make a
captain, and let us return into [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Then [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) fell on their faces before all the
assembly of the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) the son of
[Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006), and [Caleb](../ebd/ebd069.htm#003.md) the son
of [Jephunneh](../ebd/ebd203.htm#004.md), which were of them that searched
the land, [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) their clothes:  

<span id="007">7</span> And they spake unto all the company of the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), saying, The land, which we
passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.  

<span id="008">8</span> If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us
into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000) and [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear
ye the people of the land; for they are [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md)
for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD is with us:
fear them not.  

<span id="010">10</span> But all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) bade
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) them with stones. And the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the LORD appeared in the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) before all the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), How long will this people provoke me?
and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I
have shewed among them?  

<span id="012">12</span> I will smite them with the pestilence, and
disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier
than they.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said unto
the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for thou broughtest up this
people in thy might from among them;)  

<span id="014">14</span> And they will tell it to the inhabitants of
this land: for they have heard that thou LORD art among this people,
that thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md) standeth over them, and that thou goest
before them, by day time in a [pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md) of a
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001), and in a [pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md)
of fire by night.  

<span id="015">15</span> Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one
man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak,
saying,  

<span id="016">16</span> Because the LORD was not able to bring this
people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain
them in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my
LORD be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,  

<span id="018">18</span> The LORD is longsuffering, and of great
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md), forgiving iniquity and transgression,
and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the
fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> [Pardon](../ebd/ebd285.htm#001.md), I beseech
thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md), and as thou hast forgiven this people,
from [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) even until now.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to
thy word:  

<span id="021">21</span> But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be
filled with the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the LORD.  

<span id="022">22</span> Because all those men which have seen my
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), and my miracles, which I did in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) and in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), and have tempted me now these ten
times, and have not hearkened to my voice;  

<span id="023">23</span> Surely they shall not see the land which I
sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see
it:  

<span id="024">24</span> But my servant [Caleb](../ebd/ebd069.htm#003.md),
because he had another [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) with him, and
hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he
went; and his seed shall possess it.  

<span id="025">25</span> (Now the Amalekites and the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007.md) dwelt in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008)..md) Tomorrow turn you, and get you into
the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) by the way of the Red sea.  

<span id="026">26</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md),
saying,  

<span id="027">27</span> How long shall I bear with this evil
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), which murmur against me? I have
heard the murmurings of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
which they murmur against me.  

<span id="028">28</span> Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the
LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:  

<span id="029">29</span> Your carcases shall fall in this
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md); and all that were numbered of you,
according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward which
have murmured against me.  

<span id="030">30</span> Doubtless ye shall not come into the land,
concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein, save
[Caleb](../ebd/ebd069.htm#003.md) the son of
[Jephunneh](../ebd/ebd203.htm#004), and [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md)
the son of [Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> But your little ones, which ye said should be a
prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have
despised.  

<span id="032">32</span> But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall
in this [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> And your children shall wander in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) forty years, and bear your
whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).  

<span id="034">34</span> After the number of the days in which ye
searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear
your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my
[breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005.md) of promise.  

<span id="035">35</span> I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto
all this evil [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), that are gathered
together against me: in this [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) they
shall be consumed, and there they shall die.  

<span id="036">36</span> And the men, which
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) sent to search the land, who returned,
and made all the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) to murmur against
him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,  

<span id="037">37</span> Even those men that did bring up the evil
report upon the land, died by the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) before
the LORD.  

<span id="038">38</span> But [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) the son of
[Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006), and [Caleb](../ebd/ebd069.htm#003.md) the son
of [Jephunneh](../ebd/ebd203.htm#004.md), which were of the men that went
to search the land, lived still.  

<span id="039">39</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) told these
sayings unto all the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and
the people mourned greatly.  

<span id="040">40</span> And they rose up early in the morning, and gat
them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will
go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.  

<span id="041">41</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said,
Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall
not prosper.  

<span id="042">42</span> Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that
ye be not smitten before your enemies.  

<span id="043">43</span> For the Amalekites and the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007.md) are there before you, and ye shall
fall by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md): because ye are turned away
from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.  

<span id="044">44</span> But they presumed to go up unto the hill top:
nevertheless the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of the LORD, and
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), departed not out of the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md).  

<span id="045">45</span> Then the Amalekites came down, and the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007.md) which dwelt in that hill, and smote
them, and discomfited them, even unto [Hormah](../ebd/ebd182.htm#002.md).
