### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 69

<span id="001">1</span> Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto
my soul.  

<span id="002">2</span> I sink in [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) mire,
where there is no standing: I am come into [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md)
waters, where the floods overflow me.  

<span id="003">3</span> I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried:
mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.  

<span id="004">4</span> They that hate me without a cause are more than
the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies
wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.  

<span id="005">5</span> O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins
are not hid from thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of
hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be
confounded for my sake, O God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Because for thy sake I have borne reproach;
shame hath covered my face.  

<span id="008">8</span> I am become a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md)
unto my brethren, and an [alien](../ebd/ebd017.htm#003.md) unto my mother's
children.  

<span id="009">9</span> For the [zeal](../ebd/ebd388.htm#003.md) of thine
house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee
are fallen upon me.  

<span id="010">10</span> When I wept, and chastened my soul with
fasting, that was to my reproach.  

<span id="011">11</span> I made [sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001.md) also
my garment; and I became a [proverb](../ebd/ebd301.htm#002.md) to them.  

<span id="012">12</span> They that sit in the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) speak against me; and I was the song of
the drunkards.  

<span id="013">13</span> But as for me, my
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable
time: O God, in the multitude of thy [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) hear
me, in the truth of thy [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not
sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) waters.  

<span id="015">15</span> Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let
the [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008) [swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009.md) me
up, and let not the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md) shut her mouth upon
me.  

<span id="016">16</span> Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is
good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.  

<span id="017">17</span> And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I
am in trouble: hear me speedily.  

<span id="018">18</span> Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver
me because of mine enemies.  

<span id="019">19</span> Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and
my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.  

<span id="020">20</span> Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of
heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and
for comforters, but I found none.  

<span id="021">21</span> They gave me also [gall](../ebd/ebd142.htm#000.md)
for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me
[vinegar](../ebd/ebd377.htm#006) to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> Let their table become a
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009.md) before them: and that which should have
been for their welfare, let it become a trap.  

<span id="023">23</span> Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not;
and make their loins continually to shake.  

<span id="024">24</span> Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let
thy wrathful [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) take hold of them.  

<span id="025">25</span> Let their [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md)
be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.  

<span id="026">26</span> For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten;
and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.  

<span id="027">27</span> Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them
not come into thy [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> Let them be blotted out of the book of the
living, and not be written with the righteous.  

<span id="029">29</span> But I am [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) and
sorrowful: let thy [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md), O God, set me up
on high.  

<span id="030">30</span> I will praise the name of God with a song, and
will magnify him with thanksgiving.  

<span id="031">31</span> This also shall please the LORD better than an
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) or [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md) that
hath horns and hoofs.  

<span id="032">32</span> The humble shall see this, and be glad: and
your heart shall live that seek God.  

<span id="033">33</span> For the LORD heareth the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), and despiseth not his prisoners.  

<span id="034">34</span> Let the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) and
earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.  

<span id="035">35</span> For God will save
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), and will build the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md): that they may dwell there, and have it
in possession.  

<span id="036">36</span> The seed also of his servants shall inherit it:
and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
