### King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not
with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md) of God.  

<span id="002">2</span> For I determined not to know any thing among
you, save [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), and him crucified.  

<span id="003">3</span> And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and
in much trembling.  

<span id="004">4</span> And my speech and my preaching was not with
enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) and of power:  

<span id="005">5</span> That your faith should not stand in the wisdom
of men, but in the power of God.  

<span id="006">6</span> Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are
perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this
world, that come to nought:  

<span id="007">7</span> But we speak the wisdom of God in a
[mystery](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006.md), even the hidden wisdom, which God
ordained before the world unto our [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md):  

<span id="008">8</span> Which none of the princes of this world knew:
for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) heard, neither have entered into the heart
of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.  

<span id="010">10</span> But God hath revealed them unto us by his
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009): for the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md)
searcheth all things, yea, the [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) things of
God.  

<span id="011">11</span> For what man knoweth the things of a man, save
the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of man which is in him? even so the
things of God knoweth no man, but the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of
God.  

<span id="012">12</span> Now we have received, not the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the world, but the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) which is of God; that we might know the
things that are freely given to us of God.  

<span id="013">13</span> Which things also we speak, not in the words
which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md) teacheth; comparing spiritual things with
spiritual.  

<span id="014">14</span> But the natural man receiveth not the things of
the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of God: for they are foolishness
unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
discerned.  

<span id="015">15</span> But he that is spiritual judgeth all things,
yet he himself is judged of no man.  

<span id="016">16</span> For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that
he may instruct him? But we have the mind of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).
