### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 50

<span id="001">1</span> The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and
called the earth from the rising of the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md)
unto the going down thereof.  

<span id="002">2</span> Out of [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), the
[perfection](../ebd/ebd290.htm#001.md) of beauty, God hath shined.  

<span id="003">3</span> Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence:
a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round
about him.  

<span id="004">4</span> He shall call to the heavens from above, and to
the earth, that he may [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) his people.  

<span id="005">5</span> Gather my saints together unto me; those that
have made a [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with me by
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And the heavens shall declare his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md): for God is
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) himself.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and I will testify against thee: I am
God, even thy God.  

<span id="008">8</span> I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or
thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me.  

<span id="009">9</span> I will take no [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md)
out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds.  

<span id="010">10</span> For every [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) of the
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006.md) is mine, and the
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) upon a thousand hills.  

<span id="011">11</span> I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the
wild beasts of the field are mine.  

<span id="012">12</span> If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for
the world is mine, and the [fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007.md) thereof.  

<span id="013">13</span> Will I eat the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md)
of bulls, or [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of goats?  

<span id="014">14</span> Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy
[vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001.md) unto the most High:  

<span id="015">15</span> And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt [glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005.md) me.  

<span id="016">16</span> But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou
to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) in thy mouth?  

<span id="017">17</span> Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my
words behind thee.  

<span id="018">18</span> When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst
with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.  

<span id="019">19</span> Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue
frameth deceit.  

<span id="020">20</span> Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother;
thou slanderest thine own mother's son.  

<span id="021">21</span> These things hast thou done, and I kept
silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself:
but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.  

<span id="022">22</span> Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I
tear you in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md), and there be none to
deliver.  

<span id="023">23</span> Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him
that ordereth his [conversation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#001.md) aright will I
shew the [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) of God.
