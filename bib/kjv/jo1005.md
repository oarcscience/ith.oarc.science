### King James Version: 1 John Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Whosoever believeth that
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) is the [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) is
born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also
that is begotten of him.  

<span id="002">2</span> By this we know that we love the children of
God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.  

<span id="003">3</span> For this is the love of God, that we keep his
commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.  

<span id="004">4</span> For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our
faith.  

<span id="005">5</span> Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that
believeth that [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) is the Son of God?  

<span id="006">6</span> This is he that came by water and
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), even [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md); not by water only, but by water and
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md). And it is the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) that beareth
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md), because the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) is truth.  

<span id="007">7</span> For there are three that bear record in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), the Father, the Word, and the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md): and these three are one.  

<span id="008">8</span> And there are three that bear
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) in earth, the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), and the water, and the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md): and these three agree in one.  

<span id="009">9</span> If we receive the
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) of men, the
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) of God is greater: for this is the
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) of God which he hath testified of his
Son.  

<span id="010">10</span> He that believeth on the Son of God hath the
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) in himself: he that believeth not God
hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave
of his Son.  

<span id="011">11</span> And this is the record, that God hath given to
us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.  

<span id="012">12</span> He that hath the Son hath life; and he that
hath not the Son of God hath not life.  

<span id="013">13</span> These things have I written unto you that
believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have
eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.  

<span id="014">14</span> And this is the confidence that we have in him,
that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:  

<span id="015">15</span> And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we
ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.  

<span id="016">16</span> If any man see his brother
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) a [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) which is not
unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) not unto death. There is a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) unto death: I do not say that he shall pray
for it.  

<span id="017">17</span> All unrighteousness is
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md): and there is a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) not unto death.  

<span id="018">18</span> We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth
not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one
toucheth him not.  

<span id="019">19</span> And we know that we are of God, and the whole
world lieth in wickedness.  

<span id="020">20</span> And we know that the Son of God is come, and
hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and
we are in him that is true, even in his Son
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md). This is
the true God, and eternal life.  

<span id="021">21</span> Little children, keep yourselves from idols.
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).
