### King James Version: Job Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> There was a man in the land of
[Uz](../ebd/ebd375.htm#007.md), whose name was Job; and that man was
perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.  

<span id="002">2</span> And there were born unto him
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) sons and three daughters.  

<span id="003">3</span> His substance also was
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) thousand [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md),
and three thousand camels, and five hundred
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md) of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a
very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men
of the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And his sons went and feasted in their houses,
every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat
and to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) with them.  

<span id="005">5</span> And it was so, when the days of their feasting
were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in
the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them
all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in
their hearts. Thus did Job continually.  

<span id="006">6</span> Now there was a day when the sons of God came to
present themselves before the LORD, and [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md)
came also among them.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the LORD said unto
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md), Whence comest thou? Then
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md) answered the LORD, and said, From going
to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the LORD said unto
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md), Hast thou considered my servant Job,
that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man,
one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?  

<span id="009">9</span> Then [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md) answered the
LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?  

<span id="010">10</span> Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and
about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast
blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the
land.  

<span id="011">11</span> But put forth thine hand now, and touch all
that he hath, and he will [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) thee to thy
face.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the LORD said unto
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md), Behold, all that he hath is in thy
power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md) went forth from the presence of the
LORD.  

<span id="013">13</span> And there was a day when his sons and his
daughters were [eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006.md) and drinking
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) in their eldest brother's house:  

<span id="014">14</span> And there came a
[messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005.md) unto Job, and said, The oxen were
plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:  

<span id="015">15</span> And the [Sabeans](../ebd/ebd317.htm#006.md) fell
upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with
the edge of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md); and I only am escaped
alone to tell thee.  

<span id="016">16</span> While he was yet speaking, there came also
another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and hath burned up the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), and the servants, and consumed them; and
I only am escaped alone to tell thee.  

<span id="017">17</span> While he was yet speaking, there came also
another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003.md), and fell upon the camels, and have
carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md); and I only am escaped alone to tell
thee.  

<span id="018">18</span> While he was yet speaking, there came also
another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were
[eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006.md) and drinking
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) in their eldest brother's house:  

<span id="019">19</span> And, behold, there came a great wind from the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), and smote the four corners of the
house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am
escaped alone to tell thee.  

<span id="020">20</span> Then Job arose, and
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007) his [mantle](../ebd/ebd240.htm#009.md), and
shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,  

<span id="021">21</span> And said, [Naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003.md) came I
out of my mother's womb, and [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003.md) shall I
return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be
the name of the LORD.  

<span id="022">22</span> In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God
foolishly.
