### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a
mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:  

<span id="002">2</span> And he opened his mouth, and taught them,
saying,  

<span id="003">3</span> Blessed are the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) in
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009): for theirs is the kingdom of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="004">4</span> Blessed are they that
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004): for they shall be comforted.  

<span id="005">5</span> Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the
earth.  

<span id="006">6</span> Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst
after [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004): for they shall be
filled.  

<span id="007">7</span> Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005).  

<span id="008">8</span> Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall
see God.  

<span id="009">9</span> Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be
called the children of God.  

<span id="010">10</span> Blessed are they which are persecuted for
righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="011">11</span> Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and
persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for
my sake.  

<span id="012">12</span> Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is
your reward in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006): for so persecuted they
the prophets which were before you.  

<span id="013">13</span> Ye are the [salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008) of the
earth: but if the [salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008) have lost his savour,
wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to
be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.  

<span id="014">14</span> Ye are the light of the world. A city that is
set on an hill cannot be hid.  

<span id="015">15</span> Neither do men light a
[candle](../ebd/ebd071.htm#000), and put it under a bushel, but on a
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001); and it giveth light unto all that
are in the house.  

<span id="016">16</span> Let your light so shine before men, that they
may see your good works, and [glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005) your
Father which is in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="017">17</span> Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or
the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.  

<span id="018">18</span> For verily I say unto you, Till
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) and earth pass, one
[jot](../ebd/ebd211.htm#009) or one [tittle](../ebd/ebd368.htm#006)
shall in no [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) pass from the law, till all be
fulfilled.  

<span id="019">19</span> Whosoever therefore shall break one of these
least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least
in the kingdom of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006): but whosoever shall
do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="020">20</span> For I say unto you, That except your
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) shall exceed the
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) of the
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) and [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008),
ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="021">21</span> Ye have heard that it was said of them of old
time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger
of the judgment:  

<span id="022">22</span> But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry
with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and
whosoever shall say to his brother, [Raca](../ebd/ebd305.htm#001), shall
be in danger of the [council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004): but whosoever
shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003) fire.  

<span id="023">23</span> Therefore if thou bring thy
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005) to the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), and
there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;  

<span id="024">24</span> Leave there thy [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005)
before the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), and go thy way; first be
reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005).  

<span id="025">25</span> Agree with thine
[adversary](../ebd/ebd011.htm#001) quickly, whiles thou art in the way
with him; lest at any time the [adversary](../ebd/ebd011.htm#001)
deliver thee to the [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005), and the
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) deliver thee to the officer, and thou be
cast into [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006).  

<span id="026">26</span> Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means
come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost
[farthing](../ebd/ebd131.htm#003).  

<span id="027">27</span> Ye have heard that it was said by them of old
time, Thou shalt not commit [adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009):  

<span id="028">28</span> But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a
woman to [lust](../ebd/ebd233.htm#005) after her hath committed
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009) with her already in his heart.  

<span id="029">29</span> And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out,
and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy
members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003).  

<span id="030">30</span> And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off,
and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy
members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003).  

<span id="031">31</span> It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his
wife, let him give her a [writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005) of
divorcement:  

<span id="032">32</span> But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put
away his wife, saving for the cause of
[fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008), causeth her to commit
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009): and whosoever shall marry her that is
divorced committeth [adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009).  

<span id="033">33</span> Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by
them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform
unto the Lord thine oaths:  

<span id="034">34</span> But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither
by [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006); for it is God's
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001):  

<span id="035">35</span> Nor by the earth; for it is his
[footstool](../ebd/ebd136.htm#009): neither by
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005); for it is the city of the great
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="036">36</span> Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because
thou canst not make one hair white or black.  

<span id="037">37</span> But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay,
nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.  

<span id="038">38</span> Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye
for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:  

<span id="039">39</span> But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil:
but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right
[cheek](../ebd/ebd078.htm#004), turn to him the other also.  

<span id="040">40</span> And if any man will sue thee at the law, and
take away thy [coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004), let him have thy
[cloak](../ebd/ebd084.htm#009) also.  

<span id="041">41</span> And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile,
go with him twain.  

<span id="042">42</span> Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that
would [borrow](../ebd/ebd062.htm#007) of thee turn not thou away.  

<span id="043">43</span> Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou
shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.  

<span id="044">44</span> But I say unto you, Love your enemies,
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) them that [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003)
you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully
use you, and persecute you;  

<span id="045">45</span> That ye may be the children of your Father
which is in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006): for he maketh his
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) to rise on the evil and on the good, and
sendeth [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) on the just and on the unjust.  

<span id="046">46</span> For if ye love them which love you, what reward
have ye? do not even the publicans the same?  

<span id="047">47</span> And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye
more than others? do not even the publicans so?  

<span id="048">48</span> Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father
which is in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) is perfect.
