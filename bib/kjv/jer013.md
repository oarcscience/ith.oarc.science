### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008) [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md), and put
it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.  

<span id="002">2</span> So I got a [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md)
according to the word of the LORD, and put it on my loins.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the word of the LORD came unto me the second
time, saying,  

<span id="004">4</span> Take the [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md) that
thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to
[Euphrates](../ebd/ebd127.htm#001.md), and hide it there in a hole of the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> So I went, and hid it by
[Euphrates](../ebd/ebd127.htm#001.md), as the LORD commanded me.  

<span id="006">6</span> And it came to pass after many days, that the
LORD said unto me, Arise, go to [Euphrates](../ebd/ebd127.htm#001.md), and
take the [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md) from thence, which I commanded
thee to hide there.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then I went to
[Euphrates](../ebd/ebd127.htm#001.md), and digged, and took the
[girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md) from the place where I had hid it: and,
behold, the [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md) was marred, it was
profitable for nothing.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="009">9</span> Thus saith the LORD, After this manner will I
mar the pride of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and the great pride of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> This evil people, which refuse to hear my
words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after
other gods, to serve them, and to [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) them,
shall even be as this [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md), which is good for
nothing.  

<span id="011">11</span> For as the [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md)
cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the
whole house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) and the whole house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), saith the LORD; that they might be unto
me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md): but they would not hear.  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word;
Thus saith the LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), Every
[bottle](../ebd/ebd063.htm#002.md) shall be filled with
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md): and they shall say unto thee, Do we not
certainly know that every [bottle](../ebd/ebd063.htm#002.md) shall be
filled with [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="013">13</span> Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the
LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the
kings that sit upon David's [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), and the
priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), with drunkenness.  

<span id="014">14</span> And I will dash them one against another, even
the fathers and the sons together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor
spare, nor have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md), but destroy them.  

<span id="015">15</span> Hear ye, and give [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md);
be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken.  

<span id="016">16</span> Give [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) to the LORD
your God, before he cause [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), and before
your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light,
he turn it into the [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) of death, and make
it gross [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep
in secret places for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run
down with tears, because the LORD's flock is carried away
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> Say unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) and
to the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md), Humble yourselves, sit down: for
your principalities shall come down, even the
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of your [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> The cities of the south shall be shut up, and
none shall open them: [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) shall be carried
away [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001.md) all of it, it shall be wholly
carried away [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come
from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful
flock?  

<span id="021">21</span> What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee?
for thou hast taught them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall
not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?  

<span id="022">22</span> And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come
these things upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts
discovered, and thy heels made bare.  

<span id="023">23</span> Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the
[leopard](../ebd/ebd227.htm#002.md) his spots? then may ye also do good,
that are accustomed to do evil.  

<span id="024">24</span> Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble
that passeth away by the wind of the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures
from me, saith the LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in
falsehood.  

<span id="026">26</span> Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy
face, that thy shame may appear.  

<span id="027">27</span> I have seen thine adulteries, and thy
neighings, the [lewdness](../ebd/ebd228.htm#002.md) of thy whoredom, and
thine abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe unto thee, O
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md)! wilt thou not be made
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md)? when shall it once be?
