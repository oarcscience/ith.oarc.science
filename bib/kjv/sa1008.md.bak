### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, when
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) was old, that he made his sons judges
over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Now the name of his firstborn was
[Joel](../ebd/ebd208.htm#005.md); and the name of his second, Abiah: they
were judges in [Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned
aside after [lucre](../ebd/ebd232.htm#008.md), and took bribes, and
perverted judgment.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then all the elders of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) gathered themselves together, and came
to [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) unto
[Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005.md),  

<span id="005">5</span> And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy
sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
to [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) us like all the nations.  

<span id="006">6</span> But the thing displeased
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md), when they said, Give us a
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) to [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) us. And
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) prayed unto the LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the LORD said unto
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md), Hearken unto the voice of the people in
all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they
have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.  

<span id="008">8</span> According to all the works which they have done
since the day that I brought them up out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) even unto this day, wherewith they have
forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.  

<span id="009">9</span> Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit
yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) that shall reign over them.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) told all
the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And he said, This will be the manner of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) that shall reign over you: He will take
your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his
horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he will appoint him captains over
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md), and captains over fifties; and will
set them to [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) his ground, and to reap his
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md), and to make his instruments of war,
and instruments of his chariots.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he will take your daughters to be
[confectionaries](../ebd/ebd088.htm#002.md), and to be cooks, and to be
bakers.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he will take your fields, and your
vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to
his servants.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of
your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he will take your menservants, and your
maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them
to his work.  

<span id="017">17</span> He will take the tenth of your
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md): and ye shall be his servants.  

<span id="018">18</span> And ye shall cry out in that day because of
your [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) which ye shall have
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) you; and the LORD will not hear you in
that day.  

<span id="019">19</span> Nevertheless the people refused to obey the
voice of [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md); and they said, Nay; but we
will have a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over us;  

<span id="020">20</span> That we also may be like all the nations; and
that our [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) may
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) us, and go out before us, and fight our
battles.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) heard all
the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the
LORD.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the LORD said to
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md), Hearken unto their voice, and make them
a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001). And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md)
said unto the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), Go ye every man
unto his city.
