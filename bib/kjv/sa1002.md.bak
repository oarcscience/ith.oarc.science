### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> And [Hannah](../ebd/ebd163.htm#002.md) prayed, and
said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine [horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003.md)
is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because
I rejoice in thy [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> There is none holy as the LORD: for there is
none beside thee: neither is there any [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md)
like our God.  

<span id="003">3</span> Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not
arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge,
and by him actions are weighed.  

<span id="004">4</span> The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they
that stumbled are girded with strength.  

<span id="005">5</span> They that were full have hired out themselves
for [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md); and they that were hungry ceased: so
that the [barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007.md) hath born
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md); and she that hath many children is waxed
feeble.  

<span id="006">6</span> The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth
down to the [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md), and bringeth up.  

<span id="007">7</span> The LORD maketh [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md),
and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.  

<span id="008">8</span> He raiseth up the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md)
out of the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md), and lifteth up the beggar from
the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md): for
the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon
them.  

<span id="009">9</span> He will keep the feet of his saints, and the
wicked shall be silent in [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md); for by
strength shall no man prevail.  

<span id="010">10</span> The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002); out of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)
shall he [thunder](../ebd/ebd365.htm#003.md) upon them: the LORD shall
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) the ends of the earth; and he shall give
strength unto his [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and exalt the
[horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003.md) of his anointed.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Elkanah](../ebd/ebd118.htm#005.md) went to
[Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005.md) to his house. And the child did
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) unto the LORD before
[Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> Now the sons of [Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007.md)
were sons of [Belial](../ebd/ebd051.htm#007.md); they knew not the LORD.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the priest's
[custom](../ebd/ebd094.htm#008.md) with the people was, that, when any man
offered [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md), the priest's servant came,
while the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) was in seething, with a
fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;  

<span id="014">14</span> And he struck it into the
[pan](../ebd/ebd283.htm#009), or [kettle](../ebd/ebd218.htm#000.md), or
caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) took for himself. So they did in
[Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008.md) unto all the Israelites that came
thither.  

<span id="015">15</span> Also before they burnt the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md), the priest's servant came, and said to the
man that sacrificed, Give [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) to roast for
the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md); for he will not have sodden
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of thee, but raw.  

<span id="016">16</span> And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail
to burn the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) presently, and then take as
much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt
give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.  

<span id="017">17</span> Wherefore the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) of
the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) of the LORD.  

<span id="018">18</span> But [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) ministered
before the LORD, being a child, girded with a
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008) [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> Moreover his mother made him a little
[coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004.md), and brought it to him from year to year,
when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007.md) blessed
[Elkanah](../ebd/ebd118.htm#005.md) and his wife, and said, The LORD give
thee seed of this woman for the [loan](../ebd/ebd230.htm#008.md) which is
lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the LORD visited
[Hannah](../ebd/ebd163.htm#002.md), so that she conceived, and bare three
sons and two daughters. And the child [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md)
grew before the LORD.  

<span id="022">22</span> Now [Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007.md) was very old,
and heard all that his sons did unto all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); and how they lay with the women that
assembled at the door of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And he said unto them, Why do ye such things?
for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.  

<span id="024">24</span> Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I
hear: ye make the LORD's people to transgress.  

<span id="025">25</span> If one man [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) against
another, the [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) shall
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) him: but if a man
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) against the LORD, who shall intreat for
him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father,
because the LORD would slay them.  

<span id="026">26</span> And the child [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md)
grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.  

<span id="027">27</span> And there came a man of God unto
[Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007.md), and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD,
Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) in Pharaoh's house?  

<span id="028">28</span> And did I choose him out of all the tribes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) to be my
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), to offer upon mine
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), to burn
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md), to wear an
[ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md) before me? and did I give unto the house
of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="029">29</span> Wherefore kick ye at my
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) and at mine
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), which I have commanded in my
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md); and honourest thy sons above me, to
make yourselves [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) with the chiefest of all
the offerings of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) my people?  

<span id="030">30</span> Wherefore the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) saith, I said indeed that thy house, and
the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the
LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour,
and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.  

<span id="031">31</span> Behold, the days come, that I will cut off
thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an
old man in thine house.  

<span id="032">32</span> And thou shalt see an enemy in my
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md), in all the wealth which God shall
give [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and there shall not be an old man
in thine house for ever.  

<span id="033">33</span> And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off
from mine [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), shall be to consume thine
eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house
shall die in the flower of their age.  

<span id="034">34</span> And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall
come upon thy two sons, on [Hophni](../ebd/ebd181.htm#006.md) and
[Phinehas](../ebd/ebd294.htm#003.md); in one day they shall die both of
them.  

<span id="035">35</span> And I will raise me up a
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), that
shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I
will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for
ever.  

<span id="036">36</span> And it shall come to pass, that every one that
is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) and a morsel of
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into
one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md).
