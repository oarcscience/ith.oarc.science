### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 26

<span id="001">1</span> As [snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000) in summer, and
as [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) in [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008), so
honour is not seemly for a fool.  

<span id="002">2</span> As the [bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000) by
[wandering](../ebd/ebd378.htm#008), as the
[swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009) by flying, so the
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) causeless shall not come.  

<span id="003">3</span> A whip for the horse, a
[bridle](../ebd/ebd065.htm#002) for the [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001),
and a rod for the fool's back.  

<span id="004">4</span> Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest
thou also be like unto him.  

<span id="005">5</span> Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) in his own conceit.  

<span id="006">6</span> He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool
cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage.  

<span id="007">7</span> The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003) in the mouth of fools.  

<span id="008">8</span> As he that bindeth a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) in a [sling](../ebd/ebd346.htm#005), so
is he that giveth honour to a fool.  

<span id="009">9</span> As a [thorn](../ebd/ebd364.htm#006) goeth up
into the hand of a drunkard, so is a [parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003) in
the mouths of fools.  

<span id="010">10</span> The great God that formed all things both
rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.  

<span id="011">11</span> As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool
returneth to his folly.  

<span id="012">12</span> Seest thou a man [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004)
in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him.  

<span id="013">13</span> The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the
way; a lion is in the streets.  

<span id="014">14</span> As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth
the slothful upon his bed.  

<span id="015">15</span> The slothful hideth his hand in his
[bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008); it grieveth him to bring it again to his
mouth.  

<span id="016">16</span> The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) men that can render a reason.  

<span id="017">17</span> He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife
belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.  

<span id="018">18</span> As a mad man who casteth firebrands,
[arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005), and death,  

<span id="019">19</span> So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and
saith, Am not I in sport?  

<span id="020">20</span> Where no [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) is,
there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife
ceaseth.  

<span id="021">21</span> As coals are to burning coals, and
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle
strife.  

<span id="022">22</span> The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and
they go down into the innermost parts of the
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000).  

<span id="023">23</span> Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a
[potsherd](../ebd/ebd299.htm#004) covered with
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) [dross](../ebd/ebd108.htm#004).  

<span id="024">24</span> He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and
layeth up deceit within him;  

<span id="025">25</span> When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for
there are [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) abominations in his heart.  

<span id="026">26</span> Whose [hatred](../ebd/ebd167.htm#002) is
covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004).  

<span id="027">27</span> Whoso diggeth a [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007)
shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), it will return upon him.  

<span id="028">28</span> A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted
by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.
