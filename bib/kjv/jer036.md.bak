### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 36

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass in the fourth year of
[Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001.md) the son of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), that this word came unto
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) from the LORD, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Take thee a [roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004.md) of a
book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee
against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and against
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and against all the nations, from the
day I spake unto thee, from the days of [Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008.md),
even unto this day.  

<span id="003">3</span> It may be that the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) will hear all the evil which I purpose to
do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I
may forgive their iniquity and their [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Then [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) called
[Baruch](../ebd/ebd046.htm#001.md) the son of Neriah: and
[Baruch](../ebd/ebd046.htm#001.md) wrote from the mouth of
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) all the words of the LORD, which he
had spoken unto him, upon a [roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004.md) of a book.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) commanded
[Baruch](../ebd/ebd046.htm#001.md), saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into
the house of the LORD:  

<span id="006">6</span> Therefore go thou, and read in the
[roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004.md), which thou hast written from my mouth,
the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD's house upon
the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) that come out of their cities.  

<span id="007">7</span> It may be they will present their supplication
before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great
is the [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) and the
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md) that the LORD hath pronounced against this
people.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Baruch](../ebd/ebd046.htm#001.md) the son of
Neriah did according to all that [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) commanded him, reading in the book the
words of the LORD in the LORD's house.  

<span id="009">9</span> And it came to pass in the fifth year of
[Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001.md) the son of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), in the ninth month, that they proclaimed
a [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) before the LORD to all the people in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and to all the people that came from
the cities of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) unto
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> Then read [Baruch](../ebd/ebd046.htm#001.md) in
the book the words of [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) in the house of
the LORD, in the [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md) of
[Gemariah](../ebd/ebd145.htm#007.md) the son of
[Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004.md) the scribe, in the higher court, at the
entry of the new [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) of the LORD's house, in
the ears of all the people.  

<span id="011">11</span> When [Michaiah](../ebd/ebd253.htm#000.md) the son
of [Gemariah](../ebd/ebd145.htm#007.md), the son of
[Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004.md), had heard out of the book all the
words of the LORD,  

<span id="012">12</span> Then he went down into the king's house, into
the scribe's [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md): and, lo, all the princes
sat there, even [Elishama](../ebd/ebd118.htm#001.md) the scribe, and
[Delaiah](../ebd/ebd101.htm#001.md) the son of
[Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005), and [Elnathan](../ebd/ebd118.htm#009.md)
the son of [Achbor](../ebd/ebd006.htm#007.md), and
[Gemariah](../ebd/ebd145.htm#007.md) the son of
[Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004), and [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008.md)
the son of [Hananiah](../ebd/ebd162.htm#004.md), and all the princes.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then [Michaiah](../ebd/ebd253.htm#000.md) declared
unto them all the words that he had heard, when
[Baruch](../ebd/ebd046.htm#001.md) read the book in the ears of the
people.  

<span id="014">14</span> Therefore all the princes sent
[Jehudi](../ebd/ebd202.htm#009.md) the son of
[Nethaniah](../ebd/ebd271.htm#004.md), the son of
[Shelemiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#001.md), the son of Cushi, unto
[Baruch](../ebd/ebd046.htm#001.md), saying, Take in thine hand the
[roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004.md) wherein thou hast read in the ears of the
people, and come. So [Baruch](../ebd/ebd046.htm#001.md) the son of Neriah
took the [roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004.md) in his hand, and came unto
them.  

<span id="015">15</span> And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read
it in our ears. So [Baruch](../ebd/ebd046.htm#001.md) read it in their
ears.  

<span id="016">16</span> Now it came to pass, when they had heard all
the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto
[Baruch](../ebd/ebd046.htm#001.md), We will surely tell the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of all these words.  

<span id="017">17</span> And they asked [Baruch](../ebd/ebd046.htm#001.md),
saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his
mouth?  

<span id="018">18</span> Then [Baruch](../ebd/ebd046.htm#001.md) answered
them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote
them with ink in the book.  

<span id="019">19</span> Then said the princes unto
[Baruch](../ebd/ebd046.htm#001.md), Go, hide thee, thou and
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md); and let no man know where ye be.  

<span id="020">20</span> And they went in to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) into the court, but they laid up the
[roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004) in the [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md) of
[Elishama](../ebd/ebd118.htm#001.md) the scribe, and told all the words in
the ears of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> So the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) sent
[Jehudi](../ebd/ebd202.htm#009.md) to fetch the
[roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004.md): and he took it out of
[Elishama](../ebd/ebd118.htm#001.md) the scribe's
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003). And [Jehudi](../ebd/ebd202.htm#009.md)
read it in the ears of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and in the
ears of all the princes which stood beside the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> Now the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) sat in
the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the
[hearth](../ebd/ebd170.htm#002.md) burning before him.  

<span id="023">23</span> And it came to pass, that when
[Jehudi](../ebd/ebd202.htm#009.md) had read three or four leaves, he cut it
with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the
[hearth](../ebd/ebd170.htm#002.md), until all the
[roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004.md) was consumed in the fire that was on the
[hearth](../ebd/ebd170.htm#002.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> Yet they were not afraid, nor
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) their garments, neither the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), nor any of his servants that heard all
these words.  

<span id="025">25</span> Nevertheless [Elnathan](../ebd/ebd118.htm#009.md)
and [Delaiah](../ebd/ebd101.htm#001.md) and
[Gemariah](../ebd/ebd145.htm#007.md) had made intercession to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) that he would not burn the
[roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004.md): but he would not hear them.  

<span id="026">26</span> But the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) commanded
[Jerahmeel](../ebd/ebd203.htm#005.md) the son of
[Hammelech](../ebd/ebd160.htm#009), and [Seraiah](../ebd/ebd328.htm#003.md)
the son of Azriel, and [Shelemiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#001.md) the son of
[Abdeel](../ebd/ebd000.htm#009), to take [Baruch](../ebd/ebd046.htm#001.md)
the scribe and [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md): but the LORD hid them.  

<span id="027">27</span> Then the word of the LORD came to
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md), after that the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) had burned the
[roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004.md), and the words which
[Baruch](../ebd/ebd046.htm#001.md) wrote at the mouth of
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md), saying,  

<span id="028">28</span> Take thee again another
[roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004.md), and write in it all the former words that
were in the first [roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004.md), which
[Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) hath burned.  

<span id="029">29</span> And thou shalt say to
[Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned
this [roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004.md), saying, Why hast thou written
therein, saying, The [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md) shall certainly come and destroy this
land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md)?  

<span id="030">30</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD of
[Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md); He shall have none to sit upon the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md): and
his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night
to the [frost](../ebd/ebd138.htm#009.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> And I will punish him and his seed and his
servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the
inhabitants of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and upon the men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), all the evil that I have pronounced
against them; but they hearkened not.  

<span id="032">32</span> Then took [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md)
another [roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004.md), and gave it to
[Baruch](../ebd/ebd046.htm#001.md) the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote
therein from the mouth of [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) all the
words of the book which [Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) had
burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like
words.
