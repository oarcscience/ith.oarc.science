<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 15</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, ye cannot be saved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;When therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A> had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A>, and certain other of them, should go up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> unto the apostles and elders about this question.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#001">Phenice</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>, declaring the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd089.htm#002">conversion</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And when they were come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But there rose up certain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#008">sect</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And when there had been much disputing, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> by my mouth should hear the word of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A>, and believe.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A>, giving them the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>, even as he did unto us;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A> of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;But we believe that through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> of the LORD <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> we shall be saved, even as they.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> by them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And after they had held their peace, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</A> answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</A> hath declared how God at the first did visit the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, to take out of them a people for his name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;After this I will return, and will build again the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> are turned to God:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A>, and from things strangled, and from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> men of their own company to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</A> with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A>; namely, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</A> surnamed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#008">Barsabas</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</A>, chief men among the brethren:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#003">Cilicia</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> men unto you with our beloved <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;We have sent therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</A>, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;For it seemed good to the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>, and to us, to lay upon you no greater <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A> than these necessary things;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, and from things strangled, and from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A>: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;So when they were dismissed, they came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</A>: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</A>, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Notwithstanding it pleased <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</A> to abide there still.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> also and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A> continued in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</A>, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And some days after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A>, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A> determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd283.htm#008">Pamphylia</A>, and went not with them to the work.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A> took Mark, and sailed unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#003">Cyprus</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> chose <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</A>, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And he went through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#003">Cilicia</A>, confirming the churches.<BR>
