### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> And in that day [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), and wear our own
[apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000.md): only let us be called by thy name, to
take away our reproach.  

<span id="002">2</span> In that day shall the
[branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002.md) of the LORD be beautiful and glorious,
and the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of the earth shall be excellent
and comely for them that are escaped of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And it shall come to pass, that he that is left
in [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), and he that remaineth in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), shall be called holy, even every one
that is written among the living in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md):  

<span id="004">4</span> When the Lord shall have washed away the filth
of the daughters of [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), and shall have purged
the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md)
from the midst thereof by the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of
judgment, and by the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of burning.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the LORD will create upon every dwelling
place of [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md),
and upon her assemblies, a [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md) and smoke by
day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) shall be a defence.  

<span id="006">6</span> And there shall be a
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) for a
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) in the day time from the heat, and for a
place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md).
