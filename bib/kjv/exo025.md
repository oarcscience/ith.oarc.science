### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 25

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), that they bring me an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md): of every man that giveth it willingly
with his heart ye shall take my [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And this is the
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) which ye shall take of them;
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md),  

<span id="004">4</span> And [blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003.md), and purple,
and [scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md), and fine
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md), and goats' hair,  

<span id="005">5</span> And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins,
and [shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md),  

<span id="006">6</span> Oil for the light,
[spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005.md) for anointing oil, and for sweet
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md),  

<span id="007">7</span> [Onyx](../ebd/ebd279.htm#004.md) stones, and stones
to be set in the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md), and in the
[breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And let them make me a
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md); that I may dwell among them.  

<span id="009">9</span> According to all that I shew thee, after the
pattern of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), and the pattern of
all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.  

<span id="010">10</span> And they shall make an
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of [shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009.md)
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md): two cubits and a half shall be the length
thereof, and a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md) and a half the breadth
thereof, and a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md) and a half the height
thereof.  

<span id="011">11</span> And thou shalt overlay it with pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), within and without shalt thou overlay it,
and shalt make upon it a [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) round about.  

<span id="012">12</span> And thou shalt cast four rings of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) for it, and put them in the four corners
thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in
the other side of it.  

<span id="013">13</span> And thou shalt make staves of
[shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md), and
overlay them with [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by
the sides of the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md), that the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) may be borne with them.  

<span id="015">15</span> The staves shall be in the rings of the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md): they shall not be taken from it.  

<span id="016">16</span> And thou shalt put into the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) the [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md)
which I shall give thee.  

<span id="017">17</span> And thou shalt make a
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) seat of pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md): two cubits and a half shall be the length
thereof, and a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md) and a half the breadth
thereof.  

<span id="018">18</span> And thou shalt make two cherubims of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), of beaten work shalt thou make them, in
the two ends of the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) seat.  

<span id="019">19</span> And make one [cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003.md) on
the one end, and the other [cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003.md) on the other
end: even of the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) seat shall ye make the
cherubims on the two ends thereof.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the cherubims shall stretch forth their
wings on high, covering the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) seat with
their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) seat shall the faces of the cherubims
be.  

<span id="021">21</span> And thou shalt put the
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) seat above upon the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000); and in the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md)
thou shalt put the [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md) that I shall give
thee.  

<span id="022">22</span> And there I will meet with thee, and I will
commune with thee from above the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) seat,
from between the two cherubims which are upon the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md),
of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> Thou shalt also make a table of
[shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md): two
cubits shall be the length thereof, and a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md)
the breadth thereof, and a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md) and a half the
height thereof.  

<span id="024">24</span> And thou shalt overlay it with pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and make thereto a
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) round
about.  

<span id="025">25</span> And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand
breadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) to the border thereof round about.  

<span id="026">26</span> And thou shalt make for it four rings of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and put the rings in the four corners
that are on the four feet thereof.  

<span id="027">27</span> Over against the border shall the rings be for
places of the staves to bear the table.  

<span id="028">28</span> And thou shalt make the staves of
[shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md), and
overlay them with [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), that the table may be
borne with them.  

<span id="029">29</span> And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and
spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal:
of pure [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) shalt thou make them.  

<span id="030">30</span> And thou shalt set upon the table
[shewbread](../ebd/ebd336.htm#008.md) before me alway.  

<span id="031">31</span> And thou shalt make a
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md) of pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md): of beaten work shall the
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md) be made: his shaft, and his
branches, his bowls, his knops, and his
[flowers](../ebd/ebd136.htm#002.md), shall be of the same.  

<span id="032">32</span> And six branches shall come out of the sides of
it; three branches of the [candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md) out of
the one side, and three branches of the
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md) out of the other side:  

<span id="033">33</span> Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a
[knop](../ebd/ebd221.htm#009.md) and a flower in one
[branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002.md); and three bowls made like almonds in
the other [branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002.md), with a
[knop](../ebd/ebd221.htm#009.md) and a flower: so in the six branches that
come out of the [candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md).  

<span id="034">34</span> And in the candlesticks shall be four bowls
made like unto almonds, with their knops and their
[flowers](../ebd/ebd136.htm#002.md).  

<span id="035">35</span> And there shall be a
[knop](../ebd/ebd221.htm#009.md) under two branches of the same, and a
[knop](../ebd/ebd221.htm#009.md) under two branches of the same, and a

to the six branches that proceed out of the
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md).  

<span id="036">36</span> Their knops and their branches shall be of the
same: all it shall be one beaten work of pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="037">37</span> And thou shalt make the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) lamps thereof: and they shall light the
lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it.  

<span id="038">38</span> And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes
thereof, shall be of pure [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="039">39</span> Of a [talent](../ebd/ebd357.htm#009.md) of pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) shall he make it, with all these
vessels.  

<span id="040">40</span> And look that thou make them after their
pattern, which was shewed thee in the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md).
