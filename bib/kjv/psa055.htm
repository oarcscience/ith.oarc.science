<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 55</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> to my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A>, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Attend unto me, and hear me: I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</A> in my complaint, and make a noise;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And I said, Oh that I had wings like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd106.htm#007">dove</A>! for then would I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</A> away, and be at rest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#008">Selah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</A>: for wickedness is in their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#001">dwellings</A>, and among them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#008">Selah</A>. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;The words of his mouth were smoother than <A HREF="../ebd/ebd067.htm#002">butter</A>, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Cast thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A> upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.<BR>
