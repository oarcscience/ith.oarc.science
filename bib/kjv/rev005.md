### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on
the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) a book written within and on the
backside, sealed with [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) seals.  

<span id="002">2</span> And I saw a strong
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is
worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?  

<span id="003">3</span> And no man in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md),
nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book,
neither to look thereon.  

<span id="004">4</span> And I wept much, because no man was found worthy
to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.  

<span id="005">5</span> And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not:
behold, the Lion of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
[Juda](../ebd/ebd212.htm#006.md), the Root of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), hath prevailed to open the book, and to
loose the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) seals thereof.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) and of the four beasts, and in the midst
of the elders, stood a [Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md) as it had been
slain, having [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) horns and
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) eyes, which are the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) Spirits of God sent forth into all the
earth.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he came and took the book out of the right
hand of him that sat upon the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And when he had taken the book, the four beasts
and four and twenty elders fell down before the
[Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md), having every one of them harps, and
golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.  

<span id="009">9</span> And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art
worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast
slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md)
out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;  

<span id="010">10</span> And hast made us unto our God kings and
priests: and we shall reign on the earth.  

<span id="011">11</span> And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many
angels round about the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) and the beasts
and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten
thousand, and [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md) of
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md);  

<span id="012">12</span> Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the
[Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md) that was slain to receive power, and
riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), and blessing.  

<span id="013">13</span> And every [creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004.md)
which is in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and on the earth, and under
the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I
saying, Blessing, and honour, and [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), and
power, be unto him that sitteth upon the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), and unto the
[Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md) for ever and ever.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the four beasts said,
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md). And the four and twenty elders fell down
and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.
