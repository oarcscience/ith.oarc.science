### King James Version: Job Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> Then answered [Eliphaz](../ebd/ebd117.htm#005)
the [Temanite](../ebd/ebd361.htm#002), and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> Should a [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) man utter
vain knowledge, and fill his [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000) with the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) wind?  

<span id="003">3</span> Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with
speeches wherewith he can do no good?  

<span id="004">4</span> Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) before God.  

<span id="005">5</span> For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou
choosest the tongue of the crafty.  

<span id="006">6</span> Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea,
thine own lips testify against thee.  

<span id="007">7</span> Art thou the first man that was born? or wast
thou made before the hills?  

<span id="008">8</span> Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou
restrain wisdom to thyself?  

<span id="009">9</span> What knowest thou, that we know not? what
understandest thou, which is not in us?  

<span id="010">10</span> With us are both the grayheaded and very aged
men, much [elder](../ebd/ebd114.htm#008) than thy father.  

<span id="011">11</span> Are the consolations of God small with thee? is
there any secret thing with thee?  

<span id="012">12</span> Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what
do thy eyes wink at,  

<span id="013">13</span> That thou turnest thy
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) against God, and lettest such words go
out of thy mouth?  

<span id="014">14</span> What is man, that he should be
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005)? and he which is born of a woman, that he
should be righteous?  

<span id="015">15</span> Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea,
the heavens are not [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) in his sight.  

<span id="016">16</span> How much more abominable and filthy is man,
which drinketh iniquity like water?  

<span id="017">17</span> I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I
have seen I will declare;  

<span id="018">18</span> Which [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) men have
told from their fathers, and have not hid it:  

<span id="019">19</span> Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) passed among them.  

<span id="020">20</span> The wicked man travaileth with pain all his
days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.  

<span id="021">21</span> A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity
the [destroyer](../ebd/ebd102.htm#003) shall come upon him.  

<span id="022">22</span> He believeth not that he shall return out of
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008), and he is waited for of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="023">23</span> He wandereth abroad for
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the
day of [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) is ready at his hand.  

<span id="024">24</span> Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they
shall prevail against him, as a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) ready to
the battle.  

<span id="025">25</span> For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and
strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.  

<span id="026">26</span> He runneth upon him, even on his
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000), upon the thick
[bosses](../ebd/ebd062.htm#009) of his bucklers:  

<span id="027">27</span> Because he covereth his face with his fatness,
and maketh collops of [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) on his flanks.  

<span id="028">28</span> And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in
houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.  

<span id="029">29</span> He shall not be rich, neither shall his
substance continue, neither shall he prolong the
[perfection](../ebd/ebd290.htm#001) thereof upon the earth.  

<span id="030">30</span> He shall not depart out of
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008); the flame shall dry up his branches,
and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.  

<span id="031">31</span> Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity:
for vanity shall be his recompence.  

<span id="032">32</span> It shall be accomplished before his time, and
his [branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002) shall not be green.  

<span id="033">33</span> He shall shake off his unripe
[grape](../ebd/ebd154.htm#004) as the [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004), and
shall cast off his flower as the [olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009).  

<span id="034">34</span> For the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004)
of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles
of bribery.  

<span id="035">35</span> They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity,
and their [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000) prepareth deceit.
