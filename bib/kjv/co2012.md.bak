### King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> It is not expedient for me doubtless to
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md). I will come to visions and revelations
of the Lord.  

<span id="002">2</span> I knew a man in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or
whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught
up to the third [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or
out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)  

<span id="004">4</span> How that he was caught up into
[paradise](../ebd/ebd284.htm#004.md), and heard unspeakable words, which it
is not lawful for a man to utter.  

<span id="005">5</span> Of such an one will I
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md): yet of myself I will not
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), but in mine infirmities.  

<span id="006">6</span> For though I would desire to
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), I shall not be a fool; for I will say
the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that
which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.  

<span id="007">7</span> And lest I should be exalted above measure
through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a
[thorn](../ebd/ebd364.htm#006) in the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md),
the [messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005) of [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md)
to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.  

<span id="008">8</span> For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that
it might depart from me.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he said unto me, My
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) is sufficient for thee: for my strength
is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) in my infirmities, that the power of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) may rest upon me.  

<span id="010">10</span> Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in
reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's
sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.  

<span id="011">11</span> I am become a fool in glorying; ye have
compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing
am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.  

<span id="012">12</span> Truly the signs of an
[apostle](../ebd/ebd026.htm#008.md) were wrought among you in all patience,
in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.  

<span id="013">13</span> For what is it wherein ye were inferior to
other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you?
forgive me this wrong.  

<span id="014">14</span> Behold, the third time I am ready to come to
you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not your's but you:
for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents
for the children.  

<span id="015">15</span> And I will very gladly spend and be spent for
you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.  

<span id="016">16</span> But be it so, I did not
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md) you: nevertheless, being crafty, I
caught you with guile.  

<span id="017">17</span> Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I
sent unto you?  

<span id="018">18</span> I desired [Titus](../ebd/ebd368.htm#007.md), and
with him I sent a brother. Did [Titus](../ebd/ebd368.htm#007.md) make a
gain of you? walked we not in the same [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md)?
walked we not in the same steps?  

<span id="019">19</span> Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto
you? we speak before God in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md): but we do
all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.  

<span id="020">20</span> For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find
you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would
not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings,
whisperings, swellings, tumults:  

<span id="021">21</span> And lest, when I come again, my God will humble
me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already,
and have not repented of the uncleanness and
[fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008.md) and lasciviousness which they have
committed.
