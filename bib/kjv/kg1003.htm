</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> his father: only he sacrificed and burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> in high places.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> offer upon that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;In <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</A> the LORD appeared to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A> by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> my father great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, as it is this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> instead of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A>, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> this thy so great a people?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the speech pleased the LORD, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> had asked this thing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> awoke; and, behold, it was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>. And he came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and stood before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> to all his servants.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and stood before him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A> with us in the house, save we two in the house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A> slept, and laid it in her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</A>, and laid her dead child in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Then said the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said, Bring me a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>. And they brought a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, for her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A> yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> slay it: she is the mother thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> heard of the judgment which the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> had judged; and they feared the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.<BR>
