### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> The [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md) of
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md). Behold,
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md) is taken away from being a city, and
it shall be a ruinous [heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> The cities of [Aroer](../ebd/ebd032.htm#001.md) are
forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall
make them afraid.  

<span id="003">3</span> The fortress also shall cease from
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), and the kingdom from
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md), and the remnant of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md): they shall be as the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), saith the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="004">4</span> And in that day it shall come to pass, that the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) shall
be made thin, and the fatness of his [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md)
shall [wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000.md) lean.  

<span id="005">5</span> And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth
the [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md), and reapeth the ears with his arm;
and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [Rephaim](../ebd/ebd311.htm#000.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the
shaking of an [olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009.md) tree, two or three berries
in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful
branches thereof, saith the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and
his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And he shall not look to the altars, the work of
his hands, neither shall respect that which his fingers have made,
either the groves, or the images.  

<span id="009">9</span> In that day shall his strong cities be as a
forsaken bough, and an uppermost [branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002.md), which
they left because of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):
and there shall be desolation.  

<span id="010">10</span> Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md), and hast not been mindful of the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md) of thy strength, therefore shalt thou
plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it with strange slips:  

<span id="011">11</span> In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow,
and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish: but the
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md) shall be a
[heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md) in the day of grief and of desperate
sorrow.  

<span id="012">12</span> Woe to the multitude of many people, which make
a noise like the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that
make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!  

<span id="013">13</span> The nations shall [rush](../ebd/ebd316.htm#007.md)
like the rushing of many waters: but God shall rebuke them, and they
shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the
[chaff](../ebd/ebd075.htm#007.md) of the mountains before the wind, and
like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.  

<span id="014">14</span> And behold at eveningtide trouble; and before
the morning he is not. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and
the lot of them that rob us.
