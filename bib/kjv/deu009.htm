<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 9</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Hear, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: Thou art to pass over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A> this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd022.htm#005">Anak</A>!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Not for thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>; for thou art a stiffnecked people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Also in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#009">Horeb</A> ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;When I was gone up into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> to receive the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, even the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> nor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> water:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the LORD delivered unto me two <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, even the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#002">blot</A> out their name from under <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;So I turned and came down from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> burned with fire: and the two <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> were in my two hands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</A>: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And I took the two <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</A>, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, nor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For I was afraid of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And the LORD was very angry with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A> to have destroyed him: and I prayed for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A> also the same time.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And I took your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</A> which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A>: and I cast the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> thereof into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A> that descended out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#001">Taberah</A>, and at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd243.htm#006">Massah</A>, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> with a mighty hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Remember thy servants, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.<BR>
