### King James Version: Job Chapter 36

<span id="001">1</span> [Elihu](../ebd/ebd116.htm#008.md) also proceeded,
and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I
have yet to speak on God's behalf.  

<span id="003">3</span> I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will
ascribe [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) to my Maker.  

<span id="004">4</span> For truly my words shall not be false: he that
is perfect in knowledge is with thee.  

<span id="005">5</span> Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he
is mighty in strength and wisdom.  

<span id="006">6</span> He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but
giveth right to the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous:
but with kings are they on the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md); yea, he
doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.  

<span id="008">8</span> And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden
in cords of affliction;  

<span id="009">9</span> Then he sheweth them their work, and their
transgressions that they have exceeded.  

<span id="010">10</span> He openeth also their
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) to discipline, and commandeth that they
return from iniquity.  

<span id="011">11</span> If they obey and serve him, they shall spend
their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.  

<span id="012">12</span> But if they obey not, they shall perish by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), and they shall die without knowledge.  

<span id="013">13</span> But the hypocrites in heart
[heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md) up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth
them.  

<span id="014">14</span> They die in youth, and their life is among the
unclean.  

<span id="015">15</span> He delivereth the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md)
in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.  

<span id="016">16</span> Even so would he have removed thee out of the
strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which
should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.  

<span id="017">17</span> But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the
wicked: judgment and [justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007.md) take hold on
thee.  

<span id="018">18</span> Because there is wrath, beware lest he take
thee away with his stroke: then a great [ransom](../ebd/ebd307.htm#005.md)
cannot deliver thee.  

<span id="019">19</span> Will he esteem thy riches? no, not
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), nor all the
[forces](../ebd/ebd137.htm#000.md) of strength.  

<span id="020">20</span> Desire not the night, when people are cut off
in their place.  

<span id="021">21</span> Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast
thou [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) rather than affliction.  

<span id="022">22</span> Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth
like him?  

<span id="023">23</span> Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say,
Thou hast wrought iniquity?  

<span id="024">24</span> Remember that thou magnify his work, which men
behold.  

<span id="025">25</span> Every man may see it; man may behold it afar
off.  

<span id="026">26</span> Behold, God is great, and we know him not,
neither can the number of his years be searched out.  

<span id="027">27</span> For he maketh small the drops of water: they
pour down [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) according to the vapour
thereof:  

<span id="028">28</span> Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man
abundantly.  

<span id="029">29</span> Also can any understand the spreadings of the
clouds, or the noise of his [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md)?  

<span id="030">30</span> Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and
covereth the bottom of the sea.  

<span id="031">31</span> For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth
meat in abundance.  

<span id="032">32</span> With clouds he covereth the light; and
commandeth it not to shine by the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md) that
cometh betwixt.  

<span id="033">33</span> The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) also concerning the vapour.
