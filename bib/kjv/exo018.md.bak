### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> When [Jethro](../ebd/ebd206.htm#000.md), the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) of [Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md),
Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), and for [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
his people, and that the LORD had brought
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md);  

<span id="002">2</span> Then [Jethro](../ebd/ebd206.htm#000.md), Moses'
father in law, took [Zipporah](../ebd/ebd394.htm#008.md), Moses' wife,
after he had sent her back,  

<span id="003">3</span> And her two sons; of which the name of the one
was [Gershom](../ebd/ebd146.htm#008.md); for he said, I have been an
[alien](../ebd/ebd017.htm#003.md) in a strange land:  

<span id="004">4</span> And the name of the other was
[Eliezer](../ebd/ebd116.htm#007.md); for the God of my father, said he, was
mine help, and delivered me from the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md):  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Jethro](../ebd/ebd206.htm#000.md), Moses'
father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), where he encamped at the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) of God:  

<span id="006">6</span> And he said unto [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md),
I thy father in law [Jethro](../ebd/ebd206.htm#000.md) am come unto thee,
and thy wife, and her two sons with her.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) went out to
meet his father in law, and did [obeisance](../ebd/ebd276.htm#006.md), and
kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came
into the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) told his
father in law all that the LORD had done unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake,
and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD
delivered them.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Jethro](../ebd/ebd206.htm#000.md) rejoiced for
all the [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md) which the LORD had done to
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), whom he had delivered out of the hand
of the Egyptians.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Jethro](../ebd/ebd206.htm#000.md) said,
Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the
Egyptians, and out of the hand of [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), who
hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.  

<span id="011">11</span> Now I know that the LORD is greater than all
gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Jethro](../ebd/ebd206.htm#000.md), Moses'
father in law, took a burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) and
sacrifices for God: and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) came, and all the
elders of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), to eat
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) with Moses' father in law before God.  

<span id="013">13</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) sat to [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) the
people: and the people stood by [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) from the
morning unto the evening.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when Moses' father in law saw all that he
did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the
people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee
from morning unto even?  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said unto
his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:  

<span id="016">16</span> When they have a matter, they come unto me; and
I [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) between one and another, and I do make
them know the statutes of God, and his laws.  

<span id="017">17</span> And Moses' father in law said unto him, The
thing that thou doest is not good.  

<span id="018">18</span> Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this
people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art
not able to perform it thyself alone.  

<span id="019">19</span> Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee
counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward,
that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:  

<span id="020">20</span> And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws,
and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that
they must do.  

<span id="021">21</span> Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the
people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating
[covetousness](../ebd/ebd092.htm#000.md); and place such over them, to be
rulers of [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md), and rulers of hundreds,
rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:  

<span id="022">22</span> And let them [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) the
people at all [seasons](../ebd/ebd325.htm#003.md): and it shall be, that
every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter
they shall [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md): so shall it be easier for
thyself, and they shall bear the [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md) with
thee.  

<span id="023">23</span> If thou shalt do this thing, and God command
thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall
also go to their place in peace.  

<span id="024">24</span> So [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) hearkened to
the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) chose able
men out of all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and made them heads over
the people, rulers of [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md), rulers of
hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.  

<span id="026">26</span> And they judged the people at all
[seasons](../ebd/ebd325.htm#003.md): the hard causes they brought unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), but every small matter they judged
themselves.  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) let his
father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.
