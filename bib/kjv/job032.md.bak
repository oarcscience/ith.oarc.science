### King James Version: Job Chapter 32

<span id="001">1</span> So these three men ceased to answer Job, because
he was righteous in his own eyes.  

<span id="002">2</span> Then was kindled the wrath of
[Elihu](../ebd/ebd116.htm#008.md) the son of
[Barachel](../ebd/ebd044.htm#003.md) the Buzite, of the kindred of
[Ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md): against Job was his wrath kindled, because
he justified himself rather than God.  

<span id="003">3</span> Also against his three friends was his wrath
kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.  

<span id="004">4</span> Now [Elihu](../ebd/ebd116.htm#008.md) had waited
till Job had spoken, because they were [elder](../ebd/ebd114.htm#008.md)
than he.  

<span id="005">5</span> When [Elihu](../ebd/ebd116.htm#008.md) saw that
there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was
kindled.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Elihu](../ebd/ebd116.htm#008.md) the son of
[Barachel](../ebd/ebd044.htm#003.md) the Buzite answered and said, I am
young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew
you mine opinion.  

<span id="007">7</span> I said, Days should speak, and multitude of
years should teach wisdom.  

<span id="008">8</span> But there is a [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md)
in man: and the [inspiration](../ebd/ebd188.htm#006.md) of the Almighty
giveth them understanding.  

<span id="009">9</span> Great men are not always
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md): neither do the aged understand
judgment.  

<span id="010">10</span> Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will
shew mine opinion.  

<span id="011">11</span> Behold, I waited for your words; I gave
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) to your reasons, whilst ye searched out
what to say.  

<span id="012">12</span> Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there
was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:  

<span id="013">13</span> Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom:
God thrusteth him down, not man.  

<span id="014">14</span> Now he hath not directed his words against me:
neither will I answer him with your speeches.  

<span id="015">15</span> They were amazed, they answered no more: they
left off speaking.  

<span id="016">16</span> When I had waited, (for they spake not, but
stood still, and answered no more;)  

<span id="017">17</span> I said, I will answer also my part, I also will
shew mine opinion.  

<span id="018">18</span> For I am full of matter, the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) within me constraineth me.  

<span id="019">19</span> Behold, my [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000.md) is as
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) which hath no vent; it is ready to burst
like new bottles.  

<span id="020">20</span> I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will
open my lips and answer.  

<span id="021">21</span> Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's
person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.  

<span id="022">22</span> For I know not to give flattering titles; in so
doing my maker would soon take me away.
