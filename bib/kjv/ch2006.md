### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> Then said [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007), The
LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008).  

<span id="002">2</span> But I have built an house of
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007) for thee, and a place for thy
dwelling for ever.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) turned his
face, and blessed the whole [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
stood.  

<span id="004">4</span> And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), who hath with his hands fulfilled that
which he spake with his mouth to my father
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), saying,  

<span id="005">5</span> Since the day that I brought forth my people out
of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) I chose no city among all
the tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to build an house in, that
my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my
people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000):  

<span id="006">6</span> But I have [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008)
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), that my name might be there; and
have [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) to
be over my people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="007">7</span> Now it was in the heart of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) my father to build an house for the name
of the LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="008">8</span> But the LORD said to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine
heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in
thine heart:  

<span id="009">9</span> Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house;
but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the
house for my name.  

<span id="010">10</span> The LORD therefore hath performed his word that
he hath spoken: for I am risen up in the room of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) my father, and am set on the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), as
the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="011">11</span> And in it have I put the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000), wherein is the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of the LORD, that he made with the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="012">12</span> And he stood before the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of the LORD in the presence of all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and spread forth his hands:  

<span id="013">13</span> For [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) had made a
brasen scaffold of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three
cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he
stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and spread forth his hands toward
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="014">14</span> And said, O LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), there is no God like thee in the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), nor in the earth; which keepest
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), and shewest
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) unto thy servants, that walk before thee
with all their hearts:  

<span id="015">15</span> Thou which hast kept with thy servant
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) my father that which thou hast promised
him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand,
as it is this day.  

<span id="016">16</span> Now therefore, O LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), keep with thy servant
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) my father that which thou hast promised
him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); yet
so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou
hast walked before me.  

<span id="017">17</span> Now then, O LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), let thy word be verified, which thou
hast spoken unto thy servant [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="018">18</span> But will God in very deed dwell with men on the
earth? behold, [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) and the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) of heavens cannot contain thee; how much
less this house which I have built!  

<span id="019">19</span> Have respect therefore to the
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) of thy servant, and to his supplication,
O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and the
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) which thy servant prayeth before thee:  

<span id="020">20</span> That thine eyes may be open upon this house day
and night, upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put
thy name there; to hearken unto the [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000)
which thy servant prayeth toward this place.  

<span id="021">21</span> Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy
servant, and of thy people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which they
shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling place, even
from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006); and when thou hearest, forgive.  

<span id="022">22</span> If a man [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) against
his neighbour, and an [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) be laid upon him to
make him swear, and the [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) come before thine
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) in this house;  

<span id="023">23</span> Then hear thou from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and do, and
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by
recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous,
by giving him according to his [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="024">24</span> And if thy people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) be put to the worse before the enemy,
because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy
name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;  

<span id="025">25</span> Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive
the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) of thy people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and bring them again unto the land
which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.  

<span id="026">26</span> When the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) is
shut up, and there is no [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008), because they
have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place, and
confess thy name, and turn from their [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), when
thou dost afflict them;  

<span id="027">27</span> Then hear thou from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and forgive the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) of thy servants, and of thy people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), when thou hast taught them the good
way, wherein they should walk; and send [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008)
upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an
inheritance.  

<span id="028">28</span> If there be [dearth](../ebd/ebd099.htm#005) in
the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or
[mildew](../ebd/ebd254.htm#007), locusts, or caterpillers; if their
enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or
whatsoever sickness there be:  

<span id="029">29</span> Then what [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) or
what supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), when every one shall know his own sore
and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house:  

<span id="030">30</span> Then hear thou from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) thy dwelling place, and forgive, and
render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart thou
knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:)  

<span id="031">31</span> That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways,
so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.  

<span id="032">32</span> Moreover concerning the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), which is not of thy people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), but is come from a far country for thy
great name's sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if
they come and pray in this house;  

<span id="033">33</span> Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy
dwelling place, and do according to all that the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) calleth to thee for; that all people
of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and may know that this house which I
have built is called by thy name.  

<span id="034">34</span> If thy people go out to war against their
enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee
toward this city which thou hast [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008), and
the house which I have built for thy name;  

<span id="035">35</span> Then hear thou from the heavens their
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) and their supplication, and maintain
their cause.  

<span id="036">36</span> If they [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) against
thee, (for there is no man which sinneth not,) and thou be angry with
them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them
away captives unto a land far off or near;  

<span id="037">37</span> Yet if they bethink themselves in the land
whither they are carried [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001), and turn and
pray unto thee in the land of their [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002),
saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly;  

<span id="038">38</span> If they return to thee with all their heart and
with all their soul in the land of their
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002), whither they have carried them
captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their
fathers, and toward the city which thou hast
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008), and toward the house which I have built
for thy name:  

<span id="039">39</span> Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy
dwelling place, their [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) and their
supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people which
have sinned against thee.  

<span id="040">40</span> Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be
open, and let thine ears be attent unto the
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) that is made in this place.  

<span id="041">41</span> Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy
resting place, thou, and the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of thy
strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed with
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003), and let thy saints rejoice in
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000).  

<span id="042">42</span> O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine
anointed: remember the mercies of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) thy
servant.
