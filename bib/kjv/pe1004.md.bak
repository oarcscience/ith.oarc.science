### King James Version: 1 Peter Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Forasmuch then as
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) hath suffered for us in the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), arm yourselves likewise with the same
mind: for he that hath suffered in the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md)
hath ceased from [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md);  

<span id="002">2</span> That he no longer should live the rest of his
time in the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) to the lusts of men, but to
the will of God.  

<span id="003">3</span> For the time past of our life may suffice us to
have wrought the will of the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md), when we
walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), revellings, banquetings, and abominable
idolatries:  

<span id="004">4</span> Wherein they think it strange that ye run not
with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:  

<span id="005">5</span> Who shall give account to him that is ready to
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) the quick and the dead.  

<span id="006">6</span> For for this cause was the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) preached also to them that are dead,
that they might be judged according to men in the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), but live according to God in the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> But the end of all things is at hand: be ye
therefore sober, and watch unto [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And above all things have fervent
[charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009.md) among yourselves: for
[charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009.md) shall cover the multitude of sins.  

<span id="009">9</span> Use hospitality one to another without
grudging.  

<span id="010">10</span> As every man hath received the
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005), even so [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md)
the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of God.  

<span id="011">11</span> If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles
of God; if any man [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md), let him do it as
of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified
through [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md),
to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever.
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> Beloved, think it not strange concerning the
fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened
unto you:  

<span id="013">13</span> But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of
Christ's sufferings; that, when his [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) shall
be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.  

<span id="014">14</span> If ye be reproached for the name of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), happy are ye; for the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) and of
God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your
part he is glorified.  

<span id="015">15</span> But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as
a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.  

<span id="016">16</span> Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him
not be ashamed; but let him [glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005.md) God on this
behalf.  

<span id="017">17</span> For the time is come that judgment must begin
at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be
of them that obey not the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) of God?  

<span id="018">18</span> And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where
shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?  

<span id="019">19</span> Wherefore let them that suffer according to the
will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as
unto a [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md) Creator.
