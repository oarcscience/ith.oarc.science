### King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> So I returned, and considered all the
oppressions that are done under the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md): and
behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no
[comforter](../ebd/ebd087.htm#001.md); and on the side of their oppressors
there was power; but they had no [comforter](../ebd/ebd087.htm#001.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Wherefore I praised the dead which are already
dead more than the living which are yet alive.  

<span id="003">3</span> Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not
yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Again, I considered all travail, and every right
work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also
vanity and vexation of [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth
his own [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Better is an handful with quietness, than both
the hands full with travail and vexation of
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> There is one alone, and there is not a second;
yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his
labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For
whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea,
it is a sore travail.  

<span id="009">9</span> Two are better than one; because they have a
good reward for their labour.  

<span id="010">10</span> For if they fall, the one will lift up his
fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not
another to help him up.  

<span id="011">11</span> Again, if two lie together, then they have
heat: but how can one be warm alone?  

<span id="012">12</span> And if one prevail against him, two shall
withstand him; and a threefold [cord](../ebd/ebd090.htm#000.md) is not
quickly broken.  

<span id="013">13</span> Better is a [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) and a
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) child than an old and foolish
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), who will no more be admonished.  

<span id="014">14</span> For out of [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md) he
cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> I considered all the living which walk under
the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md), with the second child that shall stand
up in his stead.  

<span id="016">16</span> There is no end of all the people, even of all
that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice
in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md).
