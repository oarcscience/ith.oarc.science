### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 98

<span id="001">1</span> O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath
done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten
him the victory.  

<span id="002">2</span> The LORD hath made known his
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md): his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) hath he openly shewed in the
sight of the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> He hath remembered his
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) and his truth toward the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): all the ends of the earth have seen the
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) of our God.  

<span id="004">4</span> Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the
earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.  

<span id="005">5</span> Sing unto the LORD with the
[harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001); with the [harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001.md),
and the voice of a psalm.  

<span id="006">6</span> With [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md) and sound
of [cornet](../ebd/ebd090.htm#009.md) make a joyful noise before the LORD,
the [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Let the sea roar, and the
[fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007.md) thereof; the world, and they that dwell
therein.  

<span id="008">8</span> Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills
be joyful together  

<span id="009">9</span> Before the LORD; for he cometh to
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) the earth: with
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) shall he
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) the world, and the people with equity.
