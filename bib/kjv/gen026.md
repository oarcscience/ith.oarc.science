### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 26

<span id="001">1</span> And there was a [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md)
in the land, beside the first [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md) that was
in the days of [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md). And
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) went unto
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) unto
[Gerar](../ebd/ebd146.htm#005.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not
down into [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md); dwell in the land which I
shall tell thee of:  

<span id="003">3</span> Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee,
and will [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) thee; for unto thee, and unto
thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md) which I sware unto
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) thy father;  

<span id="004">4</span> And I will make thy seed to multiply as the
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and
will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all
the nations of the earth be blessed;  

<span id="005">5</span> Because that [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md)
obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and
my laws.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) dwelt in
[Gerar](../ebd/ebd146.htm#005.md):  

<span id="007">7</span> And the men of the place asked him of his wife;
and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife;
lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for
[Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md); because she was fair to look upon.  

<span id="008">8</span> And it came to pass, when he had been there a
long time, that [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) looked out at a window, and saw,
and, behold, [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) was sporting with
[Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md) his wife.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) called
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md), and said, Behold, of a
[surety](../ebd/ebd353.htm#005.md) she is thy wife; and how saidst thou,
She is my sister? And [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) said unto him,
Because I said, Lest I die for her.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) said,
What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly
have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon
us.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) charged
all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall
surely be put to death.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) sowed in
that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD
blessed him.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the man waxed great, and went forward, and
grew until he became very great:  

<span id="014">14</span> For he had possession of flocks, and possession
of herds, and great store of servants: and the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) envied him.  

<span id="015">15</span> For all the wells which his father's servants
had digged in the days of [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) his father,
the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) had stopped them, and filled
them with earth.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) said
unto [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md), Go from us; for thou art much
mightier than we.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) departed
thence, and pitched his [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [Gerar](../ebd/ebd146.htm#005.md), and
dwelt there.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) digged again
the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) his father; for the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) had stopped them after the death of
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md): and he called their names after the
names by which his father had called them.  

<span id="019">19</span> And Isaac's servants digged in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md), and found there a well of springing
water.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the herdmen of
[Gerar](../ebd/ebd146.htm#005.md) did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying,
The water is ours: and he called the name of the well
[Esek](../ebd/ebd124.htm#008.md); because they strove with him.  

<span id="021">21</span> And they digged another well, and strove for
that also: and he called the name of it
[Sitnah](../ebd/ebd345.htm#008.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And he removed from thence, and digged another
well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it
[Rehoboth](../ebd/ebd309.htm#008.md); and he said, For now the LORD hath
made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.  

<span id="023">23</span> And he went up from thence to
[Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And the LORD appeared unto him the same night,
and said, I am the God of [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) thy father:
fear not, for I am with thee, and will [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md)
thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.  

<span id="025">25</span> And he builded an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) there, and called upon the name of the
LORD, and pitched his [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) there: and there
Isaac's servants digged a well.  

<span id="026">26</span> Then [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) went to
him from [Gerar](../ebd/ebd146.htm#005.md), and Ahuzzath one of his
friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) said unto
them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away
from you?  

<span id="028">28</span> And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD
was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md) betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and
let us make a [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with thee;  

<span id="029">29</span> That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not
touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have
sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.  

<span id="030">30</span> And he made them a
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md), and they did eat and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> And they rose up betimes in the morning, and
sware one to another: and [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) sent them away,
and they departed from him in peace.  

<span id="032">32</span> And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's
servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged,
and said unto him, We have found water.  

<span id="033">33</span> And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of
the city is [Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008.md) unto this day.  

<span id="034">34</span> And [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) was forty
years old when he took to wife [Judith](../ebd/ebd214.htm#001.md) the
daughter of [Beeri](../ebd/ebd050.htm#004.md) the Hittite, and
[Bashemath](../ebd/ebd046.htm#006.md) the daughter of
[Elon](../ebd/ebd119.htm#000.md) the Hittite:  

<span id="035">35</span> Which were a grief of mind unto
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) and to
[Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md).
