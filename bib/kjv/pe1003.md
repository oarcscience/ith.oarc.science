### King James Version: 1 Peter Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own
husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word
be won by the [conversation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#001) of the wives;  

<span id="002">2</span> While they behold your chaste
[conversation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#001) coupled with fear.  

<span id="003">3</span> Whose adorning let it not be that outward
adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), or of putting on of
[apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000);  

<span id="004">4</span> But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in
that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), which is in the sight of God of great
price.  

<span id="005">5</span> For after this manner in the old time the holy
women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection
unto their own husbands:  

<span id="006">6</span> Even as Sara obeyed
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), [calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007) him
lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid
with any amazement.  

<span id="007">7</span> Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according
to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel,
and as being heirs together of the [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) of
life; that your prayers be not hindered.  

<span id="008">8</span> Finally, be ye all of one mind, having
compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:  

<span id="009">9</span> Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for
railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto
called, that ye should inherit a blessing.  

<span id="010">10</span> For he that will love life, and see good days,
let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no
guile:  

<span id="011">11</span> Let him [eschew](../ebd/ebd124.htm#006) evil,
and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.  

<span id="012">12</span> For the eyes of the Lord are over the
righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the
Lord is against them that do evil.  

<span id="013">13</span> And who is he that will harm you, if ye be
followers of that which is good?  

<span id="014">14</span> But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake,
happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;  

<span id="015">15</span> But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and
be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason
of the hope that is in you with [meekness](../ebd/ebd246.htm#003) and
fear:  

<span id="016">16</span> Having a good
[conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006); that, whereas they speak evil of
you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good
[conversation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#001) in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="017">17</span> For it is better, if the will of God be so,
that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.  

<span id="018">18</span> For [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) also hath
once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us
to God, being put to death in the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), but
quickened by the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009):  

<span id="019">19</span> By which also he went and preached unto the
spirits in [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006);  

<span id="020">20</span> Which sometime were disobedient, when once the
longsuffering of God waited in the days of
[Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002), while the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000)
was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by
water.  

<span id="021">21</span> The like figure whereunto even baptism doth
also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), but the answer of a good
[conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006) toward God,) by the resurrection of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000):  

<span id="022">22</span> Who is gone into
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and is on the right hand of God; angels
and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.
