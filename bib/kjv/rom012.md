### King James Version: Romans Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the
mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002), holy, acceptable unto God, which is
your reasonable service.  

<span id="002">2</span> And be not conformed to this world: but be ye
transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that
good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.  

<span id="003">3</span> For I say, through the
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) given unto me, to every man that is among
you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to
think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of
faith.  

<span id="004">4</span> For as we have many members in one body, and all
members have not the same office:  

<span id="005">5</span> So we, being many, are one body in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), and every one members one of another.  

<span id="006">6</span> Having then gifts differing according to the
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) that is given to us, whether
[prophecy](../ebd/ebd300.htm#007), let us prophesy according to the
proportion of faith;  

<span id="007">7</span> Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or
he that teacheth, on teaching;  

<span id="008">8</span> Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that
giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence;
he that sheweth [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005), with cheerfulness.  

<span id="009">9</span> Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that
which is evil; cleave to that which is good.  

<span id="010">10</span> Be kindly affectioned one to another with
brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;  

<span id="011">11</span> Not slothful in business; fervent in
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009); serving the Lord;  

<span id="012">12</span> Rejoicing in hope; patient in
[tribulation](../ebd/ebd372.htm#005); continuing instant in
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000);  

<span id="013">13</span> Distributing to the necessity of saints; given
to hospitality.  

<span id="014">14</span> [Bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) them which
persecute you: [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008), and
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) not.  

<span id="015">15</span> Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep
with them that weep.  

<span id="016">16</span> Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind
not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) in your own conceits.  

<span id="017">17</span> Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide
things honest in the sight of all men.  

<span id="018">18</span> If it be possible, as much as lieth in you,
live peaceably with all men.  

<span id="019">19</span> Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but
rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I
will repay, saith the Lord.  

<span id="020">20</span> Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if
he thirst, give him [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009): for in so doing thou
shalt [heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000) coals of fire on his head.  

<span id="021">21</span> Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with
good.
