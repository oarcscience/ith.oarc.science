### King James Version: 1 Thessalonians Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and
exhort you by the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), that as ye have
received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would
abound more and more.  

<span id="002">2</span> For ye know what commandments we gave you by the
Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="003">3</span> For this is the will of God, even your
[sanctification](../ebd/ebd321.htm#004), that ye should abstain from
[fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008):  

<span id="004">4</span> That every one of you should know how to possess
his vessel in [sanctification](../ebd/ebd321.htm#004) and honour;  

<span id="005">5</span> Not in the [lust](../ebd/ebd233.htm#005) of
[concupiscence](../ebd/ebd087.htm#008), even as the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) which know not God:  

<span id="006">6</span> That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in
any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also
have forewarned you and testified.  

<span id="007">7</span> For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but
unto [holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006).  

<span id="008">8</span> He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man,
but God, who hath also given unto us his holy
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009).  

<span id="009">9</span> But as touching brotherly love ye need not that
I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one
another.  

<span id="010">10</span> And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren
which are in all [Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003): but we beseech you,
brethren, that ye increase more and more;  

<span id="011">11</span> And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your
own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;  

<span id="012">12</span> That ye may walk honestly toward them that are
without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.  

<span id="013">13</span> But I would not have you to be ignorant,
brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as
others which have no hope.  

<span id="014">14</span> For if we believe that
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) died and rose again, even so them also
which sleep in [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) will God bring with him.  

<span id="015">15</span> For this we say unto you by the word of the
Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord
shall not prevent them which are asleep.  

<span id="016">16</span> For the Lord himself shall descend from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) with a shout, with the voice of the
[archangel](../ebd/ebd028.htm#009), and with the trump of God: and the
dead in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) shall rise first:  

<span id="017">17</span> Then we which are alive and remain shall be
caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air:
and so shall we ever be with the Lord.  

<span id="018">18</span> Wherefore comfort one another with these
words.
