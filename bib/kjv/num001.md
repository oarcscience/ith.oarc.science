[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) that cometh nigh shall be put to
death.  

<span id="052">52</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall [pitch](../ebd/ebd296.htm#008.md)
their tents, every man by his own [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md), and
every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.  

<span id="053">53</span> But the Levites shall
