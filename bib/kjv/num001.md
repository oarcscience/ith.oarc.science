<span id="051">51</span> And when the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) setteth forward, the Levites shall
take it down: and when the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) is to be
pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) that cometh nigh shall be put to
death.  

<span id="052">52</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall [pitch](../ebd/ebd296.htm#008)
their tents, every man by his own [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002), and
every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.  

<span id="053">53</span> But the Levites shall
[pitch](../ebd/ebd296.htm#008) round about the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008), that there be no wrath upon the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and the Levites shall keep the charge
