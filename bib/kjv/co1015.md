### King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) which I preached unto you, which also ye
have received, and wherein ye stand;  

<span id="002">2</span> By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory
what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  

<span id="003">3</span> For I delivered unto you first of all that which
I also received, how that [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) died for our
sins according to the scriptures;  

<span id="004">4</span> And that he was buried, and that he rose again
the third day according to the scriptures:  

<span id="005">5</span> And that he was seen of
[Cephas](../ebd/ebd075.htm#005), then of the twelve:  

<span id="006">6</span> After that, he was seen of above five hundred
brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but
some are fallen asleep.  

<span id="007">7</span> After that, he was seen of
[James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007); then of all the apostles.  

<span id="008">8</span> And last of all he was seen of me also, as of
one born out of due time.  

<span id="009">9</span> For I am the least of the apostles, that am not
meet to be called an [apostle](../ebd/ebd026.htm#008), because I
persecuted the church of God.  

<span id="010">10</span> But by the [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) of
God I am what I am: and his [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) which was
bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than
they all: yet not I, but the [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) of God which
was with me.  

<span id="011">11</span> Therefore whether it were I or they, so we
preach, and so ye believed.  

<span id="012">12</span> Now if [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) be
preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there
is no resurrection of the dead?  

<span id="013">13</span> But if there be no resurrection of the dead,
then is [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) not risen:  

<span id="014">14</span> And if [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) be not
risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.  

<span id="015">15</span> Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God;
because we have testified of God that he raised up
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000): whom he raised not up, if so be that
the dead rise not.  

<span id="016">16</span> For if the dead rise not, then is not
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) raised:  

<span id="017">17</span> And if [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) be not
raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then they also which are fallen asleep in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) are perished.  

<span id="019">19</span> If in this life only we have hope in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), we are of all men most miserable.  

<span id="020">20</span> But now is [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)
risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.  

<span id="021">21</span> For since by man came death, by man came also
the resurrection of the dead.  

<span id="022">22</span> For as in [Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007) all
die, even so in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) shall all be made
alive.  

<span id="023">23</span> But every man in his own order:
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) the firstfruits; afterward they that are
Christ's at his coming.  

<span id="024">24</span> Then cometh the end, when he shall have
delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put
down all rule and all authority and power.  

<span id="025">25</span> For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies
under his feet.  

<span id="026">26</span> The last enemy that shall be destroyed is
death.  

<span id="027">27</span> For he hath put all things under his feet. But
when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is
excepted, which did put all things under him.  

<span id="028">28</span> And when all things shall be subdued unto him,
then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things
under him, that God may be all in all.  

<span id="029">29</span> Else what shall they do which are baptized for
the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for
the dead?  

<span id="030">30</span> And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?  

<span id="031">31</span> I protest by your rejoicing which I have in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) our LORD,
I die daily.  

<span id="032">32</span> If after the manner of men I have fought with
beasts at [Ephesus](../ebd/ebd122.htm#007), what advantageth it me, if
the dead rise not? let us eat and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009); for to
morrow we die.  

<span id="033">33</span> Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt
good manners.  

<span id="034">34</span> Awake to
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), and [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your
shame.  

<span id="035">35</span> But some man will say, How are the dead raised
up? and with what body do they come?  

<span id="036">36</span> Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not
quickened, except it die:  

<span id="037">37</span> And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not
that body that shall be, but bare [grain](../ebd/ebd154.htm#003), it may
chance of [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000), or of some other
[grain](../ebd/ebd154.htm#003):  

<span id="038">38</span> But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased
him, and to every seed his own body.  

<span id="039">39</span> All [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) is not the
same [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007): but there is one kind of
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) of men, another
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) of beasts, another of fishes, and another
of birds.  

<span id="040">40</span> There are also celestial bodies, and bodies
terrestrial: but the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the celestial is
one, and the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the terrestrial is
another.  

<span id="041">41</span> There is one [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of
the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), and another
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004), and
another [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008): for one star differeth from another star
in [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006).  

<span id="042">42</span> So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is
sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:  

<span id="043">43</span> It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006): it is sown in weakness; it is raised in
power:  

<span id="044">44</span> It is sown a natural body; it is raised a
spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual
body.  

<span id="045">45</span> And so it is written, The first man
[Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007) was made a living soul; the last
[Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007) was made a quickening
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009).  

<span id="046">46</span> Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual,
but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.  

<span id="047">47</span> The first man is of the earth, earthy; the
second man is the Lord from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="048">48</span> As is the earthy, such are they also that are
earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.  

<span id="049">49</span> And as we have borne the image of the earthy,
we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.  

<span id="050">50</span> Now this I say, brethren, that
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) and [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) cannot
inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit
incorruption.  

<span id="051">51</span> Behold, I shew you a
[mystery](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006); We shall not all sleep, but we shall
all be changed,  

<span id="052">52</span> In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the
last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised
incorruptible, and we shall be changed.  

<span id="053">53</span> For this corruptible must put on incorruption,
and this mortal must put on [immortality](../ebd/ebd187.htm#009).  

<span id="054">54</span> So when this corruptible shall have put on
incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on
[immortality](../ebd/ebd187.htm#009), then shall be brought to pass the
saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.  

<span id="055">55</span> O death, where is thy sting? O
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008), where is thy victory?  

<span id="056">56</span> The sting of death is
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006); and the strength of
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) is the law.  

<span id="057">57</span> But thanks be to God, which giveth us the
victory through our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="058">58</span> Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast,
unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye
know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
