### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 34

<span id="001">1</span> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith
the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) that do feed themselves! should not the
shepherds feed the flocks?  

<span id="003">3</span> Ye eat the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md), and ye
clothe you with the [wool](../ebd/ebd383.htm#005.md), ye kill them that are
fed: but ye feed not the flock.  

<span id="004">4</span> The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither
have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which
was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away,
neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with
cruelty have ye ruled them.  

<span id="005">5</span> And they were scattered, because there is no
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006.md): and they became meat to all the
beasts of the field, when they were scattered.  

<span id="006">6</span> My [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) wandered
through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was
scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek
after them.  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the
LORD;  

<span id="008">8</span> As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my
flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) of the field, because there was no
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006.md), neither did my shepherds search for
my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock;  

<span id="009">9</span> Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the
LORD;  

<span id="010">10</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against
the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them
to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed
themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that
they may not be meat for them.  

<span id="011">11</span> For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I,
will both search my [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), and seek them out.  

<span id="012">12</span> As a [shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006.md) seeketh
out his flock in the day that he is among his
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) that are scattered; so will I seek out my
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), and will deliver them out of all places
where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.  

<span id="013">13</span> And I will bring them out from the people, and
gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land,
and feed them upon the mountains of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) by
the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country.  

<span id="014">14</span> I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon
the high mountains of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) shall their
[fold](../ebd/ebd136.htm#007.md) be: there shall they lie in a good
[fold](../ebd/ebd136.htm#007), and in a [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md)
pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to
lie down, saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="016">16</span> I will seek that which was lost, and bring
again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was
broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) and the strong; I will feed them with
judgment.  

<span id="017">17</span> And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord
GOD; Behold, I [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) between
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) and [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md),
between the rams and the he goats.  

<span id="018">18</span> Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten
up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue
of your pastures? and to have [drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007.md) of the
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) waters, but ye must foul the residue with
your feet?  

<span id="019">19</span> And as for my flock, they eat that which ye
have trodden with your feet; and they [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md)
that which ye have fouled with your feet.  

<span id="020">20</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them;
Behold, I, even I, will [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) between the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) and between
the lean [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> Because ye have thrust with side and with
shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have
scattered them abroad;  

<span id="022">22</span> Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall
no more be a prey; and I will [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) between
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) and [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And I will set up one
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006.md) over them, and he shall feed them,
even my servant [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md); he shall feed them, and
he shall be their [shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And I the LORD will be their God, and my
servant [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) a [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md)
among them; I the LORD have spoken it.  

<span id="025">25</span> And I will make with them a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of peace, and will cause the evil
beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), and sleep in the woods.  

<span id="026">26</span> And I will make them and the places round about
my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his
season; there shall be showers of blessing.  

<span id="027">27</span> And the tree of the field shall yield her
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md), and the earth shall yield her increase,
and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the LORD,
when I have broken the [bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003.md) of their
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md), and delivered them out of the hand of
those that served themselves of them.  

<span id="028">28</span> And they shall no more be a prey to the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), neither shall the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) of the land devour them; but they shall
dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid.  

<span id="029">29</span> And I will raise up for them a plant of renown,
and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear
the shame of the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) any more.  

<span id="030">30</span> Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God
am with them, and that they, even the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), are my people, saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="031">31</span> And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are
men, and I am your God, saith the Lord GOD.
