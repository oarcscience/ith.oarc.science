### King James Version: Esther Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> Now it came to pass in the days of
[Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md), (this is
[Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md) which reigned, from
[India](../ebd/ebd188.htm#003.md) even unto
[Ethiopia](../ebd/ebd126.htm#005.md), over an hundred and
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) and twenty provinces:.md)  

<span id="002">2</span> That in those days, when the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md) sat on
the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of his kingdom, which was in
[Shushan](../ebd/ebd342.htm#003) the [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md),  

<span id="003">3</span> In the third year of his reign, he made a
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) unto all his princes and his servants;
the power of [Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009.md) and
[Media](../ebd/ebd246.htm#001.md), the nobles and princes of the provinces,
being before him:  

<span id="004">4</span> When he shewed the riches of his glorious
kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an
hundred and fourscore days.  

<span id="005">5</span> And when these days were expired, the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) made a [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) unto
all the people that were present in [Shushan](../ebd/ebd342.htm#003.md) the
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md), both unto great and small,
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days, in the court of the garden of the
king's [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md);  

<span id="006">6</span> Where were white, green, and
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003.md), hangings, fastened with cords of fine
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md) and purple to
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) rings and pillars of
[marble](../ebd/ebd241.htm#006.md): the beds were of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) and [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), upon
a [pavement](../ebd/ebd287.htm#003.md) of red, and
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003.md), and white, and black,
[marble](../ebd/ebd241.htm#006.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And they gave them
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) in vessels of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), (the vessels being diverse one from
another,) and royal [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) in abundance,
according to the state of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And the drinking was according to the law; none
did compel: for so the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) had appointed to
all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every
man's pleasure.  

<span id="009">9</span> Also [Vashti](../ebd/ebd376.htm#009.md) the
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007) made a [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) for
the women in the royal house which belonged to
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> On the seventh day, when the heart of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) was merry with
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), he commanded
[Mehuman](../ebd/ebd246.htm#008.md), Biztha,
[Harbona](../ebd/ebd163.htm#008), [Bigtha](../ebd/ebd058.htm#004.md), and
[Abagtha](../ebd/ebd000.htm#004.md), Zethar, and Carcas, the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) chamberlains that served in the presence
of [Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),  

<span id="011">11</span> To bring [Vashti](../ebd/ebd376.htm#009.md) the
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007) before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
with the [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) royal, to shew the people and
the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.  

<span id="012">12</span> But the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md)
[Vashti](../ebd/ebd376.htm#009.md) refused to come at the king's
commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) very wroth, and his
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) burned in him.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said to
the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) men, which knew the times, (for so was
the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:  

<span id="014">14</span> And the next unto him was Carshena,
[Shethar](../ebd/ebd336.htm#005.md), Admatha,
[Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002.md), Meres, Marsena, and
[Memucan](../ebd/ebd248.htm#000), the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
princes of [Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009.md) and
[Media](../ebd/ebd246.htm#001.md), which saw the king's face, and which sat
the first in the kingdom;)  

<span id="015">15</span> What shall we do unto the
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007) [Vashti](../ebd/ebd376.htm#009.md) according
to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md) by the
chamberlains?  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Memucan](../ebd/ebd248.htm#000.md) answered
before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) and the princes,
[Vashti](../ebd/ebd376.htm#009) the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md) hath
not done wrong to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) only, but also to
all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> For this deed of the
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md) shall come abroad unto all women, so that
they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be
reported, The [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md) commanded
[Vashti](../ebd/ebd376.htm#009) the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md) to be
brought in before him, but she came not.  

<span id="018">18</span> Likewise shall the ladies of
[Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009) and [Media](../ebd/ebd246.htm#001.md) say
this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of
the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md). Thus shall there arise too much
contempt and wrath.  

<span id="019">19</span> If it please the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),
let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among
the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That
[Vashti](../ebd/ebd376.htm#009.md) come no more before
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md); and
let the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) give her royal estate unto another
that is better than she.  

<span id="020">20</span> And when the king's decree which he shall make
shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the
wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the saying pleased the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) and the princes; and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) did according to the word of
[Memucan](../ebd/ebd248.htm#000.md):  

<span id="022">22</span> For he sent letters into all the king's
provinces, into every province according to the
[writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005.md) thereof, and to every people after
their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and
that it should be published according to the language of every people.
