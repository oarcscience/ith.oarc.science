<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 26</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then Agrippa said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;I think myself happy, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, know all the Jews;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#008">sect</A> of our religion I lived a Pharisee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God, unto our fathers:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Which thing I also did in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: and many of the saints did I shut up in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And I punished them oft in every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A>, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Whereupon as I went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</A> with authority and commission from the chief priests,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;At midday, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, I saw in the way a light from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, above the brightness of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</A> tongue, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> whom thou persecutest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A> and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Delivering thee from the people, and from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, unto whom now I send thee,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;To open their eyes, and to turn them from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> to light, and from the power of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A> unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Whereupon, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But shewed first unto them of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</A>, and at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For these causes the Jews caught me in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, and went about to kill me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> did say should come:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;That <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Then Agrippa said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And when he had thus spoken, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> rose up, and the governor, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd053.htm#006">Bernice</A>, and they that sat with them:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</A>.<BR>
