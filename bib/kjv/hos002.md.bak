### King James Version: Hosea Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> Say ye unto your brethren,
[Ammi](../ebd/ebd020.htm#005.md); and to your sisters,
[Ruhamah](../ebd/ebd316.htm#005.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my
wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms
out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;  

<span id="003">3</span> Lest I strip her [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003.md),
and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), and set her like a dry land, and
slay her with thirst.  

<span id="004">4</span> And I will not have
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) upon her children; for they be the
children of whoredoms.  

<span id="005">5</span> For their mother hath played the
[harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005.md): she that conceived them hath done
shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) and my water, my
[wool](../ebd/ebd383.htm#005) and my [flax](../ebd/ebd135.htm#004.md), mine
oil and my [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with
thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.  

<span id="007">7</span> And she shall follow after her lovers, but she
shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find
them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for
then was it better with me than now.  

<span id="008">8</span> For she did not know that I gave her
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006), and [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), and
oil, and multiplied her [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) and
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), which they prepared for
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Therefore will I return, and take away my
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md) in the time thereof, and my
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) in the season thereof, and will recover my
[wool](../ebd/ebd383.htm#005) and my [flax](../ebd/ebd135.htm#004.md) given
to cover her nakedness.  

<span id="010">10</span> And now will I discover her
[lewdness](../ebd/ebd228.htm#002.md) in the sight of her lovers, and none
shall deliver her out of mine hand.  

<span id="011">11</span> I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) days, her new moons, and her sabbaths,
and all her solemn feasts.  

<span id="012">12</span> And I will destroy her vines and her
[fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001.md) trees, whereof she hath said, These are my
rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006.md), and the beasts of the field shall eat
them.  

<span id="013">13</span> And I will visit upon her the days of
[Baalim](../ebd/ebd039.htm#007.md), wherein she burned
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) to them, and she decked herself with
her [earrings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#007.md) and her jewels, and she went after
her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.  

<span id="014">14</span> Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring
her into the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), and speak comfortably
unto her.  

<span id="015">15</span> And I will give her her vineyards from thence,
and the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) of
[Achor](../ebd/ebd007.htm#000.md) for a door of hope: and she shall sing
there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up
out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD,
that thou shalt call me [Ishi](../ebd/ebd190.htm#004.md); and shalt call me
no more [Baali](../ebd/ebd039.htm#006.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> For I will take away the names of
[Baalim](../ebd/ebd039.htm#007.md) out of her mouth, and they shall no more
be remembered by their name.  

<span id="018">18</span> And in that day will I make a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) for them with the beasts of the field
and with the fowls of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and with the
creeping things of the ground: and I will break the
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) and the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) and
the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.  

<span id="019">19</span> And I will [betroth](../ebd/ebd057.htm#005.md)
thee unto me for ever; yea, I will [betroth](../ebd/ebd057.htm#005.md) thee
unto me in [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), and in judgment, and
in lovingkindness, and in mercies.  

<span id="020">20</span> I will even [betroth](../ebd/ebd057.htm#005.md)
thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.  

<span id="021">21</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, I will
hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the
earth;  

<span id="022">22</span> And the earth shall hear the
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006), and the [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md),
and the oil; and they shall hear [Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I
will have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) upon her that had not obtained
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md); and I will say to them which were not my
people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.
