[Ham](../ebd/ebd160.htm#003), and [Japheth](../ebd/ebd197.htm#002.md): and
unto them were sons born after the [flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> The sons of [Japheth](../ebd/ebd197.htm#002.md);

[Kittim](../ebd/ebd221.htm#004), and [Dodanim](../ebd/ebd105.htm#004.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> By these were the isles of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) divided in their lands; every one
after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the sons of [Ham](../ebd/ebd160.htm#003.md);

<span id="008">8</span> And [Cush](../ebd/ebd094.htm#005.md) begat
[Nimrod](../ebd/ebd273.htm#004.md): he began to be a mighty one in the
earth.  

<span id="009">9</span> He was a mighty hunter before the LORD:
wherefore it is said, Even as [Nimrod](../ebd/ebd273.htm#004.md) the mighty
hunter before the LORD.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and
[Erech](../ebd/ebd124.htm#002), and [Accad](../ebd/ebd006.htm#000.md), and
[Calneh](../ebd/ebd069.htm#008.md), in the land of Shinar.  

<span id="011">11</span> Out of that land went forth
[Asshur](../ebd/ebd035.htm#002.md), and builded
[Nineveh](../ebd/ebd273.htm#006.md), and the city
[Rehoboth](../ebd/ebd309.htm#008), and [Calah](../ebd/ebd069.htm#000.md),  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Resen](../ebd/ebd311.htm#005.md) between
[Nineveh](../ebd/ebd273.htm#006) and [Calah](../ebd/ebd069.htm#000.md): the
same is a great city.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Mizraim](../ebd/ebd258.htm#002.md) begat
[Ludim](../ebd/ebd233.htm#000), and [Anamim](../ebd/ebd022.htm#007.md), and
Lehabim, and [Naphtuhim](../ebd/ebd266.htm#009.md),  

<span id="014">14</span> And Pathrusim, and
[Casluhim](../ebd/ebd073.htm#005), (out of whom came Philistim,.md) and
Caphtorim.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md) begat
[Sidon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#000.md) his first born, and
[Heth](../ebd/ebd177.htm#001.md),  

<span id="016">16</span> And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the

<span id="018">18</span> And the Arvadite, and the
[Zemarite](../ebd/ebd390.htm#005.md), and the Hamathite: and afterward were
the families of the [Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007.md) spread abroad.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the border of the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007.md) was from
[Sidon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#000.md), as thou comest to
[Gerar](../ebd/ebd146.htm#005), unto [Gaza](../ebd/ebd144.htm#003.md); as
thou goest, unto [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004.md), and
[Gomorrah](../ebd/ebd152.htm#007), and [Admah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#003.md),
and [Zeboim](../ebd/ebd388.htm#009.md), even unto
[Lasha](../ebd/ebd224.htm#005.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> These are the sons of
[Ham](../ebd/ebd160.htm#003.md), after their families, after their tongues,
in their countries, and in their nations.  

<span id="021">21</span> Unto [Shem](../ebd/ebd334.htm#002.md) also, the
father of all the children of [Eber](../ebd/ebd112.htm#001.md), the brother
of [Japheth](../ebd/ebd197.htm#002) the [elder](../ebd/ebd114.htm#008.md),
even to him were children born.  

<span id="022">22</span> The children of [Shem](../ebd/ebd334.htm#002.md);
[Elam](../ebd/ebd114.htm#003), and [Asshur](../ebd/ebd035.htm#002.md), and
[Arphaxad](../ebd/ebd032.htm#004), and [Lud](../ebd/ebd232.htm#009.md), and
[Aram](../ebd/ebd028.htm#001.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And the children of
[Aram](../ebd/ebd028.htm#001); [Uz](../ebd/ebd375.htm#007.md), and
[Hul](../ebd/ebd184.htm#004.md), and Gether, and
[Mash](../ebd/ebd243.htm#001.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Arphaxad](../ebd/ebd032.htm#004.md) begat
Salah; and Salah begat [Eber](../ebd/ebd112.htm#001.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> And unto [Eber](../ebd/ebd112.htm#001.md) were
born two sons: the name of one was [Peleg](../ebd/ebd288.htm#007.md); for
in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was
[Joktan](../ebd/ebd210.htm#004.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Joktan](../ebd/ebd210.htm#004.md) begat
[Almodad](../ebd/ebd017.htm#009.md), and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and
Jerah,  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Hadoram](../ebd/ebd158.htm#001.md), and
[Uzal](../ebd/ebd375.htm#009.md), and Diklah,  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Obal](../ebd/ebd276.htm#003.md), and
[Abimael](../ebd/ebd003.htm#009), and [Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006.md),  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Ophir](../ebd/ebd279.htm#007.md), and
[Havilah](../ebd/ebd167.htm#009), and [Jobab](../ebd/ebd208.htm#003.md):
all these were the sons of [Joktan](../ebd/ebd210.htm#004.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> And their dwelling was from
[Mesha](../ebd/ebd250.htm#006.md), as thou goest unto
[Sephar](../ebd/ebd327.htm#007) a [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) of the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> These are the sons of
[Shem](../ebd/ebd334.htm#002.md), after their families, after their
tongues, in their lands, after their nations.  

<span id="032">32</span> These are the families of the sons of
[Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002.md), after their generations, in their
nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000.md).
