### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 50

<span id="001">1</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) fell upon
his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) commanded
his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians
embalmed [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="003">3</span> And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so
are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians
mourned for him threescore and ten days.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when the days of his mourning were past,
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) spake unto the house of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), saying, If now I have found
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the
ears of [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), saying,  

<span id="005">5</span> My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in
my [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008) which I have digged for me in the land
of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005), there shalt thou bury me. Now
therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come
again.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) said, Go
up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) went up to
bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), the elders of his house, and all the
elders of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009),  

<span id="008">8</span> And all the house of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), and his brethren, and his father's
house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they
left in the land of [Goshen](../ebd/ebd153.htm#002).  

<span id="009">9</span> And there went up with him both chariots and
horsemen: and it was a very great company.  

<span id="010">10</span> And they came to the threshingfloor of
[Atad](../ebd/ebd035.htm#009), which is beyond
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), and there they mourned with a great and
very sore [lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005): and he made a mourning
for his father [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days.  

<span id="011">11</span> And when the inhabitants of the land, the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007), saw the mourning in the floor of
[Atad](../ebd/ebd035.htm#009), they said, This is a grievous mourning to
the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is
beyond [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004).  

<span id="012">12</span> And his sons did unto him according as he
commanded them:  

<span id="013">13</span> For his sons carried him into the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005), and buried him in the
[cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006) of the field of
[Machpelah](../ebd/ebd235.htm#007), which
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) bought with the field for a possession
of a buryingplace of [Ephron](../ebd/ebd123.htm#008) the Hittite, before
[Mamre](../ebd/ebd239.htm#008).  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) returned
into [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), he, and his brethren, and all that
went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.  

<span id="015">15</span> And when Joseph's brethren saw that their
father was dead, they said, [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) will
peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which
we did unto him.  

<span id="016">16</span> And they sent a
[messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005) unto [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005),
saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,  

<span id="017">17</span> So shall ye say unto
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass
of thy brethren, and their [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006); for they did
unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the
servants of the God of thy father. And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005)
wept when they spake unto him.  

<span id="018">18</span> And his brethren also went and fell down before
his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) said unto
them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?  

<span id="020">20</span> But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but
God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save
much people alive.  

<span id="021">21</span> Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you,
and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto
them.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) dwelt in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), he, and his father's house: and
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) lived an hundred and ten years.  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) saw
Ephraim's children of the third [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008): the
children also of [Machir](../ebd/ebd235.htm#006) the son of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) were brought up upon Joseph's knees.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) said unto
his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of
this land unto the land which he sware to
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), to [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006), and
to [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007).  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) took an
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saying, God will surely visit you, and
ye shall carry up my bones from hence.  

<span id="026">26</span> So [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) died, being
an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a
[coffin](../ebd/ebd086.htm#001) in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).
