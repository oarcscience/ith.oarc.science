### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 38

<span id="001">1</span> O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither
chasten me in thy hot displeasure.  

<span id="002">2</span> For thine [arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005) stick
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.  

<span id="003">3</span> There is no soundness in my
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) because of thine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002); neither is there any rest in my bones
because of my [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="004">4</span> For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as
an heavy [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) they are too heavy for me.  

<span id="005">5</span> My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my
foolishness.  

<span id="006">6</span> I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go
mourning all the day long.  

<span id="007">7</span> For my loins are filled with a loathsome
disease: and there is no soundness in my
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007).  

<span id="008">8</span> I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by
reason of the disquietness of my heart.  

<span id="009">9</span> Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my
groaning is not hid from thee.  

<span id="010">10</span> My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as
for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.  

<span id="011">11</span> My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my
sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.  

<span id="012">12</span> They also that seek after my life lay snares
for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine
deceits all the day long.  

<span id="013">13</span> But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a
[dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002) man that openeth not his mouth.  

<span id="014">14</span> Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in
whose mouth are no reproofs.  

<span id="015">15</span> For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear,
O Lord my God.  

<span id="016">16</span> For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should
rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against
me.  

<span id="017">17</span> For I am ready to
[halt](../ebd/ebd160.htm#002), and my sorrow is continually before me.  

<span id="018">18</span> For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be
sorry for my [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="019">19</span> But mine enemies are lively, and they are
strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.  

<span id="020">20</span> They also that render evil for good are mine
adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.  

<span id="021">21</span> Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far
from me.  

<span id="022">22</span> Make haste to help me, O Lord my
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003).
