### King James Version: 2 Timothy Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), an
[apostle](../ebd/ebd026.htm#008) of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) by the will of God, according to the
promise of life which is in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006),  

<span id="002">2</span> To [Timothy](../ebd/ebd367.htm#002), my dearly
beloved son: [Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000),
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005), and peace, from God the Father and
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) our
Lord.  

<span id="003">3</span> I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers
with pure [conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006), that without ceasing I
have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;  

<span id="004">4</span> Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of
thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;  

<span id="005">5</span> When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith
that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother
[Lois](../ebd/ebd231.htm#004), and thy mother
[Eunice](../ebd/ebd126.htm#009); and I am persuaded that in thee also.  

<span id="006">6</span> Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou
stir up the [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005) of God, which is in thee by
the putting on of my hands.  

<span id="007">7</span> For God hath not given us the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of fear; but of power, and of love, and
of a sound mind.  

<span id="008">8</span> Be not thou therefore ashamed of the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner:
but be thou partaker of the [afflictions](../ebd/ebd011.htm#006) of the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) according to the power of God;  

<span id="009">9</span> Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy
[calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007), not according to our works, but
according to his own purpose and [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000), which
was given us in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) before the world began,  

<span id="010">10</span> But is now made manifest by the appearing of
our [Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), who hath abolished death, and hath
brought life and [immortality](../ebd/ebd187.htm#009) to light through
the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003):  

<span id="011">11</span> Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an
[apostle](../ebd/ebd026.htm#008), and a teacher of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001).  

<span id="012">12</span> For the which cause I also suffer these things:
nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am
persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him
against that day.  

<span id="013">13</span> Hold [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) the form of
sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="014">14</span> That good thing which was committed unto thee
keep by the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005) which dwelleth in us.  

<span id="015">15</span> This thou knowest, that all they which are in
[Asia](../ebd/ebd034.htm#008) be turned away from me; of whom are
[Phygellus](../ebd/ebd294.htm#008) and
[Hermogenes](../ebd/ebd175.htm#005).  

<span id="016">16</span> The Lord give [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005)
unto the house of [Onesiphorus](../ebd/ebd279.htm#000); for he oft
refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my
[chain](../ebd/ebd075.htm#008):  

<span id="017">17</span> But, when he was in
[Rome](../ebd/ebd315.htm#007), he sought me out very diligently, and
found me.  

<span id="018">18</span> The Lord grant unto him that he may find
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) of the Lord in that day: and in how many
things he ministered unto me at [Ephesus](../ebd/ebd122.htm#007), thou
knowest very well.
