### King James Version: Luke Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed
upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of
[Gennesaret](../ebd/ebd146.htm#000),  

<span id="002">2</span> And saw two [ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003)
standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were
[washing](../ebd/ebd379.htm#002) their nets.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he entered into one of the
[ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003), which was Simon's, and prayed him that
he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught
the people out of the ship.  

<span id="004">4</span> Now when he had left speaking, he said unto
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004), Launch out into the
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008), and let down your nets for a draught.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004) answering
said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken
nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002).  

<span id="006">6</span> And when they had this done, they inclosed a
great multitude of fishes: and their [net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002)
brake.  

<span id="007">7</span> And they beckoned unto their partners, which
were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they
came, and filled both the [ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003), so that they
began to sink.  

<span id="008">8</span> When [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004)
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees,
saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.  

<span id="009">9</span> For he was astonished, and all that were with
him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:  

<span id="010">10</span> And so was also [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007),
and John, the sons of [Zebedee](../ebd/ebd388.htm#008), which were
partners with [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004). And
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004),
Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.  

<span id="011">11</span> And when they had brought their
[ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003) to land, they forsook all, and followed
him.  

<span id="012">12</span> And it came to pass, when he was in a certain
city, behold a man full of [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003): who seeing
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) fell on his face, and besought him,
saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005).  

<span id="013">13</span> And he put forth his hand, and touched him,
saying, I will: be thou [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005). And immediately
the [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003) departed from him.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and
shew thyself to the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and offer for thy
cleansing, according as [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) commanded, for a
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) unto them.  

<span id="015">15</span> But so much the more went there a fame abroad
of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by
him of their infirmities.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he withdrew himself into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), and prayed.  

<span id="017">17</span> And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was
teaching, that there were [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) and doctors
of the law [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009) by, which were come out of
every town of [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008), and Judaea, and
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): and the power of the Lord was
present to heal them.  

<span id="018">18</span> And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which
was taken with a [palsy](../ebd/ebd283.htm#004): and they sought means
to bring him in, and to lay him before him.  

<span id="019">19</span> And when they could not find by what way they
might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the
housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his
[couch](../ebd/ebd091.htm#002) into the midst before
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="020">20</span> And when he saw their faith, he said unto him,
Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) and
the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) began to reason, saying, Who is
this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?  

<span id="022">22</span> But when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in
your hearts?  

<span id="023">23</span> Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven
thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?  

<span id="024">24</span> But that ye may know that the Son of man hath
power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the
[palsy](../ebd/ebd283.htm#004),) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy
[couch](../ebd/ebd091.htm#002), and go into thine house.  

<span id="025">25</span> And immediately he rose up before them, and
took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying
God.  

<span id="026">26</span> And they were all amazed, and they glorified
God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to
day.  

<span id="027">27</span> And after these things he went forth, and saw a
[publican](../ebd/ebd301.htm#009), named [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006),
[sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009) at the receipt of
[custom](../ebd/ebd094.htm#008): and he said unto him, Follow me.  

<span id="028">28</span> And he left all, rose up, and followed him.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006) made him a
great [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) in his own house: and there was a
great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.  

<span id="030">30</span> But their [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) and
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) murmured against his disciples,
saying, Why do ye eat and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) with publicans
and sinners?  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answering
said unto them, They that are whole need not a
[physician](../ebd/ebd295.htm#000); but they that are sick.  

<span id="032">32</span> I came not to call the righteous, but sinners
to [repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008).  

<span id="033">33</span> And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of
John [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) often, and make prayers, and likewise
the disciples of the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008); but thine eat
and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009)?  

<span id="034">34</span> And he said unto them, Can ye make the children
of the bridechamber [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004), while the bridegroom
is with them?  

<span id="035">35</span> But the days will come, when the bridegroom
shall be taken away from them, and then shall they
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) in those days.  

<span id="036">36</span> And he spake also a
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003) unto them; No man putteth a piece of a
new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007), and the piece that was taken out of the
new agreeth not with the old.  

<span id="037">37</span> And no man putteth new
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) into old bottles; else the new
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) will burst the bottles, and be spilled,
and the bottles shall perish.  

<span id="038">38</span> But new [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) must be
put into new bottles; and both are preserved.  

<span id="039">39</span> No man also having
[drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007) old [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000)
straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.
