<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 7</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> had made an end of praying, the fire came down from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and consumed the burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> and the sacrifices; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the LORD filled the house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the LORD had filled the LORD's house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And when all the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> saw how the fire came down, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#003">pavement</A>, and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> endureth for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> offered a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>: so the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> and all the people dedicated the house of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the LORD, which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> had made to praise the LORD, because his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> endureth for ever, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded <A HREF="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</A> before them, and all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> stood.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Moreover <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> of the peace offerings, because the brasen <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Also at the same time <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> kept the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> days, and all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> with him, a very great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A>, from the entering in of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#005">Hamath</A> unto the river of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> days, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A> that the LORD had shewed unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A>, and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> his people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Thus <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> finished the house of the LORD, and the king's house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the LORD appeared to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A>, and have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> this place to myself for an house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;If I shut up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> that there be no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A>, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and will forgive their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, and will heal their land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> that is made in this place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For now have I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then will I stablish the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> them;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#002">proverb</A> and a byword among all nations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.<BR>
