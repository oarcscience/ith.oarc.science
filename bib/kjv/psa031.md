### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 31

<span id="001">1</span> In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never
be ashamed: deliver me in thy [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="002">2</span> [Bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) down thine
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my
strong [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001), for an house of defence to save
me.  

<span id="003">3</span> For thou art my [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001)
and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.  

<span id="004">4</span> Pull me out of the [net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002)
that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength.  

<span id="005">5</span> Into thine hand I commit my
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009): thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of
truth.  

<span id="006">6</span> I have hated them that regard lying vanities:
but I trust in the LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> I will be glad and rejoice in thy
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005): for thou hast considered my trouble;
thou hast known my soul in adversities;  

<span id="008">8</span> And hast not shut me up into the hand of the
enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.  

<span id="009">9</span> Have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) upon me, O
LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul
and my [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000).  

<span id="010">10</span> For my life is spent with grief, and my years
with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones
are consumed.  

<span id="011">11</span> I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but
especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they
that did see me without fled from me.  

<span id="012">12</span> I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am
like a broken vessel.  

<span id="013">13</span> For I have heard the slander of many: fear was
on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised
to take away my life.  

<span id="014">14</span> But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art
my God.  

<span id="015">15</span> My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the
hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.  

<span id="016">16</span> Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save
me for thy mercies' sake.  

<span id="017">17</span> Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have
called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in
the [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008).  

<span id="018">18</span> Let the lying lips be put to silence; which
speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the
righteous.  

<span id="019">19</span> Oh how great is thy
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000), which thou hast laid up for them that
fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before
the sons of men!  

<span id="020">20</span> Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy
presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a
[pavilion](../ebd/ebd287.htm#004) from the strife of tongues.  

<span id="021">21</span> Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his
marvellous kindness in a strong city.  

<span id="022">22</span> For I said in my haste, I am cut off from
before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my
supplications when I cried unto thee.  

<span id="023">23</span> O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the
LORD preserveth the [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005), and plentifully
rewardeth the proud doer.  

<span id="024">24</span> Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen
your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.
