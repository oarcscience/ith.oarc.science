### King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> God, who at sundry times and in divers manners
spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,  

<span id="002">2</span> Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his
Son, whom he hath appointed [heir](../ebd/ebd171.htm#007) of all things,
by whom also he made the worlds;  

<span id="003">3</span> Who being the brightness of his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006), and the express image of his person, and
upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself
purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:  

<span id="004">4</span> Being made so much better than the angels, as he
hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.  

<span id="005">5</span> For unto which of the angels said he at any
time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will
be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?  

<span id="006">6</span> And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten
into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) him.  

<span id="007">7</span> And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his
angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.  

<span id="008">8</span> But unto the Son he saith, Thy
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001), O God, is for ever and ever: a
[sceptre](../ebd/ebd323.htm#006) of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) is the
[sceptre](../ebd/ebd323.htm#006) of thy kingdom.  

<span id="009">9</span> Thou hast loved
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), and hated iniquity; therefore
God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
fellows.  

<span id="010">10</span> And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the
foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:  

<span id="011">11</span> They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they
all shall [wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000) old as doth a garment;  

<span id="012">12</span> And as a vesture shalt thou
[fold](../ebd/ebd136.htm#007) them up, and they shall be changed: but
thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.  

<span id="013">13</span> But to which of the angels said he at any time,
Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy
[footstool](../ebd/ebd136.htm#009)?  

<span id="014">14</span> Are they not all ministering spirits, sent
forth to [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) for them who shall be heirs
of [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003)?
