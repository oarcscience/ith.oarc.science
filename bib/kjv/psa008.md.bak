### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in
all the earth! who hast set thy [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) above the
heavens.  

<span id="002">2</span> Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast
thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest
still the enemy and the avenger.  

<span id="003">3</span> When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy
fingers, the [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004.md) and the
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md), which thou hast ordained;  

<span id="004">4</span> What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and
the son of man, that thou visitest him?  

<span id="005">5</span> For thou hast made him a little lower than the
angels, and hast crowned him with [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) and
honour.  

<span id="006">6</span> Thou madest him to have dominion over the works
of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:  

<span id="007">7</span> All [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) and oxen,
yea, and the beasts of the field;  

<span id="008">8</span> The fowl of the air, and the
[fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005.md) of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through
the paths of the seas.  

<span id="009">9</span> O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in
all the earth!
