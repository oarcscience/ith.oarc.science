### King James Version: John Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> I am the true [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md), and
my Father is the [husbandman](../ebd/ebd185.htm#002.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Every [branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002.md) in me that
beareth not [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) he taketh away: and every
[branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002.md) that beareth
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md), he purgeth it, that it may bring forth
more [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> Now ye are [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md)
through the word which I have spoken unto you.  

<span id="004">4</span> Abide in me, and I in you. As the
[branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002.md) cannot bear
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of itself, except it abide in the
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md); no more can ye, except ye abide in me.  

<span id="005">5</span> I am the [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md), ye are
the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth
forth much [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md): for without me ye can do
nothing.  

<span id="006">6</span> If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a
[branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002.md), and is withered; and men gather them,
and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.  

<span id="007">7</span> If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye
shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.  

<span id="008">8</span> Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md); so shall ye be my disciples.  

<span id="009">9</span> As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved
you: continue ye in my love.  

<span id="010">10</span> If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in
my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his
love.  

<span id="011">11</span> These things have I spoken unto you, that my
joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.  

<span id="012">12</span> This is my commandment, That ye love one
another, as I have loved you.  

<span id="013">13</span> Greater love hath no man than this, that a man
lay down his life for his friends.  

<span id="014">14</span> Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I
command you.  

<span id="015">15</span> Henceforth I call you not servants; for the
servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends;
for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto
you.  

<span id="016">16</span> Ye have not [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) me,
but I have [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) you, and ordained you, that
ye should go and bring forth [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md), and that
your [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) should remain: that whatsoever ye
shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.  

<span id="017">17</span> These things I command you, that ye love one
another.  

<span id="018">18</span> If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me
before it hated you.  

<span id="019">19</span> If ye were of the world, the world would love
his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) you out of the world, therefore the
world hateth you.  

<span id="020">20</span> Remember the word that I said unto you, The
servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they
will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep
yours also.  

<span id="021">21</span> But all these things will they do unto you for
my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.  

<span id="022">22</span> If I had not come and spoken unto them, they
had not had [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md): but now they have no
[cloak](../ebd/ebd084.htm#009) for their [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> He that hateth me hateth my Father also.  

<span id="024">24</span> If I had not done among them the works which
none other man did, they had not had [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md): but
now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.  

<span id="025">25</span> But this cometh to pass, that the word might be
fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.  

<span id="026">26</span> But when the [Comforter](../ebd/ebd087.htm#001.md)
is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of truth, which proceedeth from the
Father, he shall testify of me:  

<span id="027">27</span> And ye also shall bear
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md), because ye have been with me from the
beginning.
