### King James Version: Job Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Call now, if there be any that will answer thee;
and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?  

<span id="002">2</span> For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy
slayeth the silly one.  

<span id="003">3</span> I have seen the foolish taking root: but
suddenly I cursed his [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007).  

<span id="004">4</span> His children are far from safety, and they are
crushed in the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), neither is there any to
deliver them.  

<span id="005">5</span> Whose [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008) the
hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber
swalloweth up their substance.  

<span id="006">6</span> Although affliction cometh not forth of the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008), neither doth trouble spring out of the
ground;  

<span id="007">7</span> Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks
[fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004) upward.  

<span id="008">8</span> I would seek unto God, and unto God would I
commit my cause:  

<span id="009">9</span> Which doeth great things and unsearchable;
marvellous things without number:  

<span id="010">10</span> Who giveth [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) upon
the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:  

<span id="011">11</span> To set up on high those that be low; that those
which [mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004) may be exalted to safety.  

<span id="012">12</span> He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so
that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.  

<span id="013">13</span> He taketh the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) in
their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried
headlong.  

<span id="014">14</span> They meet with
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) in the day time, and grope in the
noonday as in the night.  

<span id="015">15</span> But he saveth the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006)
from the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), from their mouth, and from the
hand of the mighty.  

<span id="016">16</span> So the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) hath hope,
and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.  

<span id="017">17</span> Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth:
therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:  

<span id="018">18</span> For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he
woundeth, and his hands make whole.  

<span id="019">19</span> He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) there shall no evil touch thee.  

<span id="020">20</span> In [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) he shall
redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="021">21</span> Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the
tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) when it cometh.  

<span id="022">22</span> At [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) and
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be
afraid of the beasts of the earth.  

<span id="023">23</span> For thou shalt be in
[league](../ebd/ebd225.htm#005) with the stones of the field: and the
beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.  

<span id="024">24</span> And thou shalt know that thy
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) shall be in peace; and thou shalt
visit thy [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007), and shalt not
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="025">25</span> Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be
great, and thine offspring as the [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005) of the
earth.  

<span id="026">26</span> Thou shalt come to thy
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008) in a full age, like as a shock of
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) cometh in in his season.  

<span id="027">27</span> Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear
it, and know thou it for thy good.
