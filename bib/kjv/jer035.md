### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 35

<span id="001">1</span> The word which came unto
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) from the LORD in the days of
[Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001.md) the son of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Go unto the house of the
[Rechabites](../ebd/ebd308.htm#003.md), and speak unto them, and bring them
into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> Then I took Jaazaniah the son of
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md), the son of Habaziniah, and his
brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the
[Rechabites](../ebd/ebd308.htm#003.md);  

<span id="004">4</span> And I brought them into the house of the LORD,
into the [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md) of the sons of
[Hanan](../ebd/ebd162.htm#001.md), the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which
was by the [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md) of the princes, which was
above the [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md) of
[Maaseiah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#007.md) the son of
[Shallum](../ebd/ebd330.htm#008.md), the keeper of the door:  

<span id="005">5</span> And I set before the sons of the house of the
[Rechabites](../ebd/ebd308.htm#003.md) pots full of
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), and cups, and I said unto them,
[Drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) ye [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> But they said, We will
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) no [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md): for
[Jonadab](../ebd/ebd210.htm#006.md) the son of
[Rechab](../ebd/ebd308.htm#002.md) our father commanded us, saying, Ye
shall [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) no [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md),
neither ye, nor your sons for ever:  

<span id="007">7</span> Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor
plant vineyard, nor have any: but all your days ye shall dwell in tents;
that ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangers.  

<span id="008">8</span> Thus have we obeyed the voice of
[Jonadab](../ebd/ebd210.htm#006.md) the son of
[Rechab](../ebd/ebd308.htm#002.md) our father in all that he hath charged
us, to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) no [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md)
all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;  

<span id="009">9</span> Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither
have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:  

<span id="010">10</span> But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed,
and done according to all that [Jonadab](../ebd/ebd210.htm#006.md) our
father commanded us.  

<span id="011">11</span> But it came to pass, when
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md) came up into the land, that we said,
Come, and let us go to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) for fear of
the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so
we dwell at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> Then came the word of the LORD unto
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md), saying,  

<span id="013">13</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); Go and tell the men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), Will ye not receive instruction to
hearken to my words? saith the LORD.  

<span id="014">14</span> The words of [Jonadab](../ebd/ebd210.htm#006.md)
the son of [Rechab](../ebd/ebd308.htm#002.md), that he commanded his sons
not to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), are
performed; for unto this day they [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) none,
but obey their father's commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto
you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me.  

<span id="015">15</span> I have sent also unto you all my servants the
prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every
man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other
gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to
you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md), nor hearkened unto me.  

<span id="016">16</span> Because the sons of
[Jonadab](../ebd/ebd210.htm#006.md) the son of
[Rechab](../ebd/ebd308.htm#002.md) have performed the commandment of their
father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto
me:  

<span id="017">17</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the
God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); Behold, I will bring upon
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and upon all the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) all the evil that I have pronounced
against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard;
and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) said unto
the house of the [Rechabites](../ebd/ebd308.htm#003.md), Thus saith the
LORD of hosts, the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); Because ye
have obeyed the commandment of [Jonadab](../ebd/ebd210.htm#006.md) your
father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he
hath commanded you:  

<span id="019">19</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); [Jonadab](../ebd/ebd210.htm#006.md) the
son of [Rechab](../ebd/ebd308.htm#002.md) shall not want a man to stand
before me for ever.
