<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Mark Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And again he entered into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#007">Capernaum</A> after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</A>, which was borne of four.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</A> lay.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</A>, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But there was certain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> there, and reasoning in their hearts,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And immediately when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> perceived in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</A>, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</A>,)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And as he passed by, he saw <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#005">Alphaeus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> at the receipt of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</A>, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that, as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#000">physician</A>, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And the disciples of John and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> used to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A>: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A>, but thy disciples <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> not?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A>, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> in those days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> is made worse.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And no man putteth new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> into old bottles: else the new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> doth burst the bottles, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> must be put into new bottles.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that he went through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> fields on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> said unto him, Behold, why do they on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day that which is not lawful?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Have ye never read what <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;How he went into the house of God in the days of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</A> the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, and did eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd336.htm#008">shewbread</A>, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> was made for man, and not man for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A>.<BR>
