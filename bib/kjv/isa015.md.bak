### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> The [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md) of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md). Because in the night Ar of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) is laid waste, and brought to silence;
because in the night [Kir](../ebd/ebd219.htm#007.md) of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) is laid waste, and brought to silence;  

<span id="002">2</span> He is gone up to
[Bajith](../ebd/ebd042.htm#000), and to [Dibon](../ebd/ebd103.htm#005.md),
the high places, to weep: [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) shall howl over
[Nebo](../ebd/ebd268.htm#004), and over [Medeba](../ebd/ebd246.htm#000.md):
on all their heads shall be [baldness](../ebd/ebd042.htm#008.md), and every
[beard](../ebd/ebd049.htm#000.md) cut off.  

<span id="003">3</span> In their streets they shall gird themselves with
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001.md): on the tops of their houses, and in
their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009.md) shall cry,
and [Elealeh](../ebd/ebd114.htm#009.md): their voice shall be heard even
unto [Jahaz](../ebd/ebd195.htm#005.md): therefore the armed soldiers of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) shall cry out; his life shall be grievous
unto him.  

<span id="005">5</span> My heart shall cry out for
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md); his fugitives shall flee unto
[Zoar](../ebd/ebd395.htm#004), an [heifer](../ebd/ebd171.htm#006.md) of
three years old: for by the mounting up of
[Luhith](../ebd/ebd233.htm#001.md) with weeping shall they go it up; for in
the way of [Horonaim](../ebd/ebd182.htm#005.md) they shall raise up a cry
of [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for
the [hay](../ebd/ebd168.htm#002.md) is withered away, the
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md) faileth, there is no green thing.  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and
that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the
[brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006.md) of the
[willows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#006.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> For the cry is gone round about the borders of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md); the howling thereof unto
[Eglaim](../ebd/ebd113.htm#007.md), and the howling thereof unto
Beerelim.  

<span id="009">9</span> For the waters of Dimon shall be full of
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md): for I will bring more upon Dimon,
[lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001.md) upon him that escapeth of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), and upon the remnant of the land.
