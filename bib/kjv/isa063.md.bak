### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 63

<span id="001">1</span> Who is this that cometh from
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md), with dyed garments from
[Bozrah](../ebd/ebd063.htm#009.md)? this that is glorious in his
[apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000.md), travelling in the greatness of his
strength? I that speak in [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), mighty
to save.  

<span id="002">2</span> Wherefore art thou red in thine
[apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000.md), and thy garments like him that
treadeth in the [winefat](../ebd/ebd382.htm#001.md)?  

<span id="003">3</span> I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the
people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md), and trample them in my
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002); and their [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md)
shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.  

<span id="004">4</span> For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and
the year of my redeemed is come.  

<span id="005">5</span> And I looked, and there was none to help; and I
wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) unto me; and my
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md), it upheld me.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I will tread down the people in mine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md), and make them
[drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007) in my [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md), and
I will bring down their strength to the earth.  

<span id="007">7</span> I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD,
and the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath
bestowed on us, and the great [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md) toward
the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), which he hath bestowed on
them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his
lovingkindnesses.  

<span id="008">8</span> For he said, Surely they are my people, children
that will not lie: so he was their [Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> In all their affliction he was afflicted, and
the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of his presence saved them: in his
love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried
them all the days of old.  

<span id="010">10</span> But they rebelled, and vexed his holy
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md): therefore he was turned to be their
enemy, and he fought against them.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then he remembered the days of old,
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), and his people, saying, Where is he that
brought them up out of the sea with the
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006.md) of his flock? where is he that put his
holy [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) within him?  

<span id="012">12</span> That led them by the right hand of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) with his glorious arm, dividing the water
before them, to make himself an [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md)
name?  

<span id="013">13</span> That led them through the
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md), as an horse in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), that they should not stumble?  

<span id="014">14</span> As a [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) goeth down
into the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md), the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the LORD caused him to rest: so didst
thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.  

<span id="015">15</span> Look down from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md),
and behold from the [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md) of thy
[holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md) and of thy
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md): where is thy
[zeal](../ebd/ebd388.htm#003.md) and thy strength, the sounding of thy
[bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004.md) and of thy mercies toward me? are they
restrained?  

<span id="016">16</span> Doubtless thou art our father, though
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) be ignorant of us, and
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art
our father, our [redeemer](../ebd/ebd308.htm#008.md); thy name is from
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy
ways, and hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants'
sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.  

<span id="018">18</span> The people of thy
[holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md) have possessed it but a little while:
our adversaries have trodden down thy
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> We are thine: thou never barest rule over them;
they were not called by thy name.
