### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 23

<span id="001">1</span> Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not
thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008).  

<span id="002">2</span> Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil;
neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest
judgment:  

<span id="003">3</span> Neither shalt thou countenance a
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) man in his cause.  

<span id="004">4</span> If thou meet thine enemy's
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) or his [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001) going
astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.  

<span id="005">5</span> If thou see the [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001) of
him that hateth thee lying under his [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007),
and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.  

<span id="006">6</span> Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) in his cause.  

<span id="007">7</span> Keep thee far from a false matter; and the
innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the
wicked.  

<span id="008">8</span> And thou shalt take no
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005): for the [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005)
blindeth the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), and perverteth the words of
the righteous.  

<span id="009">9</span> Also thou shalt not oppress a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009): for ye know the heart of a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), seeing ye were strangers in the land
of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="010">10</span> And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and
shalt gather in the fruits thereof:  

<span id="011">11</span> But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and
lie still; that the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) of thy people may eat:
and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner
thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.  

<span id="012">12</span> Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the
seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) and
thine [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001) may rest, and the son of thy
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008), and the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), may be refreshed.  

<span id="013">13</span> And in all things that I have said unto you be
circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let
it be heard out of thy mouth.  

<span id="014">14</span> Three times thou shalt keep a
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) unto me in the year.  

<span id="015">15</span> Thou shalt keep the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006): (thou shalt eat unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days, as I
commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month
[Abib](../ebd/ebd002.htm#006); for in it thou camest out from
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009): and none shall appear before me
empty:)  

<span id="016">16</span> And the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008), the firstfruits of thy labours, which
thou hast sown in the field: and the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of
ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in
thy labours out of the field.  

<span id="017">17</span> Three items in the year all thy males shall
appear before the LORD God.  

<span id="018">18</span> Thou shalt not offer the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of my [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002)
with leavened [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006); neither shall the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) of my [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002)
remain until the morning.  

<span id="019">19</span> The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou
shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not
[seethe](../ebd/ebd326.htm#001) a kid in his mother's
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000).  

<span id="020">20</span> Behold, I send an
[Angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) before thee, to keep thee in the way, and
to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.  

<span id="021">21</span> Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him
not; for he will not [pardon](../ebd/ebd285.htm#001) your
transgressions: for my name is in him.  

<span id="022">22</span> But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do
all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an
[adversary](../ebd/ebd011.htm#001) unto thine adversaries.  

<span id="023">23</span> For mine [Angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) shall
go before thee, and bring thee in unto the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006), and the
[Hittites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#006), and the
[Perizzites](../ebd/ebd290.htm#006), and the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007), the
[Hivites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#007), and the
[Jebusites](../ebd/ebd199.htm#004): and I will cut them off.  

<span id="024">24</span> Thou shalt not [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003)
down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou
shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.  

<span id="025">25</span> And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he
shall [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) thy [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006),
and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.  

<span id="026">26</span> There shall nothing cast their young, nor be
[barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007), in thy land: the number of thy days I
will fulfil.  

<span id="027">27</span> I will send my fear before thee, and will
destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all
thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.  

<span id="028">28</span> And I will send hornets before thee, which
shall drive out the Hivite, the [Canaanite](../ebd/ebd070.htm#008), and
the Hittite, from before thee.  

<span id="029">29</span> I will not drive them out from before thee in
one year; lest the land become desolate, and the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) of the field multiply against thee.  

<span id="030">30</span> By little and little I will drive them out from
before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.  

<span id="031">31</span> And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even
unto the sea of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), and from the
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000) unto the river: for I will deliver the
inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out
before thee.  

<span id="032">32</span> Thou shalt make no
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with them, nor with their gods.  

<span id="033">33</span> They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they
make thee [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) against me: for if thou serve
their gods, it will surely be a [snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009) unto
thee.
