### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 56

<span id="001">1</span> Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do
[justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007.md): for my
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) is near to come, and my
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) to be revealed.  

<span id="002">2</span> Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son
of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) from polluting it, and keepeth his hand
from doing any evil.  

<span id="003">3</span> Neither let the son of the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md), that hath joined himself to the LORD,
speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people:
neither let the [eunuch](../ebd/ebd126.htm#008.md) say, Behold, I am a dry
tree.  

<span id="004">4</span> For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that
keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of
my [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md);  

<span id="005">5</span> Even unto them will I give in mine house and
within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters:
I will give them an [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) name, that
shall not be cut off.  

<span id="006">6</span> Also the sons of the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md), that join themselves to the LORD, to
serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every
one that keepeth the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) from polluting it,
and taketh hold of my [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md);  

<span id="007">7</span> Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and
make them joyful in my house of [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md): their
burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md); for mine house shall be called an house
of [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) for all people.  

<span id="008">8</span> The Lord GOD, which gathereth the outcasts of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) saith, Yet will I gather others to him,
beside those that are gathered unto him.  

<span id="009">9</span> All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea,
all ye beasts in the [forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> His watchmen are
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md): they are all ignorant, they are all
[dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002.md) dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying
down, loving to slumber.  

<span id="011">11</span> Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have
enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to
their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.  

<span id="012">12</span> Come ye, say they, I will fetch
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), and we will fill ourselves with strong
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md); and to morrow shall be as this day, and
much more abundant.
