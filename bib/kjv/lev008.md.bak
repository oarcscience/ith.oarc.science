### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Take [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and his sons
with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) for the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and two rams, and a
[basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009.md) of unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md);  

<span id="003">3</span> And gather thou all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) together unto the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) did as the
LORD commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door
of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said unto the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), This is the thing which the LORD
commanded to be done.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) brought
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and his sons, and washed them with
water.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he put upon him the
[coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004.md), and girded him with the
[girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md), and clothed him with the robe, and put
the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md) upon him, and he girded him with the
curious [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md) of the
[ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md), and bound it unto him therewith.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he put the
[breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007.md) upon him: also he put in the
[breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007) the [Urim](../ebd/ebd375.htm#005.md)
and the [Thummim](../ebd/ebd365.htm#002.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And he put the [mitre](../ebd/ebd257.htm#006.md)
upon his head; also upon the [mitre](../ebd/ebd257.htm#006.md), even upon
his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md); as the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) took the
anointing oil, and anointed the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) and
all that was therein, and sanctified them.  

<span id="011">11</span> And he sprinkled thereof upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times, and
anointed the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) and all his vessels, both
the [laver](../ebd/ebd224.htm#009.md) and his foot, to sanctify them.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's
head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) brought
Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and
put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And he brought the
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) for the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001): and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md)
and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) for the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And he slew it; and
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) took the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md),
and put it upon the horns of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) round
about with his finger, and purified the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md),
and poured the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) at the bottom of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), and sanctified it, to make
[reconciliation](../ebd/ebd308.htm#004.md) upon it.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he took all the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) that was upon the inwards, and the
[caul](../ebd/ebd074.htm#003) above the [liver](../ebd/ebd230.htm#004.md),
and the two kidneys, and their [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md), and
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) burned it upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> But the [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md), and
his hide, his [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), and his
[dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003.md), he burnt with fire without the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md); as the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And he brought the [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md)
for the burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md): and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and his sons laid their hands upon the
head of the [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And he killed it; and
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) sprinkled the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md)
round about.  

<span id="020">20</span> And he cut the [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md)
into [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002); and [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md)
burnt the head, and the [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md), and the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And he washed the inwards and the legs in
water; and [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) burnt the whole
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003) upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md): it
was a burnt [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) for a sweet savour, and
an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) made by fire unto the LORD; as the
LORD commanded [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And he brought the other
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003), the [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md) of
[consecration](../ebd/ebd088.htm#007.md): and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and his sons laid their hands upon the
head of the [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And he slew it; and
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) took of the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of it, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's
right [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md), and upon the thumb of his right
hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.  

<span id="024">24</span> And he brought Aaron's sons, and
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) put of the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md)
upon the tip of their right [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md), and upon the
thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right
feet: and [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) sprinkled the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md)
round about.  

<span id="025">25</span> And he took the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md),
and the rump, and all the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) that was upon the
inwards, and the [caul](../ebd/ebd074.htm#003.md) above the
[liver](../ebd/ebd230.htm#004.md), and the two kidneys, and their
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md), and the right shoulder:  

<span id="026">26</span> And out of the [basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009.md)
of unleavened [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), that was before the LORD,
he took one unleavened [cake](../ebd/ebd068.htm#009.md), and a
[cake](../ebd/ebd068.htm#009) of oiled [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md),
and one wafer, and put them on the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md), and
upon the right shoulder:  

<span id="027">27</span> And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his
sons' hands, and waved them for a wave [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md)
before the LORD.  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) took them
from off their hands, and burnt them on the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) upon the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md): they were consecrations for a sweet
savour: it is an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) made by fire unto the
LORD.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) took the
breast, and waved it for a wave [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) before
the LORD: for of the [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md) of
[consecration](../ebd/ebd088.htm#007.md) it was Moses' part; as the LORD
commanded [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) took of the
anointing oil, and of the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) which was upon
the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), and sprinkled it upon
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and upon his garments, and upon his
sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and his garments, and his sons, and his
sons' garments with him.  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said unto
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and to his sons,
[Boil](../ebd/ebd061.htm#008) the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) at the
door of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md): and there eat it with the
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) that is in the
[basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009.md) of consecrations, as I commanded,
saying, [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and his sons shall eat it.  

<span id="032">32</span> And that which remaineth of the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) and of the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md)
shall ye burn with fire.  

<span id="033">33</span> And ye shall not go out of the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) in [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
days, until the days of your [consecration](../ebd/ebd088.htm#007.md) be at
an end: for [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days shall he consecrate
you.  

<span id="034">34</span> As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath
commanded to do, to make an [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for
you.  

<span id="035">35</span> Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) day and night
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days, and keep the charge of the LORD,
that ye die not: for so I am commanded.  

<span id="036">36</span> So [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and his sons
did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).
