### King James Version: Job Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> And Job answered and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall
die with you.  

<span id="003">3</span> But I have understanding as well as you; I am
not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?  

<span id="004">4</span> I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth
upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to
scorn.  

<span id="005">5</span> He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a
[lamp](../ebd/ebd223.htm#007.md) despised in the thought of him that is at
ease.  

<span id="006">6</span> The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they
that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.  

<span id="007">7</span> But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach
thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:  

<span id="008">8</span> Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee:
and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.  

<span id="009">9</span> Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of
the LORD hath wrought this?  

<span id="010">10</span> In whose hand is the soul of every living
thing, and the breath of all mankind.  

<span id="011">11</span> Doth not the [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) try
words? and the mouth taste his meat?  

<span id="012">12</span> With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of
days understanding.  

<span id="013">13</span> With him is wisdom and strength, he hath
counsel and understanding.  

<span id="014">14</span> Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be
built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.  

<span id="015">15</span> Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry
up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.  

<span id="016">16</span> With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived
and the deceiver are his.  

<span id="017">17</span> He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh
the judges fools.  

<span id="018">18</span> He looseth the [bond](../ebd/ebd062.htm#001.md) of
kings, and girdeth their loins with a [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> He leadeth princes away spoiled, and
overthroweth the mighty.  

<span id="020">20</span> He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and
taketh away the understanding of the aged.  

<span id="021">21</span> He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth
the strength of the mighty.  

<span id="022">22</span> He discovereth [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md)
things out of [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), and bringeth out to
light the [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) of death.  

<span id="023">23</span> He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them:
he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.  

<span id="024">24</span> He taketh away the heart of the chief of the
people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) where there is no way.  

<span id="025">25</span> They grope in the dark without light, and he
maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
