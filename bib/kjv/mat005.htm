</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Blessed are the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>: for theirs is the kingdom of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Blessed are they that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</A>: for they shall be comforted.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>: for they shall be filled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Ye are the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd319.htm#008">salt</A> of the earth: but if the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd319.htm#008">salt</A> have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Neither do men light a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#000">candle</A>, and put it under a bushel, but on a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#001">candlestick</A>; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</A> your Father which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For verily I say unto you, Till <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> and earth pass, one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#009">jot</A> or one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd368.htm#006">tittle</A> shall in no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For I say unto you, That except your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> shall exceed the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A>, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#001">Raca</A>, shall be in danger of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</A>: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</A> fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Therefore if thou bring thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Leave there thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Agree with thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</A> quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</A> deliver thee to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#003">farthing</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</A> after her hath committed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A> with her already in his heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A> of divorcement:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A>, causeth her to commit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A>: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>; for it is God's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Nor by the earth; for it is his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#009">footstool</A>: neither by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>; for it is the city of the great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right <A HREF="../ebd/ebd078.htm#004">cheek</A>, turn to him the other also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</A>, let him have thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#009">cloak</A> also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#007">borrow</A> of thee turn not thou away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;But I say unto you, Love your enemies, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> them that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;That ye may be the children of your Father which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>: for he maketh his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> on the just and on the unjust.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> is perfect.<BR>
