<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 18</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A>; and I will send <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> upon the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> went to shew himself unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A>. And there was a sore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#001">Obadiah</A>, which was the governor of his house. (Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#001">Obadiah</A> feared the LORD greatly:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For it was so, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</A> cut off the prophets of the LORD, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#001">Obadiah</A> took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</A>, and fed them with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> and water.)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#001">Obadiah</A>, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A> to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> went one way by himself, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#001">Obadiah</A> went another way by himself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#001">Obadiah</A> was in the way, behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> is here.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A>, to slay me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A> of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> is here.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A>, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Was it not told my lord what I did when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</A> slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifty in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</A>, and fed them with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> and water?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> is here: and he shall slay me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#001">Obadiah</A> went to meet <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A>, and told him: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> went to meet <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> saw <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A>, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And he answered, I have not troubled <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd039.htm#007">Baalim</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Now therefore send, and gather to me all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#006">Carmel</A>, and the prophets of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</A> four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> sent unto all the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and gathered the prophets together unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#006">Carmel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> came unto all the people, and said, How long <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#002">halt</A> ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</A>, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> unto the people, I, even I only, remain a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</A> for themselves, and cut it in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>, and lay it on <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>, and put no fire under: and I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#008">dress</A> the other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</A>, and lay it on <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>, and put no fire under:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> said unto the prophets of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</A>, Choose you one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</A> for yourselves, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#008">dress</A> it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And they took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</A> which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</A> from morning even until noon, saying, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</A>, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> which was made.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass at noon, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A>, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> gushed out upon them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> of the evening <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> of the LORD that was broken down.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> shall be thy name:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And with the stones he built an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>, as great as would contain two measures of seed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And he put the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A> in order, and cut the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>, and laid him on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>, and on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And the water ran round about the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>; and he filled the trench also with water.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass at the time of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> of the evening <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> came near, and said, LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, let it be known this day that thou art God in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>, and the stones, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A>, and licked up the water that was in the trench.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> said unto them, Take the prophets of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</A>; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> brought them down to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd220.htm#009">Kishon</A>, and slew them there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A>, Get thee up, eat and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>; for there is a sound of abundance of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> went up to eat and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> went up to the top of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#006">Carmel</A>; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> times.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A> out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A>, Prepare thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A>, and get thee down that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> stop thee not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the mean while, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> rode, and went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;And the hand of the LORD was on <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A>; and he girded up his loins, and ran before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> to the entrance of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</A>.<BR>
