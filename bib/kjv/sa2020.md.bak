### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> And there happened to be there a man of
[Belial](../ebd/ebd051.htm#007.md), whose name was
[Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006.md), the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he
blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), neither have we inheritance in the son
of [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005.md): every man to his tents, O
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> So every man of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
went up from after [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and followed
[Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006.md) the son of Bichri: but the men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) clave unto their
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), from [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) even
to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) came to his
house at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md); and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) took the ten women his concubines, whom he
had left to keep the house, and put them in
[ward](../ebd/ebd379.htm#001.md), and fed them, but went not in unto them.
So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then said the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) to
[Amasa](../ebd/ebd019.htm#003.md), Assemble me the men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) within three days, and be thou here
present.  

<span id="005">5</span> So [Amasa](../ebd/ebd019.htm#003.md) went to
assemble the men of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md): but he tarried
longer than the set time which he had appointed him.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said to
[Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005.md), Now shall
[Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006.md) the son of Bichri do us more harm than
did [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md): take thou thy lord's servants, and
pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.  

<span id="007">7</span> And there went out after him Joab's men, and the
Cherethites, and the [Pelethites](../ebd/ebd289.htm#000.md), and all the
mighty men: and they went out of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), to
pursue after [Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006.md) the son of Bichri.  

<span id="008">8</span> When they were at the great
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) which is in
[Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002), [Amasa](../ebd/ebd019.htm#003.md) went
before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him,
and upon it a [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md) with a
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) fastened upon his loins in the sheath
thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) said to
[Amasa](../ebd/ebd019.htm#003.md), Art thou in health, my brother? And
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) took [Amasa](../ebd/ebd019.htm#003.md) by the
[beard](../ebd/ebd049.htm#000.md) with the right hand to
[kiss](../ebd/ebd221.htm#000.md) him.  

<span id="010">10</span> But [Amasa](../ebd/ebd019.htm#003.md) took no heed
to the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) that was in Joab's hand: so he
smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his
[bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004.md) to the ground, and struck him not again;
and he died. So [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) and
[Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005.md) his brother pursued after
[Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006.md) the son of Bichri.  

<span id="011">11</span> And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said,
He that favoureth [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md), and he that is for
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), let him go after
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Amasa](../ebd/ebd019.htm#003.md) wallowed in
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) in the midst of the
[highway](../ebd/ebd178.htm#005.md). And when the man saw that all the
people stood still, he removed [Amasa](../ebd/ebd019.htm#003.md) out of the
[highway](../ebd/ebd178.htm#005.md) into the field, and cast a cloth upon
him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.  

<span id="013">13</span> When he was removed out of the
[highway](../ebd/ebd178.htm#005.md), all the people went on after
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md), to pursue after
[Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006.md) the son of Bichri.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he went through all the tribes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) unto [Abel](../ebd/ebd001.htm#004.md), and
to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together,
and went also after him.  

<span id="015">15</span> And they came and besieged him in
[Abel](../ebd/ebd001.htm#004.md) of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank
against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that
were with [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) battered the wall, to throw it
down.  

<span id="016">16</span> Then cried a [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md)
woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md), Come near hither, that I may speak with
thee.  

<span id="017">17</span> And when he was come near unto her, the woman
said, Art thou [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md)? And he answered, I am he.
Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md). And he answered, I do hear.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak
in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at
[Abel](../ebd/ebd001.htm#004.md): and so they ended the matter.  

<span id="019">19</span> I am one of them that are peaceable and
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):
thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): why wilt thou
[swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009.md) up the inheritance of the LORD?  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) answered and
said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should
[swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009.md) up or destroy.  

<span id="021">21</span> The matter is not so: but a man of
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md),
[Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006.md) the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up
his hand against the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), even against
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md): deliver him only, and I will depart from
the city. And the woman said unto [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md), Behold,
his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then the woman went unto all the people in her
wisdom. And they cut off the head of [Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006.md) the
son of Bichri, and cast it out to [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md). And he
blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009). And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md)
returned to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> Now [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) was over all
the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):
and [Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003.md) the son of
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md) was over the Cherethites and over the
[Pelethites](../ebd/ebd289.htm#000.md):  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Adoram](../ebd/ebd010.htm#001.md) was over
the [tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006.md): and
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md) the son of Ahilud was
[recorder](../ebd/ebd308.htm#005.md):  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Sheva](../ebd/ebd336.htm#007.md) was scribe:
and [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008) and [Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005.md)
were the priests:  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Ira](../ebd/ebd189.htm#000.md) also the
Jairite was a chief ruler about [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md).
