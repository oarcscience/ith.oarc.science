### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 36

<span id="001">1</span> Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md), that
[Sennacherib](../ebd/ebd327.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md) came up against all the defenced cities
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and took them.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) sent [Rabshakeh](../ebd/ebd305.htm#000.md)
from [Lachish](../ebd/ebd222.htm#009.md) to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) unto [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) with a great army. And he stood by the
[conduit](../ebd/ebd087.htm#009.md) of the upper pool in the
[highway](../ebd/ebd178.htm#005.md) of the fuller's field.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then came forth unto him
[Eliakim](../ebd/ebd116.htm#000.md), Hilkiah's son, which was over the
house, and [Shebna](../ebd/ebd332.htm#009.md) the scribe, and
[Joah](../ebd/ebd207.htm#007.md), Asaph's son, the
[recorder](../ebd/ebd308.htm#005.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Rabshakeh](../ebd/ebd305.htm#000.md) said unto
them, Say ye now to [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md), Thus saith the
great [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md), What confidence is this wherein
thou trustest?  

<span id="005">5</span> I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain
words) I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust,
that thou rebellest against me?  

<span id="006">6</span> Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken
[reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000), on [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md);
whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) to all that trust in him.  

<span id="007">7</span> But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our
God: is it not he, whose high places and whose altars
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) hath taken away, and said to
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), Ye shall
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) before this
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md)?  

<span id="008">8</span> Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my
master the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md), and I will give thee two thousand
horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.  

<span id="009">9</span> How then wilt thou turn away the face of one
captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) for chariots and for horsemen?  

<span id="010">10</span> And am I now come up without the LORD against
this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land,
and destroy it.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then said [Eliakim](../ebd/ebd116.htm#000.md) and
[Shebna](../ebd/ebd332.htm#009) and [Joah](../ebd/ebd207.htm#007.md) unto
[Rabshakeh](../ebd/ebd305.htm#000.md), Speak, I pray thee, unto thy
servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to
us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the
wall.  

<span id="012">12</span> But [Rabshakeh](../ebd/ebd305.htm#000.md) said,
Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words?
hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat
their own [dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003.md), and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) their own piss with you?  

<span id="013">13</span> Then [Rabshakeh](../ebd/ebd305.htm#000.md) stood,
and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the
words of the great [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> Thus saith the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),
Let not [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) deceive you: for he shall not
be able to deliver you.  

<span id="015">15</span> Neither let [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md)
make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us:
this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> Hearken not to
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md): for thus saith the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md), Make
an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every
one of his [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md), and every one of his
[fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001) tree, and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) ye
every one the waters of his own [cistern](../ebd/ebd083.htm#008.md);  

<span id="017">17</span> Until I come and take you away to a land like
your own land, a land of [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md) and
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), a land of [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md)
and vineyards.  

<span id="018">18</span> Beware lest [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md)
persuade you, saying, the LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of
the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md)?  

<span id="019">19</span> Where are the gods of
[Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005) and [Arphad](../ebd/ebd032.htm#003.md)?
where are the gods of [Sepharvaim](../ebd/ebd327.htm#009.md)? and have they
delivered [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md) out of my hand?  

<span id="020">20</span> Who are they among all the gods of these lands,
that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should
deliver [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) out of my hand?  

<span id="021">21</span> But they held their peace, and answered him not
a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then came [Eliakim](../ebd/ebd116.htm#000.md), the
son of [Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006.md), that was over the household,
and [Shebna](../ebd/ebd332.htm#009.md) the scribe, and
[Joah](../ebd/ebd207.htm#007.md), the son of
[Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002), the [recorder](../ebd/ebd308.htm#005.md),
to [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) with their clothes
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md), and told him the words of
[Rabshakeh](../ebd/ebd305.htm#000.md).
