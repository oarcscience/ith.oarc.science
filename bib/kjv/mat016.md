### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> The [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) also with
the [Sadducees](../ebd/ebd318.htm#003) came, and tempting desired him
that he would shew them a sign from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="002">2</span> He answered and said unto them, When it is
evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.  

<span id="003">3</span> And in the morning, It will be foul weather to
day: for the sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern
the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?  

<span id="004">4</span> A wicked and adulterous
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) seeketh after a sign; and there
shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) [Jonas](../ebd/ebd210.htm#009). And he
left them, and departed.  

<span id="005">5</span> And when his disciples were come to the other
side, they had forgotten to take [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006).  

<span id="006">6</span> Then [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto
them, Take heed and beware of the [leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000) of the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) and of the
[Sadducees](../ebd/ebd318.htm#003).  

<span id="007">7</span> And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It
is because we have taken no [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006).  

<span id="008">8</span> Which when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among
yourselves, because ye have brought no [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006)?  

<span id="009">9</span> Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the
five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?  

<span id="010">10</span> Neither the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?  

<span id="011">11</span> How is it that ye do not understand that I
spake it not to you concerning [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), that ye
should beware of the [leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000) of the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) and of the
[Sadducees](../ebd/ebd318.htm#003)?  

<span id="012">12</span> Then understood they how that he bade them not
beware of the [leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000) of
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), but of the doctrine of the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) and of the
[Sadducees](../ebd/ebd318.htm#003).  

<span id="013">13</span> When [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) came into
the coasts of [Caesarea](../ebd/ebd068.htm#003)
[Philippi](../ebd/ebd293.htm#009), he asked his disciples, saying, Whom
do men say that I the Son of man am?  

<span id="014">14</span> And they said, Some say that thou art John the
Baptist: some, [Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002); and others, Jeremias, or
one of the prophets.  

<span id="015">15</span> He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I
am?  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004)
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) answered and said, Thou art the
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), the Son of the living God.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered and
said unto him, Blessed art thou, [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004) Barjona:
for [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) and [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000)
hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="018">18</span> And I say also unto thee, That thou art
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002), and upon this
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) I will build my church; and the gates of
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003) shall not prevail against it.  

<span id="019">19</span> And I will give unto thee the keys of the
kingdom of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006): and whatsoever thou shalt
bind on earth shall be bound in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006): and
whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="020">20</span> Then charged he his disciples that they should
tell no man that he was [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) the
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="021">21</span> From that time forth began
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) to shew unto his disciples, how that he
must go unto [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and suffer many things
of the elders and chief priests and [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003),
and be killed, and be raised again the third day.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) took him,
and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall
not be unto thee.  

<span id="023">23</span> But he turned, and said unto
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002), Get thee behind me,
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000): thou art an offence unto me: for thou
savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.  

<span id="024">24</span> Then said [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) unto
his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and
take up his [cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000), and follow me.  

<span id="025">25</span> For whosoever will save his life shall lose it:
and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.  

<span id="026">26</span> For what is a man profited, if he shall gain
the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in
exchange for his soul?  

<span id="027">27</span> For the Son of man shall come in the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of his Father with his angels; and then
he shall reward every man according to his works.  

<span id="028">28</span> Verily I say unto you, There be some standing
here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man
coming in his kingdom.
