<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Nehemiah Chapter 1</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;The words of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#007">Nehemiah</A> the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#002">Chisleu</A>, in the twentieth year, as I was in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd342.htm#003">Shushan</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;That <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#003">Hanani</A>, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A>, and concerning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A> there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, the great and terrible God, that keepeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> for them that love him and observe his commandments:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Let thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> to set my name there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> be attentive to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> of thy servant, and to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.<BR>
