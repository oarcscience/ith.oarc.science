### King James Version: Job Chapter 35

<span id="001">1</span> [Elihu](../ebd/ebd116.htm#008) spake moreover,
and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou
saidst, My [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) is more than God's?  

<span id="003">3</span> For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto
thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)?  

<span id="004">4</span> I will answer thee, and thy companions with
thee.  

<span id="005">5</span> Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the
clouds which are higher than thou.  

<span id="006">6</span> If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or
if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?  

<span id="007">7</span> If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or
what receiveth he of thine hand?  

<span id="008">8</span> Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and
thy [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) may profit the son of man.  

<span id="009">9</span> By reason of the multitude of oppressions they
make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the
mighty.  

<span id="010">10</span> But none saith, Where is God my maker, who
giveth [songs](../ebd/ebd348.htm#002) in the night;  

<span id="011">11</span> Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the
earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006)?  

<span id="012">12</span> There they cry, but none giveth answer, because
of the pride of evil men.  

<span id="013">13</span> Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will
the Almighty regard it.  

<span id="014">14</span> Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him,
yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.  

<span id="015">15</span> But now, because it is not so, he hath visited
in his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002); yet he knoweth it not in great
extremity:  

<span id="016">16</span> Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he
multiplieth words without knowledge.
