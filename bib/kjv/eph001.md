### King James Version: Ephesians Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), an
[apostle](../ebd/ebd026.htm#008) of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) by the will of God, to the saints which
are at [Ephesus](../ebd/ebd122.htm#007), and to the
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006):  

<span id="002">2</span> [Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) be to you, and
peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="003">3</span> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), who hath
blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000):  

<span id="004">4</span> According as he hath
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) us in him before the foundation of the
world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:  

<span id="005">5</span> Having predestinated us unto the
[adoption](../ebd/ebd010.htm#000) of children by
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) to
himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,  

<span id="006">6</span> To the praise of the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of his [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000),
wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.  

<span id="007">7</span> In whom we have
[redemption](../ebd/ebd308.htm#009) through his
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), the forgiveness of sins, according to
the riches of his [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000);  

<span id="008">8</span> Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom
and prudence;  

<span id="009">9</span> Having made known unto us the
[mystery](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006) of his will, according to his good
pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:  

<span id="010">10</span> That in the
[dispensation](../ebd/ebd104.htm#006) of the
[fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007) of times he might gather together in
one all things in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), both which are in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and which are on earth; even in him:  

<span id="011">11</span> In whom also we have obtained an inheritance,
being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all
things after the counsel of his own will:  

<span id="012">12</span> That we should be to the praise of his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006), who first trusted in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="013">13</span> In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard
the word of truth, the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) of your
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003): in whom also after that ye believed,
ye were sealed with that holy [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of
promise,  

<span id="014">14</span> Which is the [earnest](../ebd/ebd110.htm#006)
of our inheritance until the [redemption](../ebd/ebd308.htm#009) of the
purchased possession, unto the praise of his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006).  

<span id="015">15</span> Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith
in the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), and love unto all the
saints,  

<span id="016">16</span> Cease not to give thanks for you, making
mention of you in my prayers;  

<span id="017">17</span> That the God of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), the
Father of [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006), may give unto you the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of wisdom and
[revelation](../ebd/ebd312.htm#002) in the knowledge of him:  

<span id="018">18</span> The eyes of your understanding being
enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his
[calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007), and what the riches of the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of his inheritance in the saints,  

<span id="019">19</span> And what is the exceeding greatness of his
power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty
power,  

<span id="020">20</span> Which he wrought in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), when he raised him from the dead, and
set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,  

<span id="021">21</span> Far above all principality, and power, and
might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this
world, but also in that which is to come:  

<span id="022">22</span> And hath put all things under his feet, and
gave him to be the head over all things to the church,  

<span id="023">23</span> Which is his body, the
[fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007) of him that filleth all in all.
