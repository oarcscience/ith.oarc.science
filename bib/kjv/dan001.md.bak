### King James Version: Daniel Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> In the third year of the reign of
[Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) came
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md) unto
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and besieged it.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the Lord gave
[Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) into his hand, with part of the vessels
of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the
house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of
his god.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) spake unto
[Ashpenaz](../ebd/ebd034.htm#003.md) the master of his eunuchs, that he
should bring certain of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
and of the king's seed, and of the princes;  

<span id="004">4</span> Children in whom was no
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md), but well favoured, and skilful in all
wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as
had ability in them to stand in the king's
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md), and whom they might teach the learning
and the tongue of the Chaldeans.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) appointed
them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) which he drank: so nourishing them three
years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Now among these were of the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md),
[Hananiah](../ebd/ebd162.htm#004), [Mishael](../ebd/ebd256.htm#006.md), and
[Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005.md):  

<span id="007">7</span> Unto whom the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) of
the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md)
the name of [Belteshazzar](../ebd/ebd052.htm#002.md); and to
[Hananiah](../ebd/ebd162.htm#004), of [Shadrach](../ebd/ebd330.htm#003.md);
and to [Mishael](../ebd/ebd256.htm#006.md), of
[Meshach](../ebd/ebd250.htm#007.md); and to
[Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005.md), of
[Abednego](../ebd/ebd001.htm#003.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> But [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) purposed in
his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the
king's meat, nor with the [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) which he drank:
therefore he requested of the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) of the
eunuchs that he might not defile himself.  

<span id="009">9</span> Now God had brought
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) into favour and tender love with the
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) of the eunuchs.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) of the
eunuchs said unto [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md), I fear my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), who hath appointed your meat and your
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md): for why should he see your faces worse
liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me
endanger my head to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Then said [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) to
[Melzar](../ebd/ebd247.htm#008.md), whom the
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) of the eunuchs had set over
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001), [Hananiah](../ebd/ebd162.htm#004.md),
[Mishael](../ebd/ebd256.htm#006.md), and
[Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005.md),  

<span id="012">12</span> Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days;
and let them give us [pulse](../ebd/ebd302.htm#004.md) to eat, and water to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> Then let our countenances be looked upon before
thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the
king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.  

<span id="014">14</span> So he consented to them in this matter, and
proved them ten days.  

<span id="015">15</span> And at the end of ten days their countenances
appeared fairer and fatter in [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) than all
the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.  

<span id="016">16</span> Thus [Melzar](../ebd/ebd247.htm#008.md) took away
the portion of their meat, and the [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) that
they should [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md); and gave them
[pulse](../ebd/ebd302.htm#004.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> As for these four children, God gave them
knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) had understanding in all visions and
dreams.  

<span id="018">18</span> Now at the end of the days that the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) had said he should bring them in, then the
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) of the eunuchs brought them in before
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) communed
with them; and among them all was found none like
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001), [Hananiah](../ebd/ebd162.htm#004.md),
[Mishael](../ebd/ebd256.htm#006), and [Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005.md):
therefore stood they before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And in all matters of wisdom and understanding,
that the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) enquired of them, he found them
ten times better than all the [magicians](../ebd/ebd236.htm#007.md) and
astrologers that were in all his realm.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) continued
even unto the first year of [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006.md).
