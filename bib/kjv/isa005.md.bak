### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my
beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very
fruitful hill:  

<span id="002">2</span> And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones
thereof, and planted it with the choicest [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md),
and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein:
and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth
wild grapes.  

<span id="003">3</span> And now, O inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md), I pray
you, betwixt me and my vineyard.  

<span id="004">4</span> What could have been done more to my vineyard,
that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should
bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?  

<span id="005">5</span> And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to
my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten
up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:  

<span id="006">6</span> And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned,
nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also
command the clouds that they [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) no
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) upon it.  

<span id="007">7</span> For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the
house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and the men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) his pleasant plant: and he looked for
judgment, but behold oppression; for
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), but behold a cry.  

<span id="008">8</span> Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay
field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in
the midst of the earth!  

<span id="009">9</span> In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth
many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without
inhabitant.  

<span id="010">10</span> Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one
[bath](../ebd/ebd047.htm#003.md), and the seed of an
[homer](../ebd/ebd181.htm#000.md) shall yield an
[ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Woe unto them that rise up early in the
morning, that they may follow strong [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md);
that continue until night, till [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) inflame
them!  

<span id="012">12</span> And the [harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001.md), and the
[viol](../ebd/ebd377.htm#007), the [tabret](../ebd/ebd356.htm#009.md), and
[pipe](../ebd/ebd296.htm#000), and [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), are in
their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider
the operation of his hands.  

<span id="013">13</span> Therefore my people are gone into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md), because they have no knowledge: and
their honourable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with
thirst.  

<span id="014">14</span> Therefore [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md) hath
enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), and their multitude, and their pomp, and
he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the mean man shall be brought down, and the
mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be
humbled:  

<span id="016">16</span> But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in
judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Then shall the lambs feed after their manner,
and the waste places of the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) ones shall
strangers eat.  

<span id="018">18</span> Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of
vanity, and [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) as it were with a
[cart](../ebd/ebd073.htm#001.md) rope:  

<span id="019">19</span> That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his
work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) draw nigh and come, that we may know
it!  

<span id="020">20</span> Woe unto them that call evil good, and good
evil; that put [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) for light, and light
for [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md); that put
[bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009.md) for sweet, and sweet for
[bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009.md)!  

<span id="021">21</span> Woe unto them that are
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) in their own eyes, and prudent in their
own sight!  

<span id="022">22</span> Woe unto them that are mighty to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), and men of
strength to mingle strong [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md):  

<span id="023">23</span> Which justify the wicked for reward, and take
away the [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) of the righteous from
him!  

<span id="024">24</span> Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble,
and the flame consumeth the [chaff](../ebd/ebd075.htm#007.md), so their
root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md): because they have cast away the law of
the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> Therefore is the [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md)
of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his
hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and
their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) is not turned away, but his hand is
stretched out still.  

<span id="026">26</span> And he will lift up an
[ensign](../ebd/ebd121.htm#008.md) to the nations from far, and will
[hiss](../ebd/ebd179.htm#005.md) unto them from the end of the earth: and,
behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:  

<span id="027">27</span> None shall be weary nor stumble among them;
none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the
[girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md) of their loins be loosed, nor the
[latchet](../ebd/ebd224.htm#006.md) of their shoes be broken:  

<span id="028">28</span> Whose [arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005.md) are
sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted
like [flint](../ebd/ebd135.htm#009.md), and their wheels like a
whirlwind:  

<span id="029">29</span> Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall
roar like young [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001.md): yea, they shall roar,
and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe, and none shall
deliver it.  

<span id="030">30</span> And in that day they shall roar against them
like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) and sorrow, and the light is darkened
in the heavens thereof.
