### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> In the beginning God created the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) and the earth.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the earth was without form, and void; and
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) was upon the face of the
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008). And the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md)
of God moved upon the face of the waters.  

<span id="003">3</span> And God said, Let there be light: and there was
light.  

<span id="004">4</span> And God saw the light, that it was good: and God
divided the light from the [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And God called the light Day, and the
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) he called Night. And the evening and
the morning were the first day.  

<span id="006">6</span> And God said, Let there be a
[firmament](../ebd/ebd134.htm#000.md) in the midst of the waters, and let
it divide the waters from the waters.  

<span id="007">7</span> And God made the
[firmament](../ebd/ebd134.htm#000.md), and divided the waters which were
under the [firmament](../ebd/ebd134.htm#000.md) from the waters which were
above the [firmament](../ebd/ebd134.htm#000.md): and it was so.  

<span id="008">8</span> And God called the
[firmament](../ebd/ebd134.htm#000) [Heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md). And
the evening and the morning were the second day.  

<span id="009">9</span> And God said, Let the waters under the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) be gathered together unto one place, and
let the dry land appear: and it was so.  

<span id="010">10</span> And God called the dry land Earth; and the
gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was
good.  

<span id="011">11</span> And God said, Let the earth bring forth
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005), the [herb](../ebd/ebd174.htm#008.md)
yielding seed, and the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) tree yielding
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) after his kind, whose seed is in itself,
upon the earth: and it was so.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the earth brought forth
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005), and [herb](../ebd/ebd174.htm#008.md)
yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md), whose seed was in itself, after his
kind: and God saw that it was good.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the evening and the morning were the third
day.  

<span id="014">14</span> And God said, Let there be lights in the
[firmament](../ebd/ebd134.htm#000.md) of the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) to divide the day from the night; and
let them be for signs, and for [seasons](../ebd/ebd325.htm#003.md), and for
days, and years:  

<span id="015">15</span> And let them be for lights in the
[firmament](../ebd/ebd134.htm#000.md) of the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) to give light upon the earth: and it was
so.  

<span id="016">16</span> And God made two great lights; the greater
light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made
the [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md) also.  

<span id="017">17</span> And God set them in the
[firmament](../ebd/ebd134.htm#000.md) of the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) to give light upon the earth,  

<span id="018">18</span> And to rule over the day and over the night,
and to divide the light from the [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md): and
God saw that it was good.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the evening and the morning were the fourth
day.  

<span id="020">20</span> And God said, Let the waters bring forth
abundantly the moving [creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004.md) that hath life,
and fowl that may [fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004.md) above the earth in the
open [firmament](../ebd/ebd134.htm#000.md) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And God created great whales, and every living
[creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004.md) that moveth, which the waters brought
forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his
kind: and God saw that it was good.  

<span id="022">22</span> And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and
multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the
earth.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the evening and the morning were the fifth
day.  

<span id="024">24</span> And God said, Let the earth bring forth the
living [creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004.md) after his kind,
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), and creeping thing, and
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) of the earth after his kind: and it was
so.  

<span id="025">25</span> And God made the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md)
of the earth after his kind, and [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) after
their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind:
and God saw that it was good.  

<span id="026">26</span> And God said, Let us make man in our image,
after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the
[fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005.md) of the sea, and over the fowl of the air,
and over the [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), and over all the earth,
and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.  

<span id="027">27</span> So God created man in his own image, in the
image of God created he him; male and female created he them.  

<span id="028">28</span> And God blessed them, and God said unto them,
Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and
have dominion over the [fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005.md) of the sea, and
over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon
the earth.  

<span id="029">29</span> And God said, Behold, I have given you every
[herb](../ebd/ebd174.htm#008.md) bearing seed, which is upon the face of
all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall
be for meat.  

<span id="030">30</span> And to every [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) of
the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that
creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green
[herb](../ebd/ebd174.htm#008.md) for meat: and it was so.  

<span id="031">31</span> And God saw every thing that he had made, and,
behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth
day.
