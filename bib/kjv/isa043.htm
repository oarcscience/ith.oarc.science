</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</A>: I gave <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> for thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd307.htm#005">ransom</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd126.htm#005">Ethiopia</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#004">Seba</A> for thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A>, and gather thee from the west;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Bring forth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A>: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">saviour</A>.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, and rivers in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</A>, to give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> to my people, my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Thou hast not brought me the small <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A>, nor wearied thee with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Thou hast bought me no sweet <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#002">cane</A> with money, neither hast thou filled me with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Therefore I have profaned the princes of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A>, and have given <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> to reproaches.<BR>
