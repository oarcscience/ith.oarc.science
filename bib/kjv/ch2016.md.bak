### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000) [Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) came up
against [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and built
[Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005.md), to the intent that he might let none go
out or come in to [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Then [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md) brought out
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) out of
the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent
to Benhadad [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md), that dwelt at
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md), saying,  

<span id="003">3</span> There is a [league](../ebd/ebd225.htm#005.md)
between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father:
behold, I have sent thee [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) and
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md); go, break thy
[league](../ebd/ebd225.htm#005) with [Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), that
he may depart from me.  

<span id="004">4</span> And Benhadad hearkened unto
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md), and sent the
captains of his armies against the cities of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); and they smote
[Ijon](../ebd/ebd187.htm#002), and [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md), and
Abelmaim, and all the store cities of
[Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And it came to pass, when
[Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md) heard it, that he left off building of
[Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005.md), and let his work cease.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) took all [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md);
and they carried away the stones of [Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005.md), and
the timber thereof, wherewith [Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md) was
building; and he built therewith [Geba](../ebd/ebd144.htm#004.md) and
[Mizpah](../ebd/ebd258.htm#000.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And at that time [Hanani](../ebd/ebd162.htm#003.md)
the [seer](../ebd/ebd326.htm#000) came to [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and
said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md), and not
relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md) escaped out of thine hand.  

<span id="008">8</span> Were not the Ethiopians and the
[Lubims](../ebd/ebd232.htm#004) a huge [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md),
with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on
the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.  

<span id="009">9</span> For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro
throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them
whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly:
therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md) was wroth
with the [seer](../ebd/ebd326.htm#000.md), and put him in a
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md) house; for he was in a rage with him
because of this thing. And [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md) oppressed some
of the people the same time.  

<span id="011">11</span> And, behold, the acts of
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md), first and last, lo, they are written in
the book of the kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md) in the thirty
and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease
was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but
to the physicians.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md) slept with his
fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.  

<span id="014">14</span> And they buried him in his own sepulchres,
which he had made for himself in the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and laid him in the bed which was filled
with sweet odours and divers kinds of [spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005.md)
prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great burning
for him.
