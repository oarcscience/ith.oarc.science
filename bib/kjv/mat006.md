### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> Take heed that ye do not your
[alms](../ebd/ebd018.htm#002.md) before men, to be seen of them: otherwise
ye have no reward of your Father which is in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Therefore when thou doest thine
[alms](../ebd/ebd018.htm#002.md), do not sound a trumpet before thee, as
the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may
have [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of men. Verily I say unto you, They
have their reward.  

<span id="003">3</span> But when thou doest
[alms](../ebd/ebd018.htm#002.md), let not thy left hand know what thy right
hand doeth:  

<span id="004">4</span> That thine [alms](../ebd/ebd018.htm#002.md) may be
in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward
thee openly.  

<span id="005">5</span> And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the
hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in
the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say
unto you, They have their reward.  

<span id="006">6</span> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy
[closet](../ebd/ebd085.htm#000.md), and when thou hast shut thy door, pray
to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret
shall reward thee openly.  

<span id="007">7</span> But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as
the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) do: for they think that they shall
be heard for their much speaking.  

<span id="008">8</span> Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your
Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.  

<span id="009">9</span> After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father
which art in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), Hallowed be thy name.  

<span id="010">10</span> Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as
it is in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Give us this day our daily
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our
debtors.  

<span id="013">13</span> And lead us not into
[temptation](../ebd/ebd361.htm#008.md), but deliver us from evil: For thine
is the kingdom, and the power, and the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md),
for ever. [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your
heavenly Father will also forgive you:  

<span id="015">15</span> But if ye forgive not men their trespasses,
neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.  

<span id="016">16</span> Moreover when ye [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md),
be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure
their faces, that they may appear unto men to
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md). Verily I say unto you, They have their
reward.  

<span id="017">17</span> But thou, when thou fastest,
[anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008.md) thine head, and wash thy face;  

<span id="018">18</span> That thou appear not unto men to
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md), but unto thy Father which is in secret:
and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.  

<span id="019">19</span> Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,
where [moth](../ebd/ebd260.htm#005.md) and rust doth corrupt, and where
thieves break through and steal:  

<span id="020">20</span> But lay up for yourselves treasures in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), where neither
[moth](../ebd/ebd260.htm#005.md) nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves
do not break through nor steal:  

<span id="021">21</span> For where your treasure is, there will your
heart be also.  

<span id="022">22</span> The light of the body is the eye: if therefore
thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.  

<span id="023">23</span> But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall
be full of [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md). If therefore the light
that is in thee be [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), how great is that
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md)!  

<span id="024">24</span> No man can serve two masters: for either he
will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one,
and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and
[mammon](../ebd/ebd239.htm#007.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for
your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md); nor yet for your body, what ye shall put
on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?  

<span id="026">26</span> Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not,
neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father
feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?  

<span id="027">27</span> Which of you by taking thought can add one
[cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md) unto his stature?  

<span id="028">28</span> And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider
the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they
spin:  

<span id="029">29</span> And yet I say unto you, That even
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) in all his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) was not arrayed like one of these.  

<span id="030">30</span> Wherefore, if God so clothe the
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md) of the field, which to day is, and to
morrow is cast into the [oven](../ebd/ebd281.htm#005.md), shall he not much
more clothe you, O ye of little faith?  

<span id="031">31</span> Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall
we eat? or, What shall we [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md)? or,
Wherewithal shall we be clothed?  

<span id="032">32</span> (For after all these things do the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) seek:.md) for your heavenly Father
knoweth that ye have need of all these things.  

<span id="033">33</span> But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md); and all these things shall be
added unto you.  

<span id="034">34</span> Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for
the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto
the day is the evil thereof.
