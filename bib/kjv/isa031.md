### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 31

<span id="001">1</span> Woe to them that go down to
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) for help; and stay on horses, and trust
in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are
very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), neither seek the LORD!  

<span id="002">2</span> Yet he also is [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004),
and will bring evil, and will not call back his words: but will arise
against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that
work iniquity.  

<span id="003">3</span> Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and
their horses [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), and not
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009). When the LORD shall stretch out his
hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall
down, and they all shall fail together.  

<span id="004">4</span> For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as
the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of
shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their
voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of
hosts come down to fight for [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), and for the hill thereof.  

<span id="005">5</span> As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts
defend [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005); defending also he will
deliver it; and passing over he will preserve it.  

<span id="006">6</span> Turn ye unto him from whom the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) have deeply revolted.  

<span id="007">7</span> For in that day every man shall cast away his
idols of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and his idols of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), which your own hands have made unto you
for a [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="008">8</span> Then shall the Assyrian fall with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), not of a mighty man; and the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), not of a mean man, shall devour him: but
he shall flee from the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and his young men
shall be discomfited.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he shall pass over to his strong hold for
fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the
[ensign](../ebd/ebd121.htm#008), saith the LORD, whose fire is in
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), and his [furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000)
in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).
