### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 141

<span id="001">1</span> Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.  

<span id="002">2</span> Let my [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) be set
forth before thee as [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md); and the lifting
up of my hands as the evening [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the
door of my lips.  

<span id="004">4</span> Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to
practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of
their dainties.  

<span id="005">5</span> Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a
kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which
shall not break my head: for yet my [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) also
shall be in their calamities.  

<span id="006">6</span> When their judges are overthrown in stony
places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.  

<span id="007">7</span> Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as
when one cutteth and cleaveth [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) upon the
earth.  

<span id="008">8</span> But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in
thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.  

<span id="009">9</span> Keep me from the snares which they have laid for
me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.  

<span id="010">10</span> Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst
that I withal escape.
