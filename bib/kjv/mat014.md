### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> At that time Herod the
[tetrarch](../ebd/ebd363.htm#000.md) heard of the fame of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md),  

<span id="002">2</span> And said unto his servants, This is John the
Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew
forth themselves in him.  

<span id="003">3</span> For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him,
and put him in [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md) for Herodias' sake, his
brother Philip's wife.  

<span id="004">4</span> For John said unto him, It is not lawful for
thee to have her.  

<span id="005">5</span> And when he would have put him to death, he
feared the multitude, because they counted him as a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter
of [Herodias](../ebd/ebd176.htm#006.md) danced before them, and pleased
Herod.  

<span id="007">7</span> Whereupon he promised with an
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md) to give her whatsoever she would ask.  

<span id="008">8</span> And she, being before instructed of her mother,
said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a
[charger](../ebd/ebd077.htm#007.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) was sorry:
nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat,
he commanded it to be given her.  

<span id="010">10</span> And he sent, and beheaded John in the
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And his head was brought in a
[charger](../ebd/ebd077.htm#007.md), and given to the damsel: and she
brought it to her mother.  

<span id="012">12</span> And his disciples came, and took up the body,
and buried it, and went and told [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> When [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) heard of
it, he departed thence by ship into a [desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000.md)
place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on
foot out of the cities.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) went forth,
and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them,
and he healed their sick.  

<span id="015">15</span> And when it was evening, his disciples came to
him, saying, This is a [desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000.md) place, and the
time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md), and buy themselves victuals.  

<span id="016">16</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto
them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.  

<span id="017">17</span> And they say unto him, We have here but five
loaves, and two fishes.  

<span id="018">18</span> He said, Bring them hither to me.  

<span id="019">19</span> And he commanded the multitude to sit down on
the [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md), and took the five loaves, and the
two fishes, and looking up to [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), he
blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the
disciples to the multitude.  

<span id="020">20</span> And they did all eat, and were filled: and they
took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.  

<span id="021">21</span> And they that had eaten were about five
thousand men, beside women and children.  

<span id="022">22</span> And straightway [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto
the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.  

<span id="023">23</span> And when he had sent the multitudes away, he
went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he
was there alone.  

<span id="024">24</span> But the ship was now in the midst of the sea,
tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.  

<span id="025">25</span> And in the fourth watch of the night
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) went unto them, walking on the sea.  

<span id="026">26</span> And when the disciples saw him walking on the
sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md); and they cried out for fear.  

<span id="027">27</span> But straightway [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) answered him
and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.  

<span id="029">29</span> And he said, Come. And when
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) was come down out of the ship, he walked
on the water, to go to [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was
afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.  

<span id="031">31</span> And immediately [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of
little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?  

<span id="032">32</span> And when they were come into the ship, the wind
ceased.  

<span id="033">33</span> Then they that were in the ship came and
worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.  

<span id="034">34</span> And when they were gone over, they came into
the land of [Gennesaret](../ebd/ebd146.htm#000.md).  

<span id="035">35</span> And when the men of that place had knowledge of
him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto
him all that were diseased;  

<span id="036">36</span> And besought him that they might only touch the
[hem](../ebd/ebd173.htm#008.md) of his garment: and as many as touched were
made perfectly whole.
