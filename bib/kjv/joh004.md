### King James Version: John Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> When therefore the LORD knew how the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) had heard that
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) made and baptized more disciples than
John,  

<span id="002">2</span> (Though [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) himself
baptized not, but his disciples,)  

<span id="003">3</span> He left Judaea, and departed again into
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008).  

<span id="004">4</span> And he must needs go through
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004).  

<span id="005">5</span> Then cometh he to a city of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004), which is called
[Sychar](../ebd/ebd354.htm#006), near to the parcel of ground that
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) gave to his son
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005).  

<span id="006">6</span> Now Jacob's well was there.
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) therefore, being wearied with his
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001), sat thus on the well: and it was about
the sixth hour.  

<span id="007">7</span> There cometh a woman of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004) to draw water:
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith unto her, Give me to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009).  

<span id="008">8</span> (For his disciples were gone away unto the city
to buy meat.)  

<span id="009">9</span> Then saith the woman of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004) unto him, How is it that thou, being a
[Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004), askest [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of
me, which am a woman of [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004)? for the Jews
have no dealings with the [Samaritans](../ebd/ebd320.htm#005).  

<span id="010">10</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered and
said unto her, If thou knewest the [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005) of God,
and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009); thou wouldest have asked of him, and he
would have given thee living water.  

<span id="011">11</span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast
nothing to draw with, and the well is [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008):
from whence then hast thou that living water?  

<span id="012">12</span> Art thou greater than our father
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), which gave us the well, and drank
thereof himself, and his children, and his
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002)?  

<span id="013">13</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered and
said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:  

<span id="014">14</span> But whosoever drinketh of the water that I
shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him
shall be in him a well of water springing up into
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) life.  

<span id="015">15</span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this
water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.  

<span id="016">16</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith unto her,
Go, call thy husband, and come hither.  

<span id="017">17</span> The woman answered and said, I have no husband.
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto her, Thou hast well said, I
have no husband:  

<span id="018">18</span> For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom
thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.  

<span id="019">19</span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that
thou art a [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008).  

<span id="020">20</span> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye
say, that in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) is the place where men
ought to [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002).  

<span id="021">21</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith unto her,
Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this
mountain, nor yet at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) the Father.  

<span id="022">22</span> Ye [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) ye know not
what: we know what we [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002): for
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) is of the Jews.  

<span id="023">23</span> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true
worshippers shall [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) the Father in
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) and in truth: for the Father seeketh
such to [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) him.  

<span id="024">24</span> God is a [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009): and
they that [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) him must
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) him in [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009)
and in truth.  

<span id="025">25</span> The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias
cometh, which is called [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000): when he is
come, he will tell us all things.  

<span id="026">26</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith unto her,
I that speak unto thee am he.  

<span id="027">27</span> And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled
that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or,
Why talkest thou with her?  

<span id="028">28</span> The woman then left her waterpot, and went her
way into the city, and saith to the men,  

<span id="029">29</span> Come, see a man, which told me all things that
ever I did: is not this the [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)?  

<span id="030">30</span> Then they went out of the city, and came unto
him.  

<span id="031">31</span> In the mean while his disciples prayed him,
saying, Master, eat.  

<span id="032">32</span> But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that
ye know not of.  

<span id="033">33</span> Therefore said the disciples one to another,
Hath any man brought him ought to eat?  

<span id="034">34</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith unto them,
My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.  

<span id="035">35</span> Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then
cometh [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008)? behold, I say unto you, Lift up
your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008).  

<span id="036">36</span> And he that reapeth receiveth
[wages](../ebd/ebd378.htm#004), and gathereth
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) unto life eternal: that both he that
soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.  

<span id="037">37</span> And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and
another reapeth.  

<span id="038">38</span> I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no
labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.  

<span id="039">39</span> And many of the
[Samaritans](../ebd/ebd320.htm#005) of that city believed on him for the
saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.  

<span id="040">40</span> So when the [Samaritans](../ebd/ebd320.htm#005)
were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and
he abode there two days.  

<span id="041">41</span> And many more believed because of his own
word;  

<span id="042">42</span> And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not
because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that
this is indeed the [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), the
[Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003) of the world.  

<span id="043">43</span> Now after two days he departed thence, and went
into [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008).  

<span id="044">44</span> For [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) himself
testified, that a [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) hath no honour in his
own country.  

<span id="045">45</span> Then when he was come into
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008), the Galilaeans received him, having
seen all the things that he did at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) at
the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000): for they also went unto the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000).  

<span id="046">46</span> So [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) came again
into [Cana](../ebd/ebd070.htm#004) of [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008),
where he made the water [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000). And there was a
certain [nobleman](../ebd/ebd274.htm#005), whose son was sick at
[Capernaum](../ebd/ebd071.htm#007).  

<span id="047">47</span> When he heard that
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) was come out of Judaea into
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008), he went unto him, and besought him
that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of
death.  

<span id="048">48</span> Then said [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) unto
him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.  

<span id="049">49</span> The [nobleman](../ebd/ebd274.htm#005) saith
unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.  

<span id="050">50</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith unto him,
Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) had spoken unto him, and he went his
way.  

<span id="051">51</span> And as he was now going down, his servants met
him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.  

<span id="052">52</span> Then enquired he of them the hour when he began
to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the
[fever](../ebd/ebd132.htm#009) left him.  

<span id="053">53</span> So the father knew that it was at the same
hour, in the which [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto him, Thy son
liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.  

<span id="054">54</span> This is again the second
[miracle](../ebd/ebd256.htm#002) that [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
did, when he was come out of Judaea into
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008).
