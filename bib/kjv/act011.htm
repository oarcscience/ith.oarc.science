<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 11</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> had also received the word of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> was come up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, they that were of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A> contended with him,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;I was in the city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#002">Joppa</A> praying: and in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd371.htm#006">trance</A> I saw a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> by four corners; and it came even to me:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>; slay and eat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But the voice answered me again from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</A> unto me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And he shewed us how he had seen an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#002">Joppa</A>, and call for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A>, whose surname is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And as I began to speak, the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> fell on them, as on us at the beginning.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Forasmuch then as God gave them the like <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>; what was I, that I could withstand God?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> granted <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</A> unto life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Now they which were scattered abroad upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd290.htm#007">persecution</A> that arose about <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#002">Stephen</A> travelled as far as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#001">Phenice</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#003">Cyprus</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</A>, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And some of them were men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#003">Cyprus</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#004">Cyrene</A>, which, when they were come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</A>, spake unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#002">Grecians</A>, preaching the LORD <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: and they sent forth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A>, that he should go as far as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Who, when he came, and had seen the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;For he was a good man, and full of the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Then departed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd359.htm#003">Tarsus</A>, for to seek <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And when he had found him, he brought him unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</A>. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And in these days came prophets from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And there stood up one of them named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd011.htm#007">Agabus</A>, and signified by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> that there should be great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd099.htm#005">dearth</A> throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#003">Claudius</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>.<BR>
