### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 93

<span id="001">1</span> The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty;
the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the
world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.  

<span id="002">2</span> Thy [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) is
established of old: thou art from
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods
have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.  

<span id="004">4</span> The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of
many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thy testimonies are very sure:
[holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md) becometh thine house, O LORD, for
ever.
