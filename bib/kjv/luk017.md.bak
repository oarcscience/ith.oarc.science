### King James Version: Luke Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> Then said he unto the disciples, It is
impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom
they come!  

<span id="002">2</span> It were better for him that a millstone were
hanged about his [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md), and he cast into the
sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.  

<span id="003">3</span> Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass
against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.  

<span id="004">4</span> And if he trespass against thee
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times in a day, and
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times in a day turn again to thee,
saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase
our faith.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a
[grain](../ebd/ebd154.htm#003) of [mustard](../ebd/ebd262.htm#009.md) seed,
ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root,
and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.  

<span id="007">7</span> But which of you, having a servant plowing or
feeding [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), will say unto him by and by,
when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?  

<span id="008">8</span> And will not rather say unto him, Make ready
wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten
and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md)?  

<span id="009">9</span> Doth he thank that servant because he did the
things that were commanded him? I trow not.  

<span id="010">10</span> So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all
those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants:
we have done that which was our duty to do.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it came to pass, as he went to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), that he passed through the midst of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004) and [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And as he entered into a certain village, there
met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:  

<span id="013">13</span> And they lifted up their voices, and said,
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), Master, have
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) on us.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go
shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they
went, they were cleansed.  

<span id="015">15</span> And one of them, when he saw that he was
healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,  

<span id="016">16</span> And fell down on his face at his feet, giving
him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answering
said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?  

<span id="018">18</span> There are not found that returned to give
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) to God, save this
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy
faith hath made thee whole.  

<span id="020">20</span> And when he was demanded of the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md), when the kingdom of God should come,
he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with
observation:  

<span id="021">21</span> Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there!
for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.  

<span id="022">22</span> And he said unto the disciples, The days will
come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and
ye shall not see it.  

<span id="023">23</span> And they shall say to you, See here; or, see
there: go not after them, nor follow them.  

<span id="024">24</span> For as the [lightning](../ebd/ebd229.htm#002.md),
that lighteneth out of the one part under
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), shineth unto the other part under
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md); so shall also the Son of man be in his
day.  

<span id="025">25</span> But first must he suffer many things, and be
rejected of this [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it
be also in the days of the Son of man.  

<span id="027">27</span> They did eat, they drank, they married wives,
they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000), and the [flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000.md)
came, and destroyed them all.  

<span id="028">28</span> Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot;
they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they
builded;  

<span id="029">29</span> But the same day that Lot went out of
[Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004.md) it rained fire and
[brimstone](../ebd/ebd065.htm#005) from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md),
and destroyed them all.  

<span id="030">30</span> Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son
of man is revealed.  

<span id="031">31</span> In that day, he which shall be upon the
housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it
away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.  

<span id="032">32</span> Remember Lot's wife.  

<span id="033">33</span> Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall
lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.  

<span id="034">34</span> I tell you, in that night there shall be two
men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.  

<span id="035">35</span> Two women shall be grinding together; the one
shall be taken, and the other left.  

<span id="036">36</span> Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be
taken, and the other left.  

<span id="037">37</span> And they answered and said unto him, Where,
Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the
eagles be gathered together.
