### King James Version: Romans Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> There is therefore now no condemnation to them
which are in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), who walk not after the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), but after the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009).  

<span id="002">2</span> For the law of the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of life in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) hath made
me free from the law of [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) and death.  

<span id="003">3</span> For what the law could not do, in that it was
weak through the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), God sending his own Son
in the likeness of sinful [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), and for
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), condemned [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) in
the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007):  

<span id="004">4</span> That the [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004)
of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), but after the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009).  

<span id="005">5</span> For they that are after the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) do mind the things of the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007); but they that are after the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) the things of the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009).  

<span id="006">6</span> For to be carnally minded is death; but to be
spiritually minded is life and peace.  

<span id="007">7</span> Because the [carnal](../ebd/ebd072.htm#008) mind
is [enmity](../ebd/ebd121.htm#003) against God: for it is not subject to
the law of God, neither indeed can be.  

<span id="008">8</span> So then they that are in the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) cannot please God.  

<span id="009">9</span> But ye are not in the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), but in the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), if so be that the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of God dwell in you. Now if any man have
not the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), he is none of his.  

<span id="010">10</span> And if [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) be in
you, the body is dead because of [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006); but the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) is life because of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="011">11</span> But if the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of
him that raised up [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) from the dead dwell in
you, he that raised up [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) from the dead
shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) that dwelleth in you.  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), to live after the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007).  

<span id="013">13</span> For if ye live after the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), ye shall die: but if ye through the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) do mortify the deeds of the body, ye
shall live.  

<span id="014">14</span> For as many as are led by the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of God, they are the sons of God.  

<span id="015">15</span> For ye have not received the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of [bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002)
again to fear; but ye have received the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009)
of [adoption](../ebd/ebd010.htm#000), whereby we cry,
[Abba](../ebd/ebd000.htm#007), Father.  

<span id="016">16</span> The [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) itself
beareth [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) with our
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), that we are the children of God:  

<span id="017">17</span> And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and
joint-heirs with [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000); if so be that we
suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.  

<span id="018">18</span> For I reckon that the sufferings of this
present time are not worthy to be compared with the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) which shall be revealed in us.  

<span id="019">19</span> For the [earnest](../ebd/ebd110.htm#006)
expectation of the [creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004) waiteth for the
manifestation of the sons of God.  

<span id="020">20</span> For the [creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004) was
made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath
subjected the same in hope,  

<span id="021">21</span> Because the [creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004)
itself also shall be delivered from the [bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002)
of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.  

<span id="022">22</span> For we know that the whole
[creation](../ebd/ebd092.htm#003) groaneth and travaileth in pain
together until now.  

<span id="023">23</span> And not only they, but ourselves also, which
have the firstfruits of the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), even we
ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the
[adoption](../ebd/ebd010.htm#000), to wit, the
[redemption](../ebd/ebd308.htm#009) of our body.  

<span id="024">24</span> For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen
is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?  

<span id="025">25</span> But if we hope for that we see not, then do we
with patience wait for it.  

<span id="026">26</span> Likewise the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009)
also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as
we ought: but the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) itself maketh
intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.  

<span id="027">27</span> And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what
is the mind of the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), because he maketh
intercession for the saints according to the will of God.  

<span id="028">28</span> And we know that all things work together for
good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his
purpose.  

<span id="029">29</span> For whom he did foreknow, he also did
predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be
the firstborn among many brethren.  

<span id="030">30</span> Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also
called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he
justified, them he also glorified.  

<span id="031">31</span> What shall we then say to these things? If God
be for us, who can be against us?  

<span id="032">32</span> He that spared not his own Son, but delivered
him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all
things?  

<span id="033">33</span> Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's
elect? It is God that justifieth.  

<span id="034">34</span> Who is he that condemneth? It is
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) that died, yea rather, that is risen
again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh
intercession for us.  

<span id="035">35</span> Who shall separate us from the love of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)? shall
[tribulation](../ebd/ebd372.htm#005), or distress, or
[persecution](../ebd/ebd290.htm#007), or
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000), or nakedness, or peril, or
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003)?  

<span id="036">36</span> As it is written, For thy sake we are killed
all the day long; we are accounted as [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) for
the slaughter.  

<span id="037">37</span> Nay, in all these things we are more than
conquerors through him that loved us.  

<span id="038">38</span> For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor
life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present,
nor things to come,  

<span id="039">39</span> Nor height, nor depth, nor any other
[creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004), shall be able to separate us from the
love of God, which is in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) our Lord.
