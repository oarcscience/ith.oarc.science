### King James Version: Romans Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> We then that are strong ought to bear the
infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.  

<span id="002">2</span> Let every one of us please his neighbour for his
good to edification.  

<span id="003">3</span> For even [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) pleased
not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that
reproached thee fell on me.  

<span id="004">4</span> For whatsoever things were written aforetime
were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of
the scriptures might have hope.  

<span id="005">5</span> Now the God of patience and consolation grant
you to be likeminded one toward another according to
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md):  

<span id="006">6</span> That ye may with one mind and one mouth
[glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005.md) God, even the Father of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Wherefore receive ye one another, as
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) also received us to the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of God.  

<span id="008">8</span> Now I say that [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) was a [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md)
of the [circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007.md) for the truth of God, to
confirm the promises made unto the fathers:  

<span id="009">9</span> And that the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md)
might [glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005.md) God for his
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md); as it is written, For this cause I will
confess to thee among the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md), and sing
unto thy name.  

<span id="010">10</span> And again he saith, Rejoice, ye
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md), with his people.  

<span id="011">11</span> And again, Praise the Lord, all ye
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md); and laud him, all ye people.  

<span id="012">12</span> And again, [Esaias](../ebd/ebd124.htm#003.md)
saith, There shall be a root of [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005.md), and he
that shall rise to reign over the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md); in
him shall the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) trust.  

<span id="013">13</span> Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and
peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the
Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And I myself also am persuaded of you, my
brethren, that ye also are full of [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md),
filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.  

<span id="015">15</span> Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more
boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) that is given to me of God,  

<span id="016">16</span> That I should be the
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) to the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md), ministering the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) of God, that the
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) up of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) might be acceptable, being sanctified
by the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> I have therefore whereof I may
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) through [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) in those things which pertain to God.  

<span id="018">18</span> For I will not dare to speak of any of those
things which [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) hath not wrought by me, to
make the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) obedient, by word and deed,  

<span id="019">19</span> Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power
of the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of God; so that from
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and round about unto
[Illyricum](../ebd/ebd187.htm#004.md), I have fully preached the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> Yea, so have I strived to preach the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md), not where
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) was named, lest I should build upon
another man's foundation:  

<span id="021">21</span> But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken
of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.  

<span id="022">22</span> For which cause also I have been much hindered
from coming to you.  

<span id="023">23</span> But now having no more place in these parts,
and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;  

<span id="024">24</span> Whensoever I take my
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001) into [Spain](../ebd/ebd349.htm#002.md), I
will come to you: for I trust to see you in my
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md), and to be brought on my way
thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.  

<span id="025">25</span> But now I go unto
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) to [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md)
unto the saints.  

<span id="026">26</span> For it hath pleased them of
[Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003) and [Achaia](../ebd/ebd006.htm#004.md)
to make a certain contribution for the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md)
saints which are at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors
they are. For if the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) have been made
partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) unto them in
[carnal](../ebd/ebd072.htm#008.md) things.  

<span id="028">28</span> When therefore I have performed this, and have
sealed to them this [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md), I will come by you
into [Spain](../ebd/ebd349.htm#002.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I
shall come in the [fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007.md) of the blessing of
the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) Christ's sake, and for the love of the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), that ye strive together with me in your
prayers to God for me;  

<span id="031">31</span> That I may be delivered from them that do not
believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) may be accepted of the saints;  

<span id="032">32</span> That I may come unto you with joy by the will
of God, and may with you be refreshed.  

<span id="033">33</span> Now the God of peace be with you all.
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).
