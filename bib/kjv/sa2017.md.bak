### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> Moreover [Ahithophel](../ebd/ebd015.htm#000.md)
said unto [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md), Let me now choose out twelve
thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) this night:  

<span id="002">2</span> And I will come upon him while he is weary and
weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with
him shall flee; and I will smite the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
only:  

<span id="003">3</span> And I will bring back all the people unto thee:
the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall
be in peace.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the saying pleased
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) well, and all the elders of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Then said [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md), Call
now [Hushai](../ebd/ebd185.htm#003) the [Archite](../ebd/ebd029.htm#006.md)
also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.  

<span id="006">6</span> And when [Hushai](../ebd/ebd185.htm#003.md) was
come to [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md),
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) spake unto him, saying,
[Ahithophel](../ebd/ebd015.htm#000.md) hath spoken after this manner: shall
we do after his saying? if not; speak thou.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Hushai](../ebd/ebd185.htm#003.md) said unto
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md), The counsel that
[Ahithophel](../ebd/ebd015.htm#000.md) hath given is not good at this
time.  

<span id="008">8</span> For, said [Hushai](../ebd/ebd185.htm#003.md), thou
knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be
chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and
thy father is a man of war, and will not [lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002.md)
with the people.  

<span id="009">9</span> Behold, he is hid now in some
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md), or in some other place: and it will come
to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever
heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as
the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) knoweth that thy father is a mighty man,
and they which be with him are valiant men.  

<span id="011">11</span> Therefore I counsel that all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) be generally gathered unto thee, from
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009) even to [Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008.md),
as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle
in thine own person.  

<span id="012">12</span> So shall we come upon him in some place where
he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the
[dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md) falleth on the ground: and of him and of
all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.  

<span id="013">13</span> Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then
shall all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) bring ropes to that city, and
we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) found there.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) and all
the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) said, The counsel of
[Hushai](../ebd/ebd185.htm#003) the [Archite](../ebd/ebd029.htm#006.md) is
better than the counsel of [Ahithophel](../ebd/ebd015.htm#000.md). For the
LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of
[Ahithophel](../ebd/ebd015.htm#000.md), to the intent that the LORD might
bring evil upon [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> Then said [Hushai](../ebd/ebd185.htm#003.md) unto
[Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008) and to [Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005.md)
the priests, Thus and thus did [Ahithophel](../ebd/ebd015.htm#000.md)
counsel [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) and the elders of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); and thus and thus have I counselled.  

<span id="016">16</span> Now therefore send quickly, and tell
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), saying, [Lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002.md)
not this night in the plains of the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md),
but speedily pass over; lest the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) be
swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.  

<span id="017">17</span> Now [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) and
[Ahimaaz](../ebd/ebd014.htm#002.md) stayed by Enrogel; for they might not
be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they
went and told [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md): but they went both of them away
quickly, and came to a man's house in [Bahurim](../ebd/ebd041.htm#009.md),
which had a well in his court; whither they went down.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the woman took and spread a covering over
the well's mouth, and spread ground [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md)
thereon; and the thing was not known.  

<span id="020">20</span> And when Absalom's servants came to the woman
to the house, they said, Where is [Ahimaaz](../ebd/ebd014.htm#002.md) and
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md)? And the woman said unto them, They be
gone over the [brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006.md) of water. And when they had
sought and could not find them, they returned to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And it came to pass, after they were departed,
that they came up out of the well, and went and told
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and said
unto [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), Arise, and pass quickly over the
water: for thus hath [Ahithophel](../ebd/ebd015.htm#000.md) counselled
against you.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) arose, and
all the people that were with him, and they passed over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md): by the morning light there lacked not
one of them that was not gone over [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And when [Ahithophel](../ebd/ebd015.htm#000.md)
saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md), and arose, and gat him home to his house,
to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and
died, and was buried in the [sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md) of his
father.  

<span id="024">24</span> Then [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) came to
[Mahanaim](../ebd/ebd237.htm#005). And [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md)
passed over [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), he and all the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) with him.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) made
[Amasa](../ebd/ebd019.htm#003.md) captain of the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) instead of [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md):
which [Amasa](../ebd/ebd019.htm#003.md) was a man's son, whose name was
Ithra an Israelite, that went in to [Abigail](../ebd/ebd003.htm#002.md) the
daughter of [Nahash](../ebd/ebd265.htm#003.md), sister to
[Zeruiah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#009.md) Joab's mother.  

<span id="026">26</span> So [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) and
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) pitched in the land of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And it came to pass, when
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) was come to
[Mahanaim](../ebd/ebd237.htm#005), that [Shobi](../ebd/ebd340.htm#005.md)
the son of [Nahash](../ebd/ebd265.htm#003.md) of
[Rabbah](../ebd/ebd304.htm#005.md) of the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002), and [Machir](../ebd/ebd235.htm#006.md) the
son of [Ammiel](../ebd/ebd020.htm#006.md) of Lodebar, and
[Barzillai](../ebd/ebd046.htm#002.md) the Gileadite of
[Rogelim](../ebd/ebd315.htm#003.md),  

<span id="028">28</span> Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels,
and [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000), and [barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003.md),
and [flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001.md), and parched
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006), and [beans](../ebd/ebd048.htm#008.md), and
[lentiles](../ebd/ebd227.htm#001.md), and parched
[pulse](../ebd/ebd302.htm#004.md),  

<span id="029">29</span> And [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md), and
[butter](../ebd/ebd067.htm#002), and [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), and
[cheese](../ebd/ebd078.htm#005) of [kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000.md), for
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and for the people that were with him,
to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in
the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).
