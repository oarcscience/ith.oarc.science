### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> And there was given me a
[reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000.md) like unto a rod: and the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) stood, saying, Rise, and measure the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) of God, and the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), and them that
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) therein.  

<span id="002">2</span> But the court which is without the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) leave out, and measure it not; for it is
given unto the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md): and the holy city
shall they tread under foot forty and two months.  

<span id="003">3</span> And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and
they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed
in [sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> These are the two [olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009.md)
trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.  

<span id="005">5</span> And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth
out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will
hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.  

<span id="006">6</span> These have power to shut
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), that it [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md)
not in the days of their [prophecy](../ebd/ebd300.htm#007.md): and have
power over waters to turn them to [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), and to
smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when they shall have finished their
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008), the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md)
that ascendeth out of the bottomless [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md) shall
make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.  

<span id="008">8</span> And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of
the great city, which spiritually is called
[Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004) and [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), where
also our Lord was crucified.  

<span id="009">9</span> And they of the people and kindreds and tongues
and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and
shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.  

<span id="010">10</span> And they that dwell upon the earth shall
rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another;
because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.  

<span id="011">11</span> And after three days and an half the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of life from God entered into them, and
they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw
them.  

<span id="012">12</span> And they heard a great voice from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) saying unto them, Come up hither. And
they ascended up to [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) in a
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md); and their enemies beheld them.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the same hour was there a great
[earthquake](../ebd/ebd110.htm#009.md), and the tenth part of the city
fell, and in the [earthquake](../ebd/ebd110.htm#009.md) were slain of men
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) thousand: and the remnant were
affrighted, and gave [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) to the God of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> The second woe is past; and, behold, the third
woe cometh quickly.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the seventh [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md)
sounded; and there were great voices in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md),
saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord,
and of his [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md); and he shall reign for ever
and ever.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the four and twenty elders, which sat
before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,  

<span id="017">17</span> Saying, We give thee thanks, O LORD God
Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken
to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is
come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that
thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the
saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest
destroy them which destroy the earth.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) of God
was opened in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and there was seen in his
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of his
[testament](../ebd/ebd362.htm#007.md): and there were lightnings, and
voices, and thunderings, and an [earthquake](../ebd/ebd110.htm#009.md), and
great [hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002.md).
