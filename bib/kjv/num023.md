### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 23

<span id="001">1</span> And [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) said unto
[Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md), Build me here
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) altars, and prepare me here
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) oxen and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
rams.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md) did as
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) had spoken; and
[Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006) and [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md)
offered on every [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) a
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) and a [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) said unto
[Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md), Stand by thy burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and I will go: peradventure the LORD
will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And
he went to an high place.  

<span id="004">4</span> And God met [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md): and
he said unto him, I have prepared [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) altars,
and I have offered upon every [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) a
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) and a [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and
said, Return unto [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md), and thus thou shalt
speak.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by
his burnt [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md), he, and all the princes of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And he took up his
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md), and said,
[Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) hath brought me from
[Aram](../ebd/ebd028.htm#001.md), out of the mountains of the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md), saying, Come,
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) me [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and
come, defy [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> How shall I [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md), whom
God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the LORD hath not
defied?  

<span id="009">9</span> For from the top of the rocks I see him, and
from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall
not be reckoned among the nations.  

<span id="010">10</span> Who can count the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md)
of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and the number of the fourth part of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)? Let me die the death of the righteous,
and let my last end be like his!  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md) said unto
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md), What hast thou done unto me? I took
thee to [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) mine enemies, and, behold, thou
hast blessed them altogether.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he answered and said, Must I not take heed
to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth?  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md) said unto
him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou
mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt
not see them all: and [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) me them from
thence.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to
the top of [Pisgah](../ebd/ebd296.htm#004.md), and built
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) altars, and offered a
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) and a [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md) on
every [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And he said unto
[Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md), Stand here by thy burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), while I meet the LORD yonder.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the LORD met
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md), and put a word in his mouth, and said,
Go again unto [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md), and say thus.  

<span id="017">17</span> And when he came to him, behold, he stood by
his burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and the princes of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) with him. And
[Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md) said unto him, What hath the LORD
spoken?  

<span id="018">18</span> And he took up his
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md), and said, Rise up,
[Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md), and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of
[Zippor](../ebd/ebd394.htm#007.md):  

<span id="019">19</span> God is not a man, that he should lie; neither
the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do
it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?  

<span id="020">20</span> Behold, I have received commandment to
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md): and he hath blessed; and I cannot
reverse it.  

<span id="021">21</span> He hath not beheld iniquity in
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), neither hath he seen perverseness in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): the LORD his God is with him, and the
shout of a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) is among them.  

<span id="022">22</span> God brought them out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md); he hath as it were the strength of an
[unicorn](../ebd/ebd374.htm#007.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> Surely there is no enchantment against
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), neither is there any
[divination](../ebd/ebd104.htm#009.md) against
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): according to this time it shall be said
of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) and of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), What hath God wrought!  

<span id="024">24</span> Behold, the people shall rise up as a great
lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until
he eat of the prey, and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of the slain.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md) said unto
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003), Neither [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md)
them at all, nor [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) them at all.  

<span id="026">26</span> But [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) answered
and said unto [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md), Told not I thee, saying,
All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md) said unto
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md), Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee
unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) me them from thence.  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md) brought
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) unto the top of
[Peor](../ebd/ebd289.htm#006.md), that looketh toward
[Jeshimon](../ebd/ebd205.htm#002.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) said unto
[Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md), Build me here
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) altars, and prepare me here
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) bullocks and
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) rams.  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md) did as
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) had said, and offered a
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) and a [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md) on
every [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md).
