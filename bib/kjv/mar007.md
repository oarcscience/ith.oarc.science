### King James Version: Mark Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> Then came together unto him the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008), and certain of the
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003), which came from
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="002">2</span> And when they saw some of his disciples eat
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) with defiled, that is to say, with
unwashen, hands, they found fault.  

<span id="003">3</span> For the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008), and
all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the
[tradition](../ebd/ebd371.htm#005) of the elders.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when they come from the market, except they
wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have
received to hold, as the [washing](../ebd/ebd379.htm#002) of cups, and
pots, brasen vessels, and of [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006).  

<span id="005">5</span> Then the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) and
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) asked him, Why walk not thy disciples
according to the [tradition](../ebd/ebd371.htm#005) of the elders, but
eat [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) with unwashen hands?  

<span id="006">6</span> He answered and said unto them, Well hath
[Esaias](../ebd/ebd124.htm#003) prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is
written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is
far from me.  

<span id="007">7</span> Howbeit in vain do they
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) me, teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men.  

<span id="008">8</span> For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold
the [tradition](../ebd/ebd371.htm#005) of men, as the
[washing](../ebd/ebd379.htm#002) of pots and cups: and many other such
like things ye do.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the
commandment of God, that ye may keep your own
[tradition](../ebd/ebd371.htm#005).  

<span id="010">10</span> For [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said, Honour
thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him
die the death:  

<span id="011">11</span> But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or
mother, It is [Corban](../ebd/ebd089.htm#009), that is to say, a
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005), by whatsoever thou mightest be profited
by me; he shall be free.  

<span id="012">12</span> And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his
father or his mother;  

<span id="013">13</span> Making the word of God of none effect through
your [tradition](../ebd/ebd371.htm#005), which ye have delivered: and
many such like things do ye.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when he had called all the people unto him,
he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:  

<span id="015">15</span> There is nothing from without a man, that
entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him,
those are they that defile the man.  

<span id="016">16</span> If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.  

<span id="017">17</span> And when he was entered into the house from the
people, his disciples asked him concerning the
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003).  

<span id="018">18</span> And he saith unto them, Are ye so without
understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from
without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;  

<span id="019">19</span> Because it entereth not into his heart, but
into the [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000), and goeth out into the draught,
purging all meats?  

<span id="020">20</span> And he said, That which cometh out of the man,
that defileth the man.  

<span id="021">21</span> For from within, out of the heart of men,
proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,  

<span id="022">22</span> Thefts, [covetousness](../ebd/ebd092.htm#000),
wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye,
[blasphemy](../ebd/ebd060.htm#005), pride, foolishness:  

<span id="023">23</span> All these evil things come from within, and
defile the man.  

<span id="024">24</span> And from thence he arose, and went into the
borders of [Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001) and
[Sidon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#000), and entered into an house, and would
have no man know it: but he could not be hid.  

<span id="025">25</span> For a certain woman, whose young daughter had
an unclean [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), heard of him, and came and
fell at his feet:  

<span id="026">26</span> The woman was a [Greek](../ebd/ebd155.htm#004),
a [Syrophenician](../ebd/ebd355.htm#004) by nation; and she besought him
that he would cast forth the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007) out of her
daughter.  

<span id="027">27</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto
her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the
children's [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and to cast it unto the
dogs.  

<span id="028">28</span> And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord:
yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.  

<span id="029">29</span> And he said unto her, For this saying go thy
way; the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007) is gone out of thy daughter.  

<span id="030">30</span> And when she was come to her house, she found
the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007) gone out, and her daughter laid upon
the bed.  

<span id="031">31</span> And again, departing from the coasts of
[Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001) and [Sidon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#000), he
came unto the sea of [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008), through the midst
of the coasts of [Decapolis](../ebd/ebd100.htm#002).  

<span id="032">32</span> And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and
had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand
upon him.  

<span id="033">33</span> And he took him aside from the multitude, and
put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;  

<span id="034">34</span> And looking up to
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), he sighed, and saith unto him,
[Ephphatha](../ebd/ebd122.htm#009), that is, Be opened.  

<span id="035">35</span> And straightway his ears were opened, and the
string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002).  

<span id="036">36</span> And he charged them that they should tell no
man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they
published it;  

<span id="037">37</span> And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He
hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the
[dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002) to speak.
