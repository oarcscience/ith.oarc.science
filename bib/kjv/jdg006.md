### King James Version: Judges Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) did evil in the sight of the LORD: and
the LORD delivered them into the hand of [Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md)
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) years.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the hand of [Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md)
prevailed against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and because of the
Midianites the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) made them the
dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.  

<span id="003">3</span> And so it was, when
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) had sown, that the Midianites came up,
and the Amalekites, and the children of the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md), even they came up against them;  

<span id="004">4</span> And they encamped against them, and destroyed
the increase of the earth, till thou come unto
[Gaza](../ebd/ebd144.htm#003.md), and left no sustenance for
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), neither [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md),
nor [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007), nor [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> For they came up with their
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) and their tents, and they came as
grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without
number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) was greatly
impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) cried unto the LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> And it came to pass, when the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) cried unto the LORD because of the
Midianites,  

<span id="008">8</span> That the LORD sent a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), which said unto them, Thus saith the
LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), I brought you up from
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and brought you forth out of the house
of [bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md);  

<span id="009">9</span> And I delivered you out of the hand of the
Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them
out from before you, and gave you their land;  

<span id="010">10</span> And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God;
fear not the gods of the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md), in whose
land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.  

<span id="011">11</span> And there came an
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the LORD, and sat under an
[oak](../ebd/ebd275.htm#009.md) which was in
[Ophrah](../ebd/ebd279.htm#009.md), that pertained unto
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000) the [Abiezrite](../ebd/ebd003.htm#001.md):
and his son [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) threshed
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md) by the winepress, to hide it from the
Midianites.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD is with thee, thou
mighty man of valour.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) said unto
him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen
us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying,
Did not the LORD bring us up from [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md)? but
now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the
Midianites.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in
this thy might, and thou shalt save [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) from
the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?  

<span id="015">15</span> And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith
shall I save [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)? behold, my family is
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) in [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md), and
I am the least in my father's house.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be
with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he said unto him, If now I have found
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) in thy sight, then shew me a sign that
thou talkest with me.  

<span id="018">18</span> Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come
unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he
said, I will tarry until thou come again.  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) went in,
and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an
[ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003) of [flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001.md): the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) he put in a
[basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009.md), and he put the broth in a pot, and
brought it out unto him under the [oak](../ebd/ebd275.htm#009.md), and
presented it.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of God
said unto him, Take the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) and the
unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md),
and pour out the broth. And he did so.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched
the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) and the unleavened cakes; and there
rose up fire out of the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md), and consumed the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) and the unleavened cakes. Then the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the LORD departed out of his sight.  

<span id="022">22</span> And when [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md)
perceived that he was an [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the LORD,
[Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I
have seen an [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the LORD face to face.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee;
fear not: thou shalt not die.  

<span id="024">24</span> Then [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) built an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) there unto the LORD, and called it
Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in
[Ophrah](../ebd/ebd279.htm#009.md) of the Abiezrites.  

<span id="025">25</span> And it came to pass the same night, that the
LORD said unto him, Take thy father's young
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md), even the second
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) of [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) years
old, and throw down the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) of
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md) that thy father hath, and cut down the
[grove](../ebd/ebd155.htm#008.md) that is by it:  

<span id="026">26</span> And build an [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md)
unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md), in the ordered place, and take the second
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md), and offer a burnt
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) with the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) of the [grove](../ebd/ebd155.htm#008.md)
which thou shalt cut down.  

<span id="027">27</span> Then [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) took ten
men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and so it
was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city,
that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.  

<span id="028">28</span> And when the men of the city arose early in the
morning, behold, the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) of
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md) was cast down, and the
[grove](../ebd/ebd155.htm#008.md) was cut down that was by it, and the
second [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md) was offered upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) that was built.  

<span id="029">29</span> And they said one to another, Who hath done
this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said,
[Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) the son of
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md) hath done this thing.  

<span id="030">30</span> Then the men of the city said unto
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md), Bring out thy son, that he may die:
because he hath cast down the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) of
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md), and because he hath cut down the
[grove](../ebd/ebd155.htm#008.md) that was by it.  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md) said unto
all that stood against him, Will ye plead for
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md)? will ye save him? he that will plead for
him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god,
let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> Therefore on that day he called him
[Jerubbaal](../ebd/ebd204.htm#002.md), saying, Let
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md) plead against him, because he hath thrown
down his [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and
the children of the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) were gathered
together, and went over, and pitched in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008.md).  

<span id="034">34</span> But the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the
LORD came upon [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md), and he blew a trumpet;
and [Abiezer](../ebd/ebd003.htm#000.md) was gathered after him.  

<span id="035">35</span> And he sent messengers throughout all
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md); who also was gathered after him: and
he sent messengers unto [Asher](../ebd/ebd033.htm#008.md), and unto
[Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003.md), and unto
[Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006.md); and they came up to meet them.  

<span id="036">36</span> And [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) said unto
God, If thou wilt save [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) by mine hand, as
thou hast said,  

<span id="037">37</span> Behold, I will put a
[fleece](../ebd/ebd135.htm#006) of [wool](../ebd/ebd383.htm#005.md) in the
floor; and if the [dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md) be on the
[fleece](../ebd/ebd135.htm#006.md) only, and it be dry upon all the earth
beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) by mine hand, as thou hast said.  

<span id="038">38</span> And it was so: for he rose up early on the
morrow, and thrust the [fleece](../ebd/ebd135.htm#006.md) together, and
wringed the [dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md) out of the
[fleece](../ebd/ebd135.htm#006), a [bowl](../ebd/ebd063.htm#006.md) full of
water.  

<span id="039">39</span> And [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) said unto
God, Let not thine [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) be hot against me, and
I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once
with the [fleece](../ebd/ebd135.htm#006.md); let it now be dry only upon
the [fleece](../ebd/ebd135.htm#006.md), and upon all the ground let there
be [dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md).  

<span id="040">40</span> And God did so that night: for it was dry upon
the [fleece](../ebd/ebd135.htm#006.md) only, and there was
[dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md) on all the ground.
