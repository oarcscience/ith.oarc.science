### King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 29

<span id="001">1</span> Furthermore [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said unto all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md)
my son, whom alone God hath [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md), is yet
young and tender, and the work is great: for the
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md) is not for man, but for the LORD God.  

<span id="002">2</span> Now I have prepared with all my might for the
house of my God the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) for things to be made
of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) for things of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and the [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md)
for things of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md), the
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md) for things of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004), and [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) for
things of [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003); [onyx](../ebd/ebd279.htm#004.md)
stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours,
and all manner of precious stones, and [marble](../ebd/ebd241.htm#006.md)
stones in abundance.  

<span id="003">3</span> Moreover, because I have set my
[affection](../ebd/ebd011.htm#004.md) to the house of my God, I have of
mine own proper good, of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) and
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), which I have given to the house of my
God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house.  

<span id="004">4</span> Even three thousand talents of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), of the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) of
[Ophir](../ebd/ebd279.htm#007), and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
thousand talents of refined [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), to overlay
the walls of the houses withal:  

<span id="005">5</span> The [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) for things of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and the [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md)
for things of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and for all manner of
work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is willing to
consecrate his service this day unto the LORD?  

<span id="006">6</span> Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the
tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) and the captains of
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md) and of hundreds, with the rulers of
the king's work, offered willingly,  

<span id="007">7</span> And gave for the service of the house of God of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) five thousand talents and ten thousand
drams, and of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) ten thousand talents, and
of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md) eighteen thousand talents, and one
hundred thousand talents of [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And they with whom precious stones were found
gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of
[Jehiel](../ebd/ebd200.htm#003.md) the Gershonite.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered
willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the
LORD: and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) also rejoiced with great joy.  

<span id="010">10</span> Wherefore [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
blessed the LORD before all the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md):
and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) our father, for ever and ever.  

<span id="011">11</span> Thine, O LORD is the greatness, and the power,
and the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), and the victory, and the
majesty: for all that is in the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) and in
the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted
as head above all.  

<span id="012">12</span> Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou
reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine
hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.  

<span id="013">13</span> Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and
praise thy glorious name.  

<span id="014">14</span> But who am I, and what is my people, that we
should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things
come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.  

<span id="015">15</span> For we are strangers before thee, and
sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md), and there is none abiding.  

<span id="016">16</span> O LORD our God, all this store that we have
prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine
hand, and is all thine own.  

<span id="017">17</span> I know also, my God, that thou triest the
heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness
of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I
seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly
unto thee.  

<span id="018">18</span> O LORD God of [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md),
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006), and of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of
the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:  

<span id="019">19</span> And give unto [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md)
my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and
thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md), for the which I have made provision.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said to all
the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), Now
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) the LORD your God. And all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) blessed the LORD God of their
fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD,
and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day,
even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with
their [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) offerings, and sacrifices in
abundance for all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):  

<span id="022">22</span> And did eat and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md)
before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) the son of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) the second
time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief governor, and
[Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008) to be [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> Then [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) sat on
the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of the LORD as
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) instead of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
his father, and prospered; and all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
obeyed him.  

<span id="024">24</span> And all the princes, and the mighty men, and
all the sons likewise of [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), submitted themselves unto
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> And the LORD magnified
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) exceedingly in the sight of all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and bestowed upon him such royal
majesty as had not been on any [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) before him
in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> Thus [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) the son of
[Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005.md) reigned over all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And the time that he reigned over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) was forty years;
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) years reigned he in
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004.md), and thirty and three years reigned he
in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> And he died in a good old age, full of days,
riches, and honour: and [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) his son reigned
in his stead.  

<span id="029">29</span> Now the acts of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), first and last, behold, they are
written in the book of [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) the
[seer](../ebd/ebd326.htm#000.md), and in the book of
[Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md),
and in the book of [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md) the
[seer](../ebd/ebd326.htm#000.md),  

<span id="030">30</span> With all his reign and his might, and the times
that went over him, and over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and over
all the kingdoms of the countries.
