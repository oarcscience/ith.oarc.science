<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 1</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;The former treatise have I made, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd363.htm#008">Theophilus</A>, of all that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> began both to do and teach,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;To whom also he shewed himself alive after his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#004">passion</A> by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> not many days hence.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#003">seasons</A>, which the Father hath put in his own power.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and in all Judaea, and in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A> received him out of their sight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And while they looked stedfastly toward <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Which also said, Ye men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, why stand ye gazing up into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>? this same <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, which is taken up from you into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then returned they unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> called Olivet, which is from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</A>, and John, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd023.htm#007">Andrew</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#005">Thomas</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#009">Bartholomew</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd244.htm#003">Matthew</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#005">Alphaeus</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd390.htm#003">Zelotes</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</A> the brother of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;These all continued with one accord in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> and supplication, with the women, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> the mother of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, and with his brethren.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And in those days <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Men and brethren, this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A> must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> by the mouth of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> spake before concerning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</A>, which was guide to them that took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A> gushed out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And it was known unto all the dwellers at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd006.htm#003">Aceldama</A>, that is to say, The field of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For it is written in the book of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#005">Psalms</A>, Let his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A> be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> went in and out among us,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> with us of his resurrection.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And they appointed two, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#008">Barsabas</A>, who was surnamed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd215.htm#000">Justus</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd244.htm#005">Matthias</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</A> by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd244.htm#005">Matthias</A>; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.<BR>
