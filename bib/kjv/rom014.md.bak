### King James Version: Romans Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but
not to doubtful disputations.  

<span id="002">2</span> For one believeth that he may eat all things:
another, who is weak, eateth herbs.  

<span id="003">3</span> Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth
not; and let not him which eateth not [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) him
that eateth: for God hath received him.  

<span id="004">4</span> Who art thou that judgest another man's servant?
to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up:
for God is able to make him stand.  

<span id="005">5</span> One man esteemeth one day above another: another
esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own
mind.  

<span id="006">6</span> He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the
Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard
it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he
that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.  

<span id="007">7</span> For none of us liveth to himself, and no man
dieth to himself.  

<span id="008">8</span> For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and
whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die,
we are the Lord's.  

<span id="009">9</span> For to this end [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead
and living.  

<span id="010">10</span> But why dost thou
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) thy brother? or why dost thou set at
nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord,
every knee shall [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) to me, and every tongue
shall confess to God.  

<span id="012">12</span> So then every one of us shall give account of
himself to God.  

<span id="013">13</span> Let us not therefore
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) one another any more: but
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) this rather, that no man put a
stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.  

<span id="014">14</span> I know, and am persuaded by the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), that there is nothing unclean of itself:
but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is
unclean.  

<span id="015">15</span> But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat,
now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) died.  

<span id="016">16</span> Let not then your good be evil spoken of:  

<span id="017">17</span> For the kingdom of God is not meat and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md); but
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), and peace, and joy in the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> For he that in these things serveth
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) is acceptable to God, and approved of
men.  

<span id="019">19</span> Let us therefore follow after the things which
make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.  

<span id="020">20</span> For meat destroy not the work of God. All
things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with
offence.  

<span id="021">21</span> It is good neither to eat
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), nor to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md)
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), nor any thing whereby thy brother
stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.  

<span id="022">22</span> Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God.
Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he
alloweth.  

<span id="023">23</span> And he that doubteth is damned if he eat,
because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).
