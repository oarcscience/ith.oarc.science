### King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as
unto spiritual, but as unto [carnal](../ebd/ebd072.htm#008), even as
unto babes in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="002">2</span> I have fed you with
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000), and not with meat: for hitherto ye were
not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.  

<span id="003">3</span> For ye are yet [carnal](../ebd/ebd072.htm#008):
for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are
ye not [carnal](../ebd/ebd072.htm#008), and walk as men?  

<span id="004">4</span> For while one saith, I am of
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002); and another, I am of
[Apollos](../ebd/ebd026.htm#006); are ye not
[carnal](../ebd/ebd072.htm#008)?  

<span id="005">5</span> Who then is [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), and
who is [Apollos](../ebd/ebd026.htm#006), but ministers by whom ye
believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?  

<span id="006">6</span> I have planted, [Apollos](../ebd/ebd026.htm#006)
watered; but God gave the increase.  

<span id="007">7</span> So then neither is he that planteth any thing,
neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.  

<span id="008">8</span> Now he that planteth and he that watereth are
one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own
labour.  

<span id="009">9</span> For we are labourers together with God: ye are
God's husbandry, ye are God's building.  

<span id="010">10</span> According to the [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000)
of God which is given unto me, as a [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004)
masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon.
But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.  

<span id="011">11</span> For other foundation can no man lay than that
is laid, which is [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="012">12</span> Now if any man build upon this foundation
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), precious
stones, [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), [hay](../ebd/ebd168.htm#002),
stubble;  

<span id="013">13</span> Every man's work shall be made manifest: for
the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the
fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.  

<span id="014">14</span> If any man's work abide which he hath built
thereupon, he shall receive a reward.  

<span id="015">15</span> If any man's work shall be burned, he shall
suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.  

<span id="016">16</span> Know ye not that ye are the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of God, and that the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of God dwelleth in you?  

<span id="017">17</span> If any man defile the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of God, him shall God destroy; for the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of God is holy, which
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) ye are.  

<span id="018">18</span> Let no man deceive himself. If any man among
you seemeth to be [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) in this world, let him
become a fool, that he may be [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004).  

<span id="019">19</span> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness
with God. For it is written, He taketh the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004)
in their own craftiness.  

<span id="020">20</span> And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), that they are vain.  

<span id="021">21</span> Therefore let no man
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) in men. For all things are your's;  

<span id="022">22</span> Whether [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), or
[Apollos](../ebd/ebd026.htm#006), or [Cephas](../ebd/ebd075.htm#005), or
the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all
are your's;  

<span id="023">23</span> And ye are Christ's; and
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) is God's.
