### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 26

<span id="001">1</span> In that day shall this song be sung in the land
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md); We have a strong city;
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) will God appoint for walls and
[bulwarks](../ebd/ebd066.htm#005.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation
which keepeth the truth may enter in.  

<span id="003">3</span> Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind
is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD
[JEHOVAH](../ebd/ebd201.htm#009) is [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md)
strength:  

<span id="005">5</span> For he bringeth down them that dwell on high;
the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground;
he bringeth it even to the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of
the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), and the steps of the needy.  

<span id="007">7</span> The way of the just is uprightness: thou, most
upright, dost weigh the path of the just.  

<span id="008">8</span> Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have
we waited for thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the
remembrance of thee.  

<span id="009">9</span> With my soul have I desired thee in the night;
yea, with my [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) within me will I seek thee
early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the
world will learn [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he
not learn [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md): in the land of
uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of
the LORD.  

<span id="011">11</span> LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not
see: but they shall see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people;
yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.  

<span id="012">12</span> LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou
also hast wrought all our works in us.  

<span id="013">13</span> O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have
had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy
name.  

<span id="014">14</span> They are dead, they shall not live; they are
deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed
them, and made all their memory to perish.  

<span id="015">15</span> Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou
hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed it far
unto all the ends of the earth.  

<span id="016">16</span> LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they
poured out a [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) when thy chastening was
upon them.  

<span id="017">17</span> Like as a woman with child, that draweth near
the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so
have we been in thy sight, O LORD.  

<span id="018">18</span> We have been with child, we have been in pain,
we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any
deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world
fallen.  

<span id="019">19</span> Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead
body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008): for thy [dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md) is
as the [dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md) of herbs, and the earth shall cast
out the dead.  

<span id="020">20</span> Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers,
and shut thy [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) about thee: hide thyself as
it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.  

<span id="021">21</span> For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place
to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth
also shall disclose her [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), and shall no
more cover her slain.
