### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 28

<span id="001">1</span> Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001); be not silent to me: lest, if thou be
silent to me, I become like them that go down into the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007).  

<span id="002">2</span> Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry
unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy
[oracle](../ebd/ebd280.htm#000).  

<span id="003">3</span> Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the
workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief
is in their hearts.  

<span id="004">4</span> Give them according to their deeds, and
according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the
work of their hands; render to them their
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000).  

<span id="005">5</span> Because they regard not the works of the LORD,
nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build
them up.  

<span id="006">6</span> Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the
voice of my supplications.  

<span id="007">7</span> The LORD is my strength and my
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001); my heart trusted in him, and I am
helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I
praise him.  

<span id="008">8</span> The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving
strength of his anointed.  

<span id="009">9</span> Save thy people, and
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) thine inheritance: feed them also, and
lift them up for ever.
