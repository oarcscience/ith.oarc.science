### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 33

<span id="001">1</span> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) the second time, while he was yet shut
up in the court of the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD
that formed it, to establish it; the LORD is his name;  

<span id="003">3</span> Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew
thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.  

<span id="004">4</span> For thus saith the LORD, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), concerning the houses of this city, and
concerning the houses of the kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md),
which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md);  

<span id="005">5</span> They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is
to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) and in my [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md),
and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.  

<span id="006">6</span> Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I
will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and
truth.  

<span id="007">7</span> And I will cause the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and
the [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) to return, and will build them, as at
the first.  

<span id="008">8</span> And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity,
whereby they have sinned against me; and I will
[pardon](../ebd/ebd285.htm#001.md) all their iniquities, whereby they have
sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me.  

<span id="009">9</span> And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise
and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all
the good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all
the [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md) and for all the prosperity that I
procure unto it.  

<span id="010">10</span> Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard
in this place, which ye say shall be desolate without man and without
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md), even in the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and in the streets of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), that are desolate, without man, and
without inhabitant, and without [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md),  

<span id="011">11</span> The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness,
the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the
[bride](../ebd/ebd065.htm#001.md), the voice of them that shall say, Praise
the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) endureth for ever: and of them that shall
bring the [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) of praise into the house of
the LORD. For I will cause to return the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md) of the land, as at the first, saith
the LORD.  

<span id="012">12</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this
place, which is desolate without man and without
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md), and in all the cities thereof, shall be
an [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md) of shepherds causing their flocks
to lie down.  

<span id="013">13</span> In the cities of the mountains, in the cities
of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md), and in the places about
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and in the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), shall the flocks pass again under the
hands of him that telleth them, saith the LORD.  

<span id="014">14</span> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I
will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) and to the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> In those days, and at that time, will I cause
the [Branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002.md) of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) to grow up unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md); and he shall execute judgment and
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) in the land.  

<span id="016">16</span> In those days shall
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) be saved, and
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) shall dwell safely: and this is the
name wherewith she shall be called, The LORD our
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> For thus saith the LORD;
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) shall never want a man to sit upon the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md);  

<span id="018">18</span> Neither shall the priests the Levites want a
man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings,
and to do [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) continually.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the word of the LORD came unto
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md), saying,  

<span id="020">20</span> Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of the day, and my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of the night, and that there should
not be day and night in their season;  

<span id="021">21</span> Then may also my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) be broken with
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) my servant, that he should not have a son
to reign upon his [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md); and with the Levites
the priests, my ministers.  

<span id="022">22</span> As the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) cannot be numbered, neither the sand of
the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) my servant, and the Levites that
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) unto me.  

<span id="023">23</span> Moreover the word of the LORD came to
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md), saying,  

<span id="024">24</span> Considerest thou not what this people have
spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD hath
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md), he hath even cast them off? thus they
have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before
them.  

<span id="025">25</span> Thus saith the LORD; If my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) be not with day and night, and if I
have not appointed the ordinances of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) and
earth;  

<span id="026">26</span> Then will I cast away the seed of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) my
servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the
seed of [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md),
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006), and [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md): for
I will cause their [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md) to return, and
have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) on them.
