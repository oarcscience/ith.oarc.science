### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 36

<span id="001">1</span> Then wrought [Bezaleel](../ebd/ebd057.htm#009.md)
and [Aholiab](../ebd/ebd015.htm#006.md), and every
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom
and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service
of the [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md), according to all that the
LORD had commanded.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) called
[Bezaleel](../ebd/ebd057.htm#009) and [Aholiab](../ebd/ebd015.htm#006.md),
and every [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) hearted man, in whose heart the
LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come
unto the work to do it:  

<span id="003">3</span> And they received of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) all the
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), which the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) had brought for the work of the service
of the [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md), to make it withal. And they
brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.  

<span id="004">4</span> And all the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) men,
that wrought all the work of the [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md),
came every man from his work which they made;  

<span id="005">5</span> And they spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying, The people bring much more than
enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) gave
commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md), saying, Let neither man nor woman make
any more work for the [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) of the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md). So the people were restrained from
bringing.  

<span id="007">7</span> For the stuff they had was sufficient for all
the work to make it, and too much.  

<span id="008">8</span> And every [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) hearted
man among them that wrought the work of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) made ten curtains of fine twined
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), and [blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003.md), and
purple, and [scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md): with cherubims of cunning
work made he them.  

<span id="009">9</span> The length of one
[curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004.md) was twenty and eight cubits, and the
breadth of one [curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004.md) four cubits: the
curtains were all of one size.  

<span id="010">10</span> And he coupled the five curtains one unto
another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another.  

<span id="011">11</span> And he made loops of
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003.md) on the edge of one
[curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004.md) from the selvedge in the coupling:
likewise he made in the uttermost side of another
[curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004.md), in the coupling of the second.  

<span id="012">12</span> Fifty loops made he in one
[curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004.md), and fifty loops made he in the edge of
the [curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004.md) which was in the coupling of the
second: the loops held one [curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004.md) to
another.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he made fifty
[taches](../ebd/ebd357.htm#001) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and
coupled the curtains one unto another with the
[taches](../ebd/ebd357.htm#001.md): so it became one
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And he made curtains of goats' hair for the
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) over the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md): eleven curtains he made them.  

<span id="015">15</span> The length of one
[curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004.md) was thirty cubits, and four cubits was
the breadth of one [curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004.md): the eleven curtains
were of one size.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and
six curtains by themselves.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge
of the [curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004.md) in the coupling, and fifty loops
made he upon the edge of the [curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004.md) which
coupleth the second.  

<span id="018">18</span> And he made fifty
[taches](../ebd/ebd357.htm#001) of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md) to
couple the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) together, that it might be
one.  

<span id="019">19</span> And he made a covering for the
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of
badgers' skins above that.  

<span id="020">20</span> And he made boards for the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of [shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009.md)
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md), standing up.  

<span id="021">21</span> The length of a board was ten cubits, and the
breadth of a board one [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md) and a half.  

<span id="022">22</span> One board had two tenons, equally distant one
from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And he made boards for the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md); twenty boards for the south side
southward:  

<span id="024">24</span> And forty sockets of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) he made under the twenty boards; two
sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under
another board for his two tenons.  

<span id="025">25</span> And for the other side of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), which is toward the north corner,
he made twenty boards,  

<span id="026">26</span> And their forty sockets of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md); two sockets under one board, and two
sockets under another board.  

<span id="027">27</span> And for the sides of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) [westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008.md) he
made six boards.  

<span id="028">28</span> And two boards made he for the corners of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) in the two sides.  

<span id="029">29</span> And they were coupled beneath, and coupled
together at the head thereof, to one [ring](../ebd/ebd313.htm#007.md): thus
he did to both of them in both the corners.  

<span id="030">30</span> And there were eight boards; and their sockets
were sixteen sockets of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), under every
board two sockets.  

<span id="031">31</span> And he made bars of
[shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md); five for
the boards of the one side of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md),  

<span id="032">32</span> And five bars for the boards of the other side
of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), and five bars for the boards
of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) for the sides
[westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> And he made the middle bar to shoot through the
boards from the one end to the other.  

<span id="034">34</span> And he overlaid the boards with
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and made their rings of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) to be places for the bars, and overlaid
the bars with [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="035">35</span> And he made a vail of
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003.md), and purple, and
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md), and fine twined
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md): with cherubims made he it of cunning
work.  

<span id="036">36</span> And he made thereunto four pillars of
[shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md), and
overlaid them with [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md): their hooks were of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md); and he cast for them four sockets of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md).  

<span id="037">37</span> And he made an [hanging](../ebd/ebd163.htm#001.md)
for the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) door of
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003.md), and purple, and
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md), and fine twined
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md), of needlework;  

<span id="038">38</span> And the five pillars of it with their hooks:
and he overlaid their chapiters and their
[fillets](../ebd/ebd133.htm#002) with [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md): but
their five sockets were of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md).
