### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 23

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and say unto them, Concerning the
feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations,
even these are my feasts.  

<span id="003">3</span> Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day
is the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) of rest, an holy
[convocation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#003.md); ye shall do no work therein: it is
the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) of the LORD in all your
[dwellings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#001.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy
convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their
[seasons](../ebd/ebd325.htm#003.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> In the fourteenth day of the first month at even
is the LORD's [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And on the fifteenth day of the same month is
the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) of unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) unto the LORD:
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days ye must eat unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> In the first day ye shall have an holy
[convocation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#003.md): ye shall do no servile work
therein.  

<span id="008">8</span> But ye shall offer an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) made by fire unto the LORD
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days: in the seventh day is an holy
[convocation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#003.md): ye shall do no servile work
therein.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="010">10</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and say unto them, When ye be come into
the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md) thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of
the firstfruits of your [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md) unto the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md):  

<span id="011">11</span> And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to
be accepted for you: on the morrow after the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
shall wave it.  

<span id="012">12</span> And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the
sheaf an he [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md) without
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md) of the first year for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) unto the LORD.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md)
thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine [flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001.md)
mingled with oil, an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) made by fire unto
the LORD for a sweet savour: and the [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) thereof shall be of
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), the fourth part of an hin.  

<span id="014">14</span> And ye shall eat neither
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), nor parched
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md), nor green ears, until the selfsame day
that ye have brought an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) unto your God:
it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your
[dwellings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#001.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And ye shall count unto you from the morrow
after the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md), from the day that ye brought
the sheaf of the wave [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md);
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) sabbaths shall be complete:  

<span id="016">16</span> Even unto the morrow after the seventh
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) shall ye number fifty days; and ye
shall offer a new meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) unto the
LORD.  

<span id="017">17</span> Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave
loaves of two tenth deals; they shall be of fine
[flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001.md); they shall be baken with
[leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000.md); they are the firstfruits unto the
LORD.  

<span id="018">18</span> And ye shall offer with the
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) lambs
without [blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md) of the first year, and one
young [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md), and two rams: they shall be for
a burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) unto the LORD, with their meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and their
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) offerings, even an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) made by fire, of sweet savour unto the
LORD.  

<span id="019">19</span> Then ye shall
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) one kid of the goats for a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and two
lambs of the first year for a [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) of
peace offerings.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
wave them with the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) of the firstfruits for
a wave [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) before the LORD, with the two
lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that
it may be an holy [convocation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#003.md) unto you: ye
shall do no servile work therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all
your [dwellings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#001.md) throughout your generations.  

<span id="022">22</span> And when ye reap the
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md) of your land, thou shalt not make
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) riddance of the corners of thy field when
thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md): thou shalt leave them unto the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), and to the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md): I am the LORD your God.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="024">24</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), saying, In the seventh month, in the
first day of the month, shall ye have a
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md), a memorial of blowing of
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md), an holy
[convocation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#003.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye
shall offer an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) made by fire unto the
LORD.  

<span id="026">26</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="027">27</span> Also on the tenth day of this seventh month
there shall be a day of [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md): it shall be
an holy [convocation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#003.md) unto you; and ye shall
afflict your souls, and offer an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) made
by fire unto the LORD.  

<span id="028">28</span> And ye shall do no work in that same day: for
it is a day of [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md), to make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for you before the LORD your God.  

<span id="029">29</span> For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be
afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.  

<span id="030">30</span> And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work
in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.  

<span id="031">31</span> Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a
statute for ever throughout your generations in all your
[dwellings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#001.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> It shall be unto you a
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) of rest, and ye shall afflict your
souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall
ye celebrate your [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="034">34</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), saying, The fifteenth day of this
seventh month shall be the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) of tabernacles
for [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days unto the LORD.  

<span id="035">35</span> On the first day shall be an holy
[convocation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#003.md): ye shall do no servile work
therein.  

<span id="036">36</span> [Seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days ye shall
offer an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) made by fire unto the LORD:
on the eighth day shall be an holy [convocation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#003.md)
unto you; and ye shall offer an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) made
by fire unto the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no
servile work therein.  

<span id="037">37</span> These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye
shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and a meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), a [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md),
and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) offerings, every thing upon his
day:  

<span id="038">38</span> Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside
your gifts, and beside all your [vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001.md), and
beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.  

<span id="039">39</span> Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month,
when ye have gathered in the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of the land,
ye shall keep a [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) unto the LORD
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days: on the first day shall be a
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md), and on the eighth day shall be a
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md).  

<span id="040">40</span> And ye shall take you on the first day the
boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick
trees, and [willows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#006.md) of the
[brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006.md); and ye shall rejoice before the LORD
your God [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days.  

<span id="041">41</span> And ye shall keep it a
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) unto the LORD
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days in the year. It shall be a statute
for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh
month.  

<span id="042">42</span> Ye shall dwell in booths
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days; all that are Israelites born shall
dwell in booths:  

<span id="043">43</span> That your generations may know that I made the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) to dwell in booths, when I
brought them out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): I am the
LORD your God.  

<span id="044">44</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) declared
unto the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) the feasts of the
LORD.
