### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) numbered the
people that were with him, and set captains of
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md), and captains of hundreds over
them.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) sent forth a
third part of the people under the hand of
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md), and a third part under the hand of
[Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005.md) the son of
[Zeruiah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#009.md), Joab's brother, and a third part under
the hand of [Ittai](../ebd/ebd191.htm#007.md) the
[Gittite](../ebd/ebd149.htm#009). And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.  

<span id="003">3</span> But the people answered, Thou shalt not go
forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half
of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of
us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said unto
them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) stood by the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md)
side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) commanded
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) and [Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005.md) and
[Ittai](../ebd/ebd191.htm#007.md), saying, Deal gently for my sake with the
young man, even with [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md). And all the
people heard when the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) gave all the
captains charge concerning [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> So the people went out into the field against
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and the battle was in the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md);  

<span id="007">7</span> Where the people of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) were slain before the servants of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and there was there a great slaughter
that day of twenty thousand men.  

<span id="008">8</span> For the battle was there scattered over the face
of all the country: and the [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) devoured more
people that day than the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) devoured.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) met the
servants of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md). And
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) rode upon a
[mule](../ebd/ebd262.htm#001), and the [mule](../ebd/ebd262.htm#001.md)
went under the thick boughs of a great [oak](../ebd/ebd275.htm#009.md), and
his head caught hold of the [oak](../ebd/ebd275.htm#009.md), and he was
taken up between the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) and the earth; and
the [mule](../ebd/ebd262.htm#001.md) that was under him went away.  

<span id="010">10</span> And a certain man saw it, and told
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md), and said, Behold, I saw
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) hanged in an
[oak](../ebd/ebd275.htm#009.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) said unto the
man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not
smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels
of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and a
[girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And the man said unto
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md), Though I should receive a thousand
shekels of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) in mine hand, yet would I not
put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) charged thee and
[Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005) and [Ittai](../ebd/ebd191.htm#007.md),
saying, Beware that none touch the young man
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood
against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and thou thyself wouldest have set
thyself against me.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then said [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md), I may
not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and
thrust them through the heart of [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md), while
he was yet alive in the midst of the [oak](../ebd/ebd275.htm#009.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And ten young men that bare Joab's
[armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006.md) compassed about and smote
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md), and slew him.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) blew the
trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): for [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) held
back the people.  

<span id="017">17</span> And they took [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md),
and cast him into a great [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md) in the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md), and laid a very great
[heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md) of stones upon him: and all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) fled every one to his
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> Now [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) in his
lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md), which is in the king's dale: for he
said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md) after his own name: and it is called
unto this day, Absalom's place.  

<span id="019">19</span> Then said [Ahimaaz](../ebd/ebd014.htm#002.md) the
son of [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008.md), Let me now run, and bear the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged
him of his enemies.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) said unto
him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings
another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's
son is dead.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then said [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) to
Cushi, Go tell the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) what thou hast seen.
And Cushi bowed himself unto [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md), and ran.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then said [Ahimaaz](../ebd/ebd014.htm#002.md) the
son of [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008.md) yet again to
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md), But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also
run after Cushi. And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) said, Wherefore wilt
thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?  

<span id="023">23</span> But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said
unto him, Run. Then [Ahimaaz](../ebd/ebd014.htm#002.md) ran by the way of
the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md), and overran Cushi.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) sat between
the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and
looked, and behold a man running alone.  

<span id="025">25</span> And the watchman cried, and told the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001). And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace,
and drew near.  

<span id="026">26</span> And the watchman saw another man running: and
the watchman called unto the [porter](../ebd/ebd299.htm#000.md), and said,
Behold another man running alone. And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
said, He also bringeth tidings.  

<span id="027">27</span> And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running
of the foremost is like the running of [Ahimaaz](../ebd/ebd014.htm#002.md)
the son of [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008.md). And the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said, He is a good man, and cometh with
good tidings.  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Ahimaaz](../ebd/ebd014.htm#002.md) called,
and said unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), All is well. And he
fell down to the earth upon his face before the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God,
which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my
lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said, Is
the young man [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) safe? And
[Ahimaaz](../ebd/ebd014.htm#002.md) answered, When
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) sent the king's servant, and me thy
servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.  

<span id="030">30</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said unto
him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.  

<span id="031">31</span> And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said,
Tidings, my lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md): for the LORD hath
avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.  

<span id="032">32</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said unto
Cushi, Is the young man [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) safe? And Cushi
answered, The enemies of my lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and
all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.  

<span id="033">33</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) was much
moved, and went up to the [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md) over the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md), and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O
my son [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md), my son, my son
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md)! would God I had died for thee, O
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md), my son, my son!
