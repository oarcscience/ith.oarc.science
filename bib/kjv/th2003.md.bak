### King James Version: 2 Thessalonians Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of
the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with
you:  

<span id="002">2</span> And that we may be delivered from unreasonable
and wicked men: for all men have not faith.  

<span id="003">3</span> But the Lord is
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md), who shall stablish you, and keep you
from evil.  

<span id="004">4</span> And we have confidence in the Lord touching you,
that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of
God, and into the patient waiting for [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our
Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md),
that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly,
and not after the [tradition](../ebd/ebd371.htm#005.md) which he received
of us.  

<span id="007">7</span> For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us:
for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;  

<span id="008">8</span> Neither did we eat any man's
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) for nought; but wrought with labour and
travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:  

<span id="009">9</span> Not because we have not power, but to make
ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.  

<span id="010">10</span> For even when we were with you, this we
commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.  

<span id="011">11</span> For we hear that there are some which walk
among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.  

<span id="012">12</span> Now them that are such we command and exhort by
our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md),
that with quietness they work, and eat their own
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.  

<span id="014">14</span> And if any man obey not our word by this
epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be
ashamed.  

<span id="015">15</span> Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him
as a brother.  

<span id="016">16</span> Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace
always by all means. The Lord be with you all.  

<span id="017">17</span> The [salutation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#002.md) of
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) with mine own hand, which is the token in
every epistle: so I write.  

<span id="018">18</span> The [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) be with
you all. [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).
