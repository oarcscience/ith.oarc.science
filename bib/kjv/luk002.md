### King James Version: Luke Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass in those days, that there
went out a decree from [Caesar](../ebd/ebd068.htm#002)
[Augustus](../ebd/ebd036.htm#006) that all the world should be taxed.  

<span id="002">2</span> (And this [taxing](../ebd/ebd359.htm#009) was
first made when [Cyrenius](../ebd/ebd095.htm#005) was governor of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002).)  

<span id="003">3</span> And all went to be taxed, every one into his own
city.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) also went up
from [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008), out of the city of
[Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007), into Judaea, unto the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), which is called
[Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005); (because he was of the house and
lineage of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004):)  

<span id="005">5</span> To be taxed with [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009)
his espoused wife, being great with child.  

<span id="006">6</span> And so it was, that, while they were there, the
days were accomplished that she should be delivered.  

<span id="007">7</span> And she brought forth her firstborn son, and
wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a
[manger](../ebd/ebd240.htm#005); because there was no room for them in
the [inn](../ebd/ebd188.htm#004).  

<span id="008">8</span> And there were in the same country shepherds
abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.  

<span id="009">9</span> And, lo, the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of
the Lord came upon them, and the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the
Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) said
unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy,
which shall be to all people.  

<span id="011">11</span> For unto you is born this day in the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) a [Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003), which
is [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) the Lord.  

<span id="012">12</span> And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall
find the [babe](../ebd/ebd040.htm#009) wrapped in swaddling clothes,
lying in a [manger](../ebd/ebd240.htm#005).  

<span id="013">13</span> And suddenly there was with the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) a multitude of the heavenly
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) praising God, and saying,  

<span id="014">14</span> [Glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) to God in the
highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.  

<span id="015">15</span> And it came to pass, as the angels were gone
away from them into [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), the shepherds said
one to another, Let us now go even unto
[Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005), and see this thing which is come to
pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.  

<span id="016">16</span> And they came with haste, and found
[Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009), and [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), and
the [babe](../ebd/ebd040.htm#009) lying in a
[manger](../ebd/ebd240.htm#005).  

<span id="017">17</span> And when they had seen it, they made known
abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.  

<span id="018">18</span> And all they that heard it wondered at those
things which were told them by the shepherds.  

<span id="019">19</span> But [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009) kept all
these things, and pondered them in her heart.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the shepherds returned, glorifying and
praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was
told unto them.  

<span id="021">21</span> And when eight days were accomplished for the
circumcising of the child, his name was called
[JESUS](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), which was so named of the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) before he was conceived in the womb.  

<span id="022">22</span> And when the days of her
[purification](../ebd/ebd302.htm#007) according to the law of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) were accomplished, they brought him to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), to present him to the Lord;  

<span id="023">23</span> (As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every
male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)  

<span id="024">24</span> And to offer a
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) according to that which is said in
the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.  

<span id="025">25</span> And, behold, there was a man in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), whose name was
[Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002); and the same man was just and devout,
waiting for the consolation of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and the
Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005) was upon him.  

<span id="026">26</span> And it was revealed unto him by the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005), that he should not see death, before he
had seen the Lord's [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="027">27</span> And he came by the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) into the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004): and when the parents brought in the
child [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), to do for him after the
[custom](../ebd/ebd094.htm#008) of the law,  

<span id="028">28</span> Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed
God, and said,  

<span id="029">29</span> Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in
peace, according to thy word:  

<span id="030">30</span> For mine eyes have seen thy
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003),  

<span id="031">31</span> Which thou hast prepared before the face of all
people;  

<span id="032">32</span> A light to lighten the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001), and the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of thy people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="033">33</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) and his
mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.  

<span id="034">34</span> And [Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002) blessed
them, and said unto [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009) his mother, Behold,
this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and for a sign which shall be spoken
against;  

<span id="035">35</span> (Yea, a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) shall
pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may
be revealed.  

<span id="036">36</span> And there was one
[Anna](../ebd/ebd024.htm#006), a prophetess, the daughter of
[Phanuel](../ebd/ebd292.htm#004), of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004)
of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) years from her virginity;  

<span id="037">37</span> And she was a widow of about fourscore and four
years, which departed not from the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), but
served God with fastings and prayers night and day.  

<span id="038">38</span> And she coming in that instant gave thanks
likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for
[redemption](../ebd/ebd308.htm#009) in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="039">39</span> And when they had performed all things
according to the law of the Lord, they returned into
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008), to their own city
[Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007).  

<span id="040">40</span> And the child grew, and waxed strong in
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), filled with wisdom: and the
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) of God was upon him.  

<span id="041">41</span> Now his parents went to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) every year at the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005).  

<span id="042">42</span> And when he was twelve years old, they went up
to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) after the
[custom](../ebd/ebd094.htm#008) of the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000).  

<span id="043">43</span> And when they had fulfilled the days, as they
returned, the child [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) tarried behind in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005); and [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005)
and his mother knew not of it.  

<span id="044">44</span> But they, supposing him to have been in the
company, went a day's [journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001); and they sought
him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.  

<span id="045">45</span> And when they found him not, they turned back
again to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), seeking him.  

<span id="046">46</span> And it came to pass, that after three days they
found him in the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004),
[sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009) in the midst of the doctors, both
hearing them, and asking them questions.  

<span id="047">47</span> And all that heard him were astonished at his
understanding and answers.  

<span id="048">48</span> And when they saw him, they were amazed: and
his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold,
thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.  

<span id="049">49</span> And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought
me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?  

<span id="050">50</span> And they understood not the saying which he
spake unto them.  

<span id="051">51</span> And he went down with them, and came to
[Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007), and was subject unto them: but his
mother kept all these sayings in her heart.  

<span id="052">52</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) increased in
wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.
