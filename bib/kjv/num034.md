### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 34

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Command the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and say unto them, When ye come into
the land of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md); (this is the land that
shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005) with the coasts thereof:.md)  

<span id="003">3</span> Then your south quarter shall be from the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Zin](../ebd/ebd394.htm#000.md)
along by the coast of [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md), and your south
border shall be the outmost coast of the [salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008.md)
sea eastward:  

<span id="004">4</span> And your border shall turn from the south to the
ascent of [Akrabbim](../ebd/ebd016.htm#004.md), and pass on to
[Zin](../ebd/ebd394.htm#000.md): and the going forth thereof shall be from
the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar, and pass on to
Azmon:  

<span id="005">5</span> And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon
unto the river of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and the goings out of
it shall be at the sea.  

<span id="006">6</span> And as for the western border, ye shall even
have the great sea for a border: this shall be your west border.  

<span id="007">7</span> And this shall be your north border: from the
great sea ye shall point out for you [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Hor](../ebd/ebd181.htm#008.md):  

<span id="008">8</span> From [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Hor](../ebd/ebd181.htm#008.md) ye shall point out your border unto the
entrance of [Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005.md); and the goings forth of the
border shall be to [Zedad](../ebd/ebd389.htm#007.md):  

<span id="009">9</span> And the border shall go on to
[Ziphron](../ebd/ebd394.htm#006.md), and the goings out of it shall be at
Hazarenan: this shall be your north border.  

<span id="010">10</span> And ye shall point out your
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) border from Hazarenan to
[Shepham](../ebd/ebd335.htm#004.md):  

<span id="011">11</span> And the coast shall go down from
[Shepham](../ebd/ebd335.htm#004) to [Riblah](../ebd/ebd313.htm#002.md), on
the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) side of Ain; and the border shall
descend, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of
[Chinnereth](../ebd/ebd081.htm#000.md) eastward:  

<span id="012">12</span> And the border shall go down to
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), and the goings out of it shall be at
the [salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008.md) sea: this shall be your land with the
coasts thereof round about.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) commanded
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), saying, This is the
land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give
