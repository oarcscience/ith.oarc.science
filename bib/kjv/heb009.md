### King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> Then verily the first
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) had also ordinances of divine service,
and a worldly [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> For there was a
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) made; the first, wherein was the
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md), and the table, and the
[shewbread](../ebd/ebd336.htm#008.md); which is called the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And after the second
[veil](../ebd/ebd377.htm#001), the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md)
which is called the Holiest of all;  

<span id="004">4</span> Which had the golden
[censer](../ebd/ebd075.htm#002), and the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of
the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) overlaid round about with
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), wherein was the golden pot that had
[manna](../ebd/ebd240.htm#006.md), and Aaron's rod that budded, and the
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006.md) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md);  

<span id="005">5</span> And over it the cherubims of
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) shadowing the mercyseat; of which we
cannot now speak particularly.  

<span id="006">6</span> Now when these things were thus ordained, the
priests went always into the first [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md),
accomplishing the service of God.  

<span id="007">7</span> But into the second went the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) alone once every year, not without
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), which he offered for himself, and for
the errors of the people:  

<span id="008">8</span> The Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md) this
signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made
manifest, while as the first [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) was yet
standing:  

<span id="009">9</span> Which was a figure for the time then present, in
which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him
that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the
[conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006.md);  

<span id="010">10</span> Which stood only in meats and drinks, and
divers washings, and [carnal](../ebd/ebd072.htm#008.md) ordinances, imposed
on them until the time of reformation.  

<span id="011">11</span> But [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) being come
an high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) of good things to come, by a
greater and more perfect [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), not made
with hands, that is to say, not of this building;  

<span id="012">12</span> Neither by the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md)
of goats and calves, but by his own [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) he
entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal
[redemption](../ebd/ebd308.htm#009.md) for us.  

<span id="013">13</span> For if the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of
bulls and of goats, and the [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000.md) of an
[heifer](../ebd/ebd171.htm#006.md) sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to
the purifying of the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md):  

<span id="014">14</span> How much more shall the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), who
through the eternal [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) offered himself
without spot to God, purge your [conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006.md) from
dead works to serve the living God?  

<span id="015">15</span> And for this cause he is the
[mediator](../ebd/ebd246.htm#002.md) of the new
[testament](../ebd/ebd362.htm#007.md), that by means of death, for the
[redemption](../ebd/ebd308.htm#009.md) of the transgressions that were
under the first [testament](../ebd/ebd362.htm#007.md), they which are
called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.  

<span id="016">16</span> For where a [testament](../ebd/ebd362.htm#007.md)
is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.  

<span id="017">17</span> For a [testament](../ebd/ebd362.htm#007.md) is of
force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while
the testator liveth.  

<span id="018">18</span> Whereupon neither the first
[testament](../ebd/ebd362.htm#007.md) was dedicated without
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> For when [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) had
spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of calves and of goats, with water, and
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005) [wool](../ebd/ebd383.htm#005.md), and
[hyssop](../ebd/ebd185.htm#007.md), and sprinkled both the book, and all
the people,  

<span id="020">20</span> Saying, This is the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the [testament](../ebd/ebd362.htm#007.md)
which God hath enjoined unto you.  

<span id="021">21</span> Moreover he sprinkled with
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) both the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), and all the vessels of the
ministry.  

<span id="022">22</span> And almost all things are by the law purged
with [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md); and without shedding of
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) is no remission.  

<span id="023">23</span> It was therefore necessary that the patterns of
things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly
things themselves with better sacrifices than these.  

<span id="024">24</span> For [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) is not
entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of
the true; but into [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) itself, now to appear
in the presence of God for us:  

<span id="025">25</span> Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as
the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) entereth into the holy place
every year with [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of others;  

<span id="026">26</span> For then must he often have suffered since the
foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he
appeared to put away [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) by the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) of himself.  

<span id="027">27</span> And as it is appointed unto men once to die,
but after this the judgment:  

<span id="028">28</span> So [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) was once
offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall
he appear the second time without [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) unto
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md).
