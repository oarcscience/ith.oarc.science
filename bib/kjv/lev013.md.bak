### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md),
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> When a man shall have in the skin of his
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it
be in the skin of his [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) like the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) of [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md);
then he shall be brought unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), or unto one of his sons the priests:  

<span id="003">3</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
look on the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) in the skin of the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md): and when the hair in the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) is turned white, and the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) in sight be deeper than the skin of his
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), it is a [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md)
of [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md): and the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall look on him, and pronounce him
unclean.  

<span id="004">4</span> If the bright spot be white in the skin of his
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), and in sight be not deeper than the
skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall shut up him that hath the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days:  

<span id="005">5</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) in his sight be at a stay, and the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) spread not in the skin; then the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall shut him up
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days more:  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, if the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) be somewhat dark, and the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) spread not in the skin, the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall pronounce him
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md): it is but a scab: and he shall wash his
clothes, and be [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin,
after that he hath been seen of the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) for
his cleansing, he shall be seen of the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
again.  

<span id="008">8</span> And if the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) see
that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall pronounce him unclean: it is a
[leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> When the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) of
[leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md) is in a man, then he shall be brought
unto the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md);  

<span id="010">10</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
see him: and, behold, if the rising be white in the skin, and it have
turned the hair white, and there be quick raw
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) in the rising;  

<span id="011">11</span> It is an old [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md)
in the skin of his [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), and the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall pronounce him unclean, and shall
not shut him up: for he is unclean.  

<span id="012">12</span> And if a [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md) break
out abroad in the skin, and the [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md) cover
all the skin of him that hath the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) from
his head even to his foot, wheresoever the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) looketh;  

<span id="013">13</span> Then the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
consider: and, behold, if the [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md) have
covered all his [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), he shall pronounce him
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) that hath the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md): it is all turned white: he is
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> But when raw [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md)
appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
see the raw [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), and pronounce him to be
unclean: for the raw [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) is unclean: it is a
[leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> Or if the raw [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md)
turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md);  

<span id="017">17</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
see him: and, behold, if the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) be turned
into white; then the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall pronounce him
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) that hath the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001): he is [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> The [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) also, in
which, even in the skin thereof, was a [boil](../ebd/ebd061.htm#008.md),
and is healed,  

<span id="019">19</span> And in the place of the
[boil](../ebd/ebd061.htm#008.md) there be a white rising, or a bright spot,
white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md);  

<span id="020">20</span> And if, when the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower
than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall pronounce him unclean: it is a
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) of [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md)
broken out of the [boil](../ebd/ebd061.htm#008.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> But if the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) look
on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and if it be not
lower than the skin, but be somewhat dark; then the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall shut him up
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days:  

<span id="022">22</span> And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then
the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall pronounce him unclean: it is a
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> But if the bright spot stay in his place, and
spread not, it is a burning [boil](../ebd/ebd061.htm#008.md); and the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall pronounce him
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> Or if there be any
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), in the skin whereof there is a hot
burning, and the quick [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) that burneth have
a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white;  

<span id="025">25</span> Then the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
look upon it: and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned
white, and it be in sight deeper than the skin; it is a
[leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md) broken out of the burning: wherefore
the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall pronounce him unclean: it is
the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) of
[leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> But if the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) look
on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be
no lower than the other skin, but be somewhat dark; then the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall shut him up
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days:  

<span id="027">27</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
look upon him the seventh day: and if it be spread much abroad in the
skin, then the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall pronounce him
unclean: it is the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) of
[leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> And if the bright spot stay in his place, and
spread not in the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the
burning, and the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall pronounce him
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md): for it is an inflammation of the
burning.  

<span id="029">29</span> If a man or woman have a

<span id="030">30</span> Then the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
see the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md): and, behold, if it be in sight
deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair; then the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry
scall, even a [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md) upon the head or

<span id="031">31</span> And if the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) look
on the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) of the scall, and, behold, it be
not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black hair in
it; then the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall shut up him that hath

[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days:  

<span id="032">32</span> And in the seventh day the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall look on the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md): and, behold, if the scall spread not,
and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper
than the skin;  

<span id="033">33</span> He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not
shave; and the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall shut up him that

[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md);  

<span id="044">44</span> He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the

[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) is in his head.  

<span id="045">45</span> And the leper in whom the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) is, his clothes shall be
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md), and his head bare, and he shall put a

Unclean, unclean.  

<span id="046">46</span> All the days wherein the

[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md) be.  

<span id="047">47</span> The garment also that the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) of [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md) is
in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md)
garment;  

<span id="048">48</span> Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md), or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in
any thing made of skin;  

<span id="049">49</span> And if the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) be
greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp,
or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) of [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md), and
shall be shewed unto the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md):  

<span id="050">50</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
look upon the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md), and shut up it that hath
the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
days:  

<span id="051">51</span> And he shall look on the

[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) be spread in the garment, either in the
warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin;
the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) is a fretting
[leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md); it is unclean.  

<span id="052">52</span> He shall therefore burn that garment, whether
warp or woof, in woollen or in [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md), or any
thing of skin, wherein the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) is: for it is
a fretting [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md); it shall be burnt in the
fire.  

<span id="053">53</span> And if the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
shall look, and, behold, the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) be not
spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any
thing of skin;  

<span id="054">54</span> Then the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
command that they wash the thing wherein the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) is, and he shall shut it up
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days more:  

<span id="055">55</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall

and, behold, if the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) have not changed his
[colour](../ebd/ebd086.htm#008), and the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md)
be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret
inward, whether it be bare within or without.  

<span id="056">56</span> And if the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
look, and, behold, the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) be somewhat dark
after the [washing](../ebd/ebd379.htm#002.md) of it; then he shall rend it
out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of
the woof:  

<span id="057">57</span> And if it appear still in the garment, either
in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md): thou shalt burn that wherein the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) is with fire.  

<span id="058">58</span> And the garment, either warp, or woof, or
whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) be departed from them, then it shall be
washed the second time, and shall be [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md).  

<span id="059">59</span> This is the law of the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) of [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md) in a
garment of woollen or [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md), either in the
warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md), or to pronounce it unclean.
