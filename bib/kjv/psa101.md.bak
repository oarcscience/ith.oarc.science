### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 101

<span id="001">1</span> I will sing of [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md)
and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing.  

<span id="002">2</span> I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O
when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect
heart.  

<span id="003">3</span> I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I
hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.  

<span id="004">4</span> A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not
know a wicked person.  

<span id="005">5</span> Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will
I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I
suffer.  

<span id="006">6</span> Mine eyes shall be upon the
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md) of the land, that they may dwell with
me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.  

<span id="007">7</span> He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my
house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.  

<span id="008">8</span> I will early destroy all the wicked of the land;
that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.
