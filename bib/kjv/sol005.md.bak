### King James Version: Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> I am come into my garden, my sister, my
[spouse](../ebd/ebd350.htm#002.md): I have gathered my
[myrrh](../ebd/ebd263.htm#003.md) with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb
with my [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md); I have
[drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007) my [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) with my
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000.md): eat, O friends;
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), yea, [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md)
abundantly, O beloved.  

<span id="002">2</span> I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of
my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my
[dove](../ebd/ebd106.htm#007.md), my undefiled: for my head is filled with
[dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md), and my locks with the drops of the
night.  

<span id="003">3</span> I have put off my [coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004.md);
how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?  

<span id="004">4</span> My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the
door, and my [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004.md) were moved for him.  

<span id="005">5</span> I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands
dropped with [myrrh](../ebd/ebd263.htm#003.md), and my fingers with sweet
smelling [myrrh](../ebd/ebd263.htm#003.md), upon the handles of the
[lock](../ebd/ebd230.htm#009.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had
withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought
him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.  

<span id="007">7</span> The watchmen that went about the city found me,
they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my
[veil](../ebd/ebd377.htm#001.md) from me.  

<span id="008">8</span> I charge you, O daughters of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), if ye find my beloved, that ye tell
him, that I am sick of love.  

<span id="009">9</span> What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O
thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved,
that thou dost so charge us?  

<span id="010">10</span> My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest
among ten thousand.  

<span id="011">11</span> His head is as the most fine
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), his locks are bushy, and black as a
[raven](../ebd/ebd307.htm#008.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers
of waters, washed with [milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000.md), and fitly set.  

<span id="013">13</span> His cheeks are as a bed of
[spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005.md), as sweet
[flowers](../ebd/ebd136.htm#002.md): his lips like lilies, dropping sweet
smelling [myrrh](../ebd/ebd263.htm#003.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> His hands are as [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md)
rings set with the [beryl](../ebd/ebd053.htm#008.md): his
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000.md) is as bright
[ivory](../ebd/ebd192.htm#000.md) overlaid with sapphires.  

<span id="015">15</span> His legs are as pillars of
[marble](../ebd/ebd241.htm#006.md), set upon sockets of fine
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md): his countenance is as
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md), excellent as the cedars.  

<span id="016">16</span> His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether
lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).
