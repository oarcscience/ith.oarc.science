### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) was old,
and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) in all things.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) said unto
his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I
pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:  

<span id="003">3</span> And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God
of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and the God of the earth, that thou
shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007.md), among whom I dwell:  

<span id="004">4</span> But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my
kindred, and take a wife unto my son [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the
woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs
bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) said unto
him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.  

<span id="007">7</span> The LORD God of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md),
which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred,
and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed
will I give this land; he shall send his [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md)
before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.  

<span id="008">8</span> And if the woman will not be willing to follow
thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md): only bring not my son thither again.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the servant put his hand under the thigh of
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) his master, and sware to him concerning
that matter.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the servant took ten camels of the camels
of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his
hand: and he arose, and went to [Mesopotamia](../ebd/ebd251.htm#003.md),
unto the city of [Nahor](../ebd/ebd265.htm#006.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And he made his camels to kneel down without
the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time
that women go out to draw water.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he said O LORD God of my master
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), I pray thee, send me good speed this
day, and shew kindness unto my master
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and
the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:  

<span id="014">14</span> And let it come to pass, that the damsel to
whom I shall say, Let down thy [pitcher](../ebd/ebd296.htm#009.md), I pray
thee, that I may [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md); and she shall say,
[Drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), and I will give thy camels
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) also: let the same be she that thou hast
appointed for thy servant [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md); and thereby
shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.  

<span id="015">15</span> And it came to pass, before he had done
speaking, that, behold, [Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md) came out, who
was born to [Bethuel](../ebd/ebd057.htm#003.md), son of Milcah, the wife of
[Nahor](../ebd/ebd265.htm#006.md), Abraham's brother, with her
[pitcher](../ebd/ebd296.htm#009.md) upon her shoulder.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a
[virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009.md), neither had any man known her: and she
went down to the well, and filled her [pitcher](../ebd/ebd296.htm#009.md),
and came up.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let
me, I pray thee, [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) a little water of thy
[pitcher](../ebd/ebd296.htm#009.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And she said, [Drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md),
my lord: and she hasted, and let down her
[pitcher](../ebd/ebd296.htm#009.md) upon her hand, and gave him
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And when she had done giving him
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), she said, I will draw water for thy
camels also, until they have done drinking.  

<span id="020">20</span> And she hasted, and emptied her
[pitcher](../ebd/ebd296.htm#009.md) into the trough, and ran again unto the
well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the man wondering at her held his peace, to
wit whether the LORD had made his [journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md)
prosperous or not.  

<span id="022">22</span> And it came to pass, as the camels had done
drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a
[shekel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#009.md) weight, and two bracelets for her hands
of ten shekels weight of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md);  

<span id="023">23</span> And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I
pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to
[lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002.md) in?  

<span id="024">24</span> And she said unto him, I am the daughter of
[Bethuel](../ebd/ebd057.htm#003.md) the son of Milcah, which she bare unto
[Nahor](../ebd/ebd265.htm#006.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> She said moreover unto him, We have both
[straw](../ebd/ebd352.htm#000.md) and provender enough, and room to
[lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002.md) in.  

<span id="026">26</span> And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped
the LORD.  

<span id="027">27</span> And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my
master [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), who hath not left destitute my
master of his [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) and his truth: I being in
the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.  

<span id="028">28</span> And the damsel ran, and told them of her
mother's house these things.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md) had a
brother, and his name was [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md): and
[Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md) ran out unto the man, unto the well.  

<span id="030">30</span> And it came to pass, when he saw the earring
and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of
[Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md) his sister, saying, Thus spake the man
unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels
at the well.  

<span id="031">31</span> And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD;
wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room
for the camels.  

<span id="032">32</span> And the man came into the house: and he
ungirded his camels, and gave [straw](../ebd/ebd352.htm#000.md) and
provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet
that were with him.  

<span id="033">33</span> And there was set meat before him to eat: but
he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said,
Speak on.  

<span id="034">34</span> And he said, I am Abraham's servant.  

<span id="035">35</span> And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly;
and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and
menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.  

<span id="036">36</span> And [Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md) my master's
wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he
given all that he hath.  

<span id="037">37</span> And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt
not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007.md), in whose land I dwell:  

<span id="038">38</span> But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and
to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.  

<span id="039">39</span> And I said unto my master, Peradventure the
woman will not follow me.  

<span id="040">40</span> And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I
walk, will send his [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) with thee, and
prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred,
and of my father's house:  

<span id="041">41</span> Then shalt thou be clear from this my
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md), when thou comest to my kindred; and if
they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md).  

<span id="042">42</span> And I came this day unto the well, and said, O
LORD God of my master [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), if now thou do
prosper my way which I go:  

<span id="043">43</span> Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it
shall come to pass, that when the [virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009.md) cometh
forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little
water of thy [pitcher](../ebd/ebd296.htm#009.md) to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md);  

<span id="044">44</span> And she say to me, Both
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) thou, and I will also draw for thy
camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for
my master's son.  

<span id="045">45</span> And before I had done speaking in mine heart,
behold, [Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md) came forth with her
[pitcher](../ebd/ebd296.htm#009.md) on her shoulder; and she went down unto
the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), I pray thee.  

<span id="046">46</span> And she made haste, and let down her
[pitcher](../ebd/ebd296.htm#009.md) from her shoulder, and said,
[Drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), and I will give thy camels
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) also: so I drank, and she made the camels
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) also.  

<span id="047">47</span> And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art
thou? And she said, the daughter of [Bethuel](../ebd/ebd057.htm#003.md),
Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her
face, and the bracelets upon her hands.  

<span id="048">48</span> And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the
LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), which had led me in the right way to
take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.  

<span id="049">49</span> And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with
my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right
hand, or to the left.  

<span id="050">50</span> Then [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md) and
[Bethuel](../ebd/ebd057.htm#003.md) answered and said, The thing proceedeth
from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.  

<span id="051">51</span> Behold, [Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md) is
before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife,
as the LORD hath spoken.  

<span id="052">52</span> And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's
servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD,
[bowing](../ebd/ebd063.htm#005.md) himself to the earth.  

<span id="053">53</span> And the servant brought forth jewels of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and jewels of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and raiment, and gave them to
[Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md): he gave also to her brother and to her
mother precious things.  

<span id="054">54</span> And they did eat and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), he and the men that were with him, and
tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me
away unto my master.  

<span id="055">55</span> And her brother and her mother said, Let the
damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall
go.  

<span id="056">56</span> And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing
the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my
master.  

<span id="057">57</span> And they said, We will call the damsel, and
enquire at her mouth.  

<span id="058">58</span> And they called
[Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md), and said unto her, Wilt thou go with
this man? And she said, I will go.  

<span id="059">59</span> And they sent away
[Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md) their sister, and her nurse, and
Abraham's servant, and his men.  

<span id="060">60</span> And they blessed
[Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md), and said unto her, Thou art our
sister, be thou the mother of [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md) of
millions, and let thy seed possess the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) of
those which hate them.  

<span id="061">61</span> And [Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md) arose, and
her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and
the servant took [Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md), and went his way.  

<span id="062">62</span> And [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) came from
the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country.  

<span id="063">63</span> And [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) went out to
meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and
saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.  

<span id="064">64</span> And [Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md) lifted up
her eyes, and when she saw [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md), she lighted
off the [camel](../ebd/ebd070.htm#000.md).  

<span id="065">65</span> For she had said unto the servant, What man is
this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It
is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.  

<span id="066">66</span> And the servant told
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) all things that he had done.  

<span id="067">67</span> And [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) brought her
into his mother Sarah's [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md), and took
[Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md), and she became his wife; and he loved
her: and [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) was comforted after his mother's
death.
