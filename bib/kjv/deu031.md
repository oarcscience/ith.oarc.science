### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 31

<span id="001">1</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) went and
spake these words unto all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he said unto them, I am an hundred and
twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the
LORD hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee,
and he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt
possess them: and [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), he shall go over
before thee, as the LORD hath said.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to
[Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002) and to [Og](../ebd/ebd277.htm#002.md), kings
of the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md), and unto the land of them,
whom he destroyed.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the LORD shall give them up before your
face, that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which
I have commanded you.  

<span id="006">6</span> Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor
be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with
thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) called unto
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), and said unto him in the sight of all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), Be strong and of a good courage: for
thou must go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn
unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit
it.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee;
he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear
not, neither be dismayed.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) wrote this
law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006.md), which bare the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of
the LORD, and unto all the elders of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) commanded
them, saying, At the end of every [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) years,
in the solemnity of the year of release, in the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) of tabernacles,  

<span id="011">11</span> When all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) is
come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall
choose, thou shalt read this law before all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) in their hearing.  

<span id="012">12</span> Gather the people together, men and women, and
children, and thy [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) that is within thy
gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD
your God, and observe to do all the words of this law:  

<span id="013">13</span> And that their children, which have not known
any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye
live in the land whither ye go over [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) to
possess it.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Behold, thy days approach that thou must
die: call [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), and present yourselves in the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), that I may give him a charge. And
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) went,
and presented themselves in the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of
the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And the LORD appeared in the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) in a [pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md)
of a [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md): and the
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007) of the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md)
stood over the door of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy
fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods
of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will
forsake me, and break my [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) which I have
made with them.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then my [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) shall be
kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will
hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and
troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not
these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us?  

<span id="018">18</span> And I will surely hide my face in that day for
all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned
unto other gods.  

<span id="019">19</span> Now therefore write ye this song for you, and
teach it the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): put it in
their mouths, that this song may be a [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md)
for me against the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> For when I shall have brought them into the
land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000) and [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md); and
they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md); then will they turn unto other gods, and
serve them, and provoke me, and break my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And it shall come to pass, when many evils and
troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as
a [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md); for it shall not be forgotten out of
the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go
about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I
sware.  

<span id="022">22</span> [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) therefore wrote
this song the same day, and taught it the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And he gave [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) the
son of [Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006.md) a charge, and said, Be strong and of
a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) into the land which I sware unto them:
and I will be with thee.  

<span id="024">24</span> And it came to pass, when
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) had made an end of
[writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005.md) the words of this law in a book, until
they were finished,  

<span id="025">25</span> That [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) commanded
the Levites, which bare the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of the LORD, saying,  

<span id="026">26</span> Take this book of the law, and put it in the
side of the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of the LORD your God, that it may be
there for a [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) against thee.  

<span id="027">27</span> For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md): behold, while I am yet alive with you
this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more
after my death?  

<span id="028">28</span> Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes,
and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) and earth to record against them.  

<span id="029">29</span> For I know that after my death ye will utterly
corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded
you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do
evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) through the work of your hands.  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) spake in the
ears of all the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) the words of this song, until they were
ended.
