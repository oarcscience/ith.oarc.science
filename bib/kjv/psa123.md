### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 123

<span id="001">1</span> Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that
dwellest in the heavens.  

<span id="002">2</span> Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the
hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her
mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) upon us.  

<span id="003">3</span> Have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) upon us, O
LORD, have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) upon us: for we are
exceedingly filled with contempt.  

<span id="004">4</span> Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning
of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.
