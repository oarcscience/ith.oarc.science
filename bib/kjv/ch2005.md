### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Thus all the work that
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) made for the house of the LORD was
finished: and [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) brought in all the things
that [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) his father had dedicated; and the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md),
and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of
God.  

<span id="002">2</span> Then [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) assembled
the elders of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and all the heads of the
tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), unto
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), to bring up the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of
the LORD out of the city of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), which is
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> Wherefore all the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) assembled themselves unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) in the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md)
which was in the seventh month.  

<span id="004">4</span> And all the elders of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) came; and the Levites took up the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And they brought up the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md), and the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), and all the holy vessels that
were in the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), these did the priests
and the Levites bring up.  

<span id="006">6</span> Also [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), and all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
that were assembled unto him before the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md),
sacrificed [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) and oxen, which could not be
told nor numbered for multitude.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the priests brought in the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of
the LORD unto his place, to the [oracle](../ebd/ebd280.htm#000.md) of the
house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the
cherubims:  

<span id="008">8</span> For the cherubims spread forth their wings over
the place of the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md), and the cherubims covered
the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) and the staves thereof above.  

<span id="009">9</span> And they drew out the staves of the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md), that the ends of the staves were seen from
the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) before the
[oracle](../ebd/ebd280.htm#000.md); but they were not seen without. And
there it is unto this day.  

<span id="010">10</span> There was nothing in the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) save the two
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) which [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) put
therein at [Horeb](../ebd/ebd181.htm#009.md), when the LORD made a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), when they came out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And it came to pass, when the priests were come
out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were
sanctified, and did not then wait by course:  

<span id="012">12</span> Also the Levites which were the singers, all of
them of [Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002.md), of
[Heman](../ebd/ebd173.htm#009), of [Jeduthun](../ebd/ebd199.htm#009.md),
with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), having [cymbals](../ebd/ebd095.htm#001.md)
and psalteries and harps, stood at the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) end
of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), and with them an hundred and
twenty priests sounding with [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001):.md)  

<span id="013">13</span> It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and
singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and
thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001) and [cymbals](../ebd/ebd095.htm#001.md)
and instruments of musick, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good;
for his [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) endureth for ever: that then the
house was filled with a [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md), even the house
of the LORD;  

<span id="014">14</span> So that the priests could not stand to
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) by reason of the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001): for the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md)
of the LORD had filled the house of God.
