### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 37

<span id="001">1</span> And [Bezaleel](../ebd/ebd057.htm#009) made the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of [shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009)
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003): two cubits and a half was the length of
it, and a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006) and a half the breadth of it,
and a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006) and a half the height of it:  

<span id="002">2</span> And he overlaid it with pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) within and without, and made a
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) to it
round about.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he cast for it four rings of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), to be set by the four corners of it; even
two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of
it.  

<span id="004">4</span> And he made staves of
[shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and
overlaid them with [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="005">5</span> And he put the staves into the rings by the
sides of the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000), to bear the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000).  

<span id="006">6</span> And he made the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005)
seat of pure [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001): two cubits and a half was
the length thereof, and one [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006) and a half
the breadth thereof.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he made two cherubims of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), beaten out of one piece made he them, on
the two ends of the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) seat;  

<span id="008">8</span> One [cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003) on the end
on this side, and another [cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003) on the other
end on that side: out of the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) seat made he
the cherubims on the two ends thereof.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the cherubims spread out their wings on
high, and covered with their wings over the
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) seat, with their faces one to another;
even to the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) seatward were the faces of
the cherubims.  

<span id="010">10</span> And he made the table of
[shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003): two
cubits was the length thereof, and a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006) the
breadth thereof, and a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006) and a half the
height thereof:  

<span id="011">11</span> And he overlaid it with pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and made thereunto a
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) round
about.  

<span id="012">12</span> Also he made thereunto a border of an
[handbreadth](../ebd/ebd162.htm#006) round about; and made a
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) for the
border thereof round about.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he cast for it four rings of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and put the rings upon the four corners
that were in the four feet thereof.  

<span id="014">14</span> Over against the border were the rings, the
places for the staves to bear the table.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he made the staves of
[shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and
overlaid them with [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), to bear the table.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he made the vessels which were upon the
table, his dishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to
cover withal, of pure [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="017">17</span> And he made the
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001) of pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001): of beaten work made he the
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001); his shaft, and his
[branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002), his bowls, his knops, and his
[flowers](../ebd/ebd136.htm#002), were of the same:  

<span id="018">18</span> And six branches going out of the sides
thereof; three branches of the [candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001) out
of the one side thereof, and three branches of the
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001) out of the other side thereof:  

<span id="019">19</span> Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds
in one [branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002), a [knop](../ebd/ebd221.htm#009)
and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another
[branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002), a [knop](../ebd/ebd221.htm#009) and a
flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001).  

<span id="020">20</span> And in the [candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001)
were four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his
[flowers](../ebd/ebd136.htm#002):  

<span id="021">21</span> And a [knop](../ebd/ebd221.htm#009) under two
branches of the same, and a [knop](../ebd/ebd221.htm#009) under two
branches of the same, and a [knop](../ebd/ebd221.htm#009) under two
branches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it.  

<span id="022">22</span> Their knops and their branches were of the
same: all of it was one beaten work of pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="023">23</span> And he made his [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
lamps, and his snuffers, and his snuffdishes, of pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="024">24</span> Of a [talent](../ebd/ebd357.htm#009) of pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) made he it, and all the vessels thereof.  

<span id="025">25</span> And he made the
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of
[shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003): the
length of it was a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006), and the breadth of it
a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006); it was foursquare; and two cubits was
the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same.  

<span id="026">26</span> And he overlaid it with pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), both the top of it, and the sides thereof
round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) round
about.  

<span id="027">27</span> And he made two rings of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) for it under the
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) thereof, by the two corners of it, upon
the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to bear it withal.  

<span id="028">28</span> And he made the staves of
[shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and
overlaid them with [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="029">29</span> And he made the holy anointing oil, and the
pure [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) of sweet
[spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005), according to the work of the
[apothecary](../ebd/ebd026.htm#009).
