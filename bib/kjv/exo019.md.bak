### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> In the third month, when the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) were gone forth out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), the same day came they into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> For they were departed from
[Rephidim](../ebd/ebd311.htm#002.md), and were come to the
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000) of [Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009.md), and
had pitched in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md); and there
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) camped before the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) went up unto
God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus
shalt thou say to the house of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and tell
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md);  

<span id="004">4</span> Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and
how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.  

<span id="005">5</span> Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed,
and keep my [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md), then ye shall be a
[peculiar](../ebd/ebd287.htm#008.md) treasure unto me above all people: for
all the earth is mine:  

<span id="006">6</span> And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests,
and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) came and
called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all
these words which the LORD commanded him.  

<span id="008">8</span> And all the people answered together, and said,
All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) returned the words of the people unto the
LORD.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Lo, I come unto thee in a thick
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md), that the people may hear when I speak
with thee, and believe thee for ever. And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md)
told the words of the people unto the LORD.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Go unto the people, and sanctify them to
day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,  

<span id="011">11</span> And be ready against the third day: for the
third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round
about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md), or touch the border of it: whosoever
toucheth the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) shall be surely put to
death:  

<span id="013">13</span> There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall
surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) or man, it shall not live: when the
trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) went down
from the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) unto the people, and sanctified
the people; and they washed their clothes.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he said unto the people, Be ready against
the third day: come not at your wives.  

<span id="016">16</span> And it came to pass on the third day in the
morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) upon the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md),
and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that
was in the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md) trembled.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) brought
forth the people out of the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md) to meet with
God; and they stood at the nether part of the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009.md) was altogether on a smoke, because the
LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the
smoke of a [furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000.md), and the whole
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) quaked greatly.  

<span id="019">19</span> And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long,
and waxed louder and louder, [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) spake, and
God answered him by a voice.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the LORD came down upon
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009.md), on the
top of the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md): and the LORD called
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) up to the top of the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007); and [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) went
up.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Go down, charge the people, lest they
break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.  

<span id="022">22</span> And let the priests also, which come near to
the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said unto
the LORD, The people cannot come up to [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009.md): for thou chargedst us, saying, Set
bounds about the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md), and sanctify it.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee
down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md)
with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come
up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.  

<span id="025">25</span> So [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) went down
unto the people, and spake unto them.
