### King James Version: Romans Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> What advantage then hath the
[Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004.md)? or what profit is there of
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007.md)?  

<span id="002">2</span> Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them
were committed the oracles of God.  

<span id="003">3</span> For what if some did not believe? shall their
unbelief make the faith of God without effect?  

<span id="004">4</span> God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man
a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy
sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.  

<span id="005">5</span> But if our unrighteousness commend the
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) of God, what shall we say? Is God
unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)  

<span id="006">6</span> God forbid: for then how shall God
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) the world?  

<span id="007">7</span> For if the truth of God hath more abounded
through my lie unto his [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md); why yet am I
also judged as a sinner?  

<span id="008">8</span> And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported,
and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come?
whose [damnation](../ebd/ebd096.htm#008.md) is just.  

<span id="009">9</span> What then? are we better than they? No, in no
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md): for we have before proved both Jews and
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md), that they are all under
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md);  

<span id="010">10</span> As it is written, There is none righteous, no,
not one:  

<span id="011">11</span> There is none that understandeth, there is none
that seeketh after God.  

<span id="012">12</span> They are all gone out of the way, they are
together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not
one.  

<span id="013">13</span> Their throat is an open
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md); with their tongues they have used
deceit; the [poison](../ebd/ebd297.htm#009.md) of asps is under their
lips:  

<span id="014">14</span> Whose mouth is full of cursing and
bitterness:  

<span id="015">15</span> Their feet are swift to shed
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md):  

<span id="016">16</span> [Destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md) and misery
are in their ways:  

<span id="017">17</span> And the way of peace have they not known:  

<span id="018">18</span> There is no fear of God before their eyes.  

<span id="019">19</span> Now we know that what things soever the law
saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be
stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.  

<span id="020">20</span> Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall
no [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) be justified in his sight: for by the
law is the knowledge of [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> But now the
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) of God without the law is
manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;  

<span id="022">22</span> Even the [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md)
of God which is by faith of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) unto all and upon all them that believe:
for there is no difference:  

<span id="023">23</span> For all have sinned, and come short of the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of God;  

<span id="024">24</span> Being justified freely by his
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) through the
[redemption](../ebd/ebd308.htm#009.md) that is in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md):  

<span id="025">25</span> Whom God hath set forth to be a
[propitiation](../ebd/ebd300.htm#009.md) through faith in his
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), to declare his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) for the remission of sins that
are past, through the forbearance of God;  

<span id="026">26</span> To declare, I say, at this time his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md): that he might be just, and the
justifier of him which believeth in [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what
law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.  

<span id="028">28</span> Therefore we conclude that a man is justified
by faith without the deeds of the law.  

<span id="029">29</span> Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also
of the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md)? Yes, of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) also:  

<span id="030">30</span> Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007.md) by faith, and uncircumcision
through faith.  

<span id="031">31</span> Do we then make void the law through faith? God
forbid: yea, we establish the law.
