### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saying, If a woman have conceived seed,
and born a man child: then she shall be unclean
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days; according to the days of the
separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.  

<span id="003">3</span> And in the eighth day the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) of his foreskin shall be circumcised.  

<span id="004">4</span> And she shall then continue in the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of her purifying three and thirty days;
she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005), until the days of her purifying be
fulfilled.  

<span id="005">5</span> But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be
unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of her purifying threescore and six
days.  

<span id="006">6</span> And when the days of her purifying are
fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a
[lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003) of the first year for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and a young
[pigeon](../ebd/ebd295.htm#004), or a turtledove, for a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), unto the
door of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), unto the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003):  

<span id="007">7</span> Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) for her; and she shall be cleansed
from the issue of her [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000). This is the law
for her that hath born a male or a female.  

<span id="008">8</span> And if she be not able to bring a
[lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003), then she shall bring two turtles, or two
young pigeons; the one for the burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001),
and the other for a [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001): and the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) for her, and she shall be
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005).
