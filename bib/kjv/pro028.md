### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 28

<span id="001">1</span> The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the
righteous are bold as a lion.  

<span id="002">2</span> For the transgression of a land many are the
princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state
thereof shall be prolonged.  

<span id="003">3</span> A [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) man that
oppresseth the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) is like a sweeping
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) which leaveth no food.  

<span id="004">4</span> They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but
such as keep the law contend with them.  

<span id="005">5</span> Evil men understand not judgment: but they that
seek the LORD understand all things.  

<span id="006">6</span> Better is the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) that
walketh in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though
he be rich.  

<span id="007">7</span> Whoso keepeth the law is a
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) son: but he that is a companion of riotous
men shameth his father.  

<span id="008">8</span> He that by [usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006.md) and
unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that
will pity the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> He that turneth away his
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) from hearing the law, even his
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) shall be
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an
evil way, he shall fall himself into his own
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md): but the upright shall have good things in
possession.  

<span id="011">11</span> The rich man is [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md)
in his own conceit; but the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) that hath
understanding searcheth him out.  

<span id="012">12</span> When righteous men do rejoice, there is great
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md): but when the wicked rise, a man is
hidden.  

<span id="013">13</span> He that covereth his sins shall not prosper:
but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he
that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.  

<span id="015">15</span> As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a
wicked ruler over the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) people.  

<span id="016">16</span> The [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) that
wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth
[covetousness](../ebd/ebd092.htm#000.md) shall prolong his days.  

<span id="017">17</span> A man that doeth violence to the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of any person shall flee to the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md); let no man stay him.  

<span id="018">18</span> Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he
that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.  

<span id="019">19</span> He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md): but he that followeth after vain persons
shall have poverty enough.  

<span id="020">20</span> A [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md) man shall
abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be
innocent.  

<span id="021">21</span> To have respect of persons is not good: for for
a piece of [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) that man will transgress.  

<span id="022">22</span> He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye,
and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.  

<span id="023">23</span> He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find
more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.  

<span id="024">24</span> Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and
saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a
[destroyer](../ebd/ebd102.htm#003.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife:
but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool:
but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.  

<span id="027">27</span> He that giveth unto the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) shall not lack: but he that hideth his
eyes shall have many a [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but
when they perish, the righteous increase.
