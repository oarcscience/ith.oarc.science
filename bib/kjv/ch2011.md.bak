### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> And when [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) was
come to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), he gathered of the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md) an
hundred and fourscore thousand [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) men,
which were warriors, to fight against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
that he might bring the kingdom again to
[Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> But the word of the LORD came to
[Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005.md) the man of God, saying,  

<span id="003">3</span> Speak unto [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) the
son of [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007), [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and to all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md), saying,  

<span id="004">4</span> Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor
fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this
thing is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned
from going against [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) dwelt in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and built cities for defence in
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> He built even
[Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005), and [Etam](../ebd/ebd125.htm#008.md),
and Tekoa,  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Bethzur](../ebd/ebd057.htm#004.md), and
[Shoco](../ebd/ebd340.htm#008), and [Adullam](../ebd/ebd010.htm#007.md),  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009.md), and
[Mareshah](../ebd/ebd241.htm#009), and [Ziph](../ebd/ebd394.htm#004.md),  

<span id="009">9</span> And Adoraim, and
[Lachish](../ebd/ebd222.htm#009), and [Azekah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#008.md),  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Zorah](../ebd/ebd396.htm#002.md), and
Aijalon, and [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004.md), which are in
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and in [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md)
fenced cities.  

<span id="011">11</span> And he fortified the strong holds, and put
captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And in every several city he put shields and
spears, and made them exceeding strong, having
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md) on
his side.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the priests and the Levites that were in
all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) resorted to him out of all their
coasts.  

<span id="014">14</span> For the Levites left their
[suburbs](../ebd/ebd352.htm#007.md) and their possession, and came to
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md):
for [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) and his sons had cast them off
from executing the priest's office unto the LORD:  

<span id="015">15</span> And he ordained him priests for the high
places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.  

<span id="016">16</span> And after them out of all the tribes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) such as set their hearts to seek the
LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) came to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), to
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) unto the LORD God of their fathers.  

<span id="017">17</span> So they strengthened the kingdom of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and made
[Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) the son of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) strong, three years: for three years
they walked in the way of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) and
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) took him
[Mahalath](../ebd/ebd237.htm#002.md) the daughter of
[Jerimoth](../ebd/ebd203.htm#009.md) the son of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) to wife, and
[Abihail](../ebd/ebd003.htm#003.md) the daughter of
[Eliab](../ebd/ebd115.htm#008.md) the son of
[Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005.md);  

<span id="019">19</span> Which bare him children;
[Jeush](../ebd/ebd206.htm#003.md), and Shamariah, and Zaham.  

<span id="020">20</span> And after her he took
[Maachah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#004.md) the daughter of
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md); which bare him
[Abijah](../ebd/ebd003.htm#006.md), and Attai, and
[Ziza](../ebd/ebd395.htm#001.md), and Shelomith.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) loved
[Maachah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#004.md) the daughter of
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) above all his wives and his concubines:
(for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and begat twenty
and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) made
[Abijah](../ebd/ebd003.htm#006.md) the son of
[Maachah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#004.md) the chief, to be ruler among his
brethren: for he thought to make him [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his
children throughout all the countries of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)
and [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md), unto every fenced city: and he
gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives.
