### King James Version: Acts Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> Then said the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), Are these things so?  

<span id="002">2</span> And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers,
hearken; The God of [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) appeared unto our
father [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), when he was in
[Mesopotamia](../ebd/ebd251.htm#003), before he dwelt in
[Charran](../ebd/ebd078.htm#001),  

<span id="003">3</span> And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country,
and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans,
and dwelt in [Charran](../ebd/ebd078.htm#001): and from thence, when his
father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not
so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to
him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no
child.  

<span id="006">6</span> And God spake on this
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), That his seed should sojourn in a strange
land; and that they should bring them into
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002), and entreat them evil four hundred
years.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the nation to whom they shall be in
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002) will I [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005),
said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this
place.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he gave him the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007): and so
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) begat [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006),
and circumcised him the eighth day; and [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006)
begat [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007); and [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007)
begat the twelve patriarchs.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) into [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009): but
God was with him,  

<span id="010">10</span> And delivered him out of all his
[afflictions](../ebd/ebd011.htm#006), and gave him favour and wisdom in
the sight of [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009); and he
made him governor over [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) and all his
house.  

<span id="011">11</span> Now there came a
[dearth](../ebd/ebd099.htm#005) over all the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) and Chanaan, and great affliction: and
our fathers found no sustenance.  

<span id="012">12</span> But when [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) heard
that there was [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), he sent out our fathers first.  

<span id="013">13</span> And at the second time
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) was made known to his brethren; and
Joseph's kindred was made known unto [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005).  

<span id="014">14</span> Then sent [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), and
called his father [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) to him, and all his
kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.  

<span id="015">15</span> So [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) went down
into [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and died, he, and our fathers,  

<span id="016">16</span> And were carried over into
[Sychem](../ebd/ebd354.htm#007), and laid in the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001) that [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005)
bought for a sum of money of the sons of [Emmor](../ebd/ebd120.htm#002)
the father of [Sychem](../ebd/ebd354.htm#007).  

<span id="017">17</span> But when the time of the promise drew nigh,
which God had sworn to [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), the people grew
and multiplied in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009),  

<span id="018">18</span> Till another [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
arose, which knew not [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005).  

<span id="019">19</span> The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and
evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children,
to the end they might not live.  

<span id="020">20</span> In which time [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003)
was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house
three months:  

<span id="021">21</span> And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter
took him up, and nourished him for her own son.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) was learned
in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in
deeds.  

<span id="023">23</span> And when he was full forty years old, it came
into his heart to visit his brethren the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="024">24</span> And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he
defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the
Egyptian:  

<span id="025">25</span> For he supposed his brethren would have
understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they
understood not.  

<span id="026">26</span> And the next day he shewed himself unto them as
they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are
brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?  

<span id="027">27</span> But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him
away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005)
over us?  

<span id="028">28</span> Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian
yesterday?  

<span id="029">29</span> Then fled [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) at
this saying, and was a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) in the land of
Madian, where he begat two sons.  

<span id="030">30</span> And when forty years were expired, there
appeared to him in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) Sina an [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of
the Lord in a flame of fire in a [bush](../ebd/ebd067.htm#000).  

<span id="031">31</span> When [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) saw it, he
wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of
the LORD came unto him,  

<span id="032">32</span> Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), and the God of
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006), and the God of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007). Then [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003)
trembled, and durst not behold.  

<span id="033">33</span> Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes
from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.  

<span id="034">34</span> I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my
people which is in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and I have heard
their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will
send thee into [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="035">35</span> This [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) whom they
refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005)? the same did God send to be a ruler and
a deliverer by the hand of the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) which
appeared to him in the [bush](../ebd/ebd067.htm#000).  

<span id="036">36</span> He brought them out, after that he had shewed
wonders and signs in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and in
the Red sea, and in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) forty
years.  

<span id="037">37</span> This is that [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003),
which said unto the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), A
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) shall the Lord your God raise up unto
you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.  

<span id="038">38</span> This is he, that was in the church in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) with the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) which spake to him in the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) Sina, and with our fathers: who received
the lively oracles to give unto us:  

<span id="039">39</span> To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust
him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009),  

<span id="040">40</span> Saying unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001),
Make us gods to go before us: for as for this
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), which brought us out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), we wot not what is become of him.  

<span id="041">41</span> And they made a [calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004)
in those days, and offered [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) unto the
[idol](../ebd/ebd186.htm#006), and rejoiced in the works of their own
hands.  

<span id="042">42</span> Then God turned, and gave them up to
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006); as it is written in the book of the
prophets, O ye house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), have ye offered
to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005)?  

<span id="043">43</span> Yea, ye took up the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of [Moloch](../ebd/ebd259.htm#000),
and the star of your god [Remphan](../ebd/ebd310.htm#006), figures which
ye made to [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) them: and I will carry you
away beyond [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001).  

<span id="044">44</span> Our fathers had the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008)
in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), as he had appointed,
speaking unto [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), that he should make it
according to the fashion that he had seen.  

<span id="045">45</span> Which also our fathers that came after brought
in with [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) into the possession of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001), whom God drave out before the face of
our fathers, unto the days of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004);  

<span id="046">46</span> Who found favour before God, and desired to
find a [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) for the God of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007).  

<span id="047">47</span> But [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) built him
an house.  

<span id="048">48</span> Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples
made with hands; as saith the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008),  

<span id="049">49</span> [Heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) is my
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001), and earth is my
[footstool](../ebd/ebd136.htm#009): what house will ye build me? saith
the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?  

<span id="050">50</span> Hath not my hand made all these things?  

<span id="051">51</span> Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and
ears, ye do always resist the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005): as
your fathers did, so do ye.  

<span id="052">52</span> Which of the prophets have not your fathers
persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming
of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:  

<span id="053">53</span> Who have received the law by the disposition of
angels, and have not kept it.  

<span id="054">54</span> When they heard these things, they were cut to
the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.  

<span id="055">55</span> But he, being full of the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005), looked up stedfastly into
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and saw the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of God, and
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) standing on the right hand of God,  

<span id="056">56</span> And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and
the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.  

<span id="057">57</span> Then they cried out with a loud voice, and
stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,  

<span id="058">58</span> And cast him out of the city, and stoned him:
and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose
name was [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002).  

<span id="059">59</span> And they stoned
[Stephen](../ebd/ebd351.htm#002), [calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007) upon
God, and saying, Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), receive my
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009).  

<span id="060">60</span> And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud
voice, Lord, lay not this [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) to their charge.
And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
