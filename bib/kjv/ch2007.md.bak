### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> Now when [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) had
made an end of praying, the fire came down from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and consumed the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) and the sacrifices; and the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the LORD filled the house.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the priests could not enter into the house
of the LORD, because the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the LORD had
filled the LORD's house.  

<span id="003">3</span> And when all the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) saw how the fire came down, and the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the LORD upon the house, they bowed
themselves with their faces to the ground upon the
[pavement](../ebd/ebd287.htm#003.md), and worshipped, and praised the LORD,
saying, For he is good; for his [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) endureth
for ever.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) and all
the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) offered a
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) of twenty and two thousand oxen, and
an hundred and twenty thousand [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md): so the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) and all the people dedicated the house of
God.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the priests waited on their offices: the
Levites also with instruments of musick of the LORD, which
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) had
made to praise the LORD, because his [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md)
endureth for ever, when [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) praised by their
ministry; and the priests sounded [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md)
before them, and all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) stood.  

<span id="007">7</span> Moreover [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md)
hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD:
for there he offered burnt offerings, and the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) of the peace offerings, because the brasen
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) which [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md)
had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat
offerings, and the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Also at the same time
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) kept the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md)
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days, and all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) with him, a very great
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), from the entering in of
[Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005.md) unto the river of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And in the eighth day they made a solemn
assembly: for they kept the dedication of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days, and
the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
days.  

<span id="010">10</span> And on the three and twentieth day of the
seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry
in heart for the [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md) that the LORD had
shewed unto [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and to
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007), and to [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
his people.  

<span id="011">11</span> Thus [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) finished
the house of the LORD, and the king's house: and all that came into
Solomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house,
he prosperously effected.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the LORD appeared to
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) by night, and said unto him, I have
heard thy [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md), and have
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) this place to myself for an house of
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> If I shut up [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)
that there be no [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md), or if I command the
locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;  

<span id="014">14</span> If my people, which are called by my name,
shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their
wicked ways; then will I hear from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and
will forgive their [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), and will heal their
land.  

<span id="015">15</span> Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears
attent unto the [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) that is made in this
place.  

<span id="016">16</span> For now have I [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md)
and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and mine
eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.  

<span id="017">17</span> And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me,
as [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) thy father walked, and do according to
all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my
judgments;  

<span id="018">18</span> Then will I stablish the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of thy kingdom, according as I have
covenanted with [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) thy father, saying, There
shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes
and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve
other gods, and [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) them;  

<span id="020">20</span> Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of
my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified
for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a
[proverb](../ebd/ebd301.htm#002.md) and a byword among all nations.  

<span id="021">21</span> And this house, which is high, shall be an
astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why
hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house?  

<span id="022">22</span> And it shall be answered, Because they forsook
the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land
of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and laid hold on other gods, and
worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this
evil upon them.
