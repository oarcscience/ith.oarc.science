### King James Version: Judges Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Now these are the nations which the LORD left,
to prove [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) by them, even as many of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) as had not known all the wars of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md);  

<span id="002">2</span> Only that the generations of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) might know, to teach them war, at the
least such as before knew nothing thereof;  

<span id="003">3</span> Namely, five lords of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), and all the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007.md), and the Sidonians, and the
[Hivites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#007.md) that dwelt in
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md), from
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) Baalhermon unto the entering in of
[Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And they were to prove
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) by them, to know whether they would
hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their
fathers by the hand of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) dwelt among the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007), [Hittites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#006.md),
and [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md), and
[Perizzites](../ebd/ebd290.htm#006.md), and
[Hivites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#007.md), and
[Jebusites](../ebd/ebd199.htm#004.md):  

<span id="006">6</span> And they took their daughters to be their wives,
and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) did evil in the sight of the LORD, and
forgat the LORD their God, and served [Baalim](../ebd/ebd039.htm#007.md)
and the groves.  

<span id="008">8</span> Therefore the [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) of
the LORD was hot against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and he sold
them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Mesopotamia](../ebd/ebd251.htm#003.md): and the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) served Chushanrishathaim eight years.  

<span id="009">9</span> And when the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up
a deliverer to the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), who
delivered them, even [Othniel](../ebd/ebd281.htm#003.md) the son of
[Kenaz](../ebd/ebd217.htm#003.md), Caleb's younger brother.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the
LORD came upon him, and he judged [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and
went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Mesopotamia](../ebd/ebd251.htm#003.md)
into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the land had rest forty years. And
[Othniel](../ebd/ebd281.htm#003.md) the son of
[Kenaz](../ebd/ebd217.htm#003.md) died.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) did evil again in the sight of the LORD:
and the LORD strengthened [Eglon](../ebd/ebd113.htm#008.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) against
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), because they had done evil in the sight
of the LORD.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he gathered unto him the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) and [Amalek](../ebd/ebd018.htm#009.md), and
went and smote [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and possessed the city
of palm trees.  

<span id="014">14</span> So the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) served [Eglon](../ebd/ebd113.htm#008.md)
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md)
eighteen years.  

<span id="015">15</span> But when the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised
them up a deliverer, [Ehud](../ebd/ebd114.htm#000.md) the son of
[Gera](../ebd/ebd146.htm#003.md), a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) sent a present unto
[Eglon](../ebd/ebd113.htm#008) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> But [Ehud](../ebd/ebd114.htm#000.md) made him a
dagger which had two edges, of a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md) length;
and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he brought the present unto
[Eglon](../ebd/ebd113.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005): and [Eglon](../ebd/ebd113.htm#008.md) was a
very [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) man.  

<span id="018">18</span> And when he had made an end to offer the
present, he sent away the people that bare the present.  

<span id="019">19</span> But he himself turned again from the
[quarries](../ebd/ebd303.htm#004.md) that were by
[Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md), and said, I have a secret errand unto
thee, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md): who said, Keep silence. And all
that stood by him went out from him.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Ehud](../ebd/ebd114.htm#000.md) came unto
him; and he was [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md) in a summer
[parlour](../ebd/ebd285.htm#002.md), which he had for himself alone. And
[Ehud](../ebd/ebd114.htm#000.md) said, I have a message from God unto thee.
And he arose out of his seat.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Ehud](../ebd/ebd114.htm#000.md) put forth his
left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into
his [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000.md):  

<span id="022">22</span> And the [haft](../ebd/ebd158.htm#004.md) also went
in after the [blade](../ebd/ebd060.htm#003.md); and the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) closed upon the
[blade](../ebd/ebd060.htm#003.md), so that he could not draw the dagger out
of his [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000.md); and the dirt came out.  

<span id="023">23</span> Then [Ehud](../ebd/ebd114.htm#000.md) went forth
through the porch, and shut the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) of the
[parlour](../ebd/ebd285.htm#002.md) upon him, and locked them.  

<span id="024">24</span> When he was gone out, his servants came; and
when they saw that, behold, the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) of the
[parlour](../ebd/ebd285.htm#002.md) were locked, they said, Surely he
covereth his feet in his summer [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> And they tarried till they were ashamed: and,
behold, he opened not the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) of the
[parlour](../ebd/ebd285.htm#002.md); therefore they took a
[key](../ebd/ebd218.htm#002.md), and opened them: and, behold, their lord
was fallen down dead on the earth.  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Ehud](../ebd/ebd114.htm#000.md) escaped while
they tarried, and passed beyond the [quarries](../ebd/ebd303.htm#004.md),
and escaped unto [Seirath](../ebd/ebd326.htm#005.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And it came to pass, when he was come, that he
blew a trumpet in the mountain of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), and
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) went down with him from
the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md), and he before them.  

<span id="028">28</span> And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the
LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they
went down after him, and took the fords of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) toward [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md),
and suffered not a man to pass over.  

<span id="029">29</span> And they slew of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md)
at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour;
and there escaped not a man.  

<span id="030">30</span> So [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) was subdued
that day under the hand of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md). And the land
had rest fourscore years.  

<span id="031">31</span> And after him was
[Shamgar](../ebd/ebd331.htm#000.md) the son of
[Anath](../ebd/ebd023.htm#002.md), which slew of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) six hundred men with an
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) [goad](../ebd/ebd151.htm#000.md): and he also
delivered [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).
