### King James Version: Judges Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> And the men of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md)
said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not,
when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with
him sharply.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he said unto them, What have I done now in
comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) better than the vintage of
[Abiezer](../ebd/ebd003.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="003">3</span> God hath delivered into your hands the princes
of [Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007), [Oreb](../ebd/ebd280.htm#001.md) and
[Zeeb](../ebd/ebd389.htm#009.md): and what was I able to do in comparison
of you? Then their [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) was abated toward him,
when he had said that.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) came to
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), and passed over, he, and the three
hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he said unto the men of
[Succoth](../ebd/ebd352.htm#008.md), Give, I pray you, loaves of
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) unto the people that follow me; for they
be faint, and I am pursuing after [Zebah](../ebd/ebd388.htm#006.md) and
[Zalmunna](../ebd/ebd387.htm#002.md), kings of
[Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And the princes of
[Succoth](../ebd/ebd352.htm#008.md) said, Are the hands of
[Zebah](../ebd/ebd388.htm#006) and [Zalmunna](../ebd/ebd387.htm#002.md) now
in thine hand, that we should give [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) unto
thine army?  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) said,
Therefore when the LORD hath delivered [Zebah](../ebd/ebd388.htm#006.md)
and [Zalmunna](../ebd/ebd387.htm#002.md) into mine hand, then I will tear
your [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) with the thorns of the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) and with briers.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he went up thence to
[Penuel](../ebd/ebd289.htm#005.md), and spake unto them likewise: and the
men of [Penuel](../ebd/ebd289.htm#005.md) answered him as the men of
[Succoth](../ebd/ebd352.htm#008.md) had answered him.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he spake also unto the men of
[Penuel](../ebd/ebd289.htm#005.md), saying, When I come again in peace, I
will break down this tower.  

<span id="010">10</span> Now [Zebah](../ebd/ebd388.htm#006.md) and
[Zalmunna](../ebd/ebd387.htm#002.md) were in
[Karkor](../ebd/ebd215.htm#009.md), and their hosts with them, about
fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the
children of the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md): for there fell an hundred
and twenty thousand men that drew [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) went up by
the way of them that dwelt in tents on the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md)
of [Nobah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#004.md) and Jogbehah, and smote the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007); for the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) was
secure.  

<span id="012">12</span> And when [Zebah](../ebd/ebd388.htm#006.md) and
[Zalmunna](../ebd/ebd387.htm#002.md) fled, he pursued after them, and took
the two kings of [Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md),
[Zebah](../ebd/ebd388.htm#006) and [Zalmunna](../ebd/ebd387.htm#002.md),
and discomfited all the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) the son of
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md) returned from battle before the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) was up,  

<span id="014">14</span> And caught a young man of the men of
[Succoth](../ebd/ebd352.htm#008.md), and enquired of him: and he described
unto him the princes of [Succoth](../ebd/ebd352.htm#008.md), and the elders
thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he came unto the men of
[Succoth](../ebd/ebd352.htm#008.md), and said, Behold
[Zebah](../ebd/ebd388.htm#006) and [Zalmunna](../ebd/ebd387.htm#002.md),
with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of
[Zebah](../ebd/ebd388.htm#006) and [Zalmunna](../ebd/ebd387.htm#002.md) now
in thine hand, that we should give [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) unto
thy men that are weary?  

<span id="016">16</span> And he took the elders of the city, and thorns
of the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) and briers, and with them he
taught the men of [Succoth](../ebd/ebd352.htm#008.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And he beat down the tower of
[Penuel](../ebd/ebd289.htm#005.md), and slew the men of the city.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then said he unto
[Zebah](../ebd/ebd388.htm#006) and [Zalmunna](../ebd/ebd387.htm#002.md),
What manner of men were they whom ye slew at
[Tabor](../ebd/ebd356.htm#007.md)? And they answered, As thou art, so were
they; each one resembled the children of a
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And he said, They were my brethren, even the
sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I
would not slay you.  

<span id="020">20</span> And he said unto
[Jether](../ebd/ebd205.htm#007.md) his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But
the youth drew not his [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md): for he feared,
because he was yet a youth.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then [Zebah](../ebd/ebd388.htm#006.md) and
[Zalmunna](../ebd/ebd387.htm#002.md) said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for
as the man is, so is his strength. And [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md)
arose, and slew [Zebah](../ebd/ebd388.htm#006.md) and
[Zalmunna](../ebd/ebd387.htm#002.md), and took away the ornaments that were
on their camels' necks.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
said unto [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md), Rule thou over us, both thou,
and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the
hand of [Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) said unto
them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the
LORD shall rule over you.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) said unto
them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man
the [earrings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#007.md) of his prey. (For they had golden
[earrings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#007), because they were Ishmaelites..md)  

<span id="025">25</span> And they answered, We will willingly give them.
And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the
[earrings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#007.md) of his prey.  

<span id="026">26</span> And the weight of the golden
[earrings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#007.md) that he requested was a thousand and
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) hundred shekels of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md); beside ornaments, and collars, and purple
raiment that was on the kings of [Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md), and
beside the chains that were about their camels' necks.  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) made an
[ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md) thereof, and put it in his city, even in
[Ophrah](../ebd/ebd279.htm#009): and all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009) unto [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md), and
to his house.  

<span id="028">28</span> Thus was [Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md)
subdued before the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), so that
they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness
forty years in the days of [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Jerubbaal](../ebd/ebd204.htm#002.md) the son
of [Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md) went and dwelt in his own house.  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) had
threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.  

<span id="031">31</span> And his [concubine](../ebd/ebd087.htm#007.md) that
was in [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md), she also bare him a son, whose
name he called [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> And [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) the son of
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md) died in a good old age, and was buried in
the [sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001) of [Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md)
his father, in [Ophrah](../ebd/ebd279.htm#009.md) of the Abiezrites.  

<span id="033">33</span> And it came to pass, as soon as
[Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) was dead, that the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) turned again, and went a whoring after
[Baalim](../ebd/ebd039.htm#007.md), and made Baalberith their god.  

<span id="034">34</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) remembered not the LORD their God, who
had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every
side:  

<span id="035">35</span> Neither shewed they kindness to the house of
[Jerubbaal](../ebd/ebd204.htm#002.md), namely,
[Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md), according to all the
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md) which he had shewed unto
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).
