### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 112

<span id="001">1</span> Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that
feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.  

<span id="002">2</span> His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) of the upright shall be blessed.  

<span id="003">3</span> Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) endureth for ever.  

<span id="004">4</span> Unto the upright there ariseth light in the
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md): he is gracious, and full of
compassion, and righteous.  

<span id="005">5</span> A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will
guide his affairs with discretion.  

<span id="006">6</span> Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the
righteous shall be in [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md)
remembrance.  

<span id="007">7</span> He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his
heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.  

<span id="008">8</span> His heart is established, he shall not be
afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.  

<span id="009">9</span> He hath dispersed, he hath given to the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md); his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) endureth for ever; his
[horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003.md) shall be exalted with honour.  

<span id="010">10</span> The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he
shall [gnash](../ebd/ebd150.htm#008.md) with his teeth, and melt away: the
desire of the wicked shall perish.
