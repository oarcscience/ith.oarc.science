### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 29

<span id="001">1</span> Now these are the words of the letter that
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)
sent from [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) unto the residue of the
elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the
prophets, and to all the people whom
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005) had carried away
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) from [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005)
to [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001);  

<span id="002">2</span> (After that Jeconiah the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007),
and the eunuchs, the princes of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and the carpenters, and the smiths,
were departed from [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005);)  

<span id="003">3</span> By the hand of [Elasah](../ebd/ebd114.htm#004)
the son of [Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004), and
[Gemariah](../ebd/ebd145.htm#007) the son of
[Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006), (whom
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) sent unto
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) to
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001)) saying,  

<span id="004">4</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), unto all that are carried away
captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) unto
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001);  

<span id="005">5</span> Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant
[gardens](../ebd/ebd143.htm#001), and eat the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of them;  

<span id="006">6</span> Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and
take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they
may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not
diminished.  

<span id="007">7</span> And seek the peace of the city whither I have
caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it:
for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.  

<span id="008">8</span> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); Let not your prophets and your
diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to
your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.  

<span id="009">9</span> For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I
have not sent them, saith the LORD.  

<span id="010">10</span> For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy
years be accomplished at [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) I will visit
you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to
this place.  

<span id="011">11</span> For I know the thoughts that I think toward
you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an
expected end.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and
pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.  

<span id="013">13</span> And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye
shall search for me with all your heart.  

<span id="014">14</span> And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and
I will turn away your [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002), and I will
gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have
driven you, saith the LORD; and I will bring you again into the place
whence I caused you to be carried away
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001).  

<span id="015">15</span> Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us
up prophets in [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001);  

<span id="016">16</span> Know that thus saith the LORD of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) that sitteth upon the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and
of all the people that dwelleth in this city, and of your brethren that
are not gone forth with you into [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002);  

<span id="017">17</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will
send upon them the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000), and the pestilence, and will make them
like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.  

<span id="018">18</span> And I will persecute them with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), with the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000), and with the pestilence, and will
deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003), and an astonishment, and an hissing, and
a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them:  

<span id="019">19</span> Because they have not hearkened to my words,
saith the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets,
rising up early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the
LORD.  

<span id="020">20</span> Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye
of the [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002), whom I have sent from
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) to
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001):  

<span id="021">21</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), of [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) the
son of Kolaiah, and of [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) the son of
[Maaseiah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#007), which prophesy a lie unto you in my
name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001); and he shall slay them before your
eyes;  

<span id="022">22</span> And of them shall be taken up a
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) by all the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)
which are in [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), saying, The LORD make
thee like [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) and like
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002), whom the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) roasted in the fire;  

<span id="023">23</span> Because they have committed villany in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and have committed
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009) with their neighbours' wives, and have
spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I
know, and am a [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008), saith the LORD.  

<span id="024">24</span> Thus shalt thou also speak to
[Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005) the
[Nehelamite](../ebd/ebd269.htm#006), saying,  

<span id="025">25</span> Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saying, Because thou hast sent letters
in thy name unto all the people that are at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and to
[Zephaniah](../ebd/ebd390.htm#008) the son of
[Maaseiah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#007) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),
and to all the priests, saying,  

<span id="026">26</span> The LORD hath made thee
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) in the stead of
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),
that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that
is mad, and maketh himself a [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), that thou
shouldest put him in [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006), and in the
stocks.  

<span id="027">27</span> Now therefore why hast thou not reproved
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) of [Anathoth](../ebd/ebd023.htm#004),
which maketh himself a [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) to you?  

<span id="028">28</span> For therefore he sent unto us in
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), saying, This
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) is long: build ye houses, and dwell
in them; and plant [gardens](../ebd/ebd143.htm#001), and eat the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of them.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Zephaniah](../ebd/ebd390.htm#008) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) read this letter in the ears of
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008).  

<span id="030">30</span> Then came the word of the LORD unto
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006), saying,  

<span id="031">31</span> Send to all them of the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002), saying, Thus saith the LORD
concerning [Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005) the
[Nehelamite](../ebd/ebd269.htm#006); Because that
[Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005) hath prophesied unto you, and I sent
him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie:  

<span id="032">32</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will
punish [Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005) the
[Nehelamite](../ebd/ebd269.htm#006), and his seed: he shall not have a
man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I
will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion
against the LORD.
