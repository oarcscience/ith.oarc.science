</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> to my Maker.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;He openeth also their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;But if they obey not, they shall perish by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and they shall die without knowledge.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But the hypocrites in heart <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A> up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;He delivereth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</A> take hold on thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd307.htm#005">ransom</A> cannot deliver thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Will he esteem thy riches? no, not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, nor all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#000">forces</A> of strength.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> rather than affliction.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> according to the vapour thereof:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A> that cometh betwixt.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> also concerning the vapour.<BR>
