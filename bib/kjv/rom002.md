### King James Version: Romans Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever
thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest
thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.  

<span id="002">2</span> But we are sure that the judgment of God is
according to truth against them which commit such things.  

<span id="003">3</span> And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them
which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the
judgment of God?  

<span id="004">4</span> Or despisest thou the riches of his
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md) and forbearance and longsuffering; not
knowing that the [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md) of God leadeth thee
to [repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008.md)?  

<span id="005">5</span> But after thy hardness and impenitent heart
treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and
[revelation](../ebd/ebd312.htm#002.md) of the righteous judgment of God;  

<span id="006">6</span> Who will render to every man according to his
deeds:  

<span id="007">7</span> To them who by patient continuance in well doing
seek for [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) and honour and
[immortality](../ebd/ebd187.htm#009.md), eternal life:  

<span id="008">8</span> But unto them that are contentious, and do not
obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,  

<span id="009">9</span> [Tribulation](../ebd/ebd372.htm#005.md) and
anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the
[Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004.md) first, and also of the Gentile;  

<span id="010">10</span> But [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), honour, and
peace, to every man that worketh good, to the
[Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004.md) first, and also to the Gentile:  

<span id="011">11</span> For there is no respect of persons with God.  

<span id="012">12</span> For as many as have sinned without law shall
also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be
judged by the law;  

<span id="013">13</span> (For not the hearers of the law are just before
God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.  

<span id="014">14</span> For when the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md),
which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law,
these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:  

<span id="015">15</span> Which shew the work of the law written in their
hearts, their [conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006.md) also bearing
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md), and their thoughts the mean while
accusing or else excusing one another;)  

<span id="016">16</span> In the day when God shall
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) the secrets of men by
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) according
to my [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Behold, thou art called a
[Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004.md), and restest in the law, and makest thy
boast of God,  

<span id="018">18</span> And knowest his will, and approvest the things
that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;  

<span id="019">19</span> And art confident that thou thyself art a guide
of the [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md), a light of them which are in
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md),  

<span id="020">20</span> An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of
babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.  

<span id="021">21</span> Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest
thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou
steal?  

<span id="022">22</span> Thou that sayest a man should not commit
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009.md), dost thou commit
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009.md)? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou
commit sacrilege?  

<span id="023">23</span> Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through
breaking the law dishonourest thou God?  

<span id="024">24</span> For the name of God is blasphemed among the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) through you, as it is written.  

<span id="025">25</span> For [circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007.md)
verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the
law, thy [circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007.md) is made uncircumcision.  

<span id="026">26</span> Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) of the law, shall not his
uncircumcision be counted for [circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007.md)?  

<span id="027">27</span> And shall not uncircumcision which is by
nature, if it fulfil the law, [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) thee, who
by the letter and [circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007.md) dost transgress
the law?  

<span id="028">28</span> For he is not a [Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004.md),
which is one outwardly; neither is that
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007.md), which is outward in the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md):  

<span id="029">29</span> But he is a [Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004.md), which
is one inwardly; and [circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007.md) is that of
the heart, in the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), and not in the
letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.
