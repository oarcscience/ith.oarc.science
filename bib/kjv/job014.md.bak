### King James Version: Job Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> Man that is born of a woman is of few days and
full of trouble.  

<span id="002">2</span> He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down:
he fleeth also as a [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md), and continueth
not.  

<span id="003">3</span> And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one,
and bringest me into judgment with thee?  

<span id="004">4</span> Who can bring a [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md)
thing out of an unclean? not one.  

<span id="005">5</span> Seeing his days are determined, the number of
his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot
pass;  

<span id="006">6</span> Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall
accomplish, as an [hireling](../ebd/ebd179.htm#004.md), his day.  

<span id="007">7</span> For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down,
that it will sprout again, and that the tender
[branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002.md) thereof will not cease.  

<span id="008">8</span> Though the root thereof
[wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000.md) old in the earth, and the stock thereof die
in the ground;  

<span id="009">9</span> Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and
bring forth boughs like a plant.  

<span id="010">10</span> But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man
giveth up the [ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md), and where is he?  

<span id="011">11</span> As the waters fail from the sea, and the
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000.md) decayeth and drieth up:  

<span id="012">12</span> So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the
heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their
sleep.  

<span id="013">13</span> O that thou wouldest hide me in the
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md), that thou wouldest keep me secret, until
thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and
remember me!  

<span id="014">14</span> If a man die, shall he live again? all the days
of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.  

<span id="015">15</span> Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou
wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.  

<span id="016">16</span> For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not
watch over my [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)?  

<span id="017">17</span> My transgression is sealed up in a
[bag](../ebd/ebd041.htm#008.md), and thou sewest up mine iniquity.  

<span id="018">18</span> And surely the mountains falling cometh to
nought, and the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md) is removed out of his
place.  

<span id="019">19</span> The waters wear the stones: thou washest away
the things which grow out of the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) of the
earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.  

<span id="020">20</span> Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he
passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.  

<span id="021">21</span> His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not;
and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.  

<span id="022">22</span> But his [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) upon him
shall have pain, and his soul within him shall
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004.md).
