</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</A>, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;A land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</A>, and vines, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</A> trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;A land wherein thou shalt eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.<BR>

<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:<BR>

<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;<BR>

<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> and thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, from the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Who led thee through that great and terrible <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, wherein were fiery serpents, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#001">scorpions</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#005">drought</A>, where there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#009">flint</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Who fed thee in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</A>, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD your God.<BR>
