### King James Version: Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the
breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would
[kiss](../ebd/ebd221.htm#000.md) thee; yea, I should not be despised.  

<span id="002">2</span> I would lead thee, and bring thee into my
mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of spiced [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md)
of the juice of my [pomegranate](../ebd/ebd298.htm#000.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> His left hand should be under my head, and his
right hand should embrace me.  

<span id="004">4</span> I charge you, O daughters of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), that ye stir not up, nor awake my
love, until he please.  

<span id="005">5</span> Who is this that cometh up from the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), leaning upon her beloved? I raised
thee up under the [apple](../ebd/ebd027.htm#004.md) tree: there thy mother
brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> Set me as a [seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002.md) upon
thine heart, as a [seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002.md) upon thine arm: for love
is strong as death; [jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008.md) is cruel as the
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md): the coals thereof are coals of fire,
which hath a most vehement flame.  

<span id="007">7</span> Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the
floods [drown](../ebd/ebd108.htm#006.md) it: if a man would give all the
substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.  

<span id="008">8</span> We have a little sister, and she hath no
breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be
spoken for?  

<span id="009">9</span> If she be a wall, we will build upon her a
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008) of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md): and
if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> I am a wall, and my breasts like
[towers](../ebd/ebd371.htm#002.md): then was I in his eyes as one that
found favour.  

<span id="011">11</span> [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) had a vineyard
at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) thereof was to bring a thousand
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou,
O [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), must have a thousand, and those that
keep the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) thereof two hundred.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou that dwellest in the
[gardens](../ebd/ebd143.htm#001.md), the companions hearken to thy voice:
cause me to hear it.  

<span id="014">14</span> Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a
[roe](../ebd/ebd315.htm#002) or to a young [hart](../ebd/ebd165.htm#004.md)
upon the mountains of [spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005.md).
