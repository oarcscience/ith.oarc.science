### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> And the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of God
came upon [Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005) the son of
[Oded](../ebd/ebd276.htm#009):  

<span id="002">2</span> And he went out to meet
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000), and said unto him, Hear ye me,
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000), and all [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008); The LORD is with you, while ye be
with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake
him, he will forsake you.  

<span id="003">3</span> Now for a long season
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) hath been without the true God, and
without a teaching [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and without law.  

<span id="004">4</span> But when they in their trouble did turn unto the
LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and sought him, he was
found of them.  

<span id="005">5</span> And in those times there was no peace to him
that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon
all the inhabitants of the countries.  

<span id="006">6</span> And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of
city: for God did vex them with all adversity.  

<span id="007">7</span> Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands
be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.  

<span id="008">8</span> And when [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000) heard
these words, and the [prophecy](../ebd/ebd300.htm#007) of
[Oded](../ebd/ebd276.htm#009) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), he
took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008),
and out of the cities which he had taken from
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000), and
renewed the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of the LORD, that was before
the porch of the LORD.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he gathered all
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008),
and the strangers with them out of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) and
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002), and out of
[Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002): for they fell to him out of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in abundance, when they saw that the
LORD his God was with him.  

<span id="010">10</span> So they gathered themselves together at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) in the third month, in the fifteenth
year of the reign of [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000).  

<span id="011">11</span> And they offered unto the LORD the same time,
of the spoil which they had brought, [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
hundred oxen and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) thousand
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005).  

<span id="012">12</span> And they entered into a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) to seek the LORD God of their fathers
with all their heart and with all their soul;  

<span id="013">13</span> That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) should be put to death, whether small or
great, whether man or woman.  

<span id="014">14</span> And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice,
and with shouting, and with [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001), and with
cornets.  

<span id="015">15</span> And all [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) rejoiced
at the [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000): for they had sworn with all their
heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them:
and the LORD gave them rest round about.  

<span id="016">16</span> And also concerning
[Maachah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#004) the mother of
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), he
removed her from being [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007), because she had
made an [idol](../ebd/ebd186.htm#006) in a
[grove](../ebd/ebd155.htm#008): and [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000) cut
down her [idol](../ebd/ebd186.htm#006), and stamped it, and burnt it at
the [brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006) [Kidron](../ebd/ebd218.htm#008).  

<span id="017">17</span> But the high places were not taken away out of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): nevertheless the heart of
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000) was perfect all his days.  

<span id="018">18</span> And he brought into the house of God the things
that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated,
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and
vessels.  

<span id="019">19</span> And there was no more war unto the five and
thirtieth year of the reign of [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000).
