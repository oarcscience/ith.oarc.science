### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> And [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md) went up out
of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), he, and his wife, and all that he
had, and Lot with him, into the south.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md) was very rich
in [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002), in [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md),
and in [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And he went on his journeys from the south even
to [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md), unto the place where his
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) had been at the beginning, between
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md) and Hai;  

<span id="004">4</span> Unto the place of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), which he had make there at the first:
and there [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md) called on the name of the
LORD.  

<span id="005">5</span> And Lot also, which went with
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md), had flocks, and herds, and tents.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the land was not able to bear them, that
they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they
could not dwell together.  

<span id="007">7</span> And there was a strife between the herdmen of
Abram's [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) and the herdmen of Lot's
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md): and the
[Canaanite](../ebd/ebd070.htm#008.md) and the Perizzite dwelled then in the
land.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md) said unto
Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and
between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.  

<span id="009">9</span> Is not the whole land before thee? separate
thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I
will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will
go to the left.  

<span id="010">10</span> And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) of [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), that
it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed
[Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004) and [Gomorrah](../ebd/ebd152.htm#007.md),
even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), as thou comest unto
[Zoar](../ebd/ebd395.htm#004.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Then Lot chose him all the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) of [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md); and
Lot journeyed [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md): and they separated
themselves the one from the other.  

<span id="012">12</span> [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md) dwelled in the
land of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md), and Lot dwelled in the cities
of the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md), and pitched his
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009) toward [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> But the men of [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004.md)
were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the LORD said unto
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md), after that Lot was separated from him,
Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art
[northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002.md), and southward, and eastward, and
[westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008.md):  

<span id="015">15</span> For all the land which thou seest, to thee will
I give it, and to thy seed for ever.  

<span id="016">16</span> And I will make thy seed as the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) of the earth: so that if a man can number
the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) of the earth, then shall thy seed also
be numbered.  

<span id="017">17</span> Arise, walk through the land in the length of
it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md) removed his
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md), and came and dwelt in the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) of [Mamre](../ebd/ebd239.htm#008.md), which
is in [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004.md), and built there an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) unto the LORD.
