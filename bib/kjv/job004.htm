<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#005">Eliphaz</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#002">Temanite</A> answered and said,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A>, are broken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> received a little thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;In thoughts from the visions of the night, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A> sleep falleth on men,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> passed before my face; the hair of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> stood up:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;How much less in them that dwell in houses of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A>, whose foundation is in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A>, which are crushed before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#005">moth</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.<BR>
