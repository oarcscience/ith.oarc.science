### King James Version: Job Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Then [Eliphaz](../ebd/ebd117.htm#005) the
[Temanite](../ebd/ebd361.htm#002) answered and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be
grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?  

<span id="003">3</span> Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast
strengthened the weak hands.  

<span id="004">4</span> Thy words have upholden him that was falling,
and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.  

<span id="005">5</span> But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest;
it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.  

<span id="006">6</span> Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope,
and the uprightness of thy ways?  

<span id="007">7</span> Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being
innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?  

<span id="008">8</span> Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity,
and sow wickedness, reap the same.  

<span id="009">9</span> By the blast of God they perish, and by the
breath of his nostrils are they consumed.  

<span id="010">10</span> The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the
fierce lion, and the teeth of the young [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001),
are broken.  

<span id="011">11</span> The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and
the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.  

<span id="012">12</span> Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and
mine [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) received a little thereof.  

<span id="013">13</span> In thoughts from the visions of the night, when
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008) sleep falleth on men,  

<span id="014">14</span> Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made
all my bones to shake.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then a [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) passed
before my face; the hair of my [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) stood
up:  

<span id="016">16</span> It stood still, but I could not discern the
form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I
heard a voice, saying,  

<span id="017">17</span> Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a
man be more pure than his maker?  

<span id="018">18</span> Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and
his angels he charged with folly:  

<span id="019">19</span> How much less in them that dwell in houses of
[clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004), whose foundation is in the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008), which are crushed before the
[moth](../ebd/ebd260.htm#005)?  

<span id="020">20</span> They are destroyed from morning to evening:
they perish for ever without any regarding it.  

<span id="021">21</span> Doth not their excellency which is in them go
away? they die, even without wisdom.
