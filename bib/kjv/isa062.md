### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 62

<span id="001">1</span> For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and
for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) thereof go forth as brightness,
and the [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) thereof as a
[lamp](../ebd/ebd223.htm#007.md) that burneth.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) shall
see thy [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), and all kings thy
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md): and thou shalt be called by a new name,
which the mouth of the LORD shall name.  

<span id="003">3</span> Thou shalt also be a
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) in the
hand of the LORD, and a royal [diadem](../ebd/ebd102.htm#009.md) in the
hand of thy God.  

<span id="004">4</span> Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither
shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called
[Hephzibah](../ebd/ebd174.htm#007.md), and thy land
[Beulah](../ebd/ebd057.htm#006.md): for the LORD delighteth in thee, and
thy land shall be married.  

<span id="005">5</span> For as a young man marrieth a
[virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009.md), so shall thy sons marry thee: and as
the bridegroom rejoiceth over the [bride](../ebd/ebd065.htm#001.md), so
shall thy God rejoice over thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), which shall never hold their peace
day nor night: ye that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence,  

<span id="007">7</span> And give him no rest, till he establish, and
till he make [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) a praise in the earth.  

<span id="008">8</span> The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by
the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md) to be meat for thine enemies; and the sons
of the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) shall not
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) thy [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), for
the which thou hast laboured:  

<span id="009">9</span> But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and
praise the LORD; and they that have brought it together shall
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) it in the courts of my
[holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye
the way of the people; cast up, cast up the
[highway](../ebd/ebd178.htm#005.md); gather out the stones; lift up a
standard for the people.  

<span id="011">11</span> Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end
of the world, Say ye to the daughter of [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md),
Behold, thy [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) cometh; behold, his
reward is with him, and his work before him.  

<span id="012">12</span> And they shall call them, The holy people, The
redeemed of the LORD: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not
forsaken.
