### King James Version: 2 Timothy Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), who
shall [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) the quick and the dead at his
appearing and his kingdom;  

<span id="002">2</span> Preach the word; be instant in season, out of
season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.  

<span id="003">3</span> For the time will come when they will not endure
sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they
[heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md) to themselves teachers, having itching
ears;  

<span id="004">4</span> And they shall turn away their ears from the
truth, and shall be turned unto fables.  

<span id="005">5</span> But watch thou in all things, endure
[afflictions](../ebd/ebd011.htm#006.md), do the work of an
[evangelist](../ebd/ebd127.htm#004.md), make full proof of thy ministry.  

<span id="006">6</span> For I am now ready to be offered, and the time
of my departure is at hand.  

<span id="007">7</span> I have fought a good fight, I have finished my
course, I have kept the faith:  

<span id="008">8</span> Henceforth there is laid up for me a
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), which the Lord, the righteous
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md), shall give me at that day: and not to me
only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.  

<span id="009">9</span> Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:  

<span id="010">10</span> For [Demas](../ebd/ebd101.htm#004.md) hath
forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto
[Thessalonica](../ebd/ebd364.htm#000); [Crescens](../ebd/ebd092.htm#005.md)
to [Galatia](../ebd/ebd141.htm#004), [Titus](../ebd/ebd368.htm#007.md) unto
[Dalmatia](../ebd/ebd096.htm#005.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Only [Luke](../ebd/ebd233.htm#002.md) is with me.
Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the
ministry.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Tychicus](../ebd/ebd373.htm#008.md) have I
sent to [Ephesus](../ebd/ebd122.htm#007.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> The cloke that I left at
[Troas](../ebd/ebd372.htm#008.md) with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with
thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.  

<span id="014">14</span> [Alexander](../ebd/ebd016.htm#009.md) the
coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his
works:  

<span id="015">15</span> Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly
withstood our words.  

<span id="016">16</span> At my first answer no man stood with me, but
all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their
charge.  

<span id="017">17</span> Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and
strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that
all the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) might hear: and I was
delivered out of the mouth of the lion.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil
work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) for ever and ever.
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> Salute Prisca and
[Aquila](../ebd/ebd027.htm#006.md), and the household of
[Onesiphorus](../ebd/ebd279.htm#000.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> [Erastus](../ebd/ebd124.htm#001.md) abode at
[Corinth](../ebd/ebd090.htm#002): but [Trophimus](../ebd/ebd373.htm#000.md)
have I left at Miletum sick.  

<span id="021">21</span> Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus
greeteth thee, and [Pudens](../ebd/ebd302.htm#001.md), and Linus, and
[Claudia](../ebd/ebd084.htm#002.md), and all the brethren.  

<span id="022">22</span> The Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) be with thy
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009). [Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) be with
you. [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).
