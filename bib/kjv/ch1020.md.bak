### King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, that after the year was
expired, at the time that kings go out to battle,
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) led forth the power of the army, and
wasted the country of the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002.md),
and came and besieged [Rabbah](../ebd/ebd304.htm#005.md). But
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) tarried at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005). And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md)
smote [Rabbah](../ebd/ebd304.htm#005.md), and destroyed it.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) took the
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of their [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
from off his head, and found it to weigh a
[talent](../ebd/ebd357.htm#009) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and
there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and
he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he brought out the people that were in it,
and cut them with saws, and with harrows of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md), and with axes. Even so dealt
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) with all the cities of the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002). And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) and
all the people returned to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And it came to pass after this, that there arose
war at [Gezer](../ebd/ebd147.htm#004.md) with the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md); at which time Sibbechai the
Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they
were subdued.  

<span id="005">5</span> And there was war again with the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md); and
[Elhanan](../ebd/ebd115.htm#006.md) the son of
[Jair](../ebd/ebd196.htm#001.md) slew Lahmi the brother of
[Goliath](../ebd/ebd152.htm#005) the [Gittite](../ebd/ebd149.htm#009.md),
whose spear staff was like a weaver's [beam](../ebd/ebd048.htm#007.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And yet again there was war at
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009.md), where was a man of great stature, whose
fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each
foot and he also was the son of the giant.  

<span id="007">7</span> But when he defied
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) the
son of [Shimea](../ebd/ebd338.htm#000.md) David's brother slew him.  

<span id="008">8</span> These were born unto the giant in
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009.md); and they fell by the hand of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and by the hand of his servants.
