### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> The [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md). Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md), and shall come into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): and the idols of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) shall be moved at his presence, and the
heart of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) shall melt in the midst of it.  

<span id="002">2</span> And I will set the Egyptians against the
Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every
one against his neighbour; city against city, and kingdom against
kingdom.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) shall fail in the midst thereof; and I
will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and
to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the
wizards.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand
of a cruel lord; and a fierce [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) shall rule
over them, saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the
river shall be wasted and dried up.  

<span id="006">6</span> And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the
brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags
shall wither.  

<span id="007">7</span> The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of
the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven
away, and be no more.  

<span id="008">8</span> The fishers also shall
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004.md), and all they that cast angle into the
brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall
languish.  

<span id="009">9</span> Moreover they that work in fine
[flax](../ebd/ebd135.htm#004.md), and they that weave networks, shall be
confounded.  

<span id="010">10</span> And they shall be broken in the purposes
thereof, all that make sluices and ponds for
[fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Surely the princes of
[Zoan](../ebd/ebd395.htm#003.md) are fools, the counsel of the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) counsellors of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) is become brutish: how say ye unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), I am the son of the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md), the son of ancient kings?  

<span id="012">12</span> Where are they? where are thy
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) men? and let them tell thee now, and let
them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed upon
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> The princes of [Zoan](../ebd/ebd395.htm#003.md)
are become fools, the princes of [Noph](../ebd/ebd274.htm#009.md) are
deceived; they have also seduced [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), even
they that are the stay of the tribes thereof.  

<span id="014">14</span> The LORD hath mingled a perverse
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) in the midst thereof: and they have
caused [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) to err in every work thereof, as a
drunken man staggereth in his vomit.  

<span id="015">15</span> Neither shall there be any work for
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), which the head or tail,
[branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002) or [rush](../ebd/ebd316.htm#007.md), may
do.  

<span id="016">16</span> In that day shall
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) be like unto women: and it shall be
afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts,
which he shaketh over it.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the land of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)
shall be a terror unto [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), every one that
maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the
counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he hath determined against it.  

<span id="018">18</span> In that day shall five cities in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) speak the language of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md), and swear to the LORD of hosts; one
shall be called, The city of [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> In that day shall there be an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) to the LORD in the midst of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and a [pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md) at
the border thereof to the LORD.  

<span id="020">20</span> And it shall be for a sign and for a
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) unto the LORD of hosts in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): for they shall cry unto the LORD because
of the oppressors, and he shall send them a
[saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003.md), and a great one, and he shall deliver
them.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the LORD shall be known to
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in
that day, and shall do [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) and oblation;
yea, they shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform it.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the LORD shall smite
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): he shall smite and heal it: and they
shall return even to the LORD, and he shall be intreated of them, and
shall heal them.  

<span id="023">23</span> In that day shall there be a
[highway](../ebd/ebd178.htm#005) out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md)
to [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md), and the Assyrian shall come into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and the Egyptian into
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md), and the Egyptians shall serve with the
Assyrians.  

<span id="024">24</span> In that day shall
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) be the third with
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) and with
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md), even a blessing in the midst of the
land:  

<span id="025">25</span> Whom the LORD of hosts shall
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md), saying, Blessed be
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) my people, and
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md) the work of my hands, and
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) mine inheritance.
