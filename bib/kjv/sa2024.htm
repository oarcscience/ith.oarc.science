<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>: and there were in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>; and the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> were five hundred thousand men.<BR>

<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#007">Gad</A>, David's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#000">seer</A>, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Go and say unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#007">Gad</A> came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and told him, and said unto him, Shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> years of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A> come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#007">Gad</A>, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;So the LORD sent a pestilence upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</A> even to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</A> seventy thousand men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> stretched out his hand upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD was by the threshingplace of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd028.htm#006">Araunah</A> the Jebusite.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> spake unto the LORD when he saw the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#007">Gad</A> came that day to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and said unto him, Go up, rear an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd028.htm#006">Araunah</A> the Jebusite.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, according to the saying of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#007">Gad</A>, went up as the LORD commanded.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd028.htm#006">Araunah</A> looked, and saw the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> and his servants coming on toward him: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd028.htm#006">Araunah</A> went out, and bowed himself before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> on his face upon the ground.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd028.htm#006">Araunah</A> said, Wherefore is my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> come to his servant?  And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> unto the LORD, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#001">plague</A> may be stayed from the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd028.htm#006">Araunah</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, Let my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#009">threshing</A> instruments and other instruments of the oxen for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;All these things did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd028.htm#006">Araunah</A>, as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, give unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd028.htm#006">Araunah</A> said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, The LORD thy God accept thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd028.htm#006">Araunah</A>, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> built there an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#001">plague</A> was stayed from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
