### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) was twelve
years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty and five years in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md). And his mother's name was
[Hephzibah](../ebd/ebd174.htm#007.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of
the LORD, after the abominations of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), whom the LORD cast out before the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> For he built up again the high places which
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) his father had destroyed; and he
reared up altars for [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md), and made a
[grove](../ebd/ebd155.htm#008), as did [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); and
worshipped all the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and served them.  

<span id="004">4</span> And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of
which the LORD said, In [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) will I put my
name.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he built altars for all the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) in the
two courts of the house of the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he made his son pass through the fire, and
observed times, and used [enchantments](../ebd/ebd120.htm#004.md), and
dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in
the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And he set a graven image of the
[grove](../ebd/ebd155.htm#008.md) that he had made in the house, of which
the LORD said to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and to
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) his son, In this house, and in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), which I have
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) out of all tribes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), will I put my name for ever:  

<span id="008">8</span> Neither will I make the feet of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) move any more out of the land which I
gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all
that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) commanded them.  

<span id="009">9</span> But they hearkened not: and
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) seduced them to do more evil than did
the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And the LORD spake by his servants the
prophets, saying,  

<span id="011">11</span> Because [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) hath
done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md) did, which were before him, and hath
made [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) also to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
with his idols:  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), Behold, I am bringing such evil upon
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) and [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md),
that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.  

<span id="013">13</span> And I will stretch over
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) the line of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md), and the plummet of the house of
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md): and I will wipe
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) as a man wipeth a
[dish](../ebd/ebd104.htm#004.md), wiping it, and turning it upside down.  

<span id="014">14</span> And I will forsake the remnant of mine
inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they
shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;  

<span id="015">15</span> Because they have done that which was evil in
my sight, and have provoked me to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md), since
the day their fathers came forth out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md),
even unto this day.  

<span id="016">16</span> Moreover [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) shed
innocent [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) very much, till he had filled
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) from one end to another; beside his
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) wherewith he made
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), in doing
that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.  

<span id="017">17</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md), and all that he did, and his
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) that he sinned, are they not written in the
book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003.md) of the kings of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)?  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) slept
with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the
garden of [Uzza](../ebd/ebd376.htm#000.md): and
[Amon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#005.md) his son reigned in his stead.  

<span id="019">19</span> [Amon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#005.md) was twenty and
two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md). And his mother's name was
[Meshullemeth](../ebd/ebd251.htm#002.md), the daughter of
[Haruz](../ebd/ebd165.htm#007.md) of Jotbah.  

<span id="020">20</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of
the LORD, as his father [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) did.  

<span id="021">21</span> And he walked in all the way that his father
walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped
them:  

<span id="022">22</span> And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and
walked not in the way of the LORD.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the servants of
[Amon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#005.md) conspired against him, and slew the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) in his own house.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the people of the land slew all them that
had conspired against [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Amon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#005.md); and the people of the land made
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) his son [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) in
his stead.  

<span id="025">25</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Amon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#005.md) which he did, are they not written in the
book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003.md) of the kings of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)?  

<span id="026">26</span> And he was buried in his
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md) in the garden of
[Uzza](../ebd/ebd376.htm#000): and [Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008.md) his
son reigned in his stead.
