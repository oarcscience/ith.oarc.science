<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#003">Nebat</A>, who was in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, whither he fled from the presence of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, heard it, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A> returned out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And they sent and called him. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A> and all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> came and spake to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A>, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Thy father made our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A> took counsel with the old men that had stood before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> that thy father did put upon us?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For whereas my father put a heavy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> upon you, I will put more to your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A>: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#001">scorpions</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A> and all the people came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A> on the third day, as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> answered them roughly; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A> forsook the counsel of the old men,<BR>

<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#001">scorpions</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;So the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#009">Shilonite</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#003">Nebat</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And when all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> saw that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> would not hearken unto them, the people answered the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, saying, What portion have we in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>?  and we have none inheritance in the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</A>: every man to your tents, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: and now, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, see to thine own house. So all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> went to their tents.<BR>

<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But as for the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> that dwelt in the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A> reigned over them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A> sent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd158.htm#001">Hadoram</A> that was over the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</A>; and the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> stoned him with stones, that he died. But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A> made speed to get him up to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A>, to flee to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> rebelled against the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> unto this day.<BR>
