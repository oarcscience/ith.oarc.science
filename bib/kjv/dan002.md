### King James Version: Daniel Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> And in the second year of the reign of
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md)
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) dreamed dreams, wherewith his
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) was troubled, and his sleep brake from
him.  

<span id="002">2</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) commanded
to call the [magicians](../ebd/ebd236.htm#007.md), and the astrologers, and
the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) his dreams. So they came and stood before
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said unto
them, I have dreamed a [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md), and my
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) was troubled to know the
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Then spake the Chaldeans to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) in Syriack, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), live for ever: tell thy servants the
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md), and we will shew the interpretation.  

<span id="005">5</span> The [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) answered and
said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make
known unto me the [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md), with the
interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md), and your houses shall be made a
dunghill.  

<span id="006">6</span> But if ye shew the
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md), and the interpretation thereof, ye shall
receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md), and the interpretation thereof.  

<span id="007">7</span> They answered again and said, Let the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) tell his servants the
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md), and we will shew the interpretation of
it.  

<span id="008">8</span> The [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) answered and
said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see
the thing is gone from me.  

<span id="009">9</span> But if ye will not make known unto me the
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md), there is but one decree for you: for ye
have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time
be changed: therefore tell me the [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md), and I
shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.  

<span id="010">10</span> The Chaldeans answered before the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and said, There is not a man upon the
earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), lord, nor ruler, that asked such things
at any magician, or [astrologer](../ebd/ebd035.htm#006.md), or Chaldean.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it is a rare thing that the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) requireth, and there is none other that
can shew it before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), except the gods,
whose dwelling is not with [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> For this cause the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) was angry and very furious, and commanded
to destroy all the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) men of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And the decree went forth that the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) men should be slain; and they sought
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) and his fellows to be slain.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) answered
with counsel and wisdom to [Arioch](../ebd/ebd030.htm#007.md) the captain
of the king's [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md), which was gone forth to
slay the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) men of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md):  

<span id="015">15</span> He answered and said to
[Arioch](../ebd/ebd030.htm#007.md) the king's captain, Why is the decree so
hasty from the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)? Then
[Arioch](../ebd/ebd030.htm#007.md) made the thing known to
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> Then [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) went in,
and desired of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) that he would give him
time, and that he would shew the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) the
interpretation.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) went to
his house, and made the thing known to
[Hananiah](../ebd/ebd162.htm#004), [Mishael](../ebd/ebd256.htm#006.md), and
[Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005.md), his companions:  

<span id="018">18</span> That they would desire mercies of the God of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) concerning this secret; that
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) and his fellows should not perish with
the rest of the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) men of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> Then was the secret revealed unto
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) in a night
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000). Then [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md)
blessed the God of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) answered and
said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might
are his:  

<span id="021">21</span> And he changeth the times and the
[seasons](../ebd/ebd325.htm#003.md): he removeth kings, and setteth up
kings: he giveth wisdom unto the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md), and
knowledge to them that know understanding:  

<span id="022">22</span> He revealeth the [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md)
and secret things: he knoweth what is in the
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), and the light dwelleth with him.  

<span id="023">23</span> I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my
fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me
now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the
king's matter.  

<span id="024">24</span> Therefore [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) went
in unto [Arioch](../ebd/ebd030.htm#007.md), whom the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) had ordained to destroy the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) men of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md):
he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) men of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md):
bring me in before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and I will shew
unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) the interpretation.  

<span id="025">25</span> Then [Arioch](../ebd/ebd030.htm#007.md) brought in
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001) before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), that will make known unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) the interpretation.  

<span id="026">26</span> The [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) answered and
said to [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md), whose name was
[Belteshazzar](../ebd/ebd052.htm#002.md), Art thou able to make known unto
me the [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md) which I have seen, and the
interpretation thereof?  

<span id="027">27</span> [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) answered in the
presence of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and said, The secret
which the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) hath demanded cannot the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) men, the astrologers, the
[magicians](../ebd/ebd236.htm#007.md), the soothsayers, shew unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md);  

<span id="028">28</span> But there is a God in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) that revealeth secrets, and maketh known
to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) what shall be in the latter
days. Thy [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md), and the visions of thy head
upon thy bed, are these;  

<span id="029">29</span> As for thee, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),
thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass
hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall
come to pass.  

<span id="030">30</span> But as for me, this secret is not revealed to
me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes
that shall make known the interpretation to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and that thou mightest know the thoughts
of thy heart.  

<span id="031">31</span> Thou, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), sawest,
and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was
excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible.  

<span id="032">32</span> This image's head was of fine
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), his breast and his arms of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), his [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000.md) and
his thighs of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md),  

<span id="033">33</span> His legs of [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md), his
feet part of [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md) and part of
[clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004.md).  

<span id="034">34</span> Thou sawest till that a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) was cut out without hands, which smote
the image upon his feet that were of [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md) and
[clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004.md), and brake them to
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md).  

<span id="035">35</span> Then was the [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md), the
[clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004), the [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md), the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md),
broken to [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md) together, and became like the
[chaff](../ebd/ebd075.htm#007.md) of the summer threshingfloors; and the
wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) that smote the image became a great
mountain, and filled the whole earth.  

<span id="036">36</span> This is the [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md); and
we will tell the interpretation thereof before the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="037">37</span> Thou, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), art a
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of kings: for the God of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) hath given thee a kingdom, power, and
strength, and [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="038">38</span> And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the
beasts of the field and the fowls of the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)
hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all.
Thou art this head of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="039">39</span> And after thee shall arise another kingdom
inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md), which shall bear rule over all the
earth.  

<span id="040">40</span> And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md): forasmuch as
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md) breaketh in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md) and subdueth all things: and as
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md) that breaketh all these, shall it break in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md) and bruise.  

<span id="041">41</span> And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part
of potters' [clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004.md), and part of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md), the kingdom shall be divided; but there
shall be in it of the strength of the [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md),
forasmuch as thou sawest the [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md) mixed with
miry [clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004.md).  

<span id="042">42</span> And as the toes of the feet were part of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md), and part of
[clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004.md), so the kingdom shall be partly strong,
and partly broken.  

<span id="043">43</span> And whereas thou sawest
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md) mixed with miry
[clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004.md), they shall mingle themselves with the
seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md) is not mixed with
[clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004.md).  

<span id="044">44</span> And in the days of these kings shall the God of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) set up a kingdom, which shall never be
destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it
shall break in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md) and consume all these
kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.  

<span id="045">45</span> Forasmuch as thou sawest that the
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) was cut out of the mountain without
hands, and that it brake in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md) the
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004), the [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md), the
[clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004), the [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and
the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md); the great God hath made known to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) what shall come to pass hereafter: and the
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md) is certain, and the interpretation
thereof sure.  

<span id="046">46</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) fell upon his face, and
worshipped [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md), and commanded that they
should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.  

<span id="047">47</span> The [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) answered unto
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md), and said, Of a truth it is, that your
God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets,
seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.  

<span id="048">48</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) made
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) a great man, and gave him many great
gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), and chief of the governors over all
the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) men of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md).  

<span id="049">49</span> Then [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) requested
of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and he set
[Shadrach](../ebd/ebd330.htm#003), [Meshach](../ebd/ebd250.htm#007.md), and
[Abednego](../ebd/ebd001.htm#003.md), over the affairs of the province of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001): but [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md)
sat in the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).
