### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> And [Nadab](../ebd/ebd264.htm#008.md) and
[Abihu](../ebd/ebd003.htm#004.md), the sons of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), took either of them his
[censer](../ebd/ebd075.htm#002.md), and put fire therein, and put
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) thereon, and offered strange fire
before the LORD, which he commanded them not.  

<span id="002">2</span> And there went out fire from the LORD, and
devoured them, and they died before the LORD.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said unto
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), This is it that the LORD spake, saying,
I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the
people I will be glorified. And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) held his
peace.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) called
[Mishael](../ebd/ebd256.htm#006.md) and Elzaphan, the sons of
[Uzziel](../ebd/ebd376.htm#005.md) the uncle of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and said unto them, Come near, carry
your brethren from before the [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md) out of
the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> So they went near, and carried them in their
coats out of the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md); as
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) had said.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said unto
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and unto
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000.md) and unto
[Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005.md), his sons, Uncover not your heads,
neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the
people: but let your brethren, the whole house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), bewail the burning which the LORD hath
kindled.  

<span id="007">7</span> And ye shall not go out from the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), lest ye die: for the anointing
oil of the LORD is upon you. And they did according to the word of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), saying,  

<span id="009">9</span> Do not [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md)
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) nor strong [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md),
thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), lest ye die: it shall be a
statute for ever throughout your generations:  

<span id="010">10</span> And that ye may put difference between holy and
unholy, and between unclean and [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md);  

<span id="011">11</span> And that ye may teach the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) all the statutes which the LORD hath
spoken unto them by the hand of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) spake unto
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and unto
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000.md) and unto
[Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005.md), his sons that were left, Take the meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) that remaineth of the offerings of the
LORD made by fire, and eat it without [leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000.md)
beside the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md): for it is most holy:  

<span id="013">13</span> And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because
it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by
fire: for so I am commanded.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye
eat in a [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) place; thou, and thy sons, and
thy daughters with thee: for they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which
are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall
they bring with the offerings made by fire of the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md), to wave it for a wave
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) before the LORD; and it shall be
thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath
commanded.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) diligently
sought the [goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001.md) of the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and,
behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) and [Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005.md),
the sons of [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) which were left alive,
saying,  

<span id="017">17</span> Wherefore have ye not eaten the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) in the
holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear
the iniquity of the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), to make
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for them before the LORD?  

<span id="018">18</span> Behold, the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of
it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have eaten
it in the holy place, as I commanded.  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Behold, this day have they offered their
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) and their
burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) before the LORD; and such things
have befallen me: and if I had eaten the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) to day, should it have been accepted
in the sight of the LORD?  

<span id="020">20</span> And when [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) heard
that, he was content.
