### King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove
thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is
vanity.  

<span id="002">2</span> I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth,
What doeth it?  

<span id="003">3</span> I sought in mine heart to give myself unto
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom;
and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the
sons of men, which they should do under the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) all the days of their life.  

<span id="004">4</span> I made me great works; I builded me houses; I
planted me vineyards:  

<span id="005">5</span> I made me [gardens](../ebd/ebd143.htm#001.md) and
orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:  

<span id="006">6</span> I made me pools of water, to water therewith the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) that bringeth forth trees:  

<span id="007">7</span> I got me servants and maidens, and had servants
born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) above all that were in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) before me:  

<span id="008">8</span> I gathered me also
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and
the [peculiar](../ebd/ebd287.htm#008.md) treasure of kings and of the
provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of
the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.  

<span id="009">9</span> So I was great, and increased more than all that
were before me in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): also my wisdom
remained with me.  

<span id="010">10</span> And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not
from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced
in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then I looked on all the works that my hands
had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold,
all was vanity and vexation of [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), and
there was no profit under the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and
[madness](../ebd/ebd236.htm#002.md), and folly: for what can the man do
that cometh after the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)? even that which
hath been already done.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far
as light excelleth [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> The [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) man's eyes
are in his head; but the fool walketh in
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md): and I myself perceived also that one
event happeneth to them all.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the
fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md)? Then I said in my heart, that this also
is vanity.  

<span id="016">16</span> For there is no remembrance of the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) more than of the fool for ever; seeing
that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how
dieth the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) man? as the fool.  

<span id="017">17</span> Therefore I hated life; because the work that
is wrought under the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) is grievous unto me:
for all is vanity and vexation of [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken
under the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md): because I should leave it unto
the man that shall be after me.  

<span id="019">19</span> And who knoweth whether he shall be a
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over
all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) under the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md).
This is also vanity.  

<span id="020">20</span> Therefore I went about to cause my heart to
despair of all the labour which I took under the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom,
and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured
therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a
great evil.  

<span id="022">22</span> For what hath man of all his labour, and of the
vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md)?  

<span id="023">23</span> For all his days are sorrows, and his travail
grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also
vanity.  

<span id="024">24</span> There is nothing better for a man, than that he
should eat and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), and that he should make
his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the
hand of God.  

<span id="025">25</span> For who can eat, or who else can hasten
hereunto, more than I?  

<span id="026">26</span> For God giveth to a man that is good in his
sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth
travail, to gather and to [heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md) up, that he may
give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md).
