### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Son of man, put forth a
[riddle](../ebd/ebd313.htm#003), and speak a
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003) unto the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000);  

<span id="003">3</span> And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great
[eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003) with great wings, longwinged, full of
feathers, which had divers colours, came unto
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001), and took the highest
[branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002) of the [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007):  

<span id="004">4</span> He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and
carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.  

<span id="005">5</span> He took also of the seed of the land, and
planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it
as a willow tree.  

<span id="006">6</span> And it grew, and became a spreading
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004) of low stature, whose branches turned
toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004), and brought forth branches, and shot
forth sprigs.  

<span id="007">7</span> There was also another great
[eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003) with great wings and many feathers: and,
behold, this [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004) did bend her roots toward
him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by
the furrows of her plantation.  

<span id="008">8</span> It was planted in a good soil by great waters,
that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000), that it might be a goodly
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004).  

<span id="009">9</span> Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it
prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) thereof, that it wither? it shall wither
in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people
to pluck it up by the roots thereof.  

<span id="010">10</span> Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper?
shall it not utterly wither, when the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) wind
toucheth it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.  

<span id="011">11</span> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="012">12</span> Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not
what these things mean? tell them, Behold, the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) is
come to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and hath taken the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) thereof, and the princes thereof, and led
them with him to [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001);  

<span id="013">13</span> And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with him, and hath taken an
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) of him: he hath also taken the mighty of
the land:  

<span id="014">14</span> That the kingdom might be base, that it might
not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) it might stand.  

<span id="015">15</span> But he rebelled against him in sending his
ambassadors into [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), that they might give
him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth
such things? or shall he break the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008),
and be delivered?  

<span id="016">16</span> As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the
place where the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) dwelleth that made him
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), whose [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) he
despised, and whose [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) he brake, even
with him in the midst of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) he shall
die.  

<span id="017">17</span> Neither shall [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005)
with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by
casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:  

<span id="018">18</span> Seeing he despised the
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) by breaking the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), when, lo, he had given his hand, and
hath done all these things, he shall not escape.  

<span id="019">19</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live,
surely mine [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) that he hath despised, and my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) that he hath broken, even it will I
recompense upon his own head.  

<span id="020">20</span> And I will spread my
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002) upon him, and he shall be taken in my
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009), and I will bring him to
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and will plead with him there for his
trespass that he hath trespassed against me.  

<span id="021">21</span> And all his fugitives with all his
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003) shall fall by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and they that remain shall be scattered
toward all [winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009): and ye shall know that I the
LORD have spoken it.  

<span id="022">22</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of
the highest [branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002) of the high
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007), and will set it; I will crop off from
the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high
mountain and eminent:  

<span id="023">23</span> In the mountain of the height of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) will I plant it: and it shall bring
forth boughs, and bear [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000), and be a goodly
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007): and under it shall dwell all fowl of
every wing; in the [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) of the branches
thereof shall they dwell.  

<span id="024">24</span> And all the trees of the field shall know that
I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree,
have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I
the LORD have spoken and have done it.
