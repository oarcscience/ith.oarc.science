### King James Version: Ezra Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> And when the seventh month was come, and the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) were in the cities, the
people gathered themselves together as one man to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Then stood up [Jeshua](../ebd/ebd205.htm#003.md)
the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and
[Zerubbabel](../ebd/ebd391.htm#008.md) the son of
[Shealtiel](../ebd/ebd332.htm#003.md), and his brethren, and builded the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) of the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it
is written in the law of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) the man of
God.  

<span id="003">3</span> And they set the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md)
upon his bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those
countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even
burnt offerings morning and evening.  

<span id="004">4</span> They kept also the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) of tabernacles, as it is written, and
offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the
[custom](../ebd/ebd094.htm#008.md), as the duty of every day required;  

<span id="005">5</span> And afterward offered the continual burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), both of the new moons, and of all the
set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that
willingly offered a freewill [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) unto the
LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> From the first day of the seventh month began
they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) of the LORD was not yet laid.  

<span id="007">7</span> They gave money also unto the masons, and to the
carpenters; and meat, and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), and oil, unto
them of [Zidon](../ebd/ebd393.htm#000.md), and to them of
[Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001), to bring [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md)
trees from [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md) to the sea of
[Joppa](../ebd/ebd211.htm#002.md), according to the grant that they had of
[Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Now in the second year of their coming unto the
house of God at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), in the second month,
began [Zerubbabel](../ebd/ebd391.htm#008.md) the son of
[Shealtiel](../ebd/ebd332.htm#003), and [Jeshua](../ebd/ebd205.htm#003.md)
the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and
the Levites, and all they that were come out of the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md) unto
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md); and appointed the Levites, from
twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the
LORD.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then stood [Jeshua](../ebd/ebd205.htm#003.md) with
his sons and his brethren, [Kadmiel](../ebd/ebd215.htm#004.md) and his
sons, the sons of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), together, to set
forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of
[Henadad](../ebd/ebd174.htm#004.md), with their sons and their brethren the
Levites.  

<span id="010">10</span> And when the builders laid the foundation of
the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) of the LORD, they set the priests in
their [apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000.md) with
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md), and the Levites the sons of
[Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002) with [cymbals](../ebd/ebd095.htm#001.md), to
praise the LORD, after the ordinance of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And they sang together by course in praising
and giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is good, for his
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) endureth for ever toward
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md). And all the people shouted with a great
shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house
of the LORD was laid.  

<span id="012">12</span> But many of the priests and Levites and chief
of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house,
when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with
a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:  

<span id="013">13</span> So that the people could not discern the noise
of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the
people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.
