### King James Version: Romans Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that
know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he
liveth?  

<span id="002">2</span> For the woman which hath an husband is bound by
the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead,
she is loosed from the law of her husband.  

<span id="003">3</span> So then if, while her husband liveth, she be
married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her
husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no
adulteress, though she be married to another man.  

<span id="004">4</span> Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead
to the law by the body of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md); that ye
should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead,
that we should bring forth [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) unto God.  

<span id="005">5</span> For when we were in the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), the motions of sins, which were by the
law, did work in our members to bring forth
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) unto death.  

<span id="006">6</span> But now we are delivered from the law, that
being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), and not in the oldness of the letter.  

<span id="007">7</span> What shall we say then? Is the law
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)? God forbid. Nay, I had not known
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), but by the law: for I had not known
[lust](../ebd/ebd233.htm#005.md), except the law had said, Thou shalt not
covet.  

<span id="008">8</span> But [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), taking
occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of
[concupiscence](../ebd/ebd087.htm#008.md). For without the law
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) was dead.  

<span id="009">9</span> For I was alive without the law once: but when
the commandment came, [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) revived, and I
died.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the commandment, which was ordained to
life, I found to be unto death.  

<span id="011">11</span> For [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), taking
occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.  

<span id="012">12</span> Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment
holy, and just, and good.  

<span id="013">13</span> Was then that which is good made death unto me?
God forbid. But [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), that it might appear
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), working death in me by that which is good;
that [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) by the commandment might become
exceeding sinful.  

<span id="014">14</span> For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am
[carnal](../ebd/ebd072.htm#008.md), sold under
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> For that which I do I allow not: for what I
would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.  

<span id="016">16</span> If then I do that which I would not, I consent
unto the law that it is good.  

<span id="017">17</span> Now then it is no more I that do it, but
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) that dwelleth in me.  

<span id="018">18</span> For I know that in me (that is, in my
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007),.md) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is
present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.  

<span id="019">19</span> For the good that I would I do not: but the
evil which I would not, that I do.  

<span id="020">20</span> Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I
that do it, but [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) that dwelleth in me.  

<span id="021">21</span> I find then a law, that, when I would do good,
evil is present with me.  

<span id="022">22</span> For I delight in the law of God after the
inward man:  

<span id="023">23</span> But I see another law in my members, warring
against the law of my mind, and bringing me into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md) to the law of
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) which is in my members.  

<span id="024">24</span> O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me
from the body of this death?  

<span id="025">25</span> I thank God through
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) our Lord.
So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) the law of
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).
