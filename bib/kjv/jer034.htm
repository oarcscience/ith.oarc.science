</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.<BR>

<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Therefore the word of the LORD came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> from the LORD, saying,<BR>

<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;At the end of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> years let ye go every man his brother an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</A>, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> before me in the house which is called by my name:<BR>

<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A>, whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, to the pestilence, and to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.<BR>

<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And I will give the men that have transgressed my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, which have not performed the words of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> which they had made before me, when they cut the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</A> in twain, and passed between the parts thereof,<BR>

<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and to the beasts of the earth.<BR>

<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> a desolation without an inhabitant.<BR>
