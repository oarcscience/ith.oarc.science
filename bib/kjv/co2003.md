### King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need
we, as some others, [epistles](../ebd/ebd124.htm#000) of commendation to
you, or letters of commendation from you?  

<span id="002">2</span> Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known
and read of all men:  

<span id="003">3</span> Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be
the epistle of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) ministered by us, written
not with ink, but with the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of the living
God; not in [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) of
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), but in fleshy
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) of the heart.  

<span id="004">4</span> And such trust have we through
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) to God-ward:  

<span id="005">5</span> Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think
any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;  

<span id="006">6</span> Who also hath made us able ministers of the new
[testament](../ebd/ebd362.htm#007); not of the letter, but of the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009): for the letter killeth, but the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) giveth life.  

<span id="007">7</span> But if the ministration of death, written and
engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) could not stedfastly behold the face of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) for the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of
his countenance; which [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) was to be done
away:  

<span id="008">8</span> How shall not the ministration of the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) be rather glorious?  

<span id="009">9</span> For if the ministration of condemnation be
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006), much more doth the ministration of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) exceed in
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006).  

<span id="010">10</span> For even that which was made glorious had no
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) in this respect, by reason of the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) that excelleth.  

<span id="011">11</span> For if that which is done away was glorious,
much more that which remaineth is glorious.  

<span id="012">12</span> Seeing then that we have such hope, we use
great plainness of speech:  

<span id="013">13</span> And not as [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003),
which put a vail over his face, that the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) could not stedfastly look to the end of
that which is abolished:  

<span id="014">14</span> But their minds were blinded: for until this
day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old
[testament](../ebd/ebd362.htm#007); which vail is done away in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="015">15</span> But even unto this day, when
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) is read, the vail is upon their heart.  

<span id="016">16</span> Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord,
the vail shall be taken away.  

<span id="017">17</span> Now the Lord is that
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009): and where the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of the Lord is, there is liberty.  

<span id="018">18</span> But we all, with open face beholding as in a
glass the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the Lord, are changed into
the same image from [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) to
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006), even as by the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of the LORD.
