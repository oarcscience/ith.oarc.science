### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 40

<span id="001">1</span> The word that came to
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) from the LORD, after that
[Nebuzaradan](../ebd/ebd268.htm#008.md) the captain of the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md) had let him go from
[Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005.md), when he had taken him being bound in
chains among all that were carried away [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001.md)
of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) and
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), which were carried away
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001.md) unto
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the captain of the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009) took [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md),
and said unto him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this
place.  

<span id="003">3</span> Now the LORD hath brought it, and done according
as he hath said: because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not
obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.  

<span id="004">4</span> And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the
chains which were upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come
with me into [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), come; and I will look
well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), forbear: behold, all the land is
before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go,
thither go.  

<span id="005">5</span> Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go
back also to [Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009.md) the son of
[Ahikam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#001.md) the son of
[Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004), whom the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md) hath made governor over the cities
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and dwell with him among the people:
or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captain
of the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md) gave him victuals and a reward,
and let him go.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then went [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) unto
[Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009.md) the son of
[Ahikam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#001) to [Mizpah](../ebd/ebd258.htm#000.md); and
dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.  

<span id="007">7</span> Now when all the captains of the
[forces](../ebd/ebd137.htm#000.md) which were in the fields, even they and
their men, heard that the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md) had made
[Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009.md) the son of
[Ahikam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#001.md) governor in the land, and had committed
unto him men, and women, and children, and of the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) of the land, of them that were not carried
away [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001.md) to
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md);  

<span id="008">8</span> Then they came to
[Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009) to [Mizpah](../ebd/ebd258.htm#000.md),
even [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md) the son of
[Nethaniah](../ebd/ebd271.htm#004), and [Johanan](../ebd/ebd208.htm#009.md)
and [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) the sons of
[Kareah](../ebd/ebd215.htm#007), and [Seraiah](../ebd/ebd328.htm#003.md)
the son of [Tanhumeth](../ebd/ebd358.htm#006.md), and the sons of Ephai the
Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their
men.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009.md) the son of
[Ahikam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#001.md) the son of
[Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004.md) sware unto them and to their men,
saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md),
and it shall be well with you.  

<span id="010">10</span> As for me, behold, I will dwell at
[Mizpah](../ebd/ebd258.htm#000.md), to serve the Chaldeans, which will come
unto us: but ye, gather ye [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), and summer
fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities
that ye have taken.  

<span id="011">11</span> Likewise when all the Jews that were in
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), and among the Ammonites, and in
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md), and that were in all the countries, heard
that the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md) had left a remnant of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and that he had set over them
[Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009.md) the son of
[Ahikam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#001.md) the son of
[Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004.md);  

<span id="012">12</span> Even all the Jews returned out of all places
whither they were driven, and came to the land of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), to [Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009.md),
unto [Mizpah](../ebd/ebd258.htm#000.md), and gathered
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) and summer fruits very much.  

<span id="013">13</span> Moreover [Johanan](../ebd/ebd208.htm#009.md) the
son of [Kareah](../ebd/ebd215.htm#007.md), and all the captains of the
[forces](../ebd/ebd137.htm#000.md) that were in the fields, came to
[Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009) to [Mizpah](../ebd/ebd258.htm#000.md),  

<span id="014">14</span> And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know
that [Baalis](../ebd/ebd039.htm#008) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
of the Ammonites hath sent [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md) the son of
[Nethaniah](../ebd/ebd271.htm#004.md) to slay thee? But
[Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009.md) the son of
[Ahikam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#001.md) believed them not.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then [Johanan](../ebd/ebd208.htm#009.md) the son
of [Kareah](../ebd/ebd215.htm#007.md) spake to
[Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009) in [Mizpah](../ebd/ebd258.htm#000.md)
secretly saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay
[Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md) the son of
[Nethaniah](../ebd/ebd271.htm#004.md), and no man shall know it: wherefore
should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee
should be scattered, and the remnant in [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)
perish?  

<span id="016">16</span> But [Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009.md) the son
of [Ahikam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#001.md) said unto
[Johanan](../ebd/ebd208.htm#009.md) the son of
[Kareah](../ebd/ebd215.htm#007.md), Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou
speakest falsely of [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md).
