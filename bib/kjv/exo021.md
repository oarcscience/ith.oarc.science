### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set
before them.  

<span id="002">2</span> If thou buy an [Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009)
servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out
free for nothing.  

<span id="003">3</span> If he came in by himself, he shall go out by
himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.  

<span id="004">4</span> If his master have given him a wife, and she
have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her
master's, and he shall go out by himself.  

<span id="005">5</span> And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my
master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:  

<span id="006">6</span> Then his master shall bring him unto the judges;
he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door
[post](../ebd/ebd299.htm#001); and his master shall bore his
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) through with an aul; and he shall serve him
for ever.  

<span id="007">7</span> And if a man sell his daughter to be a
maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.  

<span id="008">8</span> If she please not her master, who hath betrothed
her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a
strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully
with her.  

<span id="009">9</span> And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he
shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.  

<span id="010">10</span> If he take him another wife; her food, her
raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.  

<span id="011">11</span> And if he do not these three unto her, then
shall she go out free without money.  

<span id="012">12</span> He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be
surely put to death.  

<span id="013">13</span> And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver
him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall
flee.  

<span id="014">14</span> But if a man come presumptuously upon his
neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), that he may die.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he that smiteth his father, or his mother,
shall be surely put to death.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or
if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he that curseth his father, or his mother,
shall surely be put to death.  

<span id="018">18</span> And if men strive together, and one smite
another with a [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), or with his fist, and he
die not, but keepeth his bed:  

<span id="019">19</span> If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his
staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the
loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.  

<span id="020">20</span> And if a man smite his servant, or his maid,
with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.  

<span id="021">21</span> Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two,
he shall not be punished: for he is his money.  

<span id="022">22</span> If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so
that her [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) depart from her, and yet no
mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's
husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.  

<span id="023">23</span> And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt
give life for life,  

<span id="024">24</span> Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand,
foot for foot,  

<span id="025">25</span> Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe
for stripe.  

<span id="026">26</span> And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or
the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his
eye's sake.  

<span id="027">27</span> And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or
his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's
sake.  

<span id="028">28</span> If an [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) gore a man or
a woman, that they die: then the [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) shall be
surely stoned, and his [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) shall not be
eaten; but the owner of the [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) shall be quit.  

<span id="029">29</span> But if the [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) were
wont to push with his [horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003) in time past, and it
hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that
he hath killed a man or a woman; the [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) shall
be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.  

<span id="030">30</span> If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he
shall give for the [ransom](../ebd/ebd307.htm#005) of his life
whatsoever is laid upon him.  

<span id="031">31</span> Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a
daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.  

<span id="032">32</span> If the [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) shall push a
manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty
shekels of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and the
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) shall be stoned.  

<span id="033">33</span> And if a man shall open a
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007), or if a man shall dig a
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007), and not cover it, and an
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) or an [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001) fall
therein;  

<span id="034">34</span> The owner of the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007)
shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) shall be his.  

<span id="035">35</span> And if one man's [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007)
hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell the live
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007), and divide the money of it; and the dead
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) also they shall divide.  

<span id="036">36</span> Or if it be known that the
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) hath used to push in time past, and his
owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) for [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007); and the
dead shall be his own.
