<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 1</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd363.htm#008">Theophilus</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;THERE was in the days of Herod, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of Judaea, a certain <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#006">Zacharias</A>, of the course of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd002.htm#002">Abia</A>: and his wife was of the daughters of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A>, and her name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#008">Elisabeth</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And they had no child, because that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#008">Elisabeth</A> was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</A>, and they both were now well stricken in years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;According to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</A> of the priest's office, his lot was to burn <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> when he went into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And there appeared unto him an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the Lord standing on the right side of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#006">Zacharias</A> saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> said unto him, Fear not, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#006">Zacharias</A>: for thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> is heard; and thy wife <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#008">Elisabeth</A> shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#002">birth</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> neither <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> nor strong <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>; and he shall be filled with the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>, even from his mother's womb.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And many of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> shall he turn to the Lord their God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And he shall go before him in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> and power of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</A>, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#006">Zacharias</A> said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A>, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> answering said unto him, I am <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#006">Gabriel</A>, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And, behold, thou shalt be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</A>, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And the people waited for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#006">Zacharias</A>, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And after those days his wife <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#008">Elisabeth</A> conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And in the sixth month the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#006">Gabriel</A> was sent from God unto a city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;To a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</A> espoused to a man whose name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>; and the virgin's name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> came in unto her, and said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">Hail</A>, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#002">salutation</A> this should be.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> said unto her, Fear not, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A>: for thou hast found favour with God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">JESUS</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of his father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And he shall reign over the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A>, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> answered and said unto her, The Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And, behold, thy cousin <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#008">Elisabeth</A>, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;For with God nothing shall be impossible.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> said, Behold the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A> of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> departed from her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#006">Juda</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And entered into the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#006">Zacharias</A>, and saluted <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#008">Elisabeth</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#008">Elisabeth</A> heard the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#002">salutation</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd040.htm#009">babe</A> leaped in her womb; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#008">Elisabeth</A> was filled with the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of thy womb.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#002">salutation</A> sounded in mine ears, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd040.htm#009">babe</A> leaped in my womb for joy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;And my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> hath rejoiced in God my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;And his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> is on them that fear him from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="053">53</A>&nbsp;He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="054">54</A>&nbsp;He hath holpen his servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, in remembrance of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="055">55</A>&nbsp;As he spake to our fathers, to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, and to his seed for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="056">56</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="057">57</A>&nbsp;Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="058">58</A>&nbsp;And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> upon her; and they rejoiced with her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="059">59</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#006">Zacharias</A>, after the name of his father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="060">60</A>&nbsp;And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="061">61</A>&nbsp;And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="062">62</A>&nbsp;And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="063">63</A>&nbsp;And he asked for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A> table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="064">64</A>&nbsp;And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="065">65</A>&nbsp;And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="066">66</A>&nbsp;And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="067">67</A>&nbsp;And his father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#006">Zacharias</A> was filled with the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>, and prophesied, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="068">68</A>&nbsp;Blessed be the Lord God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="069">69</A>&nbsp;And hath raised up an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> for us in the house of his servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="070">70</A>&nbsp;As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="071">71</A>&nbsp;That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="072">72</A>&nbsp;To perform the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="073">73</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A> which he sware to our father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="074">74</A>&nbsp;That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="075">75</A>&nbsp;In <A HREF="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> before him, all the days of our life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="076">76</A>&nbsp;And thou, child, shalt be called the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="077">77</A>&nbsp;To give knowledge of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> unto his people by the remission of their sins,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="078">78</A>&nbsp;Through the tender <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> of our God; whereby the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#009">dayspring</A> from on high hath visited us,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="079">79</A>&nbsp;To give light to them that sit in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> and in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="080">80</A>&nbsp;And the child grew, and waxed strong in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
