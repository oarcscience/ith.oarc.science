### King James Version: 1 John Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Beloved, believe not every
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), but try the spirits whether they are of
God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.  

<span id="002">2</span> Hereby know ye the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of God: Every
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) that confesseth that
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) is come
in the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) is of God:  

<span id="003">3</span> And every [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) that
confesseth not that [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) is come in the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) is not of God: and this is that
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of [antichrist](../ebd/ebd025.htm#000),
whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in
the world.  

<span id="004">4</span> Ye are of God, little children, and have
overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in
the world.  

<span id="005">5</span> They are of the world: therefore speak they of
the world, and the world heareth them.  

<span id="006">6</span> We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us;
he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of truth, and the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of error.  

<span id="007">7</span> Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of
God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.  

<span id="008">8</span> He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is
love.  

<span id="009">9</span> In this was manifested the love of God toward
us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we
might live through him.  

<span id="010">10</span> Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that
he loved us, and sent his Son to be the
[propitiation](../ebd/ebd300.htm#009) for our sins.  

<span id="011">11</span> Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to
love one another.  

<span id="012">12</span> No man hath seen God at any time. If we love
one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.  

<span id="013">13</span> Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in
us, because he hath given us of his [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009).  

<span id="014">14</span> And we have seen and do testify that the Father
sent the Son to be the [Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003) of the world.  

<span id="015">15</span> Whosoever shall confess that
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him,
and he in God.  

<span id="016">16</span> And we have known and believed the love that
God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
God, and God in him.  

<span id="017">17</span> Herein is our love made perfect, that we may
have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in
this world.  

<span id="018">18</span> There is no fear in love; but perfect love
casteth out fear: because fear hath [torment](../ebd/ebd370.htm#009). He
that feareth is not made perfect in love.  

<span id="019">19</span> We love him, because he first loved us.  

<span id="020">20</span> If a man say, I love God, and hateth his
brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath
seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?  

<span id="021">21</span> And this commandment have we from him, That he
who loveth God love his brother also.
