### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> When a man hath taken a wife, and married her,
and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath
found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of
divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.  

<span id="002">2</span> And when she is departed out of his house, she
may go and be another man's wife.  

<span id="003">3</span> And if the latter husband hate her, and write
her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her
out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his
wife;  

<span id="004">4</span> Her former husband, which sent her away, may not
take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md) before the LORD: and thou shalt not
cause the land to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), which the LORD thy God
giveth thee for an inheritance.  

<span id="005">5</span> When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not
go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: but he
shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he
hath taken.  

<span id="006">6</span> No man shall take the nether or the upper
millstone to [pledge](../ebd/ebd297.htm#005.md): for he taketh a man's life
to [pledge](../ebd/ebd297.htm#005.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> If a man be found
[stealing](../ebd/ebd352.htm#001.md) any of his brethren of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and maketh merchandise of him, or
selleth him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away
from among you.  

<span id="008">8</span> Take heed in the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md)
of [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md), that thou observe diligently, and
do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I
commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.  

<span id="009">9</span> Remember what the LORD thy God did unto
[Miriam](../ebd/ebd256.htm#003.md) by the way, after that ye were come
forth out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou
shalt not go into his house to fetch his
[pledge](../ebd/ebd297.htm#005.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom
thou dost lend shall bring out the [pledge](../ebd/ebd297.htm#005.md)
abroad unto thee.  

<span id="012">12</span> And if the man be
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), thou shalt not sleep with his
[pledge](../ebd/ebd297.htm#005.md):  

<span id="013">13</span> In any case thou shalt deliver him the
[pledge](../ebd/ebd297.htm#005.md) again when the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) goeth down, that he may sleep in his own
raiment, and [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) thee: and it shall be
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) unto thee before the LORD thy
God.  

<span id="014">14</span> Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) and needy, whether he be of thy brethren,
or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates:  

<span id="015">15</span> At his day thou shalt give him his hire,
neither shall the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) go down upon it; for he
is [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), and setteth his heart upon it: lest he
cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
unto thee.  

<span id="016">16</span> The fathers shall not be put to death for the
children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers:
every man shall be put to death for his own
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md), nor of the fatherless; nor take a
widow's raiment to [pledge](../ebd/ebd297.htm#005.md):  

<span id="018">18</span> But thou shalt remember that thou wast a
bondman in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and the LORD thy God redeemed
thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.  

<span id="019">19</span> When thou cuttest down thine
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md) in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf
in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md), for the fatherless, and for the
widow: that the LORD thy God may [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) thee in
all the work of thine hands.  

<span id="020">20</span> When thou beatest thine
[olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009.md) tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs
again: it shall be for the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md), for the
fatherless, and for the widow.  

<span id="021">21</span> When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard,
thou shalt not [glean](../ebd/ebd150.htm#003.md) it afterward: it shall be
for the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md), for the fatherless, and for
the widow.  

<span id="022">22</span> And thou shalt remember that thou wast a
bondman in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): therefore I
command thee to do this thing.
