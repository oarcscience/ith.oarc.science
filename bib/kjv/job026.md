### King James Version: Job Chapter 26

<span id="001">1</span> But Job answered and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> How hast thou helped him that is without power?
how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?  

<span id="003">3</span> How hast thou counselled him that hath no
wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?  

<span id="004">4</span> To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) came from thee?  

<span id="005">5</span> Dead things are formed from under the waters,
and the inhabitants thereof.  

<span id="006">6</span> [Hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003) is
[naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003) before him, and
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) hath no covering.  

<span id="007">7</span> He stretcheth out the north over the empty
place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.  

<span id="008">8</span> He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds;
and the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) is not
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007) under them.  

<span id="009">9</span> He holdeth back the face of his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001), and spreadeth his
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) upon it.  

<span id="010">10</span> He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until
the day and night come to an end.  

<span id="011">11</span> The pillars of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006)
tremble and are astonished at his reproof.  

<span id="012">12</span> He divideth the sea with his power, and by his
understanding he smiteth through the proud.  

<span id="013">13</span> By his [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) he hath
garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009).  

<span id="014">14</span> Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little
a portion is heard of him? but the [thunder](../ebd/ebd365.htm#003) of
his power who can understand?
