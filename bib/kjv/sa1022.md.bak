### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) therefore
departed thence, and escaped to the [cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006.md)
[Adullam](../ebd/ebd010.htm#007.md): and when his brethren and all his
father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.  

<span id="002">2</span> And every one that was in distress, and every
one that was in [debt](../ebd/ebd099.htm#009.md), and every one that was
discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over
them: and there were with him about four hundred men.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) went thence
to Mizpeh of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md): and he said unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), Let my
father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I
know what God will do for me.  

<span id="004">4</span> And he brought them before the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md): and they
dwelt with him all the while that [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) was in
the hold.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md)
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007) said unto [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md),
Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007). Then [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
departed, and came into the [forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006.md) of
[Hareth](../ebd/ebd164.htm#000.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> When [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) heard that
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) was discovered, and the men that were
with him, (now [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) abode in
[Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008.md) under a tree in
[Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005.md), having his spear in his hand, and all
his servants were standing about him;)  

<span id="007">7</span> Then [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said unto his
servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of
[Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005.md) give every one of you fields and
vineyards, and make you all captains of
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md), and captains of hundreds;  

<span id="008">8</span> That all of you have conspired against me, and
there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a
[league](../ebd/ebd225.htm#005.md) with the son of
[Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005.md), and there is none of you that is sorry
for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant
against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?  

<span id="009">9</span> Then answered [Doeg](../ebd/ebd105.htm#006.md) the
Edomite, which was set over the servants of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), and said, I saw the son of
[Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005) coming to [Nob](../ebd/ebd274.htm#003.md),
to [Ahimelech](../ebd/ebd014.htm#004.md) the son of
[Ahitub](../ebd/ebd015.htm#001.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave
him victuals, and gave him the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) of
[Goliath](../ebd/ebd152.htm#005.md) the Philistine.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) sent to
call [Ahimelech](../ebd/ebd014.htm#004.md) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), the son of
[Ahitub](../ebd/ebd015.htm#001.md), and all his father's house, the priests
that were in [Nob](../ebd/ebd274.htm#003.md): and they came all of them to
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said, Hear
now, thou son of [Ahitub](../ebd/ebd015.htm#001.md). And he answered, Here
I am, my lord.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said unto
him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of
[Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005.md), in that thou hast given him
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md),
and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie
in wait, as at this day?  

<span id="014">14</span> Then [Ahimelech](../ebd/ebd014.htm#004.md)
answered the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and said, And who is so
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md) among all thy servants as
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), which is the king's son in law, and
goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?  

<span id="015">15</span> Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be
it far from me: let not the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) impute any
thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy
servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said,
Thou shalt surely die, [Ahimelech](../ebd/ebd014.htm#004.md), thou, and all
thy father's house.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said unto
the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the
LORD: because their hand also is with [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md),
and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the
servants of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) would not put forth their
hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said to
[Doeg](../ebd/ebd105.htm#006.md), Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And
[Doeg](../ebd/ebd105.htm#006.md) the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the
priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008) [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Nob](../ebd/ebd274.htm#003.md), the city of
the priests, smote he with the edge of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), both men and women, children and
sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), with
the edge of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And one of the sons of
[Ahimelech](../ebd/ebd014.htm#004.md) the son of
[Ahitub](../ebd/ebd015.htm#001.md), named
[Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005.md), escaped, and fled after
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005.md) shewed
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) that [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) had
slain the LORD's priests.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said unto
[Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005.md), I knew it that day, when
[Doeg](../ebd/ebd105.htm#006.md) the Edomite was there, that he would
surely tell [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md): I have occasioned the death
of all the persons of thy father's house.  

<span id="023">23</span> Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that
seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in
safeguard.
