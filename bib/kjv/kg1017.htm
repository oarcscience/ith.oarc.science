</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd079.htm#002">Cherith</A>, that is before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And it shall be, that thou shalt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A>; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd079.htm#002">Cherith</A>, that is before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the ravens brought him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> in the morning, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> in the evening; and he drank of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after a while, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A> dried up, because there had been no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> in the land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Arise, get thee to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd387.htm#006">Zarephath</A>, which belongeth to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd393.htm#000">Zidon</A>, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;So he arose and went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd387.htm#006">Zarephath</A>. And when he came to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> in thine hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#009">cake</A>, but an handful of meal in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#006">barrel</A>, and a little oil in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#004">cruse</A>: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#008">dress</A> it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#009">cake</A> first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#006">barrel</A> of meal shall not waste, neither shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#004">cruse</A> of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> upon the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And she went and did according to the saying of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A>: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#006">barrel</A> of meal wasted not, neither did the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#004">cruse</A> of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And she said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A>, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> to remembrance, and to slay my son?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</A>, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And the LORD heard the voice of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A>; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> took the child, and brought him down out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A> into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> said, See, thy son liveth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the woman said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A>, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.<BR>
