### King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> Who is as the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) man?
and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his
face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.  

<span id="002">2</span> I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment,
and that in regard of the [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) of God.  

<span id="003">3</span> Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not
in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.  

<span id="004">4</span> Where the word of a
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) is, there is power: and who may say unto
him, What doest thou?  

<span id="005">5</span> Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil
thing: and a [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) man's heart discerneth both
time and judgment.  

<span id="006">6</span> Because to every purpose there is time and
judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.  

<span id="007">7</span> For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who
can tell him when it shall be?  

<span id="008">8</span> There is no man that hath power over the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) to retain the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009); neither hath he power in the day of
death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness
deliver those that are given to it.  

<span id="009">9</span> All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto
every work that is done under the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001): there is
a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.  

<span id="010">10</span> And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come
and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city
where they had so done: this is also vanity.  

<span id="011">11</span> Because sentence against an evil work is not
executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set
in them to do evil.  

<span id="012">12</span> Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and
his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them
that fear God, which fear before him:  

<span id="013">13</span> But it shall not be well with the wicked,
neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002); because he feareth not before God.  

<span id="014">14</span> There is a vanity which is done upon the earth;
that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of
the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according
to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no
better thing under the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), than to eat, and to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), and to be merry: for that shall abide
with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under
the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001).  

<span id="016">16</span> When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and
to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that
neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)  

<span id="017">17</span> Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man
cannot find out the work that is done under the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001): because though a man labour to seek it
out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther; though a
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) man think to know it, yet shall he not be
able to find it.
