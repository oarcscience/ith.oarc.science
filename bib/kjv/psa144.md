### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 144

<span id="001">1</span> Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth
my hands to war, and my fingers to fight:  

<span id="002">2</span> My [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000), and my
fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001), and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my
people under me.  

<span id="003">3</span> LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of
him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!  

<span id="004">4</span> Man is like to vanity: his days are as a
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) that passeth away.  

<span id="005">5</span> [Bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) thy heavens, O
LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.  

<span id="006">6</span> Cast forth [lightning](../ebd/ebd229.htm#002),
and scatter them: shoot out thine [arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005), and
destroy them.  

<span id="007">7</span> Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver
me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;  

<span id="008">8</span> Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right
hand is a right hand of falsehood.  

<span id="009">9</span> I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a
[psaltery](../ebd/ebd301.htm#006) and an instrument of ten strings will
I sing praises unto thee.  

<span id="010">10</span> It is he that giveth
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) unto kings: who delivereth
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) his servant from the hurtful
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="011">11</span> Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange
children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right
hand of falsehood:  

<span id="012">12</span> That our sons may be as plants grown up in
their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after
the similitude of a [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008):  

<span id="013">13</span> That our garners may be full, affording all
manner of store: that our [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) may bring forth
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008) and ten
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008) in our streets:  

<span id="014">14</span> That our oxen may be strong to labour; that
there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in
our streets.  

<span id="015">15</span> Happy is that people, that is in such a case:
yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD.
