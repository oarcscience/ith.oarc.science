### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 42

<span id="001">1</span> Then he brought me forth into the utter court,
the way toward the north: and he brought me into the
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md) that was over against the separate
place, and which was before the building toward the north.  

<span id="002">2</span> Before the length of an hundred cubits was the
north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.  

<span id="003">3</span> Over against the twenty cubits which were for
the inner court, and over against the [pavement](../ebd/ebd287.htm#003.md)
which was for the utter court, was [gallery](../ebd/ebd142.htm#002.md)
against [gallery](../ebd/ebd142.htm#002.md) in three stories.  

<span id="004">4</span> And before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits
breadth inward, a way of one [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md); and their
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) toward the north.  

<span id="005">5</span> Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the
galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the
middlemost of the building.  

<span id="006">6</span> For they were in three stories, but had not
pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the building was
straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the wall that was without over against the
chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the
length thereof was fifty cubits.  

<span id="008">8</span> For the length of the chambers that were in the
utter court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) were an hundred cubits.  

<span id="009">9</span> And from under these chambers was the entry on
the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) side, as one goeth into them from the
utter court.  

<span id="010">10</span> The chambers were in the thickness of the wall
of the court toward the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md), over against the
separate place, and over against the building.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the way before them was like the appearance
of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as
broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to their
fashions, and according to their [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And according to the
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) of the chambers that were toward the
south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before
the wall toward the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md), as one entereth into
them.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then said he unto me, The north chambers and
the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy
chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the
most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the
meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and the
trespass [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md); for the place is holy.  

<span id="014">14</span> When the priests enter therein, then shall they
not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall
lay their garments wherein they [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md); for
they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to
those things which are for the people.  

<span id="015">15</span> Now when he had made an end of measuring the
inner house, he brought me forth toward the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) whose prospect is toward the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md), and measured it round about.  

<span id="016">16</span> He measured the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md)
side with the measuring [reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000.md), five hundred
reeds, with the measuring [reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000.md) round about.  

<span id="017">17</span> He measured the north side, five hundred reeds,
with the measuring [reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000.md) round about.  

<span id="018">18</span> He measured the south side, five hundred reeds,
with the measuring [reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> He turned about to the west side, and measured
five hundred reeds with the measuring [reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall
round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a
separation between the [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md) and the
profane place.
