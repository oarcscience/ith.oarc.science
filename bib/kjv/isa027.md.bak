### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 27

<span id="001">1</span> In that day the LORD with his sore and great and
strong [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) shall punish
[leviathan](../ebd/ebd227.htm#007.md) the piercing
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009.md), even
[leviathan](../ebd/ebd227.htm#007.md) that crooked
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009.md); and he shall slay the
[dragon](../ebd/ebd107.htm#000.md) that is in the sea.  

<span id="002">2</span> In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every
moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.  

<span id="004">4</span> [Fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md) is not in me: who
would set the briers and thorns against me in battle? I would go through
them, I would burn them together.  

<span id="005">5</span> Or let him take hold of my strength, that he may
make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me.  

<span id="006">6</span> He shall cause them that come of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) to take root:
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) shall blossom and bud, and fill the face
of the world with [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that
smote him? or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are
slain by him?  

<span id="008">8</span> In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt
debate with it: he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) wind.  

<span id="009">9</span> By this therefore shall the iniquity of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) be purged; and this is all the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) to take away his
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md); when he maketh all the stones of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder,
the groves and images shall not stand up.  

<span id="010">10</span> Yet the defenced city shall be desolate, and
the [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md) forsaken, and left like a
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md): there shall the
[calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004.md) feed, and there shall he lie down, and
consume the branches thereof.  

<span id="011">11</span> When the boughs thereof are withered, they
shall be broken off: the women come, and set them on fire: for it is a
people of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) on them, and he that formed them will
shew them no favour.  

<span id="012">12</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the
LORD shall beat off from the [channel](../ebd/ebd077.htm#002.md) of the
river unto the stream of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and ye shall be
gathered one by one, O ye children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the
great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to
perish in the land of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md), and the outcasts
in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and shall
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) the LORD in the holy
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).
