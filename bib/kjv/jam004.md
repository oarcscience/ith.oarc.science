### King James Version: James Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> From whence come wars and fightings among you?
come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?  

<span id="002">2</span> Ye [lust](../ebd/ebd233.htm#005.md), and have not:
ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye
have not, because ye ask not.  

<span id="003">3</span> Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss,
that ye may consume it upon your lusts.  

<span id="004">4</span> Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that
the friendship of the world is [enmity](../ebd/ebd121.htm#003.md) with God?
whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.  

<span id="005">5</span> Do ye think that the
[scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005.md) saith in vain, The
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?  

<span id="006">6</span> But he giveth more
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md). Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the
proud, but giveth [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) unto the humble.  

<span id="007">7</span> Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md), and he will flee from you.  

<span id="008">8</span> Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.
Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double
minded.  

<span id="009">9</span> Be afflicted, and
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004.md), and weep: let your laughter be turned to
mourning, and your joy to heaviness.  

<span id="010">10</span> Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and
he shall lift you up.  

<span id="011">11</span> Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He
that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh
evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) the law, thou art not a doer of the law,
but a [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and
to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?  

<span id="013">13</span> Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we
will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell,
and get gain:  

<span id="014">14</span> Whereas ye know not what shall be on the
morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a
little time, and then vanisheth away.  

<span id="015">15</span> For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we
shall live, and do this, or that.  

<span id="016">16</span> But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such
rejoicing is evil.  

<span id="017">17</span> Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and
doeth it not, to him it is [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).
