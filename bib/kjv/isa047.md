### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 47

<span id="001">1</span> Come down, and sit in the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008), O [virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009.md)
daughter of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), sit on the ground: there
is no [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), O daughter of the Chaldeans: for
thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.  

<span id="002">2</span> Take the millstones, and
[grind](../ebd/ebd155.htm#006.md) meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the
leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.  

<span id="003">3</span> Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame
shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a
man.  

<span id="004">4</span> As for our [redeemer](../ebd/ebd308.htm#008.md),
the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Sit thou silent, and get thee into
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou
shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.  

<span id="006">6</span> I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine
inheritance, and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md); upon the ancient hast thou very heavily
laid thy [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so
that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst
remember the latter end of it.  

<span id="008">8</span> Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to
pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am,
and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I
know the loss of children:  

<span id="009">9</span> But these two things shall come to thee in a
moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come
upon thee in their [perfection](../ebd/ebd290.htm#001.md) for the multitude
of thy sorceries, and for the great abundance of thine
[enchantments](../ebd/ebd120.htm#004.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou
hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath
perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else
beside me.  

<span id="011">11</span> Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt
not know from whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou
shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon thee
suddenly, which thou shalt not know.  

<span id="012">12</span> Stand now with thine
[enchantments](../ebd/ebd120.htm#004.md), and with the multitude of thy
sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou
shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy
counsels. Let now the astrologers, the
[stargazers](../ebd/ebd350.htm#007.md), the monthly prognosticators, stand
up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee.  

<span id="014">14</span> Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire
shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the
flame: there shall not be a [coal](../ebd/ebd085.htm#003.md) to warm at,
nor fire to sit before it.  

<span id="015">15</span> Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou
hast laboured, even thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander
every one to his quarter; none shall save thee.
