### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, when
[Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) had established the kingdom, and had
strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) with him.  

<span id="002">2</span> And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) Shishak
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) came up
against [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), because they had
transgressed against the LORD,  

<span id="003">3</span> With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore
thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him
out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md); the
[Lubims](../ebd/ebd232.htm#004), the [Sukkiims](../ebd/ebd353.htm#000.md),
and the Ethiopians.  

<span id="004">4</span> And he took the fenced cities which pertained to
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and came to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Then came [Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005.md) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) to [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md),
and to the princes of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), that were gathered
together to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) because of Shishak, and
said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore
have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.  

<span id="006">6</span> Whereupon the princes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when the LORD saw that they humbled
themselves, the word of the LORD came to
[Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005.md), saying, They have humbled themselves;
therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some
deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) by the hand of Shishak.  

<span id="008">8</span> Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that
they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the
countries.  

<span id="009">9</span> So Shishak [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) came up against
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and took away the treasures of the
house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all:
he carried away also the shields of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) which
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) had made.  

<span id="010">10</span> Instead of which [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) made shields of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md), and committed them to the hands of the
chief of the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md), that kept the entrance of
the king's house.  

<span id="011">11</span> And when the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
entered into the house of the LORD, the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md)
came and fetched them, and brought them again into the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009) [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the
LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also
in [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) things went well.  

<span id="013">13</span> So [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) strengthened himself in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and reigned: for
[Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) was one and forty years old when he
began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), the city which the LORD had
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) out of all the tribes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), to put his name there. And his mother's
name was [Naamah](../ebd/ebd263.htm#008.md) an Ammonitess.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he did evil, because he prepared not his
heart to seek the LORD.  

<span id="015">15</span> Now the acts of
[Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md), first and last, are they not written
in the book of [Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005.md) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), and of [Iddo](../ebd/ebd186.htm#005.md)
the [seer](../ebd/ebd326.htm#000.md) concerning genealogies? And there were
wars between [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) and
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) continually.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) slept
with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004): and [Abijah](../ebd/ebd003.htm#006.md) his
son reigned in his stead.
