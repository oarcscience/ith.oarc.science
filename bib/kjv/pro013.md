### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> A [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) son heareth his
father's instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke.  

<span id="002">2</span> A man shall eat good by the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of his mouth: but the soul of the
transgressors shall eat violence.  

<span id="003">3</span> He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: but
he that openeth wide his lips shall have
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath
nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> A righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man
is loathsome, and cometh to shame.  

<span id="006">6</span> [Righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) keepeth
him that is upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the
sinner.  

<span id="007">7</span> There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath
nothing: there is that maketh himself [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), yet
hath great riches.  

<span id="008">8</span> The [ransom](../ebd/ebd307.htm#005.md) of a man's
life are his riches: but the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) heareth not
rebuke.  

<span id="009">9</span> The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the
[lamp](../ebd/ebd223.htm#007.md) of the wicked shall be put out.  

<span id="010">10</span> Only by pride cometh contention: but with the
well advised is wisdom.  

<span id="011">11</span> Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished:
but he that gathereth by labour shall increase.  

<span id="012">12</span> Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when
the desire cometh, it is a tree of life.  

<span id="013">13</span> Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed:
but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.  

<span id="014">14</span> The law of the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) is
a [fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md) of life, to depart from the snares
of death.  

<span id="015">15</span> Good understanding giveth favour: but the way
of transgressors is hard.  

<span id="016">16</span> Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a
fool layeth open his folly.  

<span id="017">17</span> A wicked [messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005.md)
falleth into mischief: but a [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md)
[ambassador](../ebd/ebd019.htm#008.md) is health.  

<span id="018">18</span> Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth
instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.  

<span id="019">19</span> The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul:
but it is [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md) to fools to depart from
evil.  

<span id="020">20</span> He that walketh with
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) men shall be
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md): but a companion of fools shall be
destroyed.  

<span id="021">21</span> Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous
good shall be repayed.  

<span id="022">22</span> A good man leaveth an inheritance to his
children's children: and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the
just.  

<span id="023">23</span> Much food is in the tillage of the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md): but there is that is destroyed for want
of judgment.  

<span id="024">24</span> He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he
that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.  

<span id="025">25</span> The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his
soul: but the [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000.md) of the wicked shall want.
