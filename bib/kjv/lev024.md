### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Command the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that they bring unto thee pure oil
[olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009) beaten for the light, to cause the lamps
to burn continually.  

<span id="003">3</span> Without the vail of the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008), in the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), shall
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) order it from the evening unto the
morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for ever in
your generations.  

<span id="004">4</span> He shall order the lamps upon the pure
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001) before the LORD continually.  

<span id="005">5</span> And thou shalt take fine
[flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001), and [bake](../ebd/ebd042.htm#001) twelve
cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one
[cake](../ebd/ebd068.htm#009).  

<span id="006">6</span> And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a
row, upon the pure table before the LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> And thou shalt put pure
[frankincense](../ebd/ebd138.htm#004) upon each row, that it may be on
the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) for a memorial, even an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) made by fire unto the LORD.  

<span id="008">8</span> Every [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) he shall
set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) by an
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007)
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008).  

<span id="009">9</span> And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they
shall eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the
offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose
father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and this son of the Israelitish woman
and a man of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) strove together in the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002);  

<span id="011">11</span> And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the
name of the Lord, and cursed. And they brought him unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003): (and his mother's name was Shelomith,
the daughter of Dibri, of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009):)  

<span id="012">12</span> And they put him in
[ward](../ebd/ebd379.htm#001), that the mind of the LORD might be shewed
them.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="014">14</span> Bring forth him that hath cursed without the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002); and let all that heard him lay their
hands upon his head, and let all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005)
him.  

<span id="015">15</span> And thou shalt speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall
bear his [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="016">16</span> And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD,
he shall surely be put to death, and all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) shall certainly
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) him: as well the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), as he that is born in the land, when
he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he that killeth any man shall surely be put
to death.  

<span id="018">18</span> And he that killeth a
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) shall make it good;
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) for [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001).  

<span id="019">19</span> And if a man cause a
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007) in his neighbour; as he hath done, so
shall it be done to him;  

<span id="020">20</span> [Breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005) for
[breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005), eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he
hath caused a [blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007) in a man, so shall it be
done to him again.  

<span id="021">21</span> And he that killeth a
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), he shall restore it: and he that killeth
a man, he shall be put to death.  

<span id="022">22</span> Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for
the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), as for one of your own country:
for I am the LORD your God.  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) spake to the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that they should bring
forth him that had cursed out of the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002), and
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) him with stones. And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) did as the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003).
