### King James Version: Romans Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> What shall we say then? Shall we continue in
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), that [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) may
abound?  

<span id="002">2</span> God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), live any longer therein?  

<span id="003">3</span> Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized
into [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) were
baptized into his death?  

<span id="004">4</span> Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into
death: that like as [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) was raised up from
the dead by the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the Father, even so we
also should walk in newness of life.  

<span id="005">5</span> For if we have been planted together in the
likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his
resurrection:  

<span id="006">6</span> Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with
him, that the body of [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) might be destroyed,
that henceforth we should not serve [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> For he that is dead is freed from
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Now if we be dead with
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), we believe that we shall also live with
him:  

<span id="009">9</span> Knowing that [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion
over him.  

<span id="010">10</span> For in that he died, he died unto
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto
God.  

<span id="011">11</span> Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead
indeed unto [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), but alive unto God through
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) our
Lord.  

<span id="012">12</span> Let not [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) therefore
reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts
thereof.  

<span id="013">13</span> Neither yield ye your members as instruments of
unrighteousness unto [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md): but yield yourselves
unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as
instruments of [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) unto God.  

<span id="014">14</span> For [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) shall not have
dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> What then? shall we
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), because we are not under the law, but
under [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md)? God forbid.  

<span id="016">16</span> Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves
servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) unto death, or of obedience unto
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md)?  

<span id="017">17</span> But God be thanked, that ye were the servants
of [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), but ye have obeyed from the heart that
form of doctrine which was delivered you.  

<span id="018">18</span> Being then made free from
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), ye became the servants of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> I speak after the manner of men because of the
infirmity of your [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md): for as ye have yielded
your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even
so now yield your members servants to
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) unto
[holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> For when ye were the servants of
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), ye were free from
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> What [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) had ye then
in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things
is death.  

<span id="022">22</span> But now being made free from
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), and become servants to God, ye have your
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) unto [holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md),
and the end [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) life.  

<span id="023">23</span> For the [wages](../ebd/ebd378.htm#004.md) of
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) is death; but the
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005.md) of God is eternal life through
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) our
Lord.
