### King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> And [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) went to
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md): for all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) were come to
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md) to make him
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And it came to pass, when
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) the son of
[Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003.md), who was yet in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), heard of it, (for he was fled from the
presence of [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007), and [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md)
dwelt in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009);.md)  

<span id="003">3</span> That they sent and called him. And
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) and all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
came, and spake unto [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md), saying,  

<span id="004">4</span> Thy father made our
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md) grievous: now therefore make thou the
grievous service of thy father, and his heavy
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md) which he put upon us, lighter, and we will
serve thee.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he said unto them, Depart yet for three
days, then come again to me. And the people departed.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) consulted with the old men, that stood
before [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) his father while he yet lived,
and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?  

<span id="007">7</span> And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be
a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer
them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for
ever.  

<span id="008">8</span> But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which
they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up
with him, and which stood before him:  

<span id="009">9</span> And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that
we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md) which thy father did put upon us
lighter?  

<span id="010">10</span> And the young men that were grown up with him
spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that
spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md) heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us;
thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my
father's loins.  

<span id="011">11</span> And now whereas my father did lade you with a
heavy [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md), I will add to your
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md): my father hath chastised you with whips,
but I will chastise you with [scorpions](../ebd/ebd324.htm#001.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> So [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) and all
the people came to [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) the third day, as
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) had appointed, saying, Come to me
again the third day.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) answered
the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave
him;  

<span id="014">14</span> And spake to them after the counsel of the
young men, saying, My father made your [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md)
heavy, and I will add to your [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md): my father
also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with
[scorpions](../ebd/ebd324.htm#001.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> Wherefore the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he
might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by
[Ahijah](../ebd/ebd014.htm#000) the [Shilonite](../ebd/ebd337.htm#009.md)
unto [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) the son of
[Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> So when all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) saw
that the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) hearkened not unto them, the
people answered the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), saying, What portion
have we in [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)? neither have we inheritance
in the son of [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005.md): to your tents, O
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): now see to thine own house,
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004). So [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
departed unto their tents.  

<span id="017">17</span> But as for the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) which dwelt in the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md)
reigned over them.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007) sent [Adoram](../ebd/ebd010.htm#001.md),
who was over the [tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006.md); and all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) stoned him with stones, that he died.
Therefore [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) made speed to get him up to his
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md), to flee to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> So [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) rebelled
against the house of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) unto this day.  

<span id="020">20</span> And it came to pass, when all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) heard that
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) was come again, that they sent and
called him unto the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), and made him
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):
there was none that followed the house of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), but the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md)
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) only.  

<span id="021">21</span> And when [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) was
come to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), he assembled all the house
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), with the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md), an
hundred and fourscore thousand [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) men,
which were warriors, to fight against the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), to bring the kingdom again to
[Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) the son of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> But the word of God came unto
[Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005.md) the man of God, saying,  

<span id="023">23</span> Speak unto [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md),
the son of [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md),
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and
unto all the house of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md), and to the remnant of the people,
saying,  

<span id="024">24</span> Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor
fight against your brethren the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): return every man to his house; for this
thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and
returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.  

<span id="025">25</span> Then [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) built
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003) in [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), and dwelt therein; and went out from
thence, and built [Penuel](../ebd/ebd289.htm#005.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) said in
his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md):  

<span id="027">27</span> If this people go up to do
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) in the house of the LORD at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), then shall the heart of this people
turn again unto their lord, even unto [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and
they shall kill me, and go again to [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> Whereupon the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
took counsel, and made two calves of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and
said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): behold thy gods, O
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), which brought thee up out of the land
of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> And he set the one in
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md), and the other put he in
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> And this thing became a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md): for the people went to
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) before the one, even unto
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> And he made an house of high places, and made
priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> And [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) ordained
a [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) in the eighth month, on the fifteenth
day of the month, like unto the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) that is
in [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and he offered upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md). So did he in
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md), sacrificing unto the calves that he had
made: and he placed in [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md) the priests of
the high places which he had made.  

<span id="033">33</span> So he offered upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) which he had made in
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md) the fifteenth day of the eighth month,
even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and he offered upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), and burnt
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md).
