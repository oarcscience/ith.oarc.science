</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And when thou comest thither, look out there <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd273.htm#005">Nimshi</A>, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Then take the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#007">box</A> of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;So the young man, even the young man the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, went to Ramothgilead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And when he came, behold, the captains of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> were <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A>; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A> said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, I have anointed thee <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> over the people of the LORD, even over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt smite the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> thy master, that I may avenge the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of my servants the prophets, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For the whole house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> shall perish: and I will cut off from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And I will make the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> like the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#003">Nebat</A>, and like the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the dogs shall eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</A> in the portion of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</A>, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A> came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</A>, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A> is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd273.htm#005">Nimshi</A> conspired against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</A>. (Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</A> had kept Ramothgilead, he and all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, because of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</A> was returned to be healed in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</A> of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A>.)  And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A> said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A> rode in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A>, and went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</A>; for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</A> lay there. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> was come down to see <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And there stood a watchman on the tower in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</A>, and he spied the company of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A> as he came, and said, I see a company. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</A> said, Take an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#000">horseman</A>, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, Is it peace? And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A> said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</A> came to them, but he cometh not again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, Is it peace? And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A> answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd273.htm#005">Nimshi</A>; for he driveth furiously.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</A> said, Make ready. And his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A> was made ready. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> went out, each in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A>, and they went out against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A>, and met him in the portion of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd264.htm#006">Naboth</A> the Jezreelite.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</A> saw <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A>, that he said, Is it peace, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A>? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</A> and her witchcrafts are so many?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</A> turned his hands, and fled, and said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</A>, There is treachery, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A> drew a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> with his full strength, and smote <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</A> between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A> to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd264.htm#006">Naboth</A> the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> his father, the LORD laid this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A> upon him;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Surely I have seen yesterday the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd264.htm#006">Naboth</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;But when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A> followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A>. And they did so at the going up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#001">Gur</A>, which is by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd185.htm#009">Ibleam</A>. And he fled to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd246.htm#004">Megiddo</A>, and died there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And his servants carried him in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and buried him in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A> with his fathers in the city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And in the eleventh year of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> began <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</A> to reign over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A> was come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</A> heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A> entered in at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>, she said, Had <A HREF="../ebd/ebd393.htm#009">Zimri</A> peace, who slew his master?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side?  who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And when he was come in, he did eat and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd368.htm#003">Tishbite</A>, saying, In the portion of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</A> shall dogs eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</A>:<BR>
