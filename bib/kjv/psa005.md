### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Give [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) to my words, O
LORD, consider my meditation.  

<span id="002">2</span> Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and my God: for unto thee will I pray.  

<span id="003">3</span> My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD;
in the morning will I direct my [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) unto
thee, and will look up.  

<span id="004">4</span> For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in
wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.  

<span id="005">5</span> The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou
hatest all workers of iniquity.  

<span id="006">6</span> Thou shalt destroy them that speak
[leasing](../ebd/ebd225.htm#008.md): the LORD will abhor the bloody and
deceitful man.  

<span id="007">7</span> But as for me, I will come into thy house in the
multitude of thy [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md): and in thy fear will I
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) toward thy holy
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Lead me, O LORD, in thy
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) because of mine enemies; make thy
way straight before my face.  

<span id="009">9</span> For there is no faithfulness in their mouth;
their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md); they flatter with their tongue.  

<span id="010">10</span> Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by
their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their
transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.  

<span id="011">11</span> But let all those that put their trust in thee
rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let
them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.  

<span id="012">12</span> For thou, LORD, wilt
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) the righteous; with favour wilt thou
compass him as with a [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001.md).
