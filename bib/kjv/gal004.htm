<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Galatians Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now I say, That the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#007">heir</A>, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Even so we, when we were children, were in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</A> under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#004">elements</A> of the world:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</A> of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#000">adoption</A> of sons.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of his Son into your hearts, crying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#007">Abba</A>, Father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#007">heir</A> of God through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#004">elements</A>, whereunto ye desire again to be in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Ye know how through infirmity of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> I preached the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> unto you at the first.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</A> which was in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of God, even as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;My little children, of whom I travail in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#002">birth</A> again until <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> be formed in you,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For it is written, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>; but he of the freewoman was by promise.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Which things are an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd017.htm#004">allegory</A>: for these are the two covenants; the one from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</A>, which gendereth to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</A>, which is Agar.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;For this Agar is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#009">Arabia</A>, and answereth to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> which now is, and is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</A> with her children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For it is written, Rejoice, thou <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</A> that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Now we, brethren, as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> was, are the children of promise.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;But as then he that was born after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> persecuted him that was born after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>, even so it is now.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless what saith the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A>? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#007">heir</A> with the son of the freewoman.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.<BR>
