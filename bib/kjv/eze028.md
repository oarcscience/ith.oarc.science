### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 28

<span id="001">1</span> The word of the LORD came again unto me,
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Son of man, say unto the
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a God, I sit
in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man, and
not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God:  

<span id="003">3</span> Behold, thou art wiser than
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md); there is no secret that they can hide
from thee:  

<span id="004">4</span> With thy wisdom and with thine understanding
thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) and [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) into
thy treasures:  

<span id="005">5</span> By thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast
thou increased thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy
riches:  

<span id="006">6</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou
hast set thine heart as the heart of God;  

<span id="007">7</span> Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon
thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords
against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy
brightness.  

<span id="008">8</span> They shall bring thee down to the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md), and thou shalt die the deaths of them that
are slain in the midst of the seas.  

<span id="009">9</span> Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee,
I am God? but thou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that
slayeth thee.  

<span id="010">10</span> Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised
by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="011">11</span> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="012">12</span> Son of man, take up a
[lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005.md) upon the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the
Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in
beauty.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou hast been in [Eden](../ebd/ebd112.htm#009.md)
the garden of God; every precious [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) was thy
covering, the sardius, [topaz](../ebd/ebd370.htm#005.md), and the
[diamond](../ebd/ebd103.htm#001), the [beryl](../ebd/ebd053.htm#008.md),
the [onyx](../ebd/ebd279.htm#004.md), and the
[jasper](../ebd/ebd198.htm#003), the [sapphire](../ebd/ebd322.htm#002.md),
the [emerald](../ebd/ebd119.htm#007.md), and the
[carbuncle](../ebd/ebd072.htm#003), and [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md):
the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in
the day that thou wast created.  

<span id="014">14</span> Thou art the anointed
[cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003.md) that covereth; and I have set thee so:
thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in
the midst of the stones of fire.  

<span id="015">15</span> Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that
thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.  

<span id="016">16</span> By the multitude of thy merchandise they have
filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore
I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will
destroy thee, O covering [cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003.md), from the midst
of the stones of fire.  

<span id="017">17</span> Thine heart was lifted up because of thy
beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I
will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they
may behold thee.  

<span id="018">18</span> Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the
multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick;
therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall
devour thee, and I will bring thee to [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000.md)
upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.  

<span id="019">19</span> All they that know thee among the people shall
be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be
any more.  

<span id="020">20</span> Again the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="021">21</span> Son of man, set thy face against
[Zidon](../ebd/ebd393.htm#000.md), and prophesy against it,  

<span id="022">22</span> And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am
against thee, O [Zidon](../ebd/ebd393.htm#000.md); and I will be glorified
in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I
shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.  

<span id="023">23</span> For I will send into her pestilence, and
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) into her streets; and the wounded shall
be judged in the midst of her by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) upon
her on every side; and they shall know that I am the LORD.  

<span id="024">24</span> And there shall be no more a pricking
[brier](../ebd/ebd065.htm#003.md) unto the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), nor any grieving
[thorn](../ebd/ebd364.htm#006.md) of all that are round about them, that
despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.  

<span id="025">25</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have
gathered the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) from the people
among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the
sight of the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), then shall they dwell in
their land that I have given to my servant
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall
build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with
confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise
them round about them; and they shall know that I am the LORD their
God.
