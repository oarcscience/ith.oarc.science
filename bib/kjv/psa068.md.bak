### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 68

<span id="001">1</span> Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let
them also that hate him flee before him.  

<span id="002">2</span> As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as
[wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000.md) melteth before the fire, so let the wicked
perish at the presence of God.  

<span id="003">3</span> But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice
before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.  

<span id="004">4</span> Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol
him that rideth upon the heavens by his name
[JAH](../ebd/ebd195.htm#003.md), and rejoice before him.  

<span id="005">5</span> A father of the fatherless, and a
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) of the [widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003.md),
is God in his holy [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> God setteth the solitary in families: he
bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell
in a dry land.  

<span id="007">7</span> O God, when thou wentest forth before thy
people, when thou didst march through the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005); [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md):  

<span id="008">8</span> The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the
presence of God: even [Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009.md) itself was moved at
the presence of God, the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md), whereby thou didst confirm thine
inheritance, when it was weary.  

<span id="010">10</span> Thy [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) hath
dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md) for the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> The Lord gave the word: great was the company
of those that published it.  

<span id="012">12</span> Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that
tarried at home divided the spoil.  

<span id="013">13</span> Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall
ye be as the wings of a [dove](../ebd/ebd106.htm#007.md) covered with
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and her feathers with yellow
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was
white as [snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000.md) in
[Salmon](../ebd/ebd319.htm#005.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> The hill of God is as the hill of
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003.md); an high hill as the hill of
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill
which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for
ever.  

<span id="017">17</span> The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md) of angels: the Lord is among them, as
in [Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009.md), in the holy place.  

<span id="018">18</span> Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001.md):
thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the
LORD God might dwell among them.  

<span id="019">19</span> Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with
benefits, even the God of our [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md).
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> He that is our God is the God of
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md); and unto GOD the Lord belong the
issues from death.  

<span id="021">21</span> But God shall wound the head of his enemies,
and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his
trespasses.  

<span id="022">22</span> The Lord said, I will bring again from
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003.md), I will bring my people again from the
depths of the sea:  

<span id="023">23</span> That thy foot may be dipped in the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy
dogs in the same.  

<span id="024">24</span> They have seen thy goings, O God; even the
goings of my God, my [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), in the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> The singers went before, the players on
instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with
timbrels.  

<span id="026">26</span> [Bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) ye God in the
congregations, even the Lord, from the [fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md)
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> There is little
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md) with their ruler, the princes of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and their
[council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004.md), the princes of
[Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003.md), and the princes of
[Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> Thy God hath commanded thy strength:
strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.  

<span id="029">29</span> Because of thy [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md)
at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) shall kings bring presents unto
thee.  

<span id="030">30</span> Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude
of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit
himself with [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md) of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md): scatter thou the people that delight in
war.  

<span id="031">31</span> Princes shall come out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009); [Ethiopia](../ebd/ebd126.htm#005.md) shall
soon stretch out her hands unto God.  

<span id="032">32</span> Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing
praises unto the Lord; [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md):  

<span id="033">33</span> To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens,
which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty
voice.  

<span id="034">34</span> Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is
over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and his strength is in the
clouds.  

<span id="035">35</span> O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy
places: the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) is he that giveth
strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.
