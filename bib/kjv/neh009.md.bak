### King James Version: Nehemiah Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) were assembled with
fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the seed of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their
sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.  

<span id="003">3</span> And they stood up in their place, and read in
the book of the law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day;
and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD their
God.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites,
[Jeshua](../ebd/ebd205.htm#003), and [Bani](../ebd/ebd043.htm#004.md),
[Kadmiel](../ebd/ebd215.htm#004), [Shebaniah](../ebd/ebd332.htm#007.md),
Bunni, [Sherebiah](../ebd/ebd335.htm#007.md),
[Bani](../ebd/ebd043.htm#004.md), and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice
unto the LORD their God.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then the Levites,
[Jeshua](../ebd/ebd205.htm#003), and [Kadmiel](../ebd/ebd215.htm#004.md),
[Bani](../ebd/ebd043.htm#004), [Hashabniah](../ebd/ebd166.htm#002.md),
[Sherebiah](../ebd/ebd335.htm#007), [Hodijah](../ebd/ebd180.htm#002.md),
[Shebaniah](../ebd/ebd332.htm#007.md), and
[Pethahiah](../ebd/ebd291.htm#005.md), said, Stand up and
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) the LORD your God for ever and ever: and
blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and
praise.  

<span id="006">6</span> Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) of
heavens, with all their [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md), the earth, and
all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou
preservest them all; and the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) worshippeth thee.  

<span id="007">7</span> Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md), and broughtest him forth out of
[Ur](../ebd/ebd375.htm#001) of the [Chaldees](../ebd/ebd076.htm#002.md),
and gavest him the name of [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md);  

<span id="008">8</span> And foundest his heart
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md) before thee, and madest a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with him to give the land of the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007.md), the
[Hittites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#006.md), the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md), and the
[Perizzites](../ebd/ebd290.htm#006.md), and the
[Jebusites](../ebd/ebd199.htm#004.md), and the Girgashites, to give it, I
say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art
righteous:  

<span id="009">9</span> And didst see the affliction of our fathers in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and heardest their cry by the Red sea;  

<span id="010">10</span> And shewedst signs and wonders upon
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), and on all his servants, and on all
the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against
them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this day.  

<span id="011">11</span> And thou didst divide the sea before them, so
that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their
persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) into the mighty waters.  

<span id="012">12</span> Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a
cloudy [pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md); and in the night by a
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md) of fire, to give them light in the way
wherein they should go.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou camest down also upon
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009.md), and
spakest with them from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and gavest them
right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:  

<span id="014">14</span> And madest known unto them thy holy
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md), and commandedst them precepts,
statutes, and laws, by the hand of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) thy
servant:  

<span id="015">15</span> And gavest them [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md)
from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) for their hunger, and broughtest
forth water for them out of the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md) for their
thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land
which thou hadst sworn to give them.  

<span id="016">16</span> But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and
hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,  

<span id="017">17</span> And refused to obey, neither were mindful of
thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in
their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md): but thou art a God ready to
[pardon](../ebd/ebd285.htm#001.md), gracious and merciful, slow to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md), and of great kindness, and forsookest
them not.  

<span id="018">18</span> Yea, when they had made them a molten
[calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004.md), and said, This is thy God that brought
thee up out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and had wrought great
provocations;  

<span id="019">19</span> Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest
them not in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md): the
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007) of the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md)
departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md) of fire by night, to shew them light,
and the way wherein they should go.  

<span id="020">20</span> Thou gavest also thy good
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) to instruct them, and withheldest not
thy [manna](../ebd/ebd240.htm#006.md) from their mouth, and gavest them
water for their thirst.  

<span id="021">21</span> Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), so that they lacked nothing; their
clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.  

<span id="022">22</span> Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations,
and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of
[Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002.md), and the land of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009.md), and
the land of [Og](../ebd/ebd277.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> Their children also multipliedst thou as the
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and
broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to
their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.  

<span id="024">24</span> So the children went in and possessed the land,
and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007.md), and gavest them into their hands,
with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with
them as they would.  

<span id="025">25</span> And they took strong cities, and a
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) land, and possessed houses full of all
goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) trees in abundance: so they did eat, and
were filled, and became [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md), and delighted
themselves in thy great [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> Nevertheless they were disobedient, and
rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy
prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they
wrought great provocations.  

<span id="027">27</span> Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand
of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when
they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md); and according to thy manifold mercies
thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their
enemies.  

<span id="028">28</span> But after they had rest, they did evil again
before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies,
so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and
cried unto thee, thou heardest them from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md); and many times didst thou deliver them
according to thy mercies;  

<span id="029">29</span> And testifiedst against them, that thou
mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and
hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments,
(which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder,
and hardened their [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md), and would not hear.  

<span id="030">30</span> Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and
testifiedst against them by thy [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) in thy
prophets: yet would they not give [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md):
therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.  

<span id="031">31</span> Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou
didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a
gracious and merciful God.  

<span id="032">32</span> Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty,
and the terrible God, who keepest [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) and
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md), let not all the trouble seem little
before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and
on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy
people, since the time of the kings of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md)
unto this day.  

<span id="033">33</span> Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought
upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly:  

<span id="034">34</span> Neither have our kings, our princes, our
priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy
commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against
them.  

<span id="035">35</span> For they have not served thee in their kingdom,
and in thy great [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md) that thou gavest
them, and in the large and [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) land which thou
gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.  

<span id="036">36</span> Behold, we are servants this day, and for the
land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) thereof and the good thereof, behold, we
are servants in it:  

<span id="037">37</span> And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings
whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion
over our bodies, and over our [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), at their
pleasure, and we are in great distress.  

<span id="038">38</span> And because of all this we make a sure
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md), and write it; and our princes,
Levites, and priests, [seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002.md) unto it.
