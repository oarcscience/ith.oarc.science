### King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> And Benhadad the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md) gathered all his
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) together: and there were thirty and two
kings with him, and horses, and chariots; and he went up and besieged
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md), and warred against it.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he sent messengers to
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) into the city, and said unto him, Thus
saith Benhadad,  

<span id="003">3</span> Thy [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) and thy
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) is mine; thy wives also and thy children,
even the goodliest, are mine.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) answered and said, My lord, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), according to thy saying, I am thine, and
all that I have.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the messengers came again, and said, Thus
speaketh Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou
shalt deliver me thy [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and thy
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and thy wives, and thy children;  

<span id="006">6</span> Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow
about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of
thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine
eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) called all the elders of the land, and
said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he
sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and for my
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md); and I denied him not.  

<span id="008">8</span> And all the elders and all the people said unto
him, Hearken not unto him, nor consent.  

<span id="009">9</span> Wherefore he said unto the messengers of
Benhadad, Tell my lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), All that thou
didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I
may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.  

<span id="010">10</span> And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods
do so unto me, and more also, if the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md) shall suffice for handfuls for all the
people that follow me.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) answered and said, Tell him, Let not him
that girdeth on his [harness](../ebd/ebd164.htm#007.md) boast himself as he
that putteth it off.  

<span id="012">12</span> And it came to pass, when
[Ben-hadad](../ebd/ebd052.htm#007.md) heard this message, as he was
drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his
servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array
against the city.  

<span id="013">13</span> And, behold, there came a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) unto [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude?
behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know
that I am the LORD.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md) said, By
whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even by the young men of the
princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And
he answered, Thou.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then he numbered the young men of the princes
of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after
them he numbered all the people, even all the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), being [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
thousand.  

<span id="016">16</span> And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was
drinking himself [drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007.md) in the pavilions, he and
the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the young men of the princes of the
provinces went out first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him,
saying, There are men come out of [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And he said, Whether they be come out for
peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them
alive.  

<span id="019">19</span> So these young men of the princes of the
provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.  

<span id="020">20</span> And they slew every one his man: and the
Syrians fled; and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) pursued them: and
Benhadad the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md) escaped on an horse with the horsemen.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) went out, and smote the horses and
chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) came
to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou
doest: for at the return of the year the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md) will come up against thee.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the servants of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md) said
unto him, Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger
than we; but let us fight against them in the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md), and surely we shall be stronger than
they.  

<span id="024">24</span> And do this thing, Take the kings away, every
man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:  

<span id="025">25</span> And number thee an army, like the army that
thou hast lost, horse for horse, and [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md)
for [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md): and we will fight against them in
the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md), and surely we shall be stronger than
they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.  

<span id="026">26</span> And it came to pass at the return of the year,
that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight
against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) were numbered, and were all present, and
went against them: and the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians
filled the country.  

<span id="028">28</span> And there came a man of God, and spake unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and
said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is
God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I
deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that
I am the LORD.  

<span id="029">29</span> And they pitched one over against the other
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days. And so it was, that in the seventh
day the battle was joined: and the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand
footmen in one day.  

<span id="030">30</span> But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and
there a wall fell upon twenty and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadad fled, and came into the
city, into an inner [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we
have heard that the kings of the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee,
put [sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001.md) on our loins, and ropes upon our
heads, and go out to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): peradventure he will save thy life.  

<span id="032">32</span> So they girded
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001.md) on their loins, and put ropes on
their heads, and came to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and said, Thy servant Benhadad saith, I
pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my
brother.  

<span id="033">33</span> Now the men did diligently observe whether any
thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy
brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came
forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md).  

<span id="034">34</span> And [Ben-hadad](../ebd/ebd052.htm#007.md) said
unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will
restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md), as my father made in
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md). Then said
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md), I will send thee away with this
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md). So he made a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with him, and sent him away.  

<span id="035">35</span> And a certain man of the sons of the prophets
said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee.
And the man refused to smite him.  

<span id="036">36</span> Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not
obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from
me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a
lion found him, and slew him.  

<span id="037">37</span> Then he found another man, and said, Smite me,
I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.  

<span id="038">38</span> So the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md)
departed, and waited for the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) by the way,
and disguised himself with [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000.md) upon his
face.  

<span id="039">39</span> And as the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) passed
by, he cried unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md): and he said, Thy
servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned
aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any
means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou
shalt pay a [talent](../ebd/ebd357.htm#009.md) of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md).  

<span id="040">40</span> And as thy servant was busy here and there, he
was gone. And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) said unto him, So shall thy judgment be;
thyself hast decided it.  

<span id="041">41</span> And he hasted, and took the
[ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000.md) away from his face; and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
discerned him that he was of the prophets.  

<span id="042">42</span> And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD,
Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md), therefore thy life shall go for
his life, and thy people for his people.  

<span id="043">43</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) went to his house heavy and displeased,
and came to [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md).
