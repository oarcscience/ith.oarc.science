### King James Version: James Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that
we shall receive the greater condemnation.  

<span id="002">2</span> For in many things we offend all. If any man
offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to
[bridle](../ebd/ebd065.htm#002.md) the whole body.  

<span id="003">3</span> Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that
they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.  

<span id="004">4</span> Behold also the [ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003.md),
which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce
[winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009.md), yet are they turned about with a very
small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.  

<span id="005">5</span> Even so the tongue is a little member, and
boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire
kindleth!  

<span id="006">6</span> And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity:
so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and
setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of
serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of
mankind:  

<span id="008">8</span> But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly
evil, full of deadly [poison](../ebd/ebd297.htm#009.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Therewith [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) we God,
even the Father; and therewith [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) we men,
which are made after the similitude of God.  

<span id="010">10</span> Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and
cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.  

<span id="011">11</span> Doth a [fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md) send
forth at the same place sweet water and
[bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009.md)?  

<span id="012">12</span> Can the [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001.md) tree, my
brethren, bear [olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009.md) berries? either a
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md), figs? so can no
[fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md) both yield
[salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008.md) water and fresh.  

<span id="013">13</span> Who is a [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) man and
endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good
[conversation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#001.md) his works with
[meekness](../ebd/ebd246.htm#003.md) of wisdom.  

<span id="014">14</span> But if ye have [bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009.md)
envying and strife in your hearts, [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) not,
and lie not against the truth.  

<span id="015">15</span> This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is
earthly, sensual, devilish.  

<span id="016">16</span> For where envying and strife is, there is
confusion and every evil work.  

<span id="017">17</span> But the wisdom that is from above is first
pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) and good fruits, without partiality, and
without hypocrisy.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) is sown in peace of them that
make peace.
