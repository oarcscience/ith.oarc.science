### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> And when the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md) of
[Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006.md) heard of the fame of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), she came to prove
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) with hard questions at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), with a very great company, and
camels that bare [spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005.md), and
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) in abundance, and precious stones: and
when she was come to [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), she communed with
him of all that was in her heart.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) told her
all her questions: and there was nothing hid from
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) which he told her not.  

<span id="003">3</span> And when the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md) of
[Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006.md) had seen the wisdom of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), and the house that he had built,  

<span id="004">4</span> And the meat of his table, and the
[sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md) of his servants, and the attendance of
his ministers, and their [apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000.md); his
cupbearers also, and their [apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000.md); and his
ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) in her.  

<span id="005">5</span> And she said to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), It was a true report which I heard in
mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:  

<span id="006">6</span> Howbeit I believed not their words, until I
came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the
greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou exceedest the fame
that I heard.  

<span id="007">7</span> Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy
servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.  

<span id="008">8</span> Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in
thee to set thee on his [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), to be
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) for the LORD thy God: because thy God
loved [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), to establish them for ever,
therefore made he thee [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over them, to do
judgment and [justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And she gave the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
an hundred and twenty talents of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and of
[spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005.md) great abundance, and precious stones:
neither was there any such spice as the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md)
of [Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006) gave [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And the servants also of Huram, and the
servants of [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), which brought
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) from [Ophir](../ebd/ebd279.htm#007.md),
brought [algum](../ebd/ebd017.htm#002.md) trees and precious stones.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) made of
the [algum](../ebd/ebd017.htm#002.md) trees terraces to the house of the
LORD, and to the king's [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md), and harps and
psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) gave to the
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007) of [Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006.md) all her
desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md). So she turned, and went away to her own
land, she and her servants.  

<span id="013">13</span> Now the weight of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md)
that came to [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) in one year was six
hundred and threescore and six talents of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md);  

<span id="014">14</span> Beside that which chapmen and merchants
brought. And all the kings of [Arabia](../ebd/ebd027.htm#009.md) and
governors of the country brought [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) and
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) to [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) made two hundred targets of beaten
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md): six hundred shekels of beaten
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) went to one
[target](../ebd/ebd359.htm#001.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And three hundred shields made he of beaten
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md): three hundred shekels of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) went to one
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001). And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
put them in the house of the [forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006.md) of
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Moreover the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) made
a great [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of
[ivory](../ebd/ebd192.htm#000.md), and overlaid it with pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And there were six steps to the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), with a
[footstool](../ebd/ebd136.htm#009) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md),
which were fastened to the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), and stays on
each side of the [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md) place, and two
[lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001.md) standing by the stays:  

<span id="019">19</span> And twelve [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001.md) stood
there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not
the like made in any kingdom.  

<span id="020">20</span> And all the drinking vessels of
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) were of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and all the vessels of the house of the
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006) of [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md) were
of pure [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md): none were of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md); it was not any thing accounted of in
the days of [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> For the king's [ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003.md)
went to [Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002.md) with the servants of Huram:
every three years once came the [ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003.md) of
[Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002.md) bringing
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md),
[ivory](../ebd/ebd192.htm#000.md), and apes, and peacocks.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) passed all the kings of the earth in
riches and wisdom.  

<span id="023">23</span> And all the kings of the earth sought the
presence of [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), to hear his wisdom, that
God had put in his heart.  

<span id="024">24</span> And they brought every man his present, vessels
of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and vessels of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and raiment,
[harness](../ebd/ebd164.htm#007), and [spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005.md),
horses, and mules, a rate year by year.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) had four
thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen;
whom he bestowed in the [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md) cities, and
with the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And he reigned over all the kings from the
river even unto the land of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md),
and to the border of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) made
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) as
stones, and [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md) trees made he as the sycomore
trees that are in the low plains in abundance.  

<span id="028">28</span> And they brought unto
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) horses out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and out of all lands.  

<span id="029">29</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), first and last, are they not written
in the book of [Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md), and in the
[prophecy](../ebd/ebd300.htm#007) of [Ahijah](../ebd/ebd014.htm#000.md) the
[Shilonite](../ebd/ebd337.htm#009.md), and in the visions of
[Iddo](../ebd/ebd186.htm#005) the [seer](../ebd/ebd326.htm#000.md) against
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) the son of
[Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003.md)?  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) reigned in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) over all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) forty years.  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) slept with
his fathers, and he was buried in the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) his father: and
[Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) his son reigned in his stead.
