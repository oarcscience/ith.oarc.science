### King James Version: Job Chapter 28

<span id="001">1</span> Surely there is a vein for the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and a place for
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) where they fine it.  

<span id="002">2</span> [Iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md) is taken out of
the earth, and [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md) is molten out of the
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> He setteth an end to
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), and searcheth out all
[perfection](../ebd/ebd290.htm#001.md): the stones of
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), and the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) of death.  

<span id="004">4</span> The [flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000.md) breaketh out
from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are
dried up, they are gone away from men.  

<span id="005">5</span> As for the earth, out of it cometh
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md): and under it is turned up as it were
fire.  

<span id="006">6</span> The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and
it hath [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which
the vulture's eye hath not seen:  

<span id="008">8</span> The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the
fierce lion passed by it.  

<span id="009">9</span> He putteth forth his hand upon the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md); he overturneth the mountains by the
roots.  

<span id="010">10</span> He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his
eye seeth every precious thing.  

<span id="011">11</span> He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the
thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.  

<span id="012">12</span> But where shall wisdom be found? and where is
the place of understanding?  

<span id="013">13</span> Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is
it found in the land of the living.  

<span id="014">14</span> The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea
saith, It is not with me.  

<span id="015">15</span> It cannot be gotten for
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), neither shall
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) be weighed for the price thereof.  

<span id="016">16</span> It cannot be valued with the
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) of [Ophir](../ebd/ebd279.htm#007.md), with
the precious [onyx](../ebd/ebd279.htm#004.md), or the
[sapphire](../ebd/ebd322.htm#002.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> The [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) and the
[crystal](../ebd/ebd093.htm#005.md) cannot equal it: and the exchange of it
shall not be for jewels of fine [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> No mention shall be made of
[coral](../ebd/ebd089.htm#008.md), or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is
above rubies.  

<span id="019">19</span> The [topaz](../ebd/ebd370.htm#005.md) of
[Ethiopia](../ebd/ebd126.htm#005.md) shall not equal it, neither shall it
be valued with pure [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the
place of understanding?  

<span id="021">21</span> Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living,
and kept close from the fowls of the air.  

<span id="022">22</span> [Destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md) and death
say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.  

<span id="023">23</span> God understandeth the way thereof, and he
knoweth the place thereof.  

<span id="024">24</span> For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and
seeth under the whole [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md);  

<span id="025">25</span> To make the weight for the
[winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009.md); and he weigheth the waters by measure.  

<span id="026">26</span> When he made a decree for the
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md), and a way for the
[lightning](../ebd/ebd229.htm#002.md) of the
[thunder](../ebd/ebd365.htm#003.md):  

<span id="027">27</span> Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared
it, yea, and searched it out.  

<span id="028">28</span> And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the
LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.
