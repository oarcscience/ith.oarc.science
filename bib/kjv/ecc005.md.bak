### King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of
God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) of fools: for they consider not that
they do evil.  

<span id="002">2</span> Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine
heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and thou upon earth: therefore let thy
words be few.  

<span id="003">3</span> For a [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md) cometh
through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice is known by
multitude of words.  

<span id="004">4</span> When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to
pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast
vowed.  

<span id="005">5</span> Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than
that thou shouldest vow and not pay.  

<span id="006">6</span> Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md); neither
say thou before the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md), that it was an
error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work
of thine hands?  

<span id="007">7</span> For in the multitude of dreams and many words
there are also divers vanities: but fear thou God.  

<span id="008">8</span> If thou seest the oppression of the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), and violent perverting of judgment and
[justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007.md) in a province, marvel not at the
matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be
higher than they.  

<span id="009">9</span> Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) himself is served by the field.  

<span id="010">10</span> He that loveth [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md)
shall not be satisfied with [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md); nor he that
loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.  

<span id="011">11</span> When goods increase, they are increased that
eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the
beholding of them with their eyes?  

<span id="012">12</span> The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether
he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him
to sleep.  

<span id="013">13</span> There is a sore evil which I have seen under
the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md), namely, riches kept for the owners
thereof to their hurt.  

<span id="014">14</span> But those riches perish by evil travail: and he
begetteth a son, and there is nothing in his hand.  

<span id="015">15</span> As he came forth of his mother's womb,
[naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003.md) shall he return to go as he came, and
shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.  

<span id="016">16</span> And this also is a sore evil, that in all
points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath
laboured for the wind?  

<span id="017">17</span> All his days also he eateth in
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), and he hath much sorrow and wrath
with his sickness.  

<span id="018">18</span> Behold that which I have seen: it is good and
comely for one to eat and to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), and to
enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) all the days of his life, which God giveth
him: for it is his portion.  

<span id="019">19</span> Every man also to whom God hath given riches
and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his
portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005.md) of God.  

<span id="020">20</span> For he shall not much remember the days of his
life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart.
