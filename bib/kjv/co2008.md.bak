### King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of God bestowed on the churches of
[Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003.md);  

<span id="002">2</span> How that in a great trial of affliction the
abundance of their joy and their [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) poverty
abounded unto the riches of their liberality.  

<span id="003">3</span> For to their power, I bear record, yea, and
beyond their power they were willing of themselves;  

<span id="004">4</span> Praying us with much intreaty that we would
receive the [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005.md), and take upon us the
[fellowship](../ebd/ebd132.htm#002.md) of the ministering to the saints.  

<span id="005">5</span> And this they did, not as we hoped, but first
gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.  

<span id="006">6</span> Insomuch that we desired
[Titus](../ebd/ebd368.htm#007.md), that as he had begun, so he would also
finish in you the same [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) also.  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in
faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your
love to us, see that ye abound in this [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md)
also.  

<span id="008">8</span> I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of
the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.  

<span id="009">9</span> For ye know the [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md)
of our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), that, though he was rich, yet for your
sakes he became [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), that ye through his
poverty might be rich.  

<span id="010">10</span> And herein I give my advice: for this is
expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be
forward a year ago.  

<span id="011">11</span> Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as
there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of
that which ye have.  

<span id="012">12</span> For if there be first a willing mind, it is
accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath
not.  

<span id="013">13</span> For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye
burdened:  

<span id="014">14</span> But by an equality, that now at this time your
abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may
be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:  

<span id="015">15</span> As it is written, He that had gathered much had
nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.  

<span id="016">16</span> But thanks be to God, which put the same
[earnest](../ebd/ebd110.htm#006.md) care into the heart of
[Titus](../ebd/ebd368.htm#007.md) for you.  

<span id="017">17</span> For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but
being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.  

<span id="018">18</span> And we have sent with him the brother, whose
praise is in the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) throughout all the
churches;  

<span id="019">19</span> And not that only, but who was also
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) of the churches to travel with us with
this [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md), which is administered by us to the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the same Lord, and declaration of your
ready mind:  

<span id="020">20</span> Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in
this abundance which is administered by us:  

<span id="021">21</span> Providing for honest things, not only in the
sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.  

<span id="022">22</span> And we have sent with them our brother, whom we
have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more
diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.  

<span id="023">23</span> Whether any do enquire of
[Titus](../ebd/ebd368.htm#007.md), he is my partner and fellowhelper
concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers
of the churches, and the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the
churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.
