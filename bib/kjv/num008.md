### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and
say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) lamps shall give light over against the
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) did so; he
lighted the lamps thereof over against the
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md), as the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And this work of the
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md) was of beaten
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), unto the shaft thereof, unto the
[flowers](../ebd/ebd136.htm#002.md) thereof, was beaten work: according
unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), so he made the
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="006">6</span> Take the Levites from among the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and cleanse them.  

<span id="007">7</span> And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse
them: Sprinkle water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all
their [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), and let them wash their clothes,
and so make themselves [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Then let them take a young
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md) with his meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), even fine
[flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001.md) mingled with oil, and another young
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md) shalt thou take for a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And thou shalt bring the Levites before the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md): and thou shalt gather the whole
assembly of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) together:  

<span id="010">10</span> And thou shalt bring the Levites before the
LORD: and the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) shall put
their hands upon the Levites:  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) shall offer
the Levites before the LORD for an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) of
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), that they may execute
the service of the LORD.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the
heads of the bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one for a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and the
other for a burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), unto the LORD, to
make an [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for the Levites.  

<span id="013">13</span> And thou shalt set the Levites before
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and before his sons, and offer them for
an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) unto the LORD.  

<span id="014">14</span> Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and the Levites shall
be mine.  

<span id="015">15</span> And after that shall the Levites go in to do
the service of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md): and thou shalt cleanse them, and
offer them for an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> For they are wholly given unto me from among
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); instead of such as open
every womb, even instead of the firstborn of all the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), have I taken them unto me.  

<span id="017">17</span> For all the firstborn of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) are mine, both man and
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md): on the day that I smote every firstborn
in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) I sanctified them for
myself.  

<span id="018">18</span> And I have taken the Levites for all the
firstborn of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And I have given the Levites as a
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005) to [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and to
his sons from among the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), to
do the service of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) in the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), and to make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): that there be no
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) among the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), when the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) come nigh unto the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), did to the Levites according unto all
that the LORD commanded [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) concerning the
Levites, so did the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) unto
them.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the Levites were purified, and they washed
their clothes; and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) offered them as an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) before the LORD; and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) made an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for them to cleanse them.  

<span id="022">22</span> And after that went the Levites in to do their
service in the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) before
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and before his sons: as the LORD had
commanded [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) concerning the Levites, so did
they unto them.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="024">24</span> This is it that belongeth unto the Levites:
from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon
the service of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md):  

<span id="025">25</span> And from the age of fifty years they shall
cease waiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more:  

<span id="026">26</span> But shall [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md)
with their brethren in the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), to keep the charge, and shall do
no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.
