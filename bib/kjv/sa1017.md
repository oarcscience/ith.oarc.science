### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> Now the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002)
gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at
[Shochoh](../ebd/ebd340.htm#007), which belongeth to
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and pitched between
[Shochoh](../ebd/ebd340.htm#007) and [Azekah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#008), in
Ephesdammim.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) and the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) were gathered together, and pitched by
the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [Elah](../ebd/ebd114.htm#002),
and set the battle in array against the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002).  

<span id="003">3</span> And the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002)
stood on a mountain on the one side, and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) between them.  

<span id="004">4</span> And there went out a
[champion](../ebd/ebd076.htm#008) out of the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), named
[Goliath](../ebd/ebd152.htm#005), of [Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009),
whose height was six cubits and a span.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he had an [helmet](../ebd/ebd173.htm#004) of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003) upon his head, and he was armed with a
[coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004) of mail; and the weight of the
[coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004) was five thousand shekels of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003).  

<span id="006">6</span> And he had [greaves](../ebd/ebd155.htm#001) of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003) upon his legs, and a
[target](../ebd/ebd359.htm#001) of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003)
between his shoulders.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's
[beam](../ebd/ebd048.htm#007); and his spear's head weighed six hundred
shekels of [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004): and one bearing a
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001) went before him.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he stood and cried unto the armies of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and said unto them, Why are ye come out
to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002)? choose you a man for you, and let him
come down to me.  

<span id="009">9</span> If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me,
then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill
him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) this day; give me a man, that we may
fight together.  

<span id="011">11</span> When [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) and all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) heard those words of the Philistine,
they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.  

<span id="012">12</span> Now [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) was the son
of that [Ephrathite](../ebd/ebd123.htm#007) of Bethlehemjudah, whose
name was [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005); and he had eight sons: and the
man went among men for an old man in the days of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002).  

<span id="013">13</span> And the three eldest sons of
[Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005) went and followed
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) to the battle: and the names of his three
sons that went to the battle were [Eliab](../ebd/ebd115.htm#008) the
firstborn, and next unto him [Abinadab](../ebd/ebd004.htm#001), and the
third [Shammah](../ebd/ebd331.htm#002).  

<span id="014">14</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) was the
youngest: and the three eldest followed [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002).  

<span id="015">15</span> But [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) went and
returned from [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) to feed his father's
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) at [Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005).  

<span id="016">16</span> And the Philistine drew near morning and
evening, and presented himself forty days.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005) said unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) his son, Take now for thy brethren an
[ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003) of this parched
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006), and these ten loaves, and run to the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) of thy brethren;  

<span id="018">18</span> And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of
their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their
[pledge](../ebd/ebd297.htm#005).  

<span id="019">19</span> Now [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), and they,
and all the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), were in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [Elah](../ebd/ebd114.htm#002),
fighting with the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002).  

<span id="020">20</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) rose up
early in the morning, and left the [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) with a
keeper, and took, and went, as [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005) had
commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) was going forth to the fight, and shouted
for the battle.  

<span id="021">21</span> For [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) had put the battle in array, army
against army.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) left his
[carriage](../ebd/ebd073.htm#000) in the hand of the keeper of the
[carriage](../ebd/ebd073.htm#000), and ran into the army, and came and
saluted his brethren.  

<span id="023">23</span> And as he talked with them, behold, there came
up the [champion](../ebd/ebd076.htm#008), the Philistine of
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009), [Goliath](../ebd/ebd152.htm#005) by name,
out of the armies of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), and spake
according to the same words: and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) heard
them.  

<span id="024">24</span> And all the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), when they saw the man, fled from him,
and were sore afraid.  

<span id="025">25</span> And the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) is he come up: and it shall be, that the
man who killeth him, the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) will enrich him
with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's
house free in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="026">26</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) spake to the
men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that
killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)? for who is this uncircumcised
Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?  

<span id="027">27</span> And the people answered him after this manner,
saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Eliab](../ebd/ebd115.htm#008) his eldest
brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) was kindled against
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and he said, Why camest thou down
hither? and with whom hast thou left those few
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005)? I know thy pride, and the
naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest
see the battle.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said, What
have I now done? Is there not a cause?  

<span id="030">30</span> And he turned from him toward another, and
spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the
former manner.  

<span id="031">31</span> And when the words were heard which
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) spake, they rehearsed them before
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002): and he sent for him.  

<span id="032">32</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said to
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), Let no man's heart fail because of him;
thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.  

<span id="033">33</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) said to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), Thou art not able to go against this
Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of
war from his youth.  

<span id="034">34</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said unto
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), Thy servant kept his father's
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), and there came a lion, and a bear, and
took a [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003) out of the flock:  

<span id="035">35</span> And I went out after him, and smote him, and
delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught
him by his [beard](../ebd/ebd049.htm#000), and smote him, and slew
him.  

<span id="036">36</span> Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear:
and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he
hath defied the armies of the living God.  

<span id="037">37</span> [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said moreover,
The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the
paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.
And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) said unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), Go, and the LORD be with thee.  

<span id="038">38</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) armed
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) with his [armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006),
and he put an [helmet](../ebd/ebd173.htm#004) of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003) upon his head; also he armed him with a
[coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004) of mail.  

<span id="039">39</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) girded his
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) upon his [armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006),
and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said unto [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002),
I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) put them off him.  

<span id="040">40</span> And he took his staff in his hand, and chose
him five smooth stones out of the [brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006), and
put them in a shepherd's [bag](../ebd/ebd041.htm#008) which he had, even
in a [scrip](../ebd/ebd324.htm#004); and his
[sling](../ebd/ebd346.htm#005) was in his hand: and he drew near to the
Philistine.  

<span id="041">41</span> And the Philistine came on and drew near unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004); and the man that bare the
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001) went before him.  

<span id="042">42</span> And when the Philistine looked about, and saw
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), he disdained him: for he was but a
youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.  

<span id="043">43</span> And the Philistine said unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with
staves? And the Philistine cursed [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) by his
gods.  

<span id="044">44</span> And the Philistine said to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), Come to me, and I will give thy
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) unto the fowls of the air, and to the
beasts of the field.  

<span id="045">45</span> Then said [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) to the
Philistine, Thou comest to me with a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and
with a spear, and with a [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001): but I come to
thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), whom thou hast defied.  

<span id="046">46</span> This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine
hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will
give the carcases of the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) this day unto the fowls of the air,
and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that
there is a God in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="047">47</span> And all this assembly shall know that the LORD
saveth not with [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) and spear: for the battle
is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands.  

<span id="048">48</span> And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose,
and came, and drew nigh to meet [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), that
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) hastened, and ran toward the army to meet
the Philistine.  

<span id="049">49</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) put his hand
in his [bag](../ebd/ebd041.htm#008), and took thence a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), and slang it, and smote the Philistine
in his [forehead](../ebd/ebd137.htm#002), that the
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) sunk into his
[forehead](../ebd/ebd137.htm#002); and he fell upon his face to the
earth.  

<span id="050">50</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) prevailed
over the Philistine with a [sling](../ebd/ebd346.htm#005) and with a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), and smote the Philistine, and slew him;
but there was no [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) in the hand of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="051">51</span> Therefore [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) ran,
and stood upon the Philistine, and took his
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and drew it out of the sheath thereof,
and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) saw their
[champion](../ebd/ebd076.htm#008) was dead, they fled.  

<span id="052">52</span> And the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
and of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) arose, and shouted, and pursued
the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), until thou come to the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008), and to the gates of
[Ekron](../ebd/ebd114.htm#001). And the wounded of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) fell down by the way to
[Shaaraim](../ebd/ebd329.htm#008), even unto
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009), and unto
[Ekron](../ebd/ebd114.htm#001).  

<span id="053">53</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) returned from chasing after the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), and they spoiled their tents.  

<span id="054">54</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) took the
head of the Philistine, and brought it to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005); but he put his
[armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006) in his [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009).  

<span id="055">55</span> And when [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) saw
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) go forth against the Philistine, he said
unto [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002), the captain of the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007), [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002), whose son
is this youth? And [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) said, As thy soul
liveth, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), I cannot tell.  

<span id="056">56</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said,
Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.  

<span id="057">57</span> And as [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) returned
from the slaughter of the Philistine, [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002)
took him, and brought him before [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) with the
head of the Philistine in his hand.  

<span id="058">58</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) said to him,
Whose son art thou, thou young man? And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
answered, I am the son of thy servant [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005) the
Bethlehemite.
