### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Then was [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) led up
of the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) to be tempted of the
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And when he had fasted forty days and forty
nights, he was afterward an hungred.  

<span id="003">3</span> And when the tempter came to him, he said, If
thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> But he answered and said, It is written, Man
shall not live by [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) alone, but by every
word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md) taketh
him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a
[pinnacle](../ebd/ebd295.htm#009.md) of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md),  

<span id="006">6</span> And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God,
cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge
concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any
time thou dash thy foot against a [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto him, It
is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.  

<span id="008">8</span> Again, the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md) taketh
him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms
of the world, and the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of them;  

<span id="009">9</span> And saith unto him, All these things will I give
thee, if thou wilt fall down and [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) me.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then saith [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) unto
him, Get thee hence, [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md): for it is written,
Thou shalt [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) the Lord thy God, and him
only shalt thou serve.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md) leaveth
him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.  

<span id="012">12</span> Now when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) had
heard that John was cast into [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md), he
departed into [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md);  

<span id="013">13</span> And leaving [Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007.md),
he came and dwelt in [Capernaum](../ebd/ebd071.htm#007.md), which is upon
the sea coast, in the borders of [Zabulon](../ebd/ebd386.htm#001.md) and
Nephthalim:  

<span id="014">14</span> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[Esaias](../ebd/ebd124.htm#003) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md),
saying,  

<span id="015">15</span> The land of [Zabulon](../ebd/ebd386.htm#001.md),
and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md) of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md);  

<span id="016">16</span> The people which sat in
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) saw great light; and to them which sat
in the region and [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) of death light is
sprung up.  

<span id="017">17</span> From that time [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) is at hand.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), walking by
the sea of [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md), saw two brethren,
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004) called [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md),
and [Andrew](../ebd/ebd023.htm#007.md) his brother, casting a
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002.md) into the sea: for they were fishers.  

<span id="019">19</span> And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will
make you fishers of men.  

<span id="020">20</span> And they straightway left their nets, and
followed him.  

<span id="021">21</span> And going on from thence, he saw other two
brethren, [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md) the son of
[Zebedee](../ebd/ebd388.htm#008.md), and John his brother, in a ship with
[Zebedee](../ebd/ebd388.htm#008.md) their father, mending their nets; and
he called them.  

<span id="022">22</span> And they immediately left the ship and their
father, and followed him.  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) went about
all [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md), teaching in their synagogues, and
preaching the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) of the kingdom, and
healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the
people.  

<span id="024">24</span> And his fame went throughout all
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md): and they brought unto him all sick
people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those
which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and
those that had the [palsy](../ebd/ebd283.htm#004.md); and he healed them.  

<span id="025">25</span> And there followed him great multitudes of
people from [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md), and from
[Decapolis](../ebd/ebd100.htm#002.md), and from
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and from Judaea, and from beyond
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md).
