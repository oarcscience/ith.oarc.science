### King James Version: Mark Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> And he arose from thence, and cometh into the
coasts of Judaea by the farther side of [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md):
and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught
them again.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md) came
to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife?
tempting him.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he answered and said unto them, What did
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) command you?  

<span id="004">4</span> And they said, [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md)
suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered and
said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this
precept.  

<span id="006">6</span> But from the beginning of the
[creation](../ebd/ebd092.htm#003.md) God made them male and female.  

<span id="007">7</span> For this cause shall a man leave his father and
mother, and cleave to his wife;  

<span id="008">8</span> And they twain shall be one
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md): so then they are no more twain, but one
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> What therefore God hath joined together, let not
man put asunder.  

<span id="010">10</span> And in the house his disciples asked him again
of the same matter.  

<span id="011">11</span> And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put
away his wife, and marry another, committeth
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009.md) against her.  

<span id="012">12</span> And if a woman shall put away her husband, and
be married to another, she committeth
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And they brought young children to him, that he
should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.  

<span id="014">14</span> But when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saw it,
he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children
to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of
God.  

<span id="015">15</span> Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not
receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter
therein.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he took them up in his arms, put his hands
upon them, and blessed them.  

<span id="017">17</span> And when he was gone forth into the way, there
came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what
shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto
him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is,
God.  

<span id="019">19</span> Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009.md), Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not
bear false [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md), Defraud not, Honour thy
father and mother.  

<span id="020">20</span> And he answered and said unto him, Master, all
these have I observed from my youth.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) beholding
him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way,
sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), and thou shalt have treasure in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md): and come, take up the
[cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000.md), and follow me.  

<span id="022">22</span> And he was sad at that saying, and went away
grieved: for he had great possessions.  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) looked round
about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have
riches enter into the kingdom of God!  

<span id="024">24</span> And the disciples were astonished at his words.
But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answereth again, and saith unto them,
Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the
kingdom of God!  

<span id="025">25</span> It is easier for a
[camel](../ebd/ebd070.htm#000.md) to go through the eye of a
[needle](../ebd/ebd269.htm#003.md), than for a rich man to enter into the
kingdom of God.  

<span id="026">26</span> And they were astonished out of measure, saying
among themselves, Who then can be saved?  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) looking upon
them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God
all things are possible.  

<span id="028">28</span> Then [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) began to
say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered and
said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or
brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or
lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,  

<span id="030">30</span> But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this
time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and
lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.  

<span id="031">31</span> But many that are first shall be last; and the
last first.  

<span id="032">32</span> And they were in the way going up to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005); and [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were
afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things
should happen unto him,  

<span id="033">33</span> Saying, Behold, we go up to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md); and the Son of man shall be
delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md); and they shall condemn him to death,
and shall deliver him to the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md):  

<span id="034">34</span> And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him,
and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall
rise again.  

<span id="035">35</span> And [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md) and John,
the sons of [Zebedee](../ebd/ebd388.htm#008.md), come unto him, saying,
Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall
desire.  

<span id="036">36</span> And he said unto them, What would ye that I
should do for you?  

<span id="037">37</span> They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may
sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="038">38</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto
them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) of
the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) that I [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md)
of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?  

<span id="039">39</span> And they said unto him, We can. And
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto them, Ye shall indeed
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000.md) that
I [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) of; and with the baptism that I am
baptized withal shall ye be baptized:  

<span id="040">40</span> But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand
is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is
prepared.  

<span id="041">41</span> And when the ten heard it, they began to be
much displeased with [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md) and John.  

<span id="042">42</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) called them
to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to
rule over the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) exercise lordship over
them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.  

<span id="043">43</span> But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever
will be great among you, shall be your
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md):  

<span id="044">44</span> And whosoever of you will be the chiefest,
shall be servant of all.  

<span id="045">45</span> For even the Son of man came not to be
ministered unto, but to [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md), and to give
his life a [ransom](../ebd/ebd307.htm#005.md) for many.  

<span id="046">46</span> And they came to
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md): and as he went out of
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md) with his disciples and a great number
of people, [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md)
[Bartimaeus](../ebd/ebd046.htm#000.md), the son of
[Timaeus](../ebd/ebd366.htm#003.md), sat by the
[highway](../ebd/ebd178.htm#005.md) side begging.  

<span id="047">47</span> And when he heard that it was
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) of [Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007.md), he
began to cry out, and say, [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), thou son of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) on
me.  

<span id="048">48</span> And many charged him that he should hold his
peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) on
me.  

<span id="049">49</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) stood still,
and commanded him to be called. And they call the
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md) man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort,
rise; he calleth thee.  

<span id="050">50</span> And he, casting away his garment, rose, and
came to [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="051">51</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered and
said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md) man said unto him, Lord, that I might
receive my sight.  

<span id="052">52</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto
him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he
received his sight, and followed [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) in the
way.
