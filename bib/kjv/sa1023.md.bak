### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 23

<span id="001">1</span> Then they told [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md),
saying, Behold, the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) fight against
[Keilah](../ebd/ebd216.htm#009.md), and they rob the threshingfloors.  

<span id="002">2</span> Therefore [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)? And the LORD said unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), Go, and smite the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), and save
[Keilah](../ebd/ebd216.htm#009.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be
afraid here in [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md): how much more then if we
come to [Keilah](../ebd/ebd216.htm#009.md) against the armies of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)?  

<span id="004">4</span> Then [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) enquired of
the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down
to [Keilah](../ebd/ebd216.htm#009.md); for I will deliver the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) into thine hand.  

<span id="005">5</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) and his men
went to [Keilah](../ebd/ebd216.htm#009.md), and fought with the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), and brought away their
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), and smote them with a great slaughter.
So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) saved the inhabitants of
[Keilah](../ebd/ebd216.htm#009.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And it came to pass, when
[Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005.md) the son of
[Ahimelech](../ebd/ebd014.htm#004.md) fled to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) to [Keilah](../ebd/ebd216.htm#009.md), that
he came down with an [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md) in his hand.  

<span id="007">7</span> And it was told [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md)
that [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) was come to
[Keilah](../ebd/ebd216.htm#009). And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said,
God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering
into a town that hath gates and bars.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) called all the
people together to war, to go down to [Keilah](../ebd/ebd216.htm#009.md),
to besiege [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) and his men.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) knew that
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) secretly practised mischief against him;
and he said to [Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005.md) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), Bring hither the
[ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> Then said [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), O
LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), thy servant hath certainly
heard that [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) seeketh to come to
[Keilah](../ebd/ebd216.htm#009.md), to destroy the city for my sake.  

<span id="011">11</span> Will the men of [Keilah](../ebd/ebd216.htm#009.md)
deliver me up into his hand? will [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) come
down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And
the LORD said, He will come down.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then said [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), Will
the men of [Keilah](../ebd/ebd216.htm#009.md) deliver me and my men into
the hand of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md)? And the LORD said, They will
deliver thee up.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) and his
men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of
[Keilah](../ebd/ebd216.htm#009.md), and went whithersoever they could go.
And it was told [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) that
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) was escaped from
[Keilah](../ebd/ebd216.htm#009.md); and he forbare to go forth.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) abode in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) in strong holds, and remained in a
mountain in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) of
[Ziph](../ebd/ebd394.htm#004). And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) sought
him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) saw that
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) was come out to seek his life: and
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) was in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Ziph](../ebd/ebd394.htm#004.md) in
a [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) Saul's
son arose, and went to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) into the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md), and strengthened his hand in God.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) my father shall not find thee; and thou
shalt be [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and I shall be next unto thee; and that
also [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) my father knoweth.  

<span id="018">18</span> And they two made a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) before the LORD: and
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) abode in the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md)
went to his house.  

<span id="019">19</span> Then came up the Ziphites to
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) to [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008.md),
saying, Doth not [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) hide himself with us in
strong holds in the [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md), in the hill of
[Hachilah](../ebd/ebd156.htm#009.md), which is on the south of
[Jeshimon](../ebd/ebd205.htm#002.md)?  

<span id="020">20</span> Now therefore, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),
come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our
part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said, Blessed
be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me.  

<span id="022">22</span> Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see
his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is
told me that he dealeth very subtilly.  

<span id="023">23</span> See therefore, and take knowledge of all the
lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the
certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be
in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And they arose, and went to
[Ziph](../ebd/ebd394.htm#004) before [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md): but
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) and his men were in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Maon](../ebd/ebd241.htm#001.md), in
the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md) on the south of
[Jeshimon](../ebd/ebd205.htm#002.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) also and his men
went to seek him. And they told [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md);
wherefore he came down into a [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md), and abode
in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) of
[Maon](../ebd/ebd241.htm#001). And when [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md)
heard that, he pursued after [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Maon](../ebd/ebd241.htm#001.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) went on this
side of the mountain, and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) and his men on
that side of the mountain: and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) made haste
to get away for fear of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md); for
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) and his men compassed
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) and his men round about to take them.  

<span id="027">27</span> But there came a
[messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005) unto [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md),
saying, Haste thee, and come; for the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) have invaded the land.  

<span id="028">28</span> Wherefore [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md)
returned from pursuing after [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and went
against the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md): therefore they called
that place Selahammahlekoth.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) went up from
thence, and dwelt in strong holds at [Engedi](../ebd/ebd120.htm#009.md).
