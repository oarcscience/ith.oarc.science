### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) the son of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) was strengthened in his kingdom, and the
LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.  

<span id="002">2</span> Then [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) spake unto
all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), to the captains of
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md) and of hundreds, and to the judges,
and to every governor in all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), the chief
of the fathers.  

<span id="003">3</span> So [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), and all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) with him, went to the high place
that was at [Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002.md); for there was the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of God, which
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) the servant of the LORD had made in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> But the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God had
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) brought up from Kirjathjearim to the
place which [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) had prepared for it: for he
had pitched a [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) for it at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Moreover the brasen
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), that [Bezaleel](../ebd/ebd057.htm#009.md)
the son of Uri, the son of [Hur](../ebd/ebd184.htm#009.md), had made, he
put before the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the LORD: and
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) and the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) sought unto it.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) went up
thither to the brasen [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) before the LORD,
which was at the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), and offered a thousand burnt
offerings upon it.  

<span id="007">7</span> In that night did God appear unto
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), and said unto him, Ask what I shall
give thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) said unto
God, Thou hast shewed great [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) my father, and hast made me to reign in
his stead.  

<span id="009">9</span> Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) my father be established: for thou hast
made me [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over a people like the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) of the earth in multitude.  

<span id="010">10</span> Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go
out and come in before this people: for who can
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) this thy people, that is so great?  

<span id="011">11</span> And God said to
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), Because this was in thine heart, and
thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine
enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and
knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md)
my people, over whom I have made thee [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md):  

<span id="012">12</span> Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and
I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the
kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after
thee have the like.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) came from
his [journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md) to the high place that was at
[Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002) to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md),
from before the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), and reigned over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) gathered
chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots,
and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md) cities, and with the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) made
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) as plenteous as stones, and
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md) trees made he as the sycomore trees that
are in the vale for abundance.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) had horses
brought out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008) [yarn](../ebd/ebd384.htm#006.md): the king's
merchants received the [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md)
[yarn](../ebd/ebd384.htm#006.md) at a price.  

<span id="017">17</span> And they fetched up, and brought forth out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) a [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md) for
six hundred shekels of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and an horse for
an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings
of the [Hittites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#006.md), and for the kings of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md), by their means.
