### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> And unto the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of
the church in [Sardis](../ebd/ebd322.htm#006.md) write; These things saith
he that hath the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) Spirits of God, and the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md); I know
thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.  

<span id="002">2</span> Be watchful, and strengthen the things which
remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect
before God.  

<span id="003">3</span> Remember therefore how thou hast received and
heard, and hold [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md), and repent. If therefore
thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not
know what hour I will come upon thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> Thou hast a few names even in
[Sardis](../ebd/ebd322.htm#006.md) which have not defiled their garments;
and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.  

<span id="005">5</span> He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in
white raiment; and I will not [blot](../ebd/ebd061.htm#002.md) out his name
out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father,
and before his angels.  

<span id="006">6</span> He that hath an [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md),
let him hear what the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) saith unto the
churches.  

<span id="007">7</span> And to the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
church in [Philadelphia](../ebd/ebd293.htm#004.md) write; These things
saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the
[key](../ebd/ebd218.htm#002) of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), he that
openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;  

<span id="008">8</span> I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee
an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength,
and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.  

<span id="009">9</span> Behold, I will make them of the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009) of [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md),
which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make
them to come and [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) before thy feet, and
to know that I have loved thee.  

<span id="010">10</span> Because thou hast kept the word of my patience,
I also will keep thee from the hour of
[temptation](../ebd/ebd361.htm#008.md), which shall come upon all the
world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.  

<span id="011">11</span> Behold, I come quickly: hold that
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) which thou hast, that no man take thy
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> Him that overcometh will I make a
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007) in the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md)
of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the
name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), which cometh down out of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) from my God: and I will write upon him
my new name.  

<span id="013">13</span> He that hath an [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md),
let him hear what the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) saith unto the
churches.  

<span id="014">14</span> And unto the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of
the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001), the [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md) and
true [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md), the beginning of the
[creation](../ebd/ebd092.htm#003.md) of God;  

<span id="015">15</span> I know thy works, that thou art neither cold
nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.  

<span id="016">16</span> So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither
cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.  

<span id="017">17</span> Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased
with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art
wretched, and miserable, and [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), and
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009), and [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003.md):  

<span id="018">18</span> I counsel thee to buy of me
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) tried in the fire, that thou mayest be
rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame
of thy nakedness do not appear; and [anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008.md)
thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.  

<span id="019">19</span> As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be
zealous therefore, and repent.  

<span id="020">20</span> Behold, I stand at the door, and
[knock](../ebd/ebd221.htm#008.md): if any man hear my voice, and open the
door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.  

<span id="021">21</span> To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with
me in my [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), even as I also overcame, and
am set down with my Father in his [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> He that hath an [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md),
let him hear what the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) saith unto the
churches.
