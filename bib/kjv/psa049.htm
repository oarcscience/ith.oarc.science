</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Both low and high, rich and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>, together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;I will incline mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> to a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A>: I will open my dark saying upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#001">harp</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd307.htm#005">ransom</A> for him:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;(For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#009">redemption</A> of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For he seeth that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#008">Selah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Like <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> they are laid in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A>; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A> from their dwelling.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But God will redeem my soul from the power of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A>: for he shall receive me. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#008">Selah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of his house is increased;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> shall not descend after him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;He shall go to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A> of his fathers; they shall never see light.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.<BR>
