</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#008">boil</A>, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#004">leaf</A>; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A>, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Thy holy cities are a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A> is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> a desolation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?<BR>
