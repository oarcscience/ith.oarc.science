### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> My son, keep my words, and lay up my
commandments with thee.  

<span id="002">2</span> Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as
the [apple](../ebd/ebd027.htm#004.md) of thine eye.  

<span id="003">3</span> Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the
table of thine heart.  

<span id="004">4</span> Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call
understanding thy kinswoman:  

<span id="005">5</span> That they may keep thee from the strange woman,
from the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) which flattereth with her
words.  

<span id="006">6</span> For at the window of my house I looked through
my [casement](../ebd/ebd073.htm#003.md),  

<span id="007">7</span> And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned
among the youths, a young man void of understanding,  

<span id="008">8</span> Passing through the street near her corner; and
he went the way to her house,  

<span id="009">9</span> In the twilight, in the evening, in the black
and dark night:  

<span id="010">10</span> And, behold, there met him a woman with the
attire of an [harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005.md), and subtil of heart.  

<span id="011">11</span> (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not
in her house:  

<span id="012">12</span> Now is she without, now in the streets, and
lieth in wait at every corner.)  

<span id="013">13</span> So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an
impudent face said unto him,  

<span id="014">14</span> I have peace offerings with me; this day have I
payed my [vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently
to seek thy face, and I have found thee.  

<span id="016">16</span> I have decked my bed with coverings of
tapestry, with carved works, with fine [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> I have perfumed my bed with
[myrrh](../ebd/ebd263.htm#003), [aloes](../ebd/ebd018.htm#004.md), and
[cinnamon](../ebd/ebd083.htm#004.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> Come, let us take our fill of love until the
morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.  

<span id="019">19</span> For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a
long [journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md):  

<span id="020">20</span> He hath taken a [bag](../ebd/ebd041.htm#008.md) of
money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.  

<span id="021">21</span> With her much fair speech she caused him to
yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.  

<span id="022">22</span> He goeth after her straightway, as an
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007.md) goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the
correction of the stocks;  

<span id="023">23</span> Till a [dart](../ebd/ebd097.htm#009.md) strike
through his [liver](../ebd/ebd230.htm#004.md); as a
[bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000.md) hasteth to the
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009.md), and knoweth not that it is for his
life.  

<span id="024">24</span> Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children,
and attend to the words of my mouth.  

<span id="025">25</span> Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not
astray in her paths.  

<span id="026">26</span> For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many
strong men have been slain by her.  

<span id="027">27</span> Her house is the way to
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md), going down to the chambers of death.
