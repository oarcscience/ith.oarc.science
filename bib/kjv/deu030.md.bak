### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 30

<span id="001">1</span> And it shall come to pass, when all these things
are come upon thee, the blessing and the [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md),
which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all
the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee,  

<span id="002">2</span> And shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and
shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou
and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul;  

<span id="003">3</span> That then the LORD thy God will turn thy
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md), and have compassion upon thee, and
will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither the LORD thy
God hath scattered thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost
parts of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), from thence will the LORD thy
God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:  

<span id="005">5</span> And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the
land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will
do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine
heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all
thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the LORD thy God will put all these curses
upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the
LORD, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in
every work of thine hand, in the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of thy
body, and in the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of thy
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), and in the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of thy land, for good: for the LORD will
again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers:  

<span id="010">10</span> If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the
LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are
written in this book of the law, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God
with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.  

<span id="011">11</span> For this commandment which I command thee this
day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off.  

<span id="012">12</span> It is not in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md),
that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and bring it unto us, that we may hear
it, and do it?  

<span id="013">13</span> Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou
shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us,
that we may hear it, and do it?  

<span id="014">14</span> But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy
mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.  

<span id="015">15</span> See, I have set before thee this day life and
good, and death and evil;  

<span id="016">16</span> In that I command thee this day to love the
LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his
statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the
LORD thy God shall [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) thee in the land
whither thou goest to possess it.  

<span id="017">17</span> But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt
not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md)
other gods, and serve them;  

<span id="018">18</span> I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall
surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land,
whither thou passest over [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) to go to
possess it.  

<span id="019">19</span> I call [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) and
earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life
and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou
and thy seed may live:  

<span id="020">20</span> That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and
that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him:
for he is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell
in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), to [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md), and
to [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), to give them.
