### King James Version: Hosea Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he
hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us
up.  

<span id="002">2</span> After two days will he revive us: in the third
day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the
LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto
us as the [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md), as the latter and former
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) unto the earth.  

<span id="004">4</span> O [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), what shall I
do unto thee? O [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), what shall I do unto
thee? for your [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md) is as a morning
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md), and as the early
[dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md) it goeth away.  

<span id="005">5</span> Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I
have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the
light that goeth forth.  

<span id="006">6</span> For I desired [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md),
and not [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md); and the knowledge of God
more than burnt offerings.  

<span id="007">7</span> But they like men have transgressed the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md): there have they dealt treacherously
against me.  

<span id="008">8</span> [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md) is a city of
them that work iniquity, and is polluted with
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the
company of priests [murder](../ebd/ebd262.htm#002.md) in the way by
consent: for they commit [lewdness](../ebd/ebd228.htm#002.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> I have seen an horrible thing in the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): there is the whoredom of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000), [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) is
defiled.  

<span id="011">11</span> Also, O [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), he hath
set an [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md) for thee, when I returned the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md) of my people.
