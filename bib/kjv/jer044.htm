<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 44</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;The word that came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, which dwell at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd254.htm#003">Migdol</A>, and at Tahpanhes, and at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd274.htm#009">Noph</A>, and in the country of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#007">Pathros</A>, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and upon all the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, in that they went to burn <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A>, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But they hearkened not, nor inclined their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> to turn from their wickedness, to burn no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> unto other gods.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Wherefore my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A> and mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and in the streets of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, to leave you none to remain;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> unto other gods in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and in the streets of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And I will take the remnant of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, that have set their faces to go into the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>; they shall even be consumed by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> and by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> and by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>: and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A>, and a reproach.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For I will punish them that dwell in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, as I have punished <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>, and by the pestilence:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;So that none of the remnant of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, which are gone into the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#007">Pathros</A>, answered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A>, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and to pour out <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and in the streets of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;But since we left off to burn <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and to pour out <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> and by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And when we burned <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and poured out <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> her, and pour out <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> offerings unto her, without our men?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> that ye burned in the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and in the streets of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A>, without an inhabitant, as at this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Because ye have burned <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A>, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Moreover <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> that are in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</A> that we have vowed, to burn <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and to pour out <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</A>, and surely perform your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> that dwell in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> in all the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, saying, The Lord GOD liveth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> that are in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> shall be consumed by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> and by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>, until there be an end of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Yet a small number that escape the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> shall return out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> into the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and all the remnant of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, that are gone into the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or their's.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaohhophra <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> into the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, his enemy, and that sought his life.<BR>
