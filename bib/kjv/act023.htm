<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 23</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>, earnestly beholding the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</A>, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</A> before God until this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd023.htm#001">Ananias</A> commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> perceived that the one part were <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</A>, and the other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A>, he cried out in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</A>, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</A>: and the multitude was divided.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</A> say that there is no resurrection, neither <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A>, nor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>: but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> confess both.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And there arose a great cry: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> or an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> should have been pulled in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd073.htm#008">castle</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>: for as thou hast testified of me in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, so must thou bear <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> also at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#007">Rome</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A>, saying that they would neither eat nor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> till they had killed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A>, that we will eat nothing until we have slain <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Now therefore ye with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</A> signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd073.htm#008">castle</A>, and told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> to morrow into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</A>, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A>, that they will neither eat nor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</A>, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And provide them beasts, that they may set <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> on, and bring him safe unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#001">Felix</A> the governor.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And he wrote a letter after this manner:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#003">Claudius</A> Lysias unto the most excellent governor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#001">Felix</A> sendeth greeting.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>, and brought him by night to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd025.htm#004">Antipatris</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd073.htm#008">castle</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Who, when they came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</A> and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> also before him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#003">Cilicia</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.<BR>
