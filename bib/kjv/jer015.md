### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> Then said the LORD unto me, Though
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) stood
before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of
my sight, and let them go forth.  

<span id="002">2</span> And it shall come to pass, if they say unto
thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith
the LORD; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), to the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md);
and such as are for the [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md), to the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md); and such as are for the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md), to the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith
the LORD: the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) to slay, and the dogs to
tear, and the fowls of the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and the
beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.  

<span id="004">4</span> And I will cause them to be removed into all
kingdoms of the earth, because of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) the
son of [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), for that which he did in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> For who shall have pity upon thee, O
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md)? or who shall bemoan thee? or who
shall go aside to ask how thou doest?  

<span id="006">6</span> Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art
gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and
destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.  

<span id="007">7</span> And I will [fan](../ebd/ebd131.htm#001.md) them
with a [fan](../ebd/ebd131.htm#001.md) in the gates of the land; I will
bereave them of children, I will destroy my people since they return not
from their ways.  

<span id="008">8</span> Their [widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003.md) are
increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them
against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused
him to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.  

<span id="009">9</span> She that hath borne
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) languisheth: she hath given up the
[ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005); her [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) is gone
down while it was yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the
residue of them will I deliver to the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md)
before their enemies, saith the LORD.  

<span id="010">10</span> Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a
man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither
lent on [usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006.md), nor men have lent to me on
[usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006.md); yet every one of them doth
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) me.  

<span id="011">11</span> The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy
remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time
of evil and in the time of affliction.  

<span id="012">12</span> Shall [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md) break the
northern [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md) and the
[steel](../ebd/ebd351.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="013">13</span> Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to
the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy
borders.  

<span id="014">14</span> And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies
into a land which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md), which shall burn upon you.  

<span id="015">15</span> O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit
me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy
longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.  

<span id="016">16</span> Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and
thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am
called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.  

<span id="017">17</span> I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor
rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with
indignation.  

<span id="018">18</span> Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound
incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me
as a liar, and as waters that fail?  

<span id="019">19</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return,
then will I bring thee again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if
thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth:
let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.  

<span id="020">20</span> And I will make thee unto this people a fenced
brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not
prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver
thee, saith the LORD.  

<span id="021">21</span> And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the
wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.
