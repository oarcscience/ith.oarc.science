### King James Version: Luke Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> After these things the LORD appointed other
seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city
and place, whither he himself would come.  

<span id="002">2</span> Therefore said he unto them, The
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md) truly is great, but the labourers are
few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md),
that he would send forth labourers into his
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs
among wolves.  

<span id="004">4</span> Carry neither [purse](../ebd/ebd302.htm#008.md),
nor [scrip](../ebd/ebd324.htm#004.md), nor shoes: and salute no man by the
way.  

<span id="005">5</span> And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say,
Peace be to this house.  

<span id="006">6</span> And if the son of peace be there, your peace
shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.  

<span id="007">7</span> And in the same house remain,
[eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006.md) and drinking such things as they give:
for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.  

<span id="008">8</span> And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they
receive you, eat such things as are set before you:  

<span id="009">9</span> And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto
them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.  

<span id="010">10</span> But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they
receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and
say,  

<span id="011">11</span> Even the very [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) of
your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you:
notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh
unto you.  

<span id="012">12</span> But I say unto you, that it shall be more
tolerable in that day for [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004.md), than for that
city.  

<span id="013">13</span> Woe unto thee,
[Chorazin](../ebd/ebd081.htm#007.md)! woe unto thee,
[Bethsaida](../ebd/ebd056.htm#009.md)! for if the mighty works had been
done in [Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001.md) and
[Sidon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#000.md), which have been done in you, they had a
great while ago repented, [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md) in
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001) and [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> But it shall be more tolerable for
[Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001) and [Sidon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#000.md) at the
judgment, than for you.  

<span id="015">15</span> And thou, [Capernaum](../ebd/ebd071.htm#007.md),
which art exalted to [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), shalt be thrust
down to [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> He that heareth you heareth me; and he that
despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that
sent me.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the seventy returned again with joy,
saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name.  

<span id="018">18</span> And he said unto them, I beheld
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000) as [lightning](../ebd/ebd229.htm#002.md)
fall from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> Behold, I give unto you power to tread on
serpents and [scorpions](../ebd/ebd324.htm#001.md), and over all the power
of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.  

<span id="020">20</span> Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the
spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are
written in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> In that hour [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
rejoiced in [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), and said, I thank thee, O
Father, Lord of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) and earth, that thou
hast hid these things from the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) and
prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it
seemed good in thy sight.  

<span id="022">22</span> All things are delivered to me of my Father:
and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father
is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.  

<span id="023">23</span> And he turned him unto his disciples, and said
privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:  

<span id="024">24</span> For I tell you, that many prophets and kings
have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them;
and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.  

<span id="025">25</span> And, behold, a certain
[lawyer](../ebd/ebd225.htm#002.md) stood up, and tempted him, saying,
Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?  

<span id="026">26</span> He said unto him, What is written in the law?
how readest thou?  

<span id="027">27</span> And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord
thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.  

<span id="028">28</span> And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right:
this do, and thou shalt live.  

<span id="029">29</span> But he, willing to justify himself, said unto
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), And who is my neighbour?  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answering
said, A certain man went down from [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) to
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md), and fell among thieves, which stripped
him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half
dead.  

<span id="031">31</span> And by chance there came down a certain
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) that way: and when he saw him, he passed
by on the other side.  

<span id="032">32</span> And likewise a [Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009.md),
when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the
other side.  

<span id="033">33</span> But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came
where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,  

<span id="034">34</span> And went to him, and bound up his wounds,
pouring in oil and [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), and set him on his own
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md), and brought him to an
[inn](../ebd/ebd188.htm#004.md), and took care of him.  

<span id="035">35</span> And on the morrow when he departed, he took out
two pence, and gave them to the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md), and said
unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I
come again, I will repay thee.  

<span id="036">36</span> Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was
neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?  

<span id="037">37</span> And he said, He that shewed
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) on him. Then said
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.  

<span id="038">38</span> Now it came to pass, as they went, that he
entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named
[Martha](../ebd/ebd242.htm#007.md) received him into her house.  

<span id="039">39</span> And she had a sister called
[Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md), which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard
his word.  

<span id="040">40</span> But [Martha](../ebd/ebd242.htm#007.md) was
cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou
not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore
that she help me.  

<span id="041">41</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered and
said unto her, [Martha](../ebd/ebd242.htm#007.md),
[Martha](../ebd/ebd242.htm#007.md), thou art careful and troubled about
many things:  

<span id="042">42</span> But one thing is needful: and
[Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009) hath [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) that
good part, which shall not be taken away from her.
