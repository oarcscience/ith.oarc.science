### King James Version: Joshua Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, when
[Jabin](../ebd/ebd194.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Hazor](../ebd/ebd169.htm#006.md) had heard those things, that he sent to
[Jobab](../ebd/ebd208.htm#003) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Madon](../ebd/ebd236.htm#003), and to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
of [Shimron](../ebd/ebd338.htm#008.md), and to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Achshaph](../ebd/ebd007.htm#002.md),  

<span id="002">2</span> And to the kings that were on the north of the
mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md), and in the borders of
[Dor](../ebd/ebd106.htm#003.md) on the west,  

<span id="003">3</span> And to the [Canaanite](../ebd/ebd070.htm#008.md) on
the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) and on the west, and to the Amorite,
and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains,
and to the Hivite under [Hermon](../ebd/ebd175.htm#006.md) in the land of
Mizpeh.  

<span id="004">4</span> And they went out, they and all their hosts with
them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in
multitude, with horses and chariots very many.  

<span id="005">5</span> And when all these kings were met together, they
came and pitched together at the waters of
[Merom](../ebd/ebd250.htm#003.md), to fight against
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And the LORD said unto
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), Be not afraid because of them: for to
morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): thou shalt
[hough](../ebd/ebd184.htm#000.md) their horses, and burn their chariots
with fire.  

<span id="007">7</span> So [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) came, and all
the people of war with him, against them by the waters of
[Merom](../ebd/ebd250.htm#003.md) suddenly; and they fell upon them.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the LORD delivered them into the hand of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), who smote them, and chased them unto
great [Zidon](../ebd/ebd393.htm#000.md), and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto
the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote
them, until they left them none remaining.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) did unto
them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their
chariots with fire.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) at that
time turned back, and took [Hazor](../ebd/ebd169.htm#006.md), and smote the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) thereof with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003): for [Hazor](../ebd/ebd169.htm#006.md)
beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.  

<span id="011">11</span> And they smote all the souls that were therein
with the edge of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), utterly destroying
them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt
[Hazor](../ebd/ebd169.htm#006.md) with fire.  

<span id="012">12</span> And all the cities of those kings, and all the
kings of them, did [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) take, and smote them
with the edge of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), and he utterly
destroyed them, as [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) the servant of the
LORD commanded.  

<span id="013">13</span> But as for the cities that stood still in their
strength, [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) burned none of them, save
[Hazor](../ebd/ebd169.htm#006.md) only; that did
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) burn.  

<span id="014">14</span> And all the spoil of these cities, and the
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) took for a prey unto themselves; but
every man they smote with the edge of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), until they had destroyed them, neither
left they any to breathe.  

<span id="015">15</span> As the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) his servant, so did
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) command [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md),
and so did [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md); he left nothing undone of
all that the LORD commanded [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> So [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) took all
that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of
[Goshen](../ebd/ebd153.htm#002.md), and the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008), and the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md),
and the mountain of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) of the same;  

<span id="017">17</span> Even from the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Halak](../ebd/ebd159.htm#006.md), that goeth up to
[Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004.md), even unto Baalgad in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md)
under [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Hermon](../ebd/ebd175.htm#006.md):
and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.  

<span id="018">18</span> [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) made war a long
time with all those kings.  

<span id="019">19</span> There was not a city that made peace with the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), save the
[Hivites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#007.md) the inhabitants of
[Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002.md): all other they took in battle.  

<span id="020">20</span> For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts,
that they should come against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) in battle,
that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favour,
but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And at that time came
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), and cut off the Anakims from the
mountains, from [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004.md), from
[Debir](../ebd/ebd099.htm#007), from [Anab](../ebd/ebd022.htm#003.md), and
from all the mountains of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and from all
the mountains of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) destroyed them utterly with their
cities.  

<span id="022">22</span> There was none of the Anakims left in the land
of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): only in
[Gaza](../ebd/ebd144.htm#003), in [Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009.md), and in
[Ashdod](../ebd/ebd033.htm#006.md), there remained.  

<span id="023">23</span> So [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) took the
whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003); and [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) gave
it for an inheritance unto [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) according to
their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.
