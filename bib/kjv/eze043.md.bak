### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 43

<span id="001">1</span> Afterward he brought me to the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), even the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md)
that looketh toward the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md):  

<span id="002">2</span> And, behold, the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md)
of the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) came from the way of the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md): and his voice was like a noise of many
waters: and the earth shined with his [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And it was according to the appearance of the
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md) which I saw, even according to the
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md) that I saw when I came to destroy the
city: and the visions were like the [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md) that
I saw by the river [Chebar](../ebd/ebd078.htm#002.md); and I fell upon my
face.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the
LORD came into the house by the way of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md)
whose prospect is toward the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> So the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) took me
up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the LORD filled the house.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I heard him speaking unto me out of the
house; and the man stood by me.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), and the place of the soles of my feet,
where I will dwell in the midst of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) for ever, and my holy name, shall the
house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) no more defile, neither they,
nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings
in their high places.  

<span id="008">8</span> In their setting of their
[threshold](../ebd/ebd365.htm#000.md) by my thresholds, and their
[post](../ebd/ebd299.htm#001.md) by my posts, and the wall between me and
them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that
they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Now let them put away their whoredom, and the
carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of
them for ever.  

<span id="010">10</span> Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), that they may be ashamed of their
iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.  

<span id="011">11</span> And if they be ashamed of all that they have
done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the
goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms
thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and
all the laws thereof: and write it in their sight, that they may keep
the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.  

<span id="012">12</span> This is the law of the house; Upon the top of
the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy.
Behold, this is the law of the house.  

<span id="013">13</span> And these are the measures of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) after the cubits: The
[cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006) is a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md) and
an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be a
[cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md), and the breadth a
[cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md), and the border thereof by the edge
thereof round about shall be a span: and this shall be the higher place
of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And from the bottom upon the ground even to the
lower settle shall be two cubits, and the breadth one
[cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md); and from the lesser settle even to the
greater settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth one
[cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> So the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) shall be
four cubits; and from the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) and upward
shall be four horns.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) shall be
twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long
and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it
shall be half a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md); and the bottom thereof
shall be a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md) about; and his stairs shall
look toward the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the
Lord GOD; These are the ordinances of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md)
in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon,
and to sprinkle [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) thereon.  

<span id="019">19</span> And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites
that be of the seed of [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008.md), which approach
unto me, to [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) unto me, saith the Lord
GOD, a young [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md) for a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And thou shalt take of the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) thereof, and put it on the four horns of
it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round
about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it.  

<span id="021">21</span> Thou shalt take the
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md) also of the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and he
shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of
the goats without [blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md) for a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md); and they
shall cleanse the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), as they did cleanse it
with the [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> When thou hast made an end of cleansing it,
thou shalt offer a young [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md) without
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007), and a [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md) out
of the flock without [blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and
the priests shall cast [salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008.md) upon them, and they
shall offer them up for a burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) unto
the LORD.  

<span id="025">25</span> [Seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days shalt thou
prepare every day a [goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001.md) for a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md): they
shall also prepare a young [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md), and a
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md) out of the flock, without
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> [Seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days shall they
purge the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) and purify it; and they shall
consecrate themselves.  

<span id="027">27</span> And when these days are expired, it shall be,
that upon the eighth day, and so forward, the priests shall make your
burnt offerings upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), and your peace
offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord GOD.
