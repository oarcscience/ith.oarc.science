### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why
art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?  

<span id="002">2</span> O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou
hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.  

<span id="003">3</span> But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the
praises of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="004">4</span> Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and
thou didst deliver them.  

<span id="005">5</span> They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they
trusted in thee, and were not confounded.  

<span id="006">6</span> But I am a [worm](../ebd/ebd384.htm#000), and no
man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.  

<span id="007">7</span> All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they
shoot out the [lip](../ebd/ebd230.htm#002), they shake the head,
saying,  

<span id="008">8</span> He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver
him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.  

<span id="009">9</span> But thou art he that took me out of the womb:
thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.  

<span id="010">10</span> I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my
God from my mother's [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000).  

<span id="011">11</span> Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for
there is none to help.  

<span id="012">12</span> Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003) have beset me round.  

<span id="013">13</span> They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a
ravening and a roaring lion.  

<span id="014">14</span> I am poured out like water, and all my bones
are out of joint: my heart is like [wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000); it is
melted in the midst of my [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004).  

<span id="015">15</span> My strength is dried up like a
[potsherd](../ebd/ebd299.htm#004); and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws;
and thou hast brought me into the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) of
death.  

<span id="016">16</span> For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the
wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.  

<span id="017">17</span> I may tell all my bones: they look and stare
upon me.  

<span id="018">18</span> They part my garments among them, and cast lots
upon my vesture.  

<span id="019">19</span> But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my
strength, haste thee to help me.  

<span id="020">20</span> Deliver my soul from the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003); my [darling](../ebd/ebd098.htm#000) from
the power of the dog.  

<span id="021">21</span> Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast
heard me from the horns of the unicorns.  

<span id="022">22</span> I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in
the midst of the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) will I praise
thee.  

<span id="023">23</span> Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the
seed of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), [glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005)
him; and fear him, all ye the seed of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="024">24</span> For he hath not despised nor abhorred the
affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but
when he cried unto him, he heard.  

<span id="025">25</span> My praise shall be of thee in the great
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004): I will pay my
[vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001) before them that fear him.  

<span id="026">26</span> The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall
praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.  

<span id="027">27</span> All the ends of the world shall remember and
turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) before thee.  

<span id="028">28</span> For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the
governor among the nations.  

<span id="029">29</span> All they that be [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005)
upon earth shall eat and [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002): all they that
go down to the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) shall
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) before him: and none can keep alive his own
soul.  

<span id="030">30</span> A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted
to the Lord for a [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008).  

<span id="031">31</span> They shall come, and shall declare his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) unto a people that shall be born,
that he hath done this.
