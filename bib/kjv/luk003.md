### King James Version: Luke Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of
Tiberius [Caesar](../ebd/ebd068.htm#002.md), Pontius Pilate being governor
of Judaea, and Herod being [tetrarch](../ebd/ebd363.htm#000.md) of
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md), and his brother
[Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008) [tetrarch](../ebd/ebd363.htm#000.md) of
[Ituraea](../ebd/ebd191.htm#008.md) and of the region of
[Trachonitis](../ebd/ebd371.htm#004.md), and
[Lysanias](../ebd/ebd234.htm#001) the [tetrarch](../ebd/ebd363.htm#000.md)
of [Abilene](../ebd/ebd003.htm#008.md),  

<span id="002">2</span> [Annas](../ebd/ebd024.htm#007.md) and
[Caiaphas](../ebd/ebd068.htm#006.md) being the high priests, the word of
God came unto John the son of [Zacharias](../ebd/ebd386.htm#006.md) in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And he came into all the country about
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), preaching the baptism of
[repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008.md) for the remission of sins;  

<span id="004">4</span> As it is written in the book of the words of
[Esaias](../ebd/ebd124.htm#003) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md),
saying, The voice of one crying in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
make his paths straight.  

<span id="005">5</span> Every [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) shall be
filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the
crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made
smooth;  

<span id="006">6</span> And all [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) shall see
the [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) of God.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then said he to the multitude that came forth to
be baptized of him, O [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) of vipers, who
hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?  

<span id="008">8</span> Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of
[repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008.md), and begin not to say within
yourselves, We have [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) to our father: for
I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children
unto [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And now also the [axe](../ebd/ebd037.htm#003.md) is
laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not
forth good [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) is hewn down, and cast into
the fire.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the people asked him, saying, What shall we
do then?  

<span id="011">11</span> He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath
two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat,
let him do likewise.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then came also publicans to be baptized, and
said unto him, Master, what shall we do?  

<span id="013">13</span> And he said unto them, Exact no more than that
which is appointed you.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the soldiers likewise demanded of him,
saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no
man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your
[wages](../ebd/ebd378.htm#004.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And as the people were in expectation, and all
men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), or not;  

<span id="016">16</span> John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed
baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the
[latchet](../ebd/ebd224.htm#006.md) of whose shoes I am not worthy to
unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md) and with fire:  

<span id="017">17</span> Whose [fan](../ebd/ebd131.htm#001.md) is in his
hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and will gather the
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000) into his [garner](../ebd/ebd143.htm#005.md);
but the [chaff](../ebd/ebd075.htm#007.md) he will burn with fire
unquenchable.  

<span id="018">18</span> And many other things in his exhortation
preached he unto the people.  

<span id="019">19</span> But Herod the
[tetrarch](../ebd/ebd363.htm#000.md), being reproved by him for
[Herodias](../ebd/ebd176.htm#006.md) his brother Philip's wife, and for all
the evils which Herod had done,  

<span id="020">20</span> Added yet this above all, that he shut up John
in [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> Now when all the people were baptized, it came
to pass, that [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) also being baptized, and
praying, the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) was opened,  

<span id="022">22</span> And the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md)
descended in a bodily shape like a [dove](../ebd/ebd106.htm#007.md) upon
him, and a voice came from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), which said,
Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) himself
began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son
of [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), which was the son of
