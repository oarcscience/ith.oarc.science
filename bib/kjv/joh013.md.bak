### King James Version: John Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> Now before the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) of
the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md), when
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) knew that his hour was come that he
should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own
which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [supper](../ebd/ebd353.htm#004.md) being ended,
the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md) having now put into the heart of
[Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001) [Iscariot](../ebd/ebd190.htm#000.md),
Simon's son, to betray him;  

<span id="003">3</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) knowing that the
Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from
God, and went to God;  

<span id="004">4</span> He riseth from [supper](../ebd/ebd353.htm#004.md),
and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.  

<span id="005">5</span> After that he poureth water into a bason, and
began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel
wherewith he was girded.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then cometh he to [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md)
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002): and [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) saith
unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?  

<span id="007">7</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered and said
unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know
hereafter.  

<span id="008">8</span> [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) saith unto him,
Thou shalt never wash my feet. [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered
him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.  

<span id="009">9</span> [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md)
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only,
but also my hands and my head.  

<span id="010">10</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saith to him, He
that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) every whit: and ye are
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md), but not all.  

<span id="011">11</span> For he knew who should betray him; therefore
said he, Ye are not all [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> So after he had washed their feet, and had
taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye
what I have done to you?  

<span id="013">13</span> Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well;
for so I am.  

<span id="014">14</span> If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed
your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.  

<span id="015">15</span> For I have given you an example, that ye should
do as I have done to you.  

<span id="016">16</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is
not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that
sent him.  

<span id="017">17</span> If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do
them.  

<span id="018">18</span> I speak not of you all: I know whom I have
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md): but that the
[scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005.md) may be fulfilled, He that eateth
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) with me hath lifted up his heel against
me.  

<span id="019">19</span> Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is
come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.  

<span id="020">20</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that
receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me
receiveth him that sent me.  

<span id="021">21</span> When [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) had thus
said, he was troubled in [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), and testified,
and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray
me.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then the disciples looked one on another,
doubting of whom he spake.  

<span id="023">23</span> Now there was leaning on Jesus'
[bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md) one of his disciples, whom
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) loved.  

<span id="024">24</span> [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md)
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) therefore beckoned to him, that he should
ask who it should be of whom he spake.  

<span id="025">25</span> He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him,
Lord, who is it?  

<span id="026">26</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered, He it
is, to whom I shall give a [sop](../ebd/ebd348.htm#004.md), when I have
dipped it. And when he had dipped the [sop](../ebd/ebd348.htm#004.md), he
gave it to [Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001.md)
[Iscariot](../ebd/ebd190.htm#000.md), the son of
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And after the [sop](../ebd/ebd348.htm#004.md)
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md) entered into him. Then said
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.  

<span id="028">28</span> Now no man at the table knew for what intent he
spake this unto him.  

<span id="029">29</span> For some of them thought, because
[Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001) had the [bag](../ebd/ebd041.htm#008.md),
that [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) had said unto him, Buy those things
that we have need of against the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md); or,
that he should give something to the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> He then having received the
[sop](../ebd/ebd348.htm#004.md) went immediately out: and it was night.  

<span id="031">31</span> Therefore, when he was gone out,
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said, Now is the Son of man glorified,
and God is glorified in him.  

<span id="032">32</span> If God be glorified in him, God shall also
[glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005.md) him in himself, and shall straightway
[glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005.md) him.  

<span id="033">33</span> Little children, yet a little while I am with
you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye
cannot come; so now I say to you.  

<span id="034">34</span> A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love
one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.  

<span id="035">35</span> By this shall all men know that ye are my
disciples, if ye have love one to another.  

<span id="036">36</span> [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md)
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou?
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered him, Whither I go, thou canst
not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.  

<span id="037">37</span> [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) said unto him,
Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy
sake.  

<span id="038">38</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered him,
Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto
thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.
