<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 20</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, and preached the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A>, the chief priests and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> came upon him with the elders,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;The baptism of John, was it from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, or of men?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But and if we say, Of men; all the people will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> us: for they be persuaded that John was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then began he to speak to the people this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A>; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#007">heir</A>: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Whosoever shall fall upon that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#006">grind</A> him to powder.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the chief priests and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A> against them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And they watched him, and sent forth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#007">spies</A>, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Is it lawful for us to give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</A>, or no?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Shew me a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd289.htm#002">penny</A>. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Render therefore unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</A> the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Then came to him certain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</A>, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Saying, Master, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;There were therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And the third took her; and in like manner the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> also: and they left no children, and died.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Last of all the woman died also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> had her to wife.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Now that the dead are raised, even <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> shewed at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd067.htm#000">bush</A>, when he calleth the Lord the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, and the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, and the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;Then certain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> answering said, Master, thou hast well said.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, How say they that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> is David's son?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> himself saith in the book of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#005">Psalms</A>, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;Till I make thine enemies thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#009">footstool</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;Beware of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A>, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#008">damnation</A>.<BR>
