### King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> We then, as workers together with him, beseech
you also that ye receive not the [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of God
in vain.  

<span id="002">2</span> (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time
accepted, and in the day of [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) have I
succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day
of [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003)..md)  

<span id="003">3</span> Giving no offence in any thing, that the
ministry be not blamed:  

<span id="004">4</span> But in all things approving ourselves as the
ministers of God, in much patience, in
[afflictions](../ebd/ebd011.htm#006.md), in necessities, in distresses,  

<span id="005">5</span> In [stripes](../ebd/ebd352.htm#005.md), in
imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in
[watchings](../ebd/ebd379.htm#004.md), in fastings;  

<span id="006">6</span> By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by
kindness, by the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md), by love
unfeigned,  

<span id="007">7</span> By the word of truth, by the power of God, by
the [armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006.md) of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) on the right hand and on the
left,  

<span id="008">8</span> By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good
report: as deceivers, and yet true;  

<span id="009">9</span> As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and,
behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;  

<span id="010">10</span> As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), yet making many rich; as having nothing,
and yet possessing all things.  

<span id="011">11</span> O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you,
our heart is enlarged.  

<span id="012">12</span> Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are
straitened in your own [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as
unto my children,) be ye also enlarged.  

<span id="014">14</span> Be ye not unequally yoked together with
unbelievers: for what [fellowship](../ebd/ebd132.htm#002.md) hath
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) with unrighteousness? and what
[communion](../ebd/ebd087.htm#004.md) hath light with
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md)?  

<span id="015">15</span> And what concord hath
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) with [Belial](../ebd/ebd051.htm#007.md)? or
what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?  

<span id="016">16</span> And what agreement hath the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) of God with idols? for ye are the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) of the living God; as God hath said, I
will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they
shall be my people.  

<span id="017">17</span> Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye
separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will
receive you.  

<span id="018">18</span> And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be
my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
