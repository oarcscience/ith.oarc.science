### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 29

<span id="001">1</span> Then [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) went on his
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001), and came into the land of the people
of the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he looked, and behold a well in the field,
and, lo, there were three flocks of [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) lying
by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) was upon the well's mouth.  

<span id="003">3</span> And thither were all the flocks gathered: and
they rolled the [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) from the well's mouth,
and watered the [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), and put the
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) again upon the well's mouth in his
place.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) said unto
them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of
[Haran](../ebd/ebd163.htm#007) are we.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he said unto them, Know ye
[Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008) the son of
[Nahor](../ebd/ebd265.htm#006)? And they said, We know him.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he said unto them, Is he well? And they
said, He is well: and, behold, [Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) his
daughter cometh with the [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005).  

<span id="007">7</span> And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is
it time that the [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) should be gathered
together: water ye the [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), and go and feed
them.  

<span id="008">8</span> And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks
be gathered together, and till they [roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004) the
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) from the well's mouth; then we water the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005).  

<span id="009">9</span> And while he yet spake with them,
[Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) came with her father's
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005); for she kept them.  

<span id="010">10</span> And it came to pass, when
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) saw [Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) the
daughter of [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008) his mother's brother, and the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) of [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008) his
mother's brother, that [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) went near, and
rolled the [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) from the well's mouth, and
watered the flock of [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008) his mother's
brother.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) kissed
[Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004), and lifted up his voice, and wept.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) told
[Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) that he was her father's brother, and
that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.  

<span id="013">13</span> And it came to pass, when
[Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008) heard the tidings of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) his sister's son, that he ran to meet
him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And
he told [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008) all these things.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008) said to him,
Surely thou art my bone and my [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007). And he
abode with him the space of a month.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008) said unto
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), Because thou art my brother, shouldest
thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy
[wages](../ebd/ebd378.htm#004) be?  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008) had two
daughters: the name of the [elder](../ebd/ebd114.htm#008) was
[Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006), and the name of the younger was
[Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004).  

<span id="017">17</span> [Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006) was tender eyed;
but [Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) was beautiful and well favoured.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) loved
[Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004); and said, I will serve thee
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) years for [Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004)
thy younger daughter.  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008) said, It is
better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another
man: abide with me.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) served
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) years for
[Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004); and they seemed unto him but a few
days, for the love he had to her.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) said unto
[Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008), Give me my wife, for my days are
fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008) gathered
together all the men of the place, and made a
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000).  

<span id="023">23</span> And it came to pass in the evening, that he
took [Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006) his daughter, and brought her to him;
and he went in unto her.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008) gave unto
his daughter [Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006)
[Zilpah](../ebd/ebd393.htm#005) his maid for an
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008).  

<span id="025">25</span> And it came to pass, that in the morning,
behold, it was [Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006): and he said to
[Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008), What is this thou hast done unto me? did
not I serve with thee for [Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004)? wherefore
then hast thou beguiled me?  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008) said, It
must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the
firstborn.  

<span id="027">27</span> Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this
also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) other years.  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) did so, and
fulfilled her week: and he gave him [Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) his
daughter to wife also.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008) gave to
[Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) his daughter
[Bilhah](../ebd/ebd058.htm#008) his [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008) to
be her maid.  

<span id="030">30</span> And he went in also unto
[Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004), and he loved also
[Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) more than [Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006),
and served with him yet [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) other years.  

<span id="031">31</span> And when the LORD saw that
[Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006) was hated, he opened her womb: but
[Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) was [barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007).  

<span id="032">32</span> And [Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006) conceived,
and bare a son, and she called his name [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009):
for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now
therefore my husband will love me.  

<span id="033">33</span> And she conceived again, and bare a son; and
said, Because the LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given
me this son also: and she called his name
[Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002).  

<span id="034">34</span> And she conceived again, and bare a son; and
said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have
born him three sons: therefore was his name called
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006).  

<span id="035">35</span> And she conceived again, and bare a son: and
she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007); and left bearing.
