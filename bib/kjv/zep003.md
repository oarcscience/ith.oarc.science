### King James Version: Zephaniah Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the
oppressing city!  

<span id="002">2</span> She obeyed not the voice; she received not
correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.  

<span id="003">3</span> Her princes within her are roaring
[lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001); her judges are evening wolves; they gnaw
not the bones till the morrow.  

<span id="004">4</span> Her prophets are light and treacherous persons:
her priests have polluted the [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005), they
have done violence to the law.  

<span id="005">5</span> The just LORD is in the midst thereof; he will
not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he
faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.  

<span id="006">6</span> I have cut off the nations: their
[towers](../ebd/ebd371.htm#002) are desolate; I made their streets
waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there
is no man, that there is none inhabitant.  

<span id="007">7</span> I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt
receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever
I punished them: but they rose early, and corrupted all their doings.  

<span id="008">8</span> Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until
the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather
the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine
indignation, even all my fierce [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002): for all
the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my
[jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008).  

<span id="009">9</span> For then will I turn to the people a pure
language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him
with one consent.  

<span id="010">10</span> From beyond the rivers of
[Ethiopia](../ebd/ebd126.htm#005) my suppliants, even the daughter of my
dispersed, shall bring mine [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001).  

<span id="011">11</span> In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all
thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will
take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and
thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.  

<span id="012">12</span> I will also leave in the midst of thee an
afflicted and [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) people, and they shall trust
in the name of the LORD.  

<span id="013">13</span> The remnant of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue
be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none
shall make them afraid.  

<span id="014">14</span> Sing, O daughter of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002); shout, O [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000);
be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="015">15</span> The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath
cast out thine enemy: the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), even the LORD, is in the midst of thee:
thou shalt not see evil any more.  

<span id="016">16</span> In that day it shall be said to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), Fear thou not: and to
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), Let not thine hands be slack.  

<span id="017">17</span> The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is
mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest
in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.  

<span id="018">18</span> I will gather them that are sorrowful for the
solemn assembly, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007).  

<span id="019">19</span> Behold, at that time I will undo all that
afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was
driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they
have been put to shame.  

<span id="020">20</span> At that time will I bring you again, even in
the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise
among all people of the earth, when I turn back your
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) before your eyes, saith the LORD.
