### King James Version: Mark Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> And they came over unto the other side of the
sea, into the country of the [Gadarenes](../ebd/ebd140.htm#009.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And when he was come out of the ship,
immediately there met him out of the [tombs](../ebd/ebd370.htm#001.md) a
man with an unclean [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md),  

<span id="003">3</span> Who had his dwelling among the
[tombs](../ebd/ebd370.htm#001.md); and no man could bind him, no, not with
chains:  

<span id="004">4</span> Because that he had been often bound with
fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and
the fetters broken in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md): neither could any
man tame him.  

<span id="005">5</span> And always, night and day, he was in the
mountains, and in the [tombs](../ebd/ebd370.htm#001.md), crying, and
[cutting](../ebd/ebd095.htm#000.md) himself with stones.  

<span id="006">6</span> But when he saw [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
afar off, he ran and worshipped him,  

<span id="007">7</span> And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have
I to do with thee, [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), thou Son of the most
high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou
[torment](../ebd/ebd370.htm#009.md) me not.  

<span id="008">8</span> For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou
unclean [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And he asked him, What is thy name? And he
answered, saying, My name is [Legion](../ebd/ebd226.htm#008.md): for we are
many.  

<span id="010">10</span> And he besought him much that he would not send
them away out of the country.  

<span id="011">11</span> Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a
great [herd](../ebd/ebd174.htm#009) of [swine](../ebd/ebd354.htm#002.md)
feeding.  

<span id="012">12</span> And all the devils besought him, saying, Send
us into the [swine](../ebd/ebd354.htm#002.md), that we may enter into
them.  

<span id="013">13</span> And forthwith [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the
[swine](../ebd/ebd354.htm#002): and the [herd](../ebd/ebd174.htm#009.md)
ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two
thousand;) and were choked in the sea.  

<span id="014">14</span> And they that fed the
[swine](../ebd/ebd354.htm#002.md) fled, and told it in the city, and in the
country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.  

<span id="015">15</span> And they come to
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), and see him that was possessed with the
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md), and had the
[legion](../ebd/ebd226.htm#008), [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md), and
clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.  

<span id="016">16</span> And they that saw it told them how it befell to
him that was possessed with the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md), and also
concerning the [swine](../ebd/ebd354.htm#002.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And they began to pray him to depart out of
their coasts.  

<span id="018">18</span> And when he was come into the ship, he that had
been possessed with the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md) prayed him that
he might be with him.  

<span id="019">19</span> Howbeit [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) suffered
him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how
great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on
thee.  

<span id="020">20</span> And he departed, and began to publish in
[Decapolis](../ebd/ebd100.htm#002.md) how great things
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) had done for him: and all men did
marvel.  

<span id="021">21</span> And when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) was
passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto
him: and he was nigh unto the sea.  

<span id="022">22</span> And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of
the [synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009), [Jairus](../ebd/ebd196.htm#002.md)
by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,  

<span id="023">23</span> And besought him greatly, saying, My little
daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy
hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) went with
him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.  

<span id="025">25</span> And a certain woman, which had an issue of
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) twelve years,  

<span id="026">26</span> And had suffered many things of many
physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered,
but rather grew worse,  

<span id="027">27</span> When she had heard of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), came in the press behind, and touched
his garment.  

<span id="028">28</span> For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I
shall be whole.  

<span id="029">29</span> And straightway the
[fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000) of her [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md)
was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), immediately
knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in
the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?  

<span id="031">31</span> And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the
multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?  

<span id="032">32</span> And he looked round about to see her that had
done this thing.  

<span id="033">33</span> But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing
what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all
the truth.  

<span id="034">34</span> And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath
made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md).  

<span id="035">35</span> While he yet spake, there came from the ruler
of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why
troublest thou the Master any further?  

<span id="036">36</span> As soon as [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) heard
the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009.md), Be not afraid, only believe.  

<span id="037">37</span> And he suffered no man to follow him, save
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002), and [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md), and
John the brother of [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md).  

<span id="038">38</span> And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009.md), and seeth the tumult, and them that
wept and wailed greatly.  

<span id="039">39</span> And when he was come in, he saith unto them,
Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.  

<span id="040">40</span> And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had
put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and
them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.  

<span id="041">41</span> And he took the damsel by the hand, and said
unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto
thee, arise.  

<span id="042">42</span> And straightway the damsel arose, and walked;
for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a
great astonishment.  

<span id="043">43</span> And he charged them straitly that no man should
know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.
