### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 48

<span id="001">1</span> Against [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) thus saith
the LORD of hosts, the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); Woe unto
[Nebo](../ebd/ebd268.htm#004.md)! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is
confounded and taken: [Misgab](../ebd/ebd256.htm#005.md) is confounded and
dismayed.  

<span id="002">2</span> There shall be no more praise of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005): in [Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009.md) they
have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a
nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O [Madmen](../ebd/ebd236.htm#000.md);
the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) shall pursue thee.  

<span id="003">3</span> A voice of crying shall be from
[Horonaim](../ebd/ebd182.htm#005.md), spoiling and great
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) is destroyed; her
little ones have caused a cry to be heard.  

<span id="005">5</span> For in the going up of
[Luhith](../ebd/ebd233.htm#001.md) continual weeping shall go up; for in
the going down of [Horonaim](../ebd/ebd182.htm#005.md) the enemies have
heard a cry of [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Flee, save your lives, and be like the
[heath](../ebd/ebd170.htm#004.md) in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> For because thou hast trusted in thy works and
in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and
[Chemosh](../ebd/ebd078.htm#007.md) shall go forth into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md) with his priests and his princes
together.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and
no city shall escape: the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) also shall
perish, and the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md) shall be destroyed, as
the LORD hath spoken.  

<span id="009">9</span> Give wings unto [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md),
that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate,
without any to dwell therein.  

<span id="010">10</span> Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD
deceitfully, and cursed be he that keepeth back his
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) from [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) hath been at ease
from his youth, and he hath settled on his
[lees](../ebd/ebd226.htm#005.md), and hath not been emptied from vessel to
vessel, neither hath he gone into [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md):
therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the
LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to
wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) shall be
ashamed of [Chemosh](../ebd/ebd078.htm#007.md), as the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) was ashamed of
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md) their confidence.  

<span id="014">14</span> How say ye, We are mighty and strong men for
the war?  

<span id="015">15</span> [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) is spoiled, and
gone up out of her cities, and his [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) young
men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), whose name is the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="016">16</span> The calamity of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md)
is near to come, and his affliction hasteth
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all
ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, and the
beautiful rod!  

<span id="018">18</span> Thou daughter that dost inhabit
[Dibon](../ebd/ebd103.htm#005.md), come down from thy
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) shall come upon thee, and he shall destroy
thy strong holds.  

<span id="019">19</span> O inhabitant of [Aroer](../ebd/ebd032.htm#001.md),
stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth,
and say, What is done?  

<span id="020">20</span> [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) is confounded;
for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in
[Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000), that [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) is
spoiled,  

<span id="021">21</span> And judgment is come upon the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md) country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah,
and upon [Mephaath](../ebd/ebd248.htm#005.md),  

<span id="022">22</span> And upon [Dibon](../ebd/ebd103.htm#005.md), and
upon [Nebo](../ebd/ebd268.htm#004.md), and upon Bethdiblathaim,  

<span id="023">23</span> And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and
upon Bethmeon,  

<span id="024">24</span> And upon [Kerioth](../ebd/ebd217.htm#008.md), and
upon [Bozrah](../ebd/ebd063.htm#009.md), and upon all the cities of the
land of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), far or near.  

<span id="025">25</span> The [horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003.md) of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith
the LORD.  

<span id="026">26</span> Make ye him drunken: for he magnified himself
against the LORD: [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) also shall wallow in his
vomit, and he also shall be in derision.  

<span id="027">27</span> For was not [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) a
derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest
of him, thou skippedst for joy.  

<span id="028">28</span> O ye that dwell in
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), leave the cities, and dwell in the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md), and be like the
[dove](../ebd/ebd106.htm#007.md) that maketh her nest in the sides of the
hole's mouth.  

<span id="029">29</span> We have heard the pride of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), (he is exceeding proud.md) his loftiness,
and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.  

<span id="030">30</span> I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but it shall
not be so; his lies shall not so effect it.  

<span id="031">31</span> Therefore will I howl for
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), and I will cry out for all
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md); mine heart shall
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004.md) for the men of Kirheres.  

<span id="032">32</span> O [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md) of
[Sibmah](../ebd/ebd342.htm#006.md), I will weep for thee with the weeping
of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea
of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy
vintage.  

<span id="033">33</span> And joy and gladness is taken from the
plentiful field, and from the land of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), and
I have caused [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) to fail from the
winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no
shouting.  

<span id="034">34</span> From the cry of
[Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009.md) even unto
[Elealeh](../ebd/ebd114.htm#009.md), and even unto
[Jahaz](../ebd/ebd195.htm#005.md), have they uttered their voice, from
[Zoar](../ebd/ebd395.htm#004.md) even unto
[Horonaim](../ebd/ebd182.htm#005), as an [heifer](../ebd/ebd171.htm#006.md)
of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.  

<span id="035">35</span> Moreover I will cause to cease in
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), saith the LORD, him that offereth in the
high places, and him that burneth [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) to
his gods.  

<span id="036">36</span> Therefore mine heart shall sound for
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) like pipes, and mine heart shall sound
like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches that he hath
gotten are perished.  

<span id="037">37</span> For every head shall be bald, and every
[beard](../ebd/ebd049.htm#000.md) clipped: upon all the hands shall be
cuttings, and upon the loins [sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001.md).  

<span id="038">38</span> There shall be
[lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005.md) generally upon all the housetops of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), and in the streets thereof: for I have
broken [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) like a vessel wherein is no
pleasure, saith the LORD.  

<span id="039">39</span> They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down!
how hath [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) turned the back with shame! so
shall [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) be a derision and a dismaying to all
them about him.  

<span id="040">40</span> For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall
[fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004) as an [eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003.md), and
shall spread his wings over [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md).  

<span id="041">41</span> [Kerioth](../ebd/ebd217.htm#008.md) is taken, and
the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) at that day shall be as the heart of a
woman in her pangs.  

<span id="042">42</span> And [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) shall be
destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against
the LORD.  

<span id="043">43</span> Fear, and the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md), and
the [snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009.md), shall be upon thee, O inhabitant of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), saith the LORD.  

<span id="044">44</span> He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into
the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md); and he that getteth up out of the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md) shall be taken in the
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009.md): for I will bring upon it, even upon
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), the year of their visitation, saith the
LORD.  

<span id="045">45</span> They that fled stood under the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) of [Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009.md)
because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of
[Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009.md), and a flame from the midst of
[Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002.md), and shall devour the corner of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), and the [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) of
the head of the tumultuous ones.  

<span id="046">46</span> Woe be unto thee, O
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md)! the people of
[Chemosh](../ebd/ebd078.htm#007.md) perisheth: for thy sons are taken
captives, and thy daughters captives.  

<span id="047">47</span> Yet will I bring again the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) in
the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md).
