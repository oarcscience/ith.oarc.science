### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 33

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Depart, and go up hence, thou and the
people which thou hast brought up out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), unto the land which I sware unto
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), to [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md), and
to [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), saying, Unto thy seed will I give
it:  

<span id="002">2</span> And I will send an
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) before thee; and I will drive out the
[Canaanite](../ebd/ebd070.htm#008.md), the Amorite, and the Hittite, and
the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:  

<span id="003">3</span> Unto a land flowing with
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000) and [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md): for I
will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people:
lest I consume thee in the way.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when the people heard these evil tidings,
they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.  

<span id="005">5</span> For the LORD had said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Say unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will
come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore
now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto
thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) stripped themselves of their ornaments
by the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Horeb](../ebd/ebd181.htm#009.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) took the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), and pitched it without the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md), afar off from the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md), and called it the
[Tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md). And it came to pass, that every
one which sought the LORD went out unto the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), which was without the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And it came to pass, when
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) went out unto the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), that all the people rose up, and
stood every man at his [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) door, and looked
after [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), until he was gone into the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And it came to pass, as
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) entered into the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), the cloudy
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md) descended, and stood at the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), and the Lord talked with
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And all the people saw the cloudy
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md) stand at the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) door: and all the people rose up and
worshipped, every man in his [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) door.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) face to face, as a man speaketh unto his
friend. And he turned again into the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md): but
his servant [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), the son of
[Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006.md), a young man, departed not out of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said unto
the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast
not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know
thee by name, and thou hast also found [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) in
my sight.  

<span id="013">13</span> Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I
may know thee, that I may find [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) in thy
sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he said, My presence shall go with thee,
and I will give thee rest.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he said unto him, If thy presence go not
with me, carry us not up hence.  

<span id="016">16</span> For wherein shall it be known here that I and
thy people have found [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) in thy sight? is it
not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy
people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), I will do this thing also that thou hast
spoken: for thou hast found [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) in my sight,
and I know thee by name.  

<span id="018">18</span> And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And he said, I will make all my
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md) pass before thee, and I will proclaim
the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be
gracious, and will shew [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) on whom I will
shew [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for
there shall no man see me, and live.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by
me, and thou shalt stand upon a [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md):  

<span id="022">22</span> And it shall come to pass, while my
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) passeth by, that I will put thee in a
clift of the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md), and will cover thee with my
hand while I pass by:  

<span id="023">23</span> And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt
see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.
