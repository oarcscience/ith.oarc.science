### King James Version: Mark Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> And again he entered into
[Capernaum](../ebd/ebd071.htm#007.md) after some days; and it was noised
that he was in the house.  

<span id="002">2</span> And straightway many were gathered together,
insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as
about the door: and he preached the word unto them.  

<span id="003">3</span> And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the
[palsy](../ebd/ebd283.htm#004.md), which was borne of four.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when they could not come nigh unto him for
the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had
broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the
[palsy](../ebd/ebd283.htm#004.md) lay.  

<span id="005">5</span> When [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saw their
faith, he said unto the sick of the [palsy](../ebd/ebd283.htm#004.md), Son,
thy sins be forgiven thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> But there was certain of the
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md) there,
and reasoning in their hearts,  

<span id="007">7</span> Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who
can forgive sins but God only?  

<span id="008">8</span> And immediately when
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) perceived in his
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) that they so reasoned within themselves,
he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?  

<span id="009">9</span> Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the
[palsy](../ebd/ebd283.htm#004.md), Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say,
Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?  

<span id="010">10</span> But that ye may know that the Son of man hath
power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the
[palsy](../ebd/ebd283.htm#004),.md)  

<span id="011">11</span> I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed,
and go thy way into thine house.  

<span id="012">12</span> And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and
went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and
glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he went forth again by the sea side; and
all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.  

<span id="014">14</span> And as he passed by, he saw
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006.md) the son of
[Alphaeus](../ebd/ebd018.htm#005) [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md) at
the receipt of [custom](../ebd/ebd094.htm#008.md), and said unto him,
Follow me. And he arose and followed him.  

<span id="015">15</span> And it came to pass, that, as
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) sat at meat in his house, many publicans
and sinners sat also together with [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) and
his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.  

<span id="016">16</span> And when the [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md)
and [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md) saw him eat with publicans and
sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and
drinketh with publicans and sinners?  

<span id="017">17</span> When [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) heard it,
he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the
[physician](../ebd/ebd295.htm#000.md), but they that are sick: I came not
to call the righteous, but sinners to
[repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And the disciples of John and of the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md) used to
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md): and they come and say unto him, Why do
the disciples of John and of the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md)
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md), but thy disciples
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) not?  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto
them, Can the children of the bridechamber
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md), while the bridegroom is with them? as
long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> But the days will come, when the bridegroom
shall be taken away from them, and then shall they
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) in those days.  

<span id="021">21</span> No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an
old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the
old, and the [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) is made worse.  

<span id="022">22</span> And no man putteth new
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) into old bottles: else the new
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) doth burst the bottles, and the
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) is spilled, and the bottles will be
marred: but new [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) must be put into new
bottles.  

<span id="023">23</span> And it came to pass, that he went through the
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md) fields on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) day; and his disciples began, as they
went, to pluck the ears of [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md) said
unto him, Behold, why do they on the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md)
day that which is not lawful?  

<span id="025">25</span> And he said unto them, Have ye never read what
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) did, when he had need, and was an
hungred, he, and they that were with him?  

<span id="026">26</span> How he went into the house of God in the days
of [Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005.md) the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), and did eat the
[shewbread](../ebd/ebd336.htm#008.md), which is not lawful to eat but for
the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?  

<span id="027">27</span> And he said unto them, The
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) was made for man, and not man for the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md):  

<span id="028">28</span> Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md).
