### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> And when [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md) was
ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md), and said unto him, I am the Almighty
God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.  

<span id="002">2</span> And I will make my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) between me and thee, and will multiply
thee exceedingly.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md) fell on his
face: and God talked with him, saying,  

<span id="004">4</span> As for me, behold, my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) is with thee, and thou shalt be a
father of many nations.  

<span id="005">5</span> Neither shall thy name any more be called
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md), but thy name shall be
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md); for a father of many nations have I
made thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I
will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.  

<span id="007">7</span> And I will establish my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) between me and thee and thy seed after
thee in their generations for an [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md)
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md), to be a God unto thee, and to thy
seed after thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after
thee, the land wherein thou art a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md), all
the land of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md), for an
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) possession; and I will be their
God.  

<span id="009">9</span> And God said unto
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), Thou shalt keep my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) therefore, thou, and thy seed after
thee in their generations.  

<span id="010">10</span> This is my [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md),
which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every
man child among you shall be circumcised.  

<span id="011">11</span> And ye shall circumcise the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of your foreskin; and it shall be a token
of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) betwixt me and you.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he that is eight days old shall be
circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is
born in the house, or bought with money of any
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md), which is not of thy seed.  

<span id="013">13</span> He that is born in thy house, and he that is
bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) shall be in your
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) for an
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md)
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And the uncircumcised man child whose
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of his foreskin is not circumcised, that
soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And God said unto
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), As for [Sarai](../ebd/ebd322.htm#004.md)
thy wife, thou shalt not call her name [Sarai](../ebd/ebd322.htm#004.md),
but [Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md) shall her name be.  

<span id="016">16</span> And I will [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) her,
and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) her, and she shall be a mother of
nations; kings of people shall be of her.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) fell upon
his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto
him that is an hundred years old? and shall
[Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md), that is ninety years old, bear?  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) said unto
God, O that [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md) might live before thee!  

<span id="019">19</span> And God said, [Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md)
thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md): and I will establish my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with him for an
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md),
and with his seed after him.  

<span id="020">20</span> And as for [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md), I
have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful,
and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I
will make him a great nation.  

<span id="021">21</span> But my [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) will I
establish with [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md), which
[Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md) shall bear unto thee at this set time in
the next year.  

<span id="022">22</span> And he left off talking with him, and God went
up from [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) took
[Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md) his son, and all that were born in his
house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men
of Abraham's house; and circumcised the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md)
of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) was ninety
years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of his foreskin.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md) his son
was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of his foreskin.  

<span id="026">26</span> In the selfsame day was
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) circumcised, and
[Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md) his son.  

<span id="027">27</span> And all the men of his house, born in the
house, and bought with money of the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md),
were circumcised with him.
