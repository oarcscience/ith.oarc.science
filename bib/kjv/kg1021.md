### King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass after these things, that
[Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006) the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was
in [Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008), hard by the
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008) of [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) spake unto
[Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006), saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I
may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and
I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good
to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006) said to
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002), The LORD forbid it me, that I should give
the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) came into his
house heavy and displeased because of the word which
[Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006) the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he
had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he
laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006).  

<span id="005">5</span> But [Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006) his wife
came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) so sad, that thou eatest no
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006)?  

<span id="006">6</span> And he said unto her, Because I spake unto
[Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006) the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give
me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee
another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my
vineyard.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006) his wife
said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)? arise, and eat
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and let thine heart be merry: I will
give thee the vineyard of [Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006) the
Jezreelite.  

<span id="008">8</span> So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed
them with his [seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002), and sent the letters unto
the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with
[Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006).  

<span id="009">9</span> And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004), and set [Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006)
on high among the people:  

<span id="010">10</span> And set two men, sons of
[Belial](../ebd/ebd051.htm#007), before him, to bear
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) against him, saying, Thou didst
blaspheme God and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001). And then carry him
out, and [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) him, that he may die.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the men of his city, even the elders and
the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as
[Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006) had sent unto them, and as it was
written in the letters which she had sent unto them.  

<span id="012">12</span> They proclaimed a
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004), and set [Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006)
on high among the people.  

<span id="013">13</span> And there came in two men, children of
[Belial](../ebd/ebd051.htm#007), and sat before him: and the men of
[Belial](../ebd/ebd051.htm#007) witnessed against him, even against
[Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006), in the presence of the people, saying,
[Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006) did blaspheme God and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001). Then they carried him forth out of the
city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then they sent to
[Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006), saying,
[Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006) is stoned, and is dead.  

<span id="015">15</span> And it came to pass, when
[Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006) heard that
[Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006) was stoned, and was dead, that
[Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006) said to [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002),
Arise, take possession of the vineyard of
[Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006) the Jezreelite, which he refused to give
thee for money: for [Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006) is not alive, but
dead.  

<span id="016">16</span> And it came to pass, when
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) heard that [Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006)
was dead, that [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) rose up to go down to the
vineyard of [Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006) the Jezreelite, to take
possession of it.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the word of the LORD came to
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) the [Tishbite](../ebd/ebd368.htm#003),
saying,  

<span id="018">18</span> Arise, go down to meet
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which is in
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004): behold, he is in the vineyard of
[Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006), whither he is gone down to possess
it.  

<span id="019">19</span> And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus
saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou
shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where
dogs licked the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of
[Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006) shall dogs lick thy
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), even thine.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) said to
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009), Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And
he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work
evil in the sight of the LORD.  

<span id="021">21</span> Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will
take away thy posterity, and will cut off from
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) him that pisseth against the wall, and him
that is shut up and left in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),  

<span id="022">22</span> And will make thine house like the house of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) the son of
[Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003), and like the house of
[Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008) the son of
[Ahijah](../ebd/ebd014.htm#000), for the provocation wherewith thou hast
provoked me to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), and made
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="023">23</span> And of [Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006) also
spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat
[Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006) by the wall of
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008).  

<span id="024">24</span> Him that dieth of [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002)
in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall
the fowls of the air eat.  

<span id="025">25</span> But there was none like unto
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002), which did sell himself to work wickedness
in the sight of the LORD, whom [Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006) his wife
stirred up.  

<span id="026">26</span> And he did very abominably in following idols,
according to all things as did the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006),
whom the LORD cast out before the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="027">27</span> And it came to pass, when
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) heard those words, that he
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007) his clothes, and put
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001) upon his
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), and fasted, and lay in
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001), and went softly.  

<span id="028">28</span> And the word of the LORD came to
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) the [Tishbite](../ebd/ebd368.htm#003),
saying,  

<span id="029">29</span> Seest thou how [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002)
humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I
will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days will I bring
the evil upon his house.
