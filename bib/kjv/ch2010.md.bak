### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> And [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) went to
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md): for to
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md) were all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) come to make him
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And it came to pass, when
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) the son of
[Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003.md), who was in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), whither he fled from the presence of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),
heard it, that [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) returned out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And they sent and called him. So
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) and all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) came and spake to
[Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md), saying,  

<span id="004">4</span> Thy father made our
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md) grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat
the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md) that he put upon us, and we will serve
thee.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he said unto them, Come again unto me after
three days. And the people departed.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) took counsel with the old men that had
stood before [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) his father while he yet
lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this
people?  

<span id="007">7</span> And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind
to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will
be thy servants for ever.  

<span id="008">8</span> But he forsook the counsel which the old men
gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with
him, that stood before him.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he said unto them, What advice give ye that
we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying,
Ease somewhat the [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md) that thy father did put
upon us?  

<span id="010">10</span> And the young men that were brought up with him
spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake
unto thee, saying, Thy father made our [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md)
heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say
unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.  

<span id="011">11</span> For whereas my father put a heavy
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md) upon you, I will put more to your
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md): my father chastised you with whips, but I
will chastise you with [scorpions](../ebd/ebd324.htm#001.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> So [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) and all
the people came to [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) on the third day,
as the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) bade, saying, Come again to me on
the third day.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) answered
them roughly; and [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) forsook the counsel of the old men,  

<span id="014">14</span> And answered them after the advice of the young
men, saying, My father made your [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md) heavy,
but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will
chastise you with [scorpions](../ebd/ebd324.htm#001.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> So the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) hearkened
not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might
perform his word, which he spake by the hand of
[Ahijah](../ebd/ebd014.htm#000) the [Shilonite](../ebd/ebd337.htm#009.md)
to [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) the son of
[Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And when all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
saw that the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) would not hearken unto them,
the people answered the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), saying, What
portion have we in [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)? and we have none
inheritance in the son of [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005.md): every man to
your tents, O [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and now,
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), see to thine own house. So all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) went to their tents.  

<span id="017">17</span> But as for the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) that dwelt in the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md)
reigned over them.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007) sent [Hadoram](../ebd/ebd158.htm#001.md)
that was over the [tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006.md); and the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) stoned him with stones, that he died.
But [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) made
speed to get him up to his [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md), to flee to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) rebelled
against the house of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) unto this day.
