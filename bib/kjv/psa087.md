### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 87

<span id="001">1</span> His foundation is in the holy mountains.  

<span id="002">2</span> The LORD loveth the gates of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md) more than all the
[dwellings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#001) of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of
God. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> I will make mention of
[Rahab](../ebd/ebd305.htm#006) and [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md) to
them that know me: behold [Philistia](../ebd/ebd294.htm#001.md), and
[Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001), with [Ethiopia](../ebd/ebd126.htm#005.md);
this man was born there.  

<span id="005">5</span> And of [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md) it shall be
said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall
establish her.  

<span id="006">6</span> The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the
people, that this man was born there. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> As well the singers as the players on
instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee.
