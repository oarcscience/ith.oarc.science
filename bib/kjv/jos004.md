### King James Version: Joshua Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, when all the people were
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) passed over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), that the LORD spake unto
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Take you twelve men out of the people, out of
every [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) a man,  

<span id="003">3</span> And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out
of the midst of [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), out of the place where
the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them
over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall
[lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002.md) this night.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) called the
twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), out of every
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) a man:  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) said unto
them, Pass over before the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD your
God into the midst of [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), and take you up
every man of you a [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) upon his shoulder,
according unto the number of the tribes of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):  

<span id="006">6</span> That this may be a sign among you, that when
your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by
these stones?  

<span id="007">7</span> Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) were cut off before the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of
the LORD; when it passed over [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), the
waters of [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) were cut off: and these stones
shall be for a memorial unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) for ever.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) did so as
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) commanded, and took up twelve stones out
of the midst of [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), as the LORD spake unto
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), according to the number of the tribes
of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and carried them
over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down
there.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) set up
twelve stones in the midst of [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), in the
place where the feet of the priests which bare the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md)
stood: and they are there unto this day.  

<span id="010">10</span> For the priests which bare the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) stood in the midst of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), until everything was finished that the
LORD commanded [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) to speak unto the people,
according to all that [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) commanded
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md): and the people hasted and passed
over.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it came to pass, when all the people were
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) passed over, that the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD passed over, and the priests,
in the presence of the people.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the children of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009.md), and the children of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md), and half the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md),
passed over armed before the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), as [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) spake
unto them:  

<span id="013">13</span> About forty thousand prepared for war passed
over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> On that day the LORD magnified
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) in the sight of all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); and they feared him, as they feared
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), all the days of his life.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), saying,  

<span id="016">16</span> Command the priests that bear the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md),
that they come up out of [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) therefore
commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And it came to pass, when the priests that bare
the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of the LORD were come up out of the
midst of [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), and the soles of the priests'
feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) returned unto their place, and flowed
over all his banks, as they did before.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the people came up out of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) on the tenth day of the first month, and
encamped in [Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md), in the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) border of
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And those twelve stones, which they took out of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), did [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md)
[pitch](../ebd/ebd296.htm#008) in [Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And he spake unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), saying, When your children shall ask
their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?  

<span id="022">22</span> Then ye shall let your children know, saying,
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) came over this
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) on dry land.  

<span id="023">23</span> For the LORD your God dried up the waters of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) from before you, until ye were passed
over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from
before us, until we were gone over:  

<span id="024">24</span> That all the people of the earth might know the
hand of the LORD, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your
God for ever.
