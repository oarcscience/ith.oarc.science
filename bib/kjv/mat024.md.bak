### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) went out, and
departed from the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md): and his disciples
came to him for to shew him the buildings of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto
them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall
not be left here one [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) upon another, that
shall not be thrown down.  

<span id="003">3</span> And as he sat upon the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) of Olives, the disciples came unto him
privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall
be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered and
said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.  

<span id="005">5</span> For many shall come in my name, saying, I am
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md); and shall deceive many.  

<span id="006">6</span> And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars:
see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but
the end is not yet.  

<span id="007">7</span> For nation shall rise against nation, and
kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences,
and earthquakes, in divers places.  

<span id="008">8</span> All these are the beginning of sorrows.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted,
and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's
sake.  

<span id="010">10</span> And then shall many be offended, and shall
betray one another, and shall hate one another.  

<span id="011">11</span> And many false prophets shall rise, and shall
deceive many.  

<span id="012">12</span> And because iniquity shall abound, the love of
many shall [wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000.md) cold.  

<span id="013">13</span> But he that shall endure unto the end, the same
shall be saved.  

<span id="014">14</span> And this [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) of the
kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) unto all nations; and then shall the
end come.  

<span id="015">15</span> When ye therefore shall see the
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md) of desolation, spoken of by
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md),
stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)  

<span id="016">16</span> Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the
mountains:  

<span id="017">17</span> Let him which is on the housetop not come down
to take any thing out of his house:  

<span id="018">18</span> Neither let him which is in the field return
back to take his clothes.  

<span id="019">19</span> And woe unto them that are with child, and to
them that give suck in those days!  

<span id="020">20</span> But pray ye that your flight be not in the
winter, neither on the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) day:  

<span id="021">21</span> For then shall be great
[tribulation](../ebd/ebd372.htm#005.md), such as was not since the
beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.  

<span id="022">22</span> And except those days should be shortened,
there should no [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) be saved: but for the
elect's sake those days shall be shortened.  

<span id="023">23</span> Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), or there; believe it not.  

<span id="024">24</span> For there shall arise false Christs, and false
prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it
were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.  

<span id="025">25</span> Behold, I have told you before.  

<span id="026">26</span> Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold,
he is in the [desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000.md); go not forth: behold, he
is in the secret chambers; believe it not.  

<span id="027">27</span> For as the [lightning](../ebd/ebd229.htm#002.md)
cometh out of the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md), and shineth even unto
the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  

<span id="028">28</span> For wheresoever the
[carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md) is, there will the eagles be gathered
together.  

<span id="029">29</span> Immediately after the
[tribulation](../ebd/ebd372.htm#005.md) of those days shall the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) be darkened, and the
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004.md) shall not give her light, and the
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md) shall fall from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and the powers of the heavens shall be
shaken:  

<span id="030">30</span> And then shall appear the sign of the Son of
man in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md): and then shall all the tribes of
the earth [mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004.md), and they shall see the Son of
man coming in the clouds of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) with power
and great [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> And he shall send his angels with a great sound
of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four
[winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009.md), from one end of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) to the other.  

<span id="032">32</span> Now learn a [parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md) of
the [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001.md) tree; When his
[branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002.md) is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves,
ye know that summer is nigh:  

<span id="033">33</span> So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these
things, know that it is near, even at the
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md).  

<span id="034">34</span> Verily I say unto you, This
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) shall not pass, till all these
things be fulfilled.  

<span id="035">35</span> [Heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) and earth shall
pass away, but my words shall not pass away.  

<span id="036">36</span> But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no,
not the angels of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), but my Father only.  

<span id="037">37</span> But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the
coming of the Son of man be.  

<span id="038">38</span> For as in the days that were before the
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000) they were [eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006.md)
and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe
entered into the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md),  

<span id="039">39</span> And knew not until the
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000.md) came, and took them all away; so shall
also the coming of the Son of man be.  

<span id="040">40</span> Then shall two be in the field; the one shall
be taken, and the other left.  

<span id="041">41</span> Two women shall be grinding at the
[mill](../ebd/ebd255.htm#001.md); the one shall be taken, and the other
left.  

<span id="042">42</span> Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your
Lord doth come.  

<span id="043">43</span> But know this, that if the goodman of the house
had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and
would not have suffered his house to be broken up.  

<span id="044">44</span> Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour
as ye think not the Son of man cometh.  

<span id="045">45</span> Who then is a [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md)
and [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) servant, whom his lord hath made ruler
over his household, to give them meat in due season?  

<span id="046">46</span> Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he
cometh shall find so doing.  

<span id="047">47</span> Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him
ruler over all his goods.  

<span id="048">48</span> But and if that evil servant shall say in his
heart, My lord delayeth his coming;  

<span id="049">49</span> And shall begin to smite his fellowservants,
and to eat and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) with the drunken;  

<span id="050">50</span> The lord of that servant shall come in a day
when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,  

<span id="051">51</span> And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his
portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of
teeth.
