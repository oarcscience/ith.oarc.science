### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 132

<span id="001">1</span> Lord, remember [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md),
and all his [afflictions](../ebd/ebd011.htm#006.md):  

<span id="002">2</span> How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the
mighty God of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md);  

<span id="003">3</span> Surely I will not come into the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of my house, nor go up into my
bed;  

<span id="004">4</span> I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber
to mine eyelids,  

<span id="005">5</span> Until I find out a place for the LORD, an
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md) for the mighty God of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Lo, we heard of it at
[Ephratah](../ebd/ebd123.htm#006.md): we found it in the fields of the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> We will go into his tabernacles: we will
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) at his
[footstool](../ebd/ebd136.htm#009.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of thy strength.  

<span id="009">9</span> Let thy priests be clothed with
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md); and let thy saints shout for
joy.  

<span id="010">10</span> For thy servant David's sake turn not away the
face of thine anointed.  

<span id="011">11</span> The LORD hath sworn in truth unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md); he will not turn from it; Of the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of thy body will I set upon thy
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> If thy children will keep my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) and my
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md) that I shall teach them, their
children shall also sit upon thy [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) for
evermore.  

<span id="013">13</span> For the LORD hath
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md); he hath
desired it for his [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell;
for I have desired it.  

<span id="015">15</span> I will abundantly
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) her provision: I will satisfy her
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) with [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> I will also clothe her priests with
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md): and her saints shall shout aloud for
joy.  

<span id="017">17</span> There will I make the
[horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003) of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) to bud:
I have ordained a [lamp](../ebd/ebd223.htm#007.md) for mine anointed.  

<span id="018">18</span> His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon
himself shall his [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) flourish.
