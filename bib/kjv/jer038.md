### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 38

<span id="001">1</span> Then [Shephatiah](../ebd/ebd335.htm#005) the son
of [Mattan](../ebd/ebd243.htm#007), and
[Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009) the son of
[Pashur](../ebd/ebd286.htm#002), and Jucal the son of
[Shelemiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#001), and [Pashur](../ebd/ebd286.htm#002)
the son of [Malchiah](../ebd/ebd239.htm#001), heard the words that
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) had spoken unto all the people,
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this
city shall die by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), by the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000), and by the pestilence: but he that
goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for
a prey, and shall live.  

<span id="003">3</span> Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be
given into the hand of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of Babylon's
army, which shall take it.  

<span id="004">4</span> Therefore the princes said unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), We beseech thee, let this man be put to
death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in
this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto
them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the
hurt.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) is not he that can do any thing against
you.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then took they
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006), and cast him into the
[dungeon](../ebd/ebd109.htm#006) of [Malchiah](../ebd/ebd239.htm#001)
the son of [Hammelech](../ebd/ebd160.htm#009), that was in the court of
the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006): and they let down
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) with cords. And in the
[dungeon](../ebd/ebd109.htm#006) there was no water, but mire: so
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) sunk in the mire.  

<span id="007">7</span> Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the
eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) in the
[dungeon](../ebd/ebd109.htm#006); the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) then
[sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009) in the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008);  

<span id="008">8</span> Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house,
and spake to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) saying,  

<span id="009">9</span> My lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), these
men have done evil in all that they have done to
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008),
whom they have cast into the [dungeon](../ebd/ebd109.htm#006); and he is
like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) in the city.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men
with thee, and take up [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) out of the
[dungeon](../ebd/ebd109.htm#006), before he die.  

<span id="011">11</span> So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went
into the house of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) under the
[treasury](../ebd/ebd372.htm#000), and took thence old cast clouts and
old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the
[dungeon](../ebd/ebd109.htm#006) to [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006).  

<span id="012">12</span> And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006), Put now these old cast clouts and
rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) did so.  

<span id="013">13</span> So they drew up
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) with cords, and took him up out of the
[dungeon](../ebd/ebd109.htm#006): and [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006)
remained in the court of the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006).  

<span id="014">14</span> Then [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) sent, and took
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)
unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said unto
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006), I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing
from me.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) said
unto [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008), If I declare it unto thee, wilt
thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou
not hearken unto me?  

<span id="016">16</span> So [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) sware secretly unto
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006), saying, As the LORD liveth, that made
us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee
into the hand of these men that seek thy life.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then said [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006)
unto [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008), Thus saith the LORD, the God of
hosts, the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); If thou wilt
assuredly go forth unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of Babylon's
princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned
with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:  

<span id="018">18</span> But if thou wilt not go forth to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of Babylon's princes, then shall this city
be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with
fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said unto
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006), I am afraid of the Jews that are
fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they
mock me.  

<span id="020">20</span> But [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) said,
They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the
LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy
soul shall live.  

<span id="021">21</span> But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the
word that the LORD hath shewed me:  

<span id="022">22</span> And, behold, all the women that are left in the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of Judah's house shall be brought forth to
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of Babylon's princes, and those women
shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against
thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.  

<span id="023">23</span> So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy
children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand,
but shalt be taken by the hand of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001): and thou shalt cause this city to be
burned with fire.  

<span id="024">24</span> Then said [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008)
unto [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006), Let no man know of these words,
and thou shalt not die.  

<span id="025">25</span> But if the princes hear that I have talked with
thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now
what thou hast said unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), hide it not
from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said unto thee:  

<span id="026">26</span> Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my
supplication before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), that he would not
cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.  

<span id="027">27</span> Then came all the princes unto
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006), and asked him: and he told them
according to all these words that the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) had
commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not
perceived.  

<span id="028">28</span> So [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) abode in
the court of the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006) until the day that
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) was taken: and he was there when
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) was taken.
