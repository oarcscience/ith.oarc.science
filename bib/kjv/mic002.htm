<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Micah Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;In that day shall one take up a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A> against you, and lament with a doleful <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</A>, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#000">cord</A> by lot in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;O thou that art named the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of the LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;If a man walking in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> and of strong <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>; he shall even be the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> of this people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;I will surely assemble, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; I will put them together as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#009">Bozrah</A>, as the flock in the midst of their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#007">fold</A>: they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>, and are gone out by it: and their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.<BR>
