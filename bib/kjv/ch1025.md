<span id="001">1</span> Moreover [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) and the
captains of the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) separated to the service
of the sons of [Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002.md), and of
[Heman](../ebd/ebd173.htm#009.md), and of
[Jeduthun](../ebd/ebd199.htm#009.md), who should prophesy with harps, with
psalteries, and with [cymbals](../ebd/ebd095.htm#001.md): and the number of
the workmen according to their service was:  

<span id="002">2</span> Of the sons of [Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002.md);
[Zaccur](../ebd/ebd386.htm#004), and [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md),
and [Nethaniah](../ebd/ebd271.htm#004.md), and Asarelah, the sons of
[Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002.md) under the hands of
[Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002.md), which prophesied according to the order
of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> Of [Jeduthun](../ebd/ebd199.htm#009.md): the sons
of [Jeduthun](../ebd/ebd199.htm#009); [Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009.md),
and Zeri, and [Jeshaiah](../ebd/ebd204.htm#007.md),
[Hashabiah](../ebd/ebd166.htm#001.md), and
[Mattithiah](../ebd/ebd244.htm#006.md), six, under the hands of their
father [Jeduthun](../ebd/ebd199.htm#009.md), who prophesied with a
[harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001.md), to give thanks and to praise the LORD.  

<span id="004">4</span> Of [Heman](../ebd/ebd173.htm#009.md): the sons of
[Heman](../ebd/ebd173.htm#009.md): Bukkiah,
[Mattaniah](../ebd/ebd243.htm#009), [Uzziel](../ebd/ebd376.htm#005.md),
[Shebuel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#000), and [Jerimoth](../ebd/ebd203.htm#009.md),
[Hananiah](../ebd/ebd162.htm#004), [Hanani](../ebd/ebd162.htm#003.md),

Joshbekashah, [Mallothi](../ebd/ebd239.htm#004.md), Hothir, and
[Mahazioth](../ebd/ebd237.htm#008.md):  

<span id="005">5</span> All these were the sons of
[Heman](../ebd/ebd173.htm#009) the king's [seer](../ebd/ebd326.htm#000.md)
in the words of God, to lift up the [horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003.md). And
God gave to [Heman](../ebd/ebd173.htm#009.md) fourteen sons and three
daughters.  

<span id="006">6</span> All these were under the hands of their father
for song in the house of the LORD, with
[cymbals](../ebd/ebd095.htm#001.md), psalteries, and harps, for the service
of the house of God, according to the king's order to
[Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002), [Jeduthun](../ebd/ebd199.htm#009.md), and
[Heman](../ebd/ebd173.htm#009.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> So the number of them, with their brethren that
were instructed in the [songs](../ebd/ebd348.htm#002.md) of the LORD, even
all that were cunning, was two hundred fourscore and eight.  

<span id="008">8</span> And they cast lots,
[ward](../ebd/ebd379.htm#001) against [ward](../ebd/ebd379.htm#001.md), as
well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar.  

<span id="009">9</span> Now the first lot came forth for
[Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002) to [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md): the
second to [Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009.md), who with his brethren and
