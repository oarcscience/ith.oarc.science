</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</A> fell down through a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd224.htm#008">lattice</A> in his upper <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A> that was in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#001">Ekron</A> whether I shall recover of this disease.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd368.htm#003">Tishbite</A>, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>, and say unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#001">Ekron</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> departed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#001">Ekron</A>? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#009">leather</A> about his loins. And he said, It is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd368.htm#003">Tishbite</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> hath said, Come down.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and consumed him and his fifty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said, Come down quickly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and consumed him and his fifty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A>, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Behold, there came fire down from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A>, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#001">Ekron</A>, is it not because there is no God in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;So he died according to the word of the LORD which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> had spoken. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</A> reigned in his stead in the second year of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>; because he had no son.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Now the rest of the acts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</A> which he did, are they not written in the book of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</A> of the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>?<BR>
