### King James Version: Habakkuk Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> A [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) of
[Habakkuk](../ebd/ebd156.htm#004) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)
upon Shigionoth.  

<span id="002">2</span> O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid:
O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the
years make known; in wrath remember [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005).  

<span id="003">3</span> God came from [Teman](../ebd/ebd361.htm#001),
and the Holy One from [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Paran](../ebd/ebd284.htm#006). [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008). His
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) covered the heavens, and the earth was
full of his praise.  

<span id="004">4</span> And his brightness was as the light; he had
horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.  

<span id="005">5</span> Before him went the pestilence, and burning
coals went forth at his feet.  

<span id="006">6</span> He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and
drove asunder the nations; and the [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007)
mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003): his ways are
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007).  

<span id="007">7</span> I saw the tents of
[Cushan](../ebd/ebd094.htm#006) in affliction: and the curtains of the
land of [Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007) did tremble.  

<span id="008">8</span> Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was
thine [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) against the rivers? was thy wrath
against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots
of [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003)?  

<span id="009">9</span> Thy [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) was made quite
[naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003), according to the oaths of the tribes,
even thy word. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008). Thou didst cleave the
earth with rivers.  

<span id="010">10</span> The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the
overflowing of the water passed by: the [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008)
uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high.  

<span id="011">11</span> The [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) and
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004) stood still in their
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007): at the light of thine
[arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005) they went, and at the shining of thy
glittering spear.  

<span id="012">12</span> Thou didst march through the land in
indignation, thou didst thresh the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005) in
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002).  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou wentest forth for the
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) of thy people, even for
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) with thine anointed; thou woundedst
the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation
unto the [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000).
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="014">14</span> Thou didst strike through with his staves the
head of his [villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003): they came out as a
whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing was as to devour the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) secretly.  

<span id="015">15</span> Thou didst walk through the sea with thine
horses, through the [heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000) of great waters.  

<span id="016">16</span> When I heard, my [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000)
trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my
bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of
trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his
troops.  

<span id="017">17</span> Although the [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001) tree
shall not blossom, neither shall [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) be in
the vines; the labour of the [olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009) shall fail,
and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the
[fold](../ebd/ebd136.htm#007), and there shall be no
[herd](../ebd/ebd174.htm#009) in the stalls:  

<span id="018">18</span> Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in
the God of my [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003).  

<span id="019">19</span> The LORD God is my strength, and he will make
my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high
places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.
