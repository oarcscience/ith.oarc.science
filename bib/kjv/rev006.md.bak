### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> And I saw when the [Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md)
opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of
[thunder](../ebd/ebd365.htm#003.md), one of the four beasts saying, Come
and see.  

<span id="002">2</span> And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that
sat on him had a [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md); and a
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) was given unto him: and he went forth
conquering, and to conquer.  

<span id="003">3</span> And when he had opened the second
[seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002.md), I heard the second
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) say, Come and see.  

<span id="004">4</span> And there went out another horse that was red:
and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the
earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto
him a great [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And when he had opened the third
[seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002.md), I heard the third
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a
black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his
hand.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I heard a voice in the midst of the four
beasts say, A measure of [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md) for a
[penny](../ebd/ebd289.htm#002.md), and three measures of
[barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003) for a [penny](../ebd/ebd289.htm#002.md);
and see thou hurt not the oil and the [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And when he had opened the fourth
[seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002.md), I heard the voice of the fourth
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) say, Come and see.  

<span id="008">8</span> And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his
name that sat on him was Death, and [Hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md)
followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of
the earth, to kill with [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), and with hunger,
and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.  

<span id="009">9</span> And when he had opened the fifth
[seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002.md), I saw under the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) the souls of them that were slain for the
word of God, and for the [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md) which they
held:  

<span id="010">10</span> And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How
long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) and avenge our
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) on them that dwell on the earth?  

<span id="011">11</span> And white robes were given unto every one of
them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little
season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should
be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.  

<span id="012">12</span> And I beheld when he had opened the sixth
[seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002.md), and, lo, there was a great
[earthquake](../ebd/ebd110.htm#009.md); and the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) became black as
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001.md) of hair, and the
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004.md) became as
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md);  

<span id="013">13</span> And the [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) fell unto the earth, even as a
[fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001.md) tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is
shaken of a mighty wind.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)
departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and
[island](../ebd/ebd190.htm#009.md) were moved out of their places.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the kings of the earth, and the great men,
and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every
bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks
of the mountains;  

<span id="016">16</span> And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on
us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), and from the wrath of the
[Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md):  

<span id="017">17</span> For the great day of his wrath is come; and who
shall be able to stand?
