### King James Version: James Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007), a servant of God
and of the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), to the twelve tribes which are
scattered abroad, greeting.  

<span id="002">2</span> My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into
divers temptations;  

<span id="003">3</span> Knowing this, that the trying of your faith
worketh patience.  

<span id="004">4</span> But let patience have her perfect work, that ye
may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.  

<span id="005">5</span> If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God,
that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be
given him.  

<span id="006">6</span> But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For
he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and
tossed.  

<span id="007">7</span> For let not that man think that he shall receive
any thing of the Lord.  

<span id="008">8</span> A double minded man is unstable in all his
ways.  

<span id="009">9</span> Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he
is exalted:  

<span id="010">10</span> But the rich, in that he is made low: because
as the flower of the [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005) he shall pass
away.  

<span id="011">11</span> For the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) is no
sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005), and the flower thereof falleth, and the
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) of the fashion of it perisheth: so also
shall the rich man fade away in his ways.  

<span id="012">12</span> Blessed is the man that endureth
[temptation](../ebd/ebd361.htm#008): for when he is tried, he shall
receive the [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of life, which the Lord hath
promised to them that love him.  

<span id="013">13</span> Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted
of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any
man:  

<span id="014">14</span> But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away
of his own [lust](../ebd/ebd233.htm#005), and enticed.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then when [lust](../ebd/ebd233.htm#005) hath
conceived, it bringeth forth [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006): and
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), when it is finished, bringeth forth
death.  

<span id="016">16</span> Do not err, my beloved brethren.  

<span id="017">17</span> Every good [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005) and
every perfect [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005) is from above, and cometh
down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) of turning.  

<span id="018">18</span> Of his own will begat he us with the word of
truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.  

<span id="019">19</span> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man
be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:  

<span id="020">20</span> For the wrath of man worketh not the
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) of God.  

<span id="021">21</span> Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and
superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with
[meekness](../ebd/ebd246.htm#003) the engrafted word, which is able to
save your souls.  

<span id="022">22</span> But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers
only, deceiving your own selves.  

<span id="023">23</span> For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a
doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:  

<span id="024">24</span> For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way,
and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.  

<span id="025">25</span> But whoso looketh into the perfect law of
liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a
doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.  

<span id="026">26</span> If any man among you seem to be religious, and
bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's
religion is vain.  

<span id="027">27</span> Pure religion and undefiled before God and the
Father is this, To visit the fatherless and
[widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003) in their affliction, and to keep himself
unspotted from the world.
