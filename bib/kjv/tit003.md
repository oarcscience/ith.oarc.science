### King James Version: Titus Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Put them in mind to be subject to principalities
and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,  

<span id="002">2</span> To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but
gentle, shewing all [meekness](../ebd/ebd246.htm#003) unto all men.  

<span id="003">3</span> For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish,
disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in
malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.  

<span id="004">4</span> But after that the kindness and love of God our
[Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003) toward man appeared,  

<span id="005">5</span> Not by works of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) which we have done, but according
to his [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) he saved us, by the
[washing](../ebd/ebd379.htm#002) of
[regeneration](../ebd/ebd309.htm#004), and renewing of the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005);  

<span id="006">6</span> Which he shed on us abundantly through
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) our
[Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003);  

<span id="007">7</span> That being justified by his
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000), we should be made heirs according to the
hope of eternal life.  

<span id="008">8</span> This is a [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005)
saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they
which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works.
These things are good and profitable unto men.  

<span id="009">9</span> But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies,
and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable
and vain.  

<span id="010">10</span> A man that is an heretick after the first and
second admonition reject;  

<span id="011">11</span> Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and
sinneth, being condemned of himself.  

<span id="012">12</span> When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or
[Tychicus](../ebd/ebd373.htm#008), be diligent to come unto me to
[Nicopolis](../ebd/ebd272.htm#008): for I have determined there to
winter.  

<span id="013">13</span> Bring [Zenas](../ebd/ebd390.htm#007) the
[lawyer](../ebd/ebd225.htm#002) and [Apollos](../ebd/ebd026.htm#006) on
their [journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001) diligently, that nothing be
wanting unto them.  

<span id="014">14</span> And let our's also learn to maintain good works
for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.  

<span id="015">15</span> All that are with me salute thee. Greet them
that love us in the faith. [Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) be with you
all. [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).
