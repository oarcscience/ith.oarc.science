### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 61

<span id="001">1</span> The [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the Lord
GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings
unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim
liberty to the captives, and the opening of the
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md) to them that are bound;  

<span id="002">2</span> To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and
the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004.md);  

<span id="003">3</span> To appoint unto them that
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004) in [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), to give
unto them beauty for [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000.md), the oil of joy for
mourning, the garment of praise for the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md)
of heaviness; that they might be called trees of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), the planting of the LORD, that
he might be glorified.  

<span id="004">4</span> And they shall build the old wastes, they shall
raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities,
the desolations of many generations.  

<span id="005">5</span> And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks,
and the sons of the [alien](../ebd/ebd017.htm#003.md) shall be your plowmen
and your vinedressers.  

<span id="006">6</span> But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD:
men shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of
the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md), and in their
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) shall ye boast yourselves.  

<span id="007">7</span> For your shame ye shall have double; and for
confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land
they shall possess the double: [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) joy
shall be unto them.  

<span id="008">8</span> For I the LORD love judgment, I hate
[robbery](../ebd/ebd315.htm#000.md) for burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md); and I will direct their work in
truth, and I will make an [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md)
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with them.  

<span id="009">9</span> And their seed shall be known among the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md), and their offspring among the people:
all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which
the LORD hath blessed.  

<span id="010">10</span> I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul
shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md), he hath covered me with the robe of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), as a bridegroom decketh himself
with ornaments, and as a [bride](../ebd/ebd065.htm#001.md) adorneth herself
with her jewels.  

<span id="011">11</span> For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as
the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so
the Lord GOD will cause [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) and
praise to spring forth before all the nations.
