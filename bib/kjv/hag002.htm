<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Haggai Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of the LORD by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> Haggai, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Speak now to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#008">Zerubbabel</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd332.htm#003">Shealtiel</A>, governor of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> the son of Josedech, the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, and to the residue of the people, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Who is left among you that saw this house in her first <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Yet now be strong, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#008">Zerubbabel</A>, saith the LORD; and be strong, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>, son of Josedech, the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work: for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, so my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> remaineth among you: fear ye not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, saith the LORD of hosts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> is mine, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</A>, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;If one bear holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd299.htm#005">pottage</A>, or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> was laid upon a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of the LORD:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Since those days were, when one came to an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A> of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;I smote you with blasting and with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd254.htm#007">mildew</A> and with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A> in all the labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the LORD's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> was laid, consider it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Is the seed yet in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#004">barn</A>? yea, as yet the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</A> tree, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#000">pomegranate</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</A> tree, hath not brought forth: from this day will I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Speak to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#008">Zerubbabel</A>, governor of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And I will overthrow the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> of his brother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#008">Zerubbabel</A>, my servant, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd332.htm#003">Shealtiel</A>, saith the LORD, and will make thee as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#001">signet</A>: for I have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> thee, saith the LORD of hosts.<BR>
