### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 40

<span id="001">1</span> In the five and twentieth year of our
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002), in the beginning of the year, in the
tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was
smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and
brought me thither.  

<span id="002">2</span> In the visions of God brought he me into the
land of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and set me upon a very high
mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he brought me thither, and, behold, there
was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003), with a line of
[flax](../ebd/ebd135.htm#004) in his hand, and a measuring
[reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000); and he stood in the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008).  

<span id="004">4</span> And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold
with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all
that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto
thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="005">5</span> And behold a wall on the outside of the house
round about, and in the man's hand a measuring
[reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000) of six cubits long by the
[cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006) and an hand breadth: so he measured the
breadth of the building, one [reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000); and the
height, one [reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000).  

<span id="006">6</span> Then came he unto the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) which looketh toward the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000), and went up the stairs thereof, and
measured the [threshold](../ebd/ebd365.htm#000) of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), which was one
[reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000) broad; and the other
[threshold](../ebd/ebd365.htm#000) of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008),
which was one [reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000) broad.  

<span id="007">7</span> And every little
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003) was one [reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000)
long, and one [reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000) broad; and between the
little chambers were five cubits; and the
[threshold](../ebd/ebd365.htm#000) of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008)
by the porch of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) within was one
[reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000).  

<span id="008">8</span> He measured also the porch of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) within, one
[reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000).  

<span id="009">9</span> Then measured he the porch of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two
cubits; and the porch of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) was inward.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the little chambers of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) eastward were three on this side, and
three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had
one measure on this side and on that side.  

<span id="011">11</span> And he measured the breadth of the entry of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), ten cubits; and the length of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), thirteen cubits.  

<span id="012">12</span> The space also before the little chambers was
one [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006) on this side, and the space was one
[cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006) on that side: and the little chambers
were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.  

<span id="013">13</span> He measured then the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) from the roof of one little
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003) to the roof of another: the breadth was
five and twenty cubits, door against door.  

<span id="014">14</span> He made also posts of threescore cubits, even
unto the [post](../ebd/ebd299.htm#001) of the court round about the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008).  

<span id="015">15</span> And from the face of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the entrance unto the face of the porch
of the inner [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) were fifty cubits.  

<span id="016">16</span> And there were narrow windows to the little
chambers, and to their posts within the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008)
round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows were round about
inward: and upon each [post](../ebd/ebd299.htm#001) were palm trees.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then brought he me into the outward court, and,
lo, there were chambers, and a [pavement](../ebd/ebd287.htm#003) made
for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the
[pavement](../ebd/ebd287.htm#003).  

<span id="018">18</span> And the [pavement](../ebd/ebd287.htm#003) by
the side of the gates over against the length of the gates was the lower
[pavement](../ebd/ebd287.htm#003).  

<span id="019">19</span> Then he measured the breadth from the forefront
of the lower [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) unto the forefront of the
inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and
[northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002).  

<span id="020">20</span> And the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the
outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length
thereof, and the breadth thereof.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the little chambers thereof were three on
this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches
thereof were after the measure of the first
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008): the length thereof was fifty cubits, and
the breadth five and twenty cubits.  

<span id="022">22</span> And their windows, and their arches, and their
palm trees, were after the measure of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008)
that looketh toward the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000); and they went up
unto it by [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) steps; and the arches thereof
were before them.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the
inner court was over against the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) toward
the north, and toward the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000); and he measured
from [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) to [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) an
hundred cubits.  

<span id="024">24</span> After that he brought me toward the south, and
behold a [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) toward the south: and he measured
the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.  

<span id="025">25</span> And there were windows in it and in the arches
thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits,
and the breadth five and twenty cubits.  

<span id="026">26</span> And there were [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them: and it
had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the
posts thereof.  

<span id="027">27</span> And there was a [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008)
in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) to [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) toward
the south an hundred cubits.  

<span id="028">28</span> And he brought me to the inner court by the
south [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008): and he measured the south
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) according to these measures;  

<span id="029">29</span> And the little chambers thereof, and the posts
thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there
were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty
cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.  

<span id="030">30</span> And the arches round about were five and twenty
cubits long, and five cubits broad.  

<span id="031">31</span> And the arches thereof were toward the utter
court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof: and the going up to
it had eight steps.  

<span id="032">32</span> And he brought me into the inner court toward
the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000): and he measured the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) according to these measures.  

<span id="033">33</span> And the little chambers thereof, and the posts
thereof, and the arches thereof, were according to these measures: and
there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about: it was
fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.  

<span id="034">34</span> And the arches thereof were toward the outward
court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on
that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.  

<span id="035">35</span> And he brought me to the north
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), and measured it according to these
measures;  

<span id="036">36</span> The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof,
and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length
was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.  

<span id="037">37</span> And the posts thereof were toward the utter
court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on
that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.  

<span id="038">38</span> And the chambers and the entries thereof were
by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001).  

<span id="039">39</span> And in the porch of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) were two [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006)
on this side, and two [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) on that side, to
slay thereon the burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) and the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) and the
trespass [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001).  

<span id="040">40</span> And at the side without, as one goeth up to the
entry of the north [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), were two
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006); and on the other side, which was at the
porch of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), were two
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006).  

<span id="041">41</span> Four [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) were on
this side, and four [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) on that side, by the
side of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008); eight
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006), whereupon they slew their sacrifices.  

<span id="042">42</span> And the four [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006)
were of hewn [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) for the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), of a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006)
and an half long, and a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006) and an half
broad, and one [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006) high: whereupon also they
laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) and the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002).  

<span id="043">43</span> And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened
round about: and upon the [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) was the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) of the
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001).  

<span id="044">44</span> And without the inner
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) were the chambers of the singers in the
inner court, which was at the side of the north
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008); and their prospect was toward the south:
one at the side of the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000)
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) having the prospect toward the north.  

<span id="045">45</span> And he said unto me, This
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003), whose prospect is toward the south, is
for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.  

<span id="046">46</span> And the [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003) whose
prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the
charge of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006): these are the sons of
[Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008) among the sons of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006), which come near to the LORD to
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) unto him.  

<span id="047">47</span> So he measured the court, an hundred cubits
long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) that was before the house.  

<span id="048">48</span> And he brought me to the porch of the house,
and measured each [post](../ebd/ebd299.htm#001) of the porch, five
cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of
the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) was three cubits on this side, and
three cubits on that side.  

<span id="049">49</span> The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and
the breadth eleven cubits, and he brought me by the steps whereby they
went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side,
and another on that side.
