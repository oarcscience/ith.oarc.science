### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Son of man, set thy face toward
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and drop thy word toward the holy
places, and prophesy against the land of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),  

<span id="003">3</span> And say to the land of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I am
against thee, and will draw forth my [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) out
of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the
wicked.  

<span id="004">4</span> Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the
righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) go forth out of his sheath against all
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) from the south to the north:  

<span id="005">5</span> That all [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) may know
that I the LORD have drawn forth my [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) out
of his sheath: it shall not return any more.  

<span id="006">6</span> Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the
breaking of thy loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.  

<span id="007">7</span> And it shall be, when they say unto thee,
Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because
it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble,
and every [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) shall faint, and all knees
shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass,
saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="008">8</span> Again the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="009">9</span> Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the
LORD; Say, A [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), a
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) is sharpened, and also furbished:  

<span id="010">10</span> It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is
furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth
the rod of my son, as every tree.  

<span id="011">11</span> And he hath given it to be furbished, that it
may be handled: this [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) is sharpened, and it
is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.  

<span id="012">12</span> Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon
my people, it shall be upon all the princes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): terrors by reason of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) shall be upon my people: smite therefore
upon thy thigh.  

<span id="013">13</span> Because it is a trial, and what if the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) contemn even the rod? it shall be no
more, saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="014">14</span> Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite
thine hands together. and let the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) be
doubled the third time, the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) of the slain:
it is the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) of the great men that are
slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.  

<span id="015">15</span> I have set the point of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) against all their gates, that their heart
may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made bright, it is
wrapped up for the slaughter.  

<span id="016">16</span> Go thee one way or other, either on the right
hand, or on the left, whithersoever thy face is set.  

<span id="017">17</span> I will also smite mine hands together, and I
will cause my [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) to rest: I the LORD have
said it.  

<span id="018">18</span> The word of the LORD came unto me again,
saying,  

<span id="019">19</span> Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways,
that the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) may
come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a
place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.  

<span id="020">20</span> Appoint a way, that the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and
to [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005)
the defenced.  

<span id="021">21</span> For the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) stood at the parting of the way, at the
head of the two ways, to use [divination](../ebd/ebd104.htm#009): he
made his [arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005) bright, he consulted with
images, he looked in the [liver](../ebd/ebd230.htm#004).  

<span id="022">22</span> At his right hand was the
[divination](../ebd/ebd104.htm#009) for
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), to appoint captains, to open the
mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint
battering rams against the gates, to cast a
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007), and to build a fort.  

<span id="023">23</span> And it shall be unto them as a false
[divination](../ebd/ebd104.htm#009) in their sight, to them that have
sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may
be taken.  

<span id="024">24</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye
have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions
are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because,
I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the
hand.  

<span id="025">25</span> And thou, profane wicked
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),
whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end,  

<span id="026">26</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the
[diadem](../ebd/ebd102.htm#009), and take off the
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001): this shall not be the same: exalt him
that is low, and abase him that is high.  

<span id="027">27</span> I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it
shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it
him.  

<span id="028">28</span> And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus
saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their
reproach; even say thou, The [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) is drawn: for the slaughter it is
furbished, to consume because of the glittering:  

<span id="029">29</span> Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they
divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of them that are
slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity shall have
an end.  

<span id="030">30</span> Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I
will [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) thee in the place where thou wast
created, in the land of thy nativity.  

<span id="031">31</span> And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee,
I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into
the hand of brutish men, and skilful to destroy.  

<span id="032">32</span> Thou shalt be for [fuel](../ebd/ebd139.htm#002)
to the fire; thy [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) shall be in the midst of
the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the LORD have spoken
it.
