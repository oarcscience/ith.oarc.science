### King James Version: Acts Chapter 28

<span id="001">1</span> And when they were escaped, then they knew that
the [island](../ebd/ebd190.htm#009.md) was called
[Melita](../ebd/ebd247.htm#006.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the barbarous people shewed us no little
kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of
the present [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md), and because of the cold.  

<span id="003">3</span> And when [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) had
gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a
[viper](../ebd/ebd377.htm#008.md) out of the heat, and fastened on his
hand.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when the barbarians saw the venomous
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) hang on his hand, they said among
themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath
escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he shook off the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) into the fire, and felt no harm.  

<span id="006">6</span> Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen,
or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while,
and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he
was a god.  

<span id="007">7</span> In the same quarters were possessions of the
chief man of the [island](../ebd/ebd190.htm#009.md), whose name was
[Publius](../ebd/ebd302.htm#000.md); who received us, and lodged us three
days courteously.  

<span id="008">8</span> And it came to pass, that the father of
[Publius](../ebd/ebd302.htm#000.md) lay sick of a
[fever](../ebd/ebd132.htm#009.md) and of a bloody flux: to whom
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands
on him, and healed him.  

<span id="009">9</span> So when this was done, others also, which had
diseases in the [island](../ebd/ebd190.htm#009.md), came, and were
healed:  

<span id="010">10</span> Who also honoured us with many honours; and
when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.  

<span id="011">11</span> And after three months we departed in a ship of
[Alexandria](../ebd/ebd017.htm#001.md), which had wintered in the isle,
whose sign was Castor and Pollux.  

<span id="012">12</span> And landing at
[Syracuse](../ebd/ebd355.htm#001.md), we tarried there three days.  

<span id="013">13</span> And from thence we fetched a compass, and came
to [Rhegium](../ebd/ebd312.htm#008.md): and after one day the south wind
blew, and we came the next day to [Puteoli](../ebd/ebd303.htm#000.md):  

<span id="014">14</span> Where we found brethren, and were desired to
tarry with them [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days: and so we went
toward [Rome](../ebd/ebd315.htm#007.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And from thence, when the brethren heard of us,
they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom
when [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) saw, he thanked God, and took
courage.  

<span id="016">16</span> And when we came to
[Rome](../ebd/ebd315.htm#007), the [centurion](../ebd/ebd075.htm#004.md)
delivered the prisoners to the captain of the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009): but [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) was
suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.  

<span id="017">17</span> And it came to pass, that after three days
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) called the chief of the Jews together: and
when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren,
though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our
fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) into the hands of the Romans.  

<span id="018">18</span> Who, when they had examined me, would have let
me go, because there was no cause of death in me.  

<span id="019">19</span> But when the Jews spake against it, I was
constrained to [appeal](../ebd/ebd027.htm#001.md) unto
[Caesar](../ebd/ebd068.htm#002.md); not that I had ought to accuse my
nation of.  

<span id="020">20</span> For this cause therefore have I called for you,
to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) I am bound with this
[chain](../ebd/ebd075.htm#008.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And they said unto him, We neither received
letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that
came shewed or spake any harm of thee.  

<span id="022">22</span> But we desire to hear of thee what thou
thinkest: for as concerning this [sect](../ebd/ebd325.htm#008.md), we know
that every where it is spoken against.  

<span id="023">23</span> And when they had appointed him a day, there
came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified
the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), both out of the law of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), and out of the prophets, from morning
till evening.  

<span id="024">24</span> And some believed the things which were spoken,
and some believed not.  

<span id="025">25</span> And when they agreed not among themselves, they
departed, after that [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) had spoken one word,
Well spake the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md) by
[Esaias](../ebd/ebd124.htm#003) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md)
unto our fathers,  

<span id="026">26</span> Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing
ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and
not perceive:  

<span id="027">27</span> For the heart of this people is waxed gross,
and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed;
lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and
understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal
them.  

<span id="028">28</span> Be it known therefore unto you, that the
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) of God is sent unto the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md), and that they will hear it.  

<span id="029">29</span> And when he had said these words, the Jews
departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) dwelt two
whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto
him,  

<span id="031">31</span> Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching
those things which concern the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), with all confidence, no man forbidding
him.
