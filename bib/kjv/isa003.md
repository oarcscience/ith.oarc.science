### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth
take away from [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) and from
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) the stay and the staff, the whole stay of
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and the whole stay of water.  

<span id="002">2</span> The mighty man, and the man of war, the
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005), and the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), and the prudent, and the ancient,  

<span id="003">3</span> The captain of fifty, and the honourable man,
and the [counsellor](../ebd/ebd091.htm#005), and the cunning
[artificer](../ebd/ebd032.htm#007), and the eloquent orator.  

<span id="004">4</span> And I will give children to be their princes,
and babes shall rule over them.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the people shall be oppressed, every one by
another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself
proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.  

<span id="006">6</span> When a man shall take hold of his brother of the
house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and
let this ruin be under thy hand:  

<span id="007">7</span> In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not
be an healer; for in my house is neither [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006)
nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.  

<span id="008">8</span> For [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) is
ruined, and [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) is fallen: because their
tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006).  

<span id="009">9</span> The shew of their countenance doth
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) against them; and they declare their
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) as [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004), they
hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto
themselves.  

<span id="010">10</span> Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well
with him: for they shall eat the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of their
doings.  

<span id="011">11</span> Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him:
for the reward of his hands shall be given him.  

<span id="012">12</span> As for my people, children are their
oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee
cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.  

<span id="013">13</span> The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) the people.  

<span id="014">14</span> The LORD will enter into judgment with the
ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up
the vineyard; the spoil of the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) is in your
houses.  

<span id="015">15</span> What mean ye that ye beat my people to
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002), and [grind](../ebd/ebd155.htm#006) the
faces of the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006)? saith the Lord GOD of
hosts.  

<span id="016">16</span> Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters
of [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002) are haughty, and walk with stretched
forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and
[mincing](../ebd/ebd255.htm#005) as they go, and making a tinkling with
their feet:  

<span id="017">17</span> Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of the head of the daughters of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), and the LORD will discover their secret
parts.  

<span id="018">18</span> In that day the Lord will take away the
[bravery](../ebd/ebd064.htm#004) of their tinkling ornaments about their
feet, and their [cauls](../ebd/ebd074.htm#004), and their round
[tires](../ebd/ebd367.htm#009) like the [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004),  

<span id="019">19</span> The chains, and the bracelets, and the
[mufflers](../ebd/ebd261.htm#009),  

<span id="020">20</span> The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and
the headbands, and the tablets, and the
[earrings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#007),  

<span id="021">21</span> The rings, and nose jewels,  

<span id="022">22</span> The changeable suits of
[apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000), and the mantles, and the wimples, and
the crisping pins,  

<span id="023">23</span> The glasses, and the fine
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), and the hoods, and the vails.  

<span id="024">24</span> And it shall come to pass, that instead of
sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a
[girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005) a [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007); and
instead of well set hair [baldness](../ebd/ebd042.htm#008); and instead
of a [stomacher](../ebd/ebd351.htm#004) a girding of
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001); and burning instead of beauty.  

<span id="025">25</span> Thy men shall fall by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and thy mighty in the war.  

<span id="026">26</span> And her gates shall lament and
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004); and she being desolate shall sit upon
the ground.
