<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 27</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Moreover Job continued his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A>, and said,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;All the while my breath is in me, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of God is in my nostrils;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;My <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> I hold <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A>, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For what is the hope of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd185.htm#006">hypocrite</A>, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;If his children be multiplied, it is for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</A> shall not weep.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Though he <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A> up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A>, and prepare raiment as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;He buildeth his house as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#005">moth</A>, and as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#005">booth</A> that the keeper maketh.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#005">hiss</A> him out of his place.<BR>
