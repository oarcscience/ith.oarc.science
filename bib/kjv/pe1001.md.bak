### King James Version: 1 Peter Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md), an
[apostle](../ebd/ebd026.htm#008) of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), to the strangers scattered throughout
[Pontus](../ebd/ebd298.htm#003), [Galatia](../ebd/ebd141.htm#004.md),
[Cappadocia](../ebd/ebd071.htm#009), [Asia](../ebd/ebd034.htm#008.md), and
[Bithynia](../ebd/ebd059.htm#008.md),  

<span id="002">2</span> Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the
Father, through [sanctification](../ebd/ebd321.htm#004.md) of the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), unto obedience and sprinkling of the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000): [Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) unto
you, and peace, be multiplied.  

<span id="003">3</span> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), which
according to his abundant [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) hath begotten
us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) from the
dead,  

<span id="004">4</span> To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled,
and that fadeth not away, reserved in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)
for you,  

<span id="005">5</span> Who are kept by the power of God through faith
unto [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) ready to be revealed in the last
time.  

<span id="006">6</span> Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a
season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:  

<span id="007">7</span> That the trial of your faith, being much more
precious than of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) that perisheth, though it
be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) at the appearing of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md):  

<span id="008">8</span> Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though
now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and
full of [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md):  

<span id="009">9</span> Receiving the end of your faith, even the
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) of your souls.  

<span id="010">10</span> Of which [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) the
prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) that should come unto you:  

<span id="011">11</span> Searching what, or what manner of time the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) which
was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), and the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md)
that should follow.  

<span id="012">12</span> Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto
themselves, but unto us they did [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) the
things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) unto you with the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md) sent down from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md); which things the angels desire to look
into.  

<span id="013">13</span> Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be
sober, and hope to the end for the [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) that
is to be brought unto you at the [revelation](../ebd/ebd312.htm#002.md) of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md);  

<span id="014">14</span> As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves
according to the former lusts in your ignorance:  

<span id="015">15</span> But as he which hath called you is holy, so be
ye holy in all manner of [conversation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#001.md);  

<span id="016">16</span> Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am
holy.  

<span id="017">17</span> And if ye call on the Father, who without
respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time
of your sojourning here in fear:  

<span id="018">18</span> Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed
with corruptible things, as [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) and
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), from your vain
[conversation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#001.md) received by
[tradition](../ebd/ebd371.htm#005.md) from your fathers;  

<span id="019">19</span> But with the precious
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), as of
a [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003) without [blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md)
and without spot:  

<span id="020">20</span> Who verily was foreordained before the
foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,  

<span id="021">21</span> Who by him do believe in God, that raised him
up from the dead, and gave him [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md); that your
faith and hope might be in God.  

<span id="022">22</span> Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying
the truth through the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) unto unfeigned
love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart
fervently:  

<span id="023">23</span> Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but
of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for
ever.  

<span id="024">24</span> For all [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) is as
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md), and all the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of man as the flower of
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005). The [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md)
withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:  

<span id="025">25</span> But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And
this is the word which by the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) is
preached unto you.
