### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 25

<span id="001">1</span> Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.  

<span id="002">2</span> O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be
ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.  

<span id="003">3</span> Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let
them be ashamed which transgress without cause.  

<span id="004">4</span> Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.  

<span id="005">5</span> Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art
the God of my [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003); on thee do I wait all
the day.  

<span id="006">6</span> Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy
lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old.  

<span id="007">7</span> Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my
transgressions: according to thy [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) remember
thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD.  

<span id="008">8</span> Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he
teach sinners in the way.  

<span id="009">9</span> The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek
will he teach his way.  

<span id="010">10</span> All the paths of the LORD are
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) and truth unto such as keep his
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) and his testimonies.  

<span id="011">11</span> For thy name's sake, O LORD,
[pardon](../ebd/ebd285.htm#001) mine iniquity; for it is great.  

<span id="012">12</span> What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall
he teach in the way that he shall choose.  

<span id="013">13</span> His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed
shall inherit the earth.  

<span id="014">14</span> The secret of the LORD is with them that fear
him; and he will shew them his [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008).  

<span id="015">15</span> Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he
shall pluck my feet out of the [net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002).  

<span id="016">16</span> Turn thee unto me, and have
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) upon me; for I am desolate and
afflicted.  

<span id="017">17</span> The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring
thou me out of my distresses.  

<span id="018">18</span> Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and
forgive all my sins.  

<span id="019">19</span> Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and
they hate me with cruel [hatred](../ebd/ebd167.htm#002).  

<span id="020">20</span> O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be
ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.  

<span id="021">21</span> Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for
I wait on thee.  

<span id="022">22</span> Redeem [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), O God,
out of all his troubles.
