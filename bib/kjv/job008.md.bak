### King James Version: Job Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> Then answered [Bildad](../ebd/ebd058.htm#006.md)
the [Shuhite](../ebd/ebd341.htm#008.md), and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> How long wilt thou speak these things? and how
long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?  

<span id="003">3</span> Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty
pervert [justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007.md)?  

<span id="004">4</span> If thy children have sinned against him, and he
have cast them away for their transgression;  

<span id="005">5</span> If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make
thy supplication to the Almighty;  

<span id="006">6</span> If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he
would awake for thee, and make the [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md)
of thy [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) prosperous.  

<span id="007">7</span> Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter
end should greatly increase.  

<span id="008">8</span> For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and
prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:  

<span id="009">9</span> (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing,
because our days upon earth are a [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002):.md)  

<span id="010">10</span> Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and
utter words out of their heart?  

<span id="011">11</span> Can the [rush](../ebd/ebd316.htm#007.md) grow up
without mire? can the [flag](../ebd/ebd135.htm#001.md) grow without
water?  

<span id="012">12</span> Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut
down, it withereth before any other [herb](../ebd/ebd174.htm#008.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> So are the paths of all that forget God; and
the hypocrite's hope shall perish:  

<span id="014">14</span> Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust
shall be a spider's web.  

<span id="015">15</span> He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not
stand: he shall hold it [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md), but it shall not
endure.  

<span id="016">16</span> He is green before the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), and his [branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002.md)
shooteth forth in his garden.  

<span id="017">17</span> His roots are wrapped about the
[heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md), and seeth the place of stones.  

<span id="018">18</span> If he destroy him from his place, then it shall
deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.  

<span id="019">19</span> Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of
the earth shall others grow.  

<span id="020">20</span> Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man,
neither will he help the evil doers:  

<span id="021">21</span> Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy
lips with rejoicing.  

<span id="022">22</span> They that hate thee shall be clothed with
shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
