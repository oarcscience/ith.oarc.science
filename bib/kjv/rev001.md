### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> The [Revelation](../ebd/ebd312.htm#002) of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), which
God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly
come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) unto his servant John:  

<span id="002">2</span> Who bare record of the word of God, and of the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), and of all things that he saw.  

<span id="003">3</span> Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear
the words of this [prophecy](../ebd/ebd300.htm#007), and keep those
things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.  

<span id="004">4</span> John to the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
churches which are in [Asia](../ebd/ebd034.htm#008):
[Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) be unto you, and peace, from him which
is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) Spirits which are before his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001);  

<span id="005">5</span> And from [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), who is the
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008), and
the first begotten of the dead, and the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004)
of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from
our sins in his own [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000),  

<span id="006">6</span> And hath made us kings and priests unto God and
his Father; to him be [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) and dominion for
ever and ever. [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).  

<span id="007">7</span> Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye
shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the
earth shall wail because of him. Even so,
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).  

<span id="008">8</span> I am Alpha and [Omega](../ebd/ebd278.htm#004),
the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was,
and which is to come, the Almighty.  

<span id="009">9</span> I John, who also am your brother, and companion
in [tribulation](../ebd/ebd372.htm#005), and in the kingdom and patience
of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), was
in the isle that is called [Patmos](../ebd/ebd286.htm#008), for the word
of God, and for the [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="010">10</span> I was in the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) on
the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,  

<span id="011">11</span> Saying, I am Alpha and
[Omega](../ebd/ebd278.htm#004), the first and the last: and, What thou
seest, write in a book, and send it unto the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) churches which are in
[Asia](../ebd/ebd034.htm#008); unto [Ephesus](../ebd/ebd122.htm#007),
and unto [Smyrna](../ebd/ebd346.htm#007), and unto
[Pergamos](../ebd/ebd290.htm#004), and unto
[Thyatira](../ebd/ebd365.htm#004), and unto
[Sardis](../ebd/ebd322.htm#006), and unto
[Philadelphia](../ebd/ebd293.htm#004), and unto
[Laodicea](../ebd/ebd223.htm#009).  

<span id="012">12</span> And I turned to see the voice that spake with
me. And being turned, I saw [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) golden
candlesticks;  

<span id="013">13</span> And in the midst of the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) candlesticks one like unto the Son of
man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps
with a golden [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005).  

<span id="014">14</span> His head and his hairs were white like
[wool](../ebd/ebd383.htm#005), as white as
[snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000); and his eyes were as a flame of fire;  

<span id="015">15</span> And his feet like unto fine
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003), as if they burned in a
[furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000); and his voice as the sound of many
waters.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he had in his right hand
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008): and out
of his mouth went a sharp twoedged [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003): and
his countenance was as the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) shineth in his
strength.  

<span id="017">17</span> And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead.
And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the
first and the last:  

<span id="018">18</span> I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold,
I am alive for evermore, [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001); and have the
keys of [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003) and of death.  

<span id="019">19</span> Write the things which thou hast seen, and the
things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;  

<span id="020">20</span> The [mystery](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006) of the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008) which thou
sawest in my right hand, and the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) golden
candlesticks. The [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008) are the angels of the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) churches: and the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) candlesticks which thou sawest are the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) churches.
