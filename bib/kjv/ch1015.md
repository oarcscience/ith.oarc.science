### King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) made him
houses in the city of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and prepared a
place for the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God, and pitched for it a
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Then [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said, None
ought to carry the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God but the Levites:
for them hath the LORD [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) to carry the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God, and to
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) unto him for ever.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) gathered all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) together to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), to bring up the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD unto his place, which he had
prepared for it.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) assembled the
children of [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and the Levites:  

<span id="005">5</span> Of the sons of [Kohath](../ebd/ebd222.htm#001.md);
[Uriel](../ebd/ebd375.htm#003.md) the chief, and his brethren an hundred
and twenty:  

<span id="006">6</span> Of the sons of [Merari](../ebd/ebd249.htm#000.md);
Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:  

<span id="007">7</span> Of the sons of [Gershom](../ebd/ebd146.htm#008.md);
[Joel](../ebd/ebd208.htm#005.md) the chief and his brethren an hundred and
thirty:  

<span id="008">8</span> Of the sons of Elizaphan;
[Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005.md) the chief, and his brethren two
hundred:  

<span id="009">9</span> Of the sons of [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004.md);
[Eliel](../ebd/ebd116.htm#006.md) the chief, and his brethren fourscore:  

<span id="010">10</span> Of the sons of [Uzziel](../ebd/ebd376.htm#005.md);
[Amminadab](../ebd/ebd020.htm#008.md) the chief, and his brethren an
hundred and twelve.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) called for
[Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008) and [Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005.md) the
priests, and for the Levites, for [Uriel](../ebd/ebd375.htm#003.md),
Asaiah, and [Joel](../ebd/ebd208.htm#005.md),
[Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005), and [Eliel](../ebd/ebd116.htm#006.md),
and [Amminadab](../ebd/ebd020.htm#008.md),  

<span id="012">12</span> And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the
fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren,
that ye may bring up the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) unto the place that I have prepared for
it.  

<span id="013">13</span> For because ye did it not at the first, the
LORD our God made a [breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005.md) upon us, for that we
sought him not after the due order.  

<span id="014">14</span> So the priests and the Levites sanctified
themselves to bring up the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD God
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And the children of the Levites bare the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God upon their shoulders with the staves
thereon, as [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) commanded according to the
word of the LORD.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) spake to the
chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with
instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and
[cymbals](../ebd/ebd095.htm#001.md), sounding, by lifting up the voice with
joy.  

<span id="017">17</span> So the Levites appointed
[Heman](../ebd/ebd173.htm#009) the son of [Joel](../ebd/ebd208.htm#005.md);
and of his brethren, [Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002.md) the son of
[Berechiah](../ebd/ebd053.htm#003.md); and of the sons of
[Merari](../ebd/ebd249.htm#000.md) their brethren,
[Ethan](../ebd/ebd126.htm#002.md) the son of Kushaiah;  

<span id="018">18</span> And with them their brethren of the second
degree, [Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006.md), Ben, and
[Jaaziel](../ebd/ebd193.htm#004.md), and
[Shemiramoth](../ebd/ebd334.htm#009.md), and
[Jehiel](../ebd/ebd200.htm#003), and [Unni](../ebd/ebd374.htm#008.md),
[Eliab](../ebd/ebd115.htm#008), and [Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003.md),
and [Maaseiah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#007.md), and
[Mattithiah](../ebd/ebd244.htm#006.md), and
[Elipheleh](../ebd/ebd117.htm#006.md), and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and
[Jeiel](../ebd/ebd203.htm#000.md), the porters.  

<span id="019">19</span> So the singers, [Heman](../ebd/ebd173.htm#009.md),
[Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002), and [Ethan](../ebd/ebd126.htm#002.md), were
appointed to sound with [cymbals](../ebd/ebd095.htm#001.md) of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md);  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006.md), and
Aziel, and [Shemiramoth](../ebd/ebd334.htm#009.md), and
[Jehiel](../ebd/ebd200.htm#003), and [Unni](../ebd/ebd374.htm#008.md), and
[Eliab](../ebd/ebd115.htm#008), and [Maaseiah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#007.md),
and [Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003.md), with psalteries on
[Alamoth](../ebd/ebd016.htm#006.md);  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Mattithiah](../ebd/ebd244.htm#006.md), and
[Elipheleh](../ebd/ebd117.htm#006.md), and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and
[Jeiel](../ebd/ebd203.htm#000), and [Azaziah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#007.md),
with harps on the [Sheminith](../ebd/ebd334.htm#008.md) to excel.  

<span id="022">22</span> And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for
song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful.  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Berechiah](../ebd/ebd053.htm#003.md) and
[Elkanah](../ebd/ebd118.htm#005.md) were doorkeepers for the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Shebaniah](../ebd/ebd332.htm#007.md), and
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md), and
[Nethaneel](../ebd/ebd271.htm#003), and [Amasai](../ebd/ebd019.htm#004.md),
and [Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006.md), and
[Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003), and [Eliezer](../ebd/ebd116.htm#007.md),
the priests, did blow with the [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md) before
the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God: and Obededom and Jehiah were
doorkeepers for the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and the
elders of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and the captains over
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md), went to bring up the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of
the LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy.  

<span id="026">26</span> And it came to pass, when God helped the
Levites that bare the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of the LORD, that they offered
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) bullocks and
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) rams.  

<span id="027">27</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) was clothed
with a robe of fine [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md), and all the Levites
that bare the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md), and the singers, and
Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers:
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) also had upon him an
[ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008) of [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> Thus all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
brought up the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of the LORD with shouting, and with
sound of the [cornet](../ebd/ebd090.htm#009.md), and with
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md), and with
[cymbals](../ebd/ebd095.htm#001.md), making a noise with psalteries and
harps.  

<span id="029">29</span> And it came to pass, as the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of
the LORD came to the city of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), that
[Michal](../ebd/ebd253.htm#001.md), the daughter of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) looking out at a window saw
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) dancing and
playing: and she despised him in her heart.
