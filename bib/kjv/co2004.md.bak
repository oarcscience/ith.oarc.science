### King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we
have received [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md), we faint not;  

<span id="002">2</span> But have renounced the hidden things of
dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God
deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to
every man's [conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006.md) in the sight of God.  

<span id="003">3</span> But if our [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) be
hid, it is hid to them that are lost:  

<span id="004">4</span> In whom the god of this world hath blinded the
minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), who
is the image of God, should shine unto them.  

<span id="005">5</span> For we preach not ourselves, but
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) the Lord;
and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.  

<span id="006">6</span> For God, who commanded the light to shine out of
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), hath shined in our hearts, to give
the light of the knowledge of the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of God
in the face of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> But we have this treasure in earthen vessels,
that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.  

<span id="008">8</span> We are troubled on every side, yet not
distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;  

<span id="009">9</span> Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not
destroyed;  

<span id="010">10</span> Always bearing about in the body the dying of
the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), that the life also of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) might be made manifest in our body.  

<span id="011">11</span> For we which live are alway delivered unto
death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) might be made manifest in our mortal
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> So then death worketh in us, but life in you.  

<span id="013">13</span> We having the same
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of faith, according as it is written, I
believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore
speak;  

<span id="014">14</span> Knowing that he which raised up the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) shall raise up us also by
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), and shall present us with you.  

<span id="015">15</span> For all things are for your sakes, that the
abundant [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) might through the thanksgiving
of many redound to the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of God.  

<span id="016">16</span> For which cause we faint not; but though our
outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.  

<span id="017">17</span> For our light affliction, which is but for a
moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md);  

<span id="018">18</span> While we look not at the things which are seen,
but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are
temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.
