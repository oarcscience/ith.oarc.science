### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp
[knife](../ebd/ebd221.htm#007.md), take thee a barber's
[razor](../ebd/ebd307.htm#009.md), and cause it to pass upon thine head and
upon thy [beard](../ebd/ebd049.htm#000.md): then take thee balances to
weigh, and divide the hair.  

<span id="002">2</span> Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the
midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou
shalt take a third part, and smite about it with a
[knife](../ebd/ebd221.htm#007.md): and a third part thou shalt scatter in
the wind; and I will draw out a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) after
them.  

<span id="003">3</span> Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number,
and bind them in thy skirts.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then take of them again, and cast them into the
midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire
come forth into all the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; This is
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): I have set it in the midst of the
nations and countries that are round about her.  

<span id="006">6</span> And she hath changed my judgments into
wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the
countries that are round about her: for they have refused my judgments
and my statutes, they have not walked in them.  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye
multiplied more than the nations that are round about you, and have not
walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done
according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you;  

<span id="008">8</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I,
even I, am against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee
in the sight of the nations.  

<span id="009">9</span> And I will do in thee that which I have not
done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all
thine abominations.  

<span id="010">10</span> Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the
midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute
judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all
the [winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD;
Surely, because thou hast defiled my [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md)
with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations,
therefore will I also diminish thee; neither shall mine eye spare,
neither will I have any pity.  

<span id="012">12</span> A third part of thee shall die with the
pestilence, and with [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md) shall they be
consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) round about thee; and I will scatter a
third part into all the [winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009.md), and I will draw
out a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) after them.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thus shall mine [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md)
be accomplished, and I will cause my [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md) to
rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the
LORD have spoken it in my [zeal](../ebd/ebd388.htm#003.md), when I have
accomplished my [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md) in them.  

<span id="014">14</span> Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach
among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that
pass by.  

<span id="015">15</span> So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an
instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about
thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) and in [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md) and
in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken it.  

<span id="016">16</span> When I shall send upon them the evil
[arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005) of [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md),
which shall be for their [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md), and which
I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md) upon you, and will break your staff of
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md):  

<span id="017">17</span> So will I send upon you
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md) and evil beasts, and they shall bereave
thee: and pestilence and [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) shall pass
through thee; and I will bring the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) upon
thee. I the LORD have spoken it.
