### King James Version: Colossians Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Masters, give unto your servants that which is
just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Continue in [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md), and
watch in the same with thanksgiving;  

<span id="003">3</span> Withal praying also for us, that God would open
unto us a door of utterance, to speak the
[mystery](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006) of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), for
which I am also in bonds:  

<span id="004">4</span> That I may make it manifest, as I ought to
speak.  

<span id="005">5</span> Walk in wisdom toward them that are without,
redeeming the time.  

<span id="006">6</span> Let your speech be alway with
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md), seasoned with
[salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008.md), that ye may know how ye ought to answer
every man.  

<span id="007">7</span> All my state shall
[Tychicus](../ebd/ebd373.htm#008.md) declare unto you, who is a beloved
brother, and a [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md)
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) and fellowservant in the Lord:  

<span id="008">8</span> Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose,
that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;  

<span id="009">9</span> With [Onesimus](../ebd/ebd278.htm#009.md), a
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md) and beloved brother, who is one of
you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here.  

<span id="010">10</span> [Aristarchus](../ebd/ebd030.htm#008.md) my
fellowprisoner saluteth you, and [Marcus](../ebd/ebd241.htm#008.md),
sister's son to [Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005.md), (touching whom ye
received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), which is
called [Justus](../ebd/ebd215.htm#000.md), who are of the
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007.md). These only are my fellowworkers
unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.  

<span id="012">12</span> [Epaphras](../ebd/ebd122.htm#000.md), who is one
of you, a servant of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), saluteth you,
always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect
and complete in all the will of God.  

<span id="013">13</span> For I bear him record, that he hath a great
[zeal](../ebd/ebd388.htm#003.md) for you, and them that are in
[Laodicea](../ebd/ebd223.htm#009.md), and them in
[Hierapolis](../ebd/ebd178.htm#001.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> [Luke](../ebd/ebd233.htm#002.md), the beloved
[physician](../ebd/ebd295.htm#000), and [Demas](../ebd/ebd101.htm#004.md),
greet you.  

<span id="015">15</span> Salute the brethren which are in
[Laodicea](../ebd/ebd223.htm#009), and [Nymphas](../ebd/ebd275.htm#008.md),
and the church which is in his house.  

<span id="016">16</span> And when this epistle is read among you, cause
that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye
likewise read the epistle from [Laodicea](../ebd/ebd223.htm#009.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And say to [Archippus](../ebd/ebd029.htm#005.md),
Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that
thou fulfil it.  

<span id="018">18</span> The [salutation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#002.md) by the
hand of me [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md). Remember my bonds.
[Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) be with you.
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).
