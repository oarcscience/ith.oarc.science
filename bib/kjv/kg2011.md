### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> And when [Athaliah](../ebd/ebd036.htm#002.md) the
mother of [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006.md) saw that her son was dead,
she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.  

<span id="002">2</span> But [Jehosheba](../ebd/ebd201.htm#008.md), the
daughter of [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003.md), sister of
[Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006), took [Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md)
the son of [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006.md), and stole him from among
the king's sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his
nurse, in the bedchamber from [Athaliah](../ebd/ebd036.htm#002.md), so that
he was not slain.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD
six years. And [Athaliah](../ebd/ebd036.htm#002.md) did reign over the
land.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the seventh year
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md) sent and fetched the rulers over
hundreds, with the captains and the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md), and
brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with them, and took an
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md) of them in the house of the LORD, and
shewed them the king's son.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing
that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) shall even be keepers of the watch of
the king's house;  

<span id="006">6</span> And a third part shall be at the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) of Sur; and a third part at the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) behind the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md):
so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.  

<span id="007">7</span> And two parts of all you that go forth on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md), even they shall keep the watch of the
house of the LORD about the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And ye shall compass the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) round about, every man with his weapons in
his hand: and he that cometh within the [ranges](../ebd/ebd307.htm#004.md),
let him be slain: and be ye with the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) as he
goeth out and as he cometh in.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the captains over the hundreds did according
to all things that [Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) commanded: and they took every man his
men that were to come in on the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md), with
them that should go out on the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md), and
came to [Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And to the captains over hundreds did the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) give [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
David's spears and shields, that were in the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) of the LORD.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md) stood,
every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), from the right corner of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) to the left corner of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), along by the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) and the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And he brought forth the king's son, and put
the [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) upon him, and gave him the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md); and they made him
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and anointed him; and they clapped their
hands, and said, God save the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And when [Athaliah](../ebd/ebd036.htm#002.md)
heard the noise of the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md) and of the people,
she came to the people into the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) of the
LORD.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when she looked, behold, the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) stood by a
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md), as the manner was, and the princes and
the trumpeters by the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and all the people
of the land rejoiced, and blew with [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md):
and [Athaliah](../ebd/ebd036.htm#002) [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) her
clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.  

<span id="015">15</span> But [Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) commanded the captains of the hundreds,
the officers of the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md), and said unto them,
Have her forth without the [ranges](../ebd/ebd307.htm#004.md): and him that
followeth her kill with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md). For the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) had said, Let her not be slain in the
house of the LORD.  

<span id="016">16</span> And they laid hands on her; and she went by the
way by the which the horses came into the king's house: and there was
she slain.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md) made a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) between the LORD and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) and the people, that they should be the
LORD's people; between the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) also and the
people.  

<span id="018">18</span> And all the people of the land went into the
house of [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md), and brake it down; his altars
and his images brake they in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md) thoroughly,
and slew [Mattan](../ebd/ebd243.htm#007.md) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) of [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md) before
the altars. And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) appointed officers
over the house of the LORD.  

<span id="019">19</span> And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the
captains, and the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md), and all the people of
the land; and they brought down the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) from
the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md) to
the king's house. And he sat on the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of
the kings.  

<span id="020">20</span> And all the people of the land rejoiced, and
the city was in quiet: and they slew [Athaliah](../ebd/ebd036.htm#002.md)
with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) beside the king's house.  

<span id="021">21</span> [Seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) years old was
[Jehoash](../ebd/ebd200.htm#007.md) when he began to reign.
