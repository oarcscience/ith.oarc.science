<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Mark Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And other fell on good ground, and did yield <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#006">mystery</A> of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Know ye not this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A>? and how then will ye know all parables?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;The sower soweth the word.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A> cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd290.htm#007">persecution</A> ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A>, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#000">candle</A> brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#001">candlestick</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;For the earth bringeth forth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of herself; first the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#003">blade</A>, then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, after that the full <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;But when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd342.htm#008">sickle</A>, because the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</A> is come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;It is like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#003">grain</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd262.htm#009">mustard</A> seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may <A HREF="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</A> under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;But without a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A> spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little <A HREF="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?<BR>
