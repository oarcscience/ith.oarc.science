</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;God looked down from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.<BR>
