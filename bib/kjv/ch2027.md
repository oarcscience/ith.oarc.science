### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 27

<span id="001">1</span> [Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000.md) was twenty and
five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md). His mother's name also was Jerushah,
the daughter of [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he did that which was right in the sight of
the LORD, according to all that his father
[Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004.md) did: howbeit he entered not into the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) of the LORD. And the people did yet
corruptly.  

<span id="003">3</span> He built the high [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md)
of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of
[Ophel](../ebd/ebd279.htm#006.md) he built much.  

<span id="004">4</span> Moreover he built cities in the mountains of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and in the forests he built castles and
[towers](../ebd/ebd371.htm#002.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> He fought also with the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of the Ammonites, and prevailed against
them. And the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002.md) gave him the
same year an hundred talents of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and ten
thousand measures of [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md), and ten thousand of
[barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003.md). So much did the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002.md) pay unto him, both the second year, and
the third.  

<span id="006">6</span> So [Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000.md) became
mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God.  

<span id="007">7</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000.md), and all his wars, and his ways, lo,
they are written in the book of the kings of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> He was five and twenty years old when he began
to reign, and reigned sixteen years in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000.md) slept with
his fathers, and they buried him in the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004): and [Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005.md) his
son reigned in his stead.
