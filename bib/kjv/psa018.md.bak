### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.  

<span id="002">2</span> The LORD is my [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md),
and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will
trust; my [buckler](../ebd/ebd066.htm#000.md), and the
[horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003) of my [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md),
and my high tower.  

<span id="003">3</span> I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be
praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.  

<span id="004">4</span> The sorrows of death compassed me, and the
floods of ungodly men made me afraid.  

<span id="005">5</span> The sorrows of [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md)
compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.  

<span id="006">6</span> In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried
unto my God: he heard my voice out of his
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), and my cry came before him, even into
his ears.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then the earth shook and trembled; the
foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was
wroth.  

<span id="008">8</span> There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and
fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.  

<span id="009">9</span> He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) was under his feet.  

<span id="010">10</span> And he rode upon a
[cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003), and did [fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004.md):
yea, he did [fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004.md) upon the wings of the wind.  

<span id="011">11</span> He made [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) his
secret place; his [pavilion](../ebd/ebd287.htm#004.md) round about him were
dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.  

<span id="012">12</span> At the brightness that was before him his thick
clouds passed, [hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002.md) stones and coals of fire.  

<span id="013">13</span> The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the
Highest gave his voice; [hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002.md) stones and coals
of fire.  

<span id="014">14</span> Yea, he sent out his
[arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005.md), and scattered them; and he shot out
lightnings, and discomfited them.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then the channels of waters were seen, and the
foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the
blast of the breath of thy nostrils.  

<span id="016">16</span> He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out
of many waters.  

<span id="017">17</span> He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from
them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.  

<span id="018">18</span> They prevented me in the day of my calamity:
but the LORD was my stay.  

<span id="019">19</span> He brought me forth also into a large place; he
delivered me, because he delighted in me.  

<span id="020">20</span> The LORD rewarded me according to my
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md); according to the cleanness of my
hands hath he recompensed me.  

<span id="021">21</span> For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have
not wickedly departed from my God.  

<span id="022">22</span> For all his judgments were before me, and I did
not put away his statutes from me.  

<span id="023">23</span> I was also upright before him, and I kept
myself from mine iniquity.  

<span id="024">24</span> Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me
according to my [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), according to the
cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.  

<span id="025">25</span> With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself
merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;  

<span id="026">26</span> With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and
with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.  

<span id="027">27</span> For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but
wilt bring down high looks.  

<span id="028">28</span> For thou wilt light my
[candle](../ebd/ebd071.htm#000.md): the LORD my God will enlighten my
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> For by thee I have run through a troop; and by
my God have I leaped over a wall.  

<span id="030">30</span> As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the
LORD is tried: he is a [buckler](../ebd/ebd066.htm#000.md) to all those
that trust in him.  

<span id="031">31</span> For who is God save the LORD? or who is a
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md) save our God?  

<span id="032">32</span> It is God that girdeth me with strength, and
maketh my way perfect.  

<span id="033">33</span> He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth
me upon my high places.  

<span id="034">34</span> He teacheth my hands to war, so that a
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) of [steel](../ebd/ebd351.htm#000.md) is broken
by mine arms.  

<span id="035">35</span> Thou hast also given me the
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001.md) of thy
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md): and thy right hand hath holden me
up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.  

<span id="036">36</span> Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my
feet did not slip.  

<span id="037">37</span> I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken
them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.  

<span id="038">38</span> I have wounded them that they were not able to
rise: they are fallen under my feet.  

<span id="039">39</span> For thou hast girded me with strength unto the
battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.  

<span id="040">40</span> Thou hast also given me the necks of mine
enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.  

<span id="041">41</span> They cried, but there was none to save them:
even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.  

<span id="042">42</span> Then did I beat them small as the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) before the wind: I did cast them out as
the dirt in the streets.  

<span id="043">43</span> Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of
the people; and thou hast made me the head of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md): a people whom I have not known shall
serve me.  

<span id="044">44</span> As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me:
the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.  

<span id="045">45</span> The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid
out of their close places.  

<span id="046">46</span> The LORD liveth; and blessed be my
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md); and let the God of my
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) be exalted.  

<span id="047">47</span> It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the
people under me.  

<span id="048">48</span> He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou
liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered
me from the violent man.  

<span id="049">49</span> Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD,
among the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), and sing praises unto thy
name.  

<span id="050">50</span> Great deliverance giveth he to his
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md); and sheweth
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) to his anointed, to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and to his seed for evermore.
