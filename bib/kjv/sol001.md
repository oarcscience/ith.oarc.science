### King James Version: Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> The song of [songs](../ebd/ebd348.htm#002),
which is Solomon's.  

<span id="002">2</span> Let him [kiss](../ebd/ebd221.htm#000) me with
the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000).  

<span id="003">3</span> Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy
name is as [ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007) poured forth, therefore do
the virgins love thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> Draw me, we will run after thee: the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) hath brought me into his chambers: we will
be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000): the upright love thee.  

<span id="005">5</span> I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), as the tents of
[Kedar](../ebd/ebd216.htm#003), as the curtains of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007).  

<span id="006">6</span> Look not upon me, because I am black, because
the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) hath looked upon me: my mother's
children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards;
but mine own vineyard have I not kept.  

<span id="007">7</span> Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou
feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I
be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?  

<span id="008">8</span> If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go
thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside
the shepherds' tents.  

<span id="009">9</span> I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of
horses in Pharaoh's chariots.  

<span id="010">10</span> Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000) with chains of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="011">11</span> We will make thee borders of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) with studs of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000).  

<span id="012">12</span> While the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) sitteth
at his table, my [spikenard](../ebd/ebd349.htm#008) sendeth forth the
smell thereof.  

<span id="013">13</span> A bundle of [myrrh](../ebd/ebd263.htm#003) is
my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.  

<span id="014">14</span> My beloved is unto me as a cluster of
[camphire](../ebd/ebd070.htm#003) in the vineyards of
[Engedi](../ebd/ebd120.htm#009).  

<span id="015">15</span> Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou
art fair; thou hast doves' eyes.  

<span id="016">16</span> Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea,
pleasant: also our bed is green.  

<span id="017">17</span> The beams of our house are
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007), and our rafters of
[fir](../ebd/ebd133.htm#005).
