### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 34

<span id="001">1</span> And [Dinah](../ebd/ebd103.htm#008) the daughter
of [Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006), which she bare unto
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), went out to see the daughters of the
land.  

<span id="002">2</span> And when [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003) the
son of [Hamor](../ebd/ebd161.htm#004) the Hivite,
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) of the country, saw her, he took her,
and lay with her, and defiled her.  

<span id="003">3</span> And his soul clave unto
[Dinah](../ebd/ebd103.htm#008) the daughter of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), and he loved the damsel, and spake
kindly unto the damsel.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003) spake unto
his father [Hamor](../ebd/ebd161.htm#004), saying, Get me this damsel to
wife.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) heard that he
had defiled [Dinah](../ebd/ebd103.htm#008) his daughter: now his sons
were with his [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) in the field: and
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) held his peace until they were come.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Hamor](../ebd/ebd161.htm#004) the father of
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003) went out unto
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) to commune with him.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the sons of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007)
came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and
they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in lying with Jacob's daughter: which
thing ought not to be done.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Hamor](../ebd/ebd161.htm#004) communed with
them, saying, The soul of my son [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003)
longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.  

<span id="009">9</span> And make ye marriages with us, and give your
daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.  

<span id="010">10</span> And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall
be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions
therein.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003) said unto
her father and unto her brethren, Let me find
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto
me I will give.  

<span id="012">12</span> Ask me never so much
[dowry](../ebd/ebd106.htm#009) and [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005), and I
will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to
wife.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the sons of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007)
answered [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003) and
[Hamor](../ebd/ebd161.htm#004) his father deceitfully, and said, because
he had defiled [Dinah](../ebd/ebd103.htm#008) their sister:  

<span id="014">14</span> And they said unto them, We cannot do this
thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a
reproach unto us:  

<span id="015">15</span> But in this will we consent unto you: If ye
will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;  

<span id="016">16</span> Then will we give our daughters unto you, and
we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we
will become one people.  

<span id="017">17</span> But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be
circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.  

<span id="018">18</span> And their words pleased
[Hamor](../ebd/ebd161.htm#004), and [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003)
Hamor's son.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the young man deferred not to do the thing,
because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable
than all the house of his father.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Hamor](../ebd/ebd161.htm#004) and
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003) his son came unto the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of their city, and communed with the men
of their city, saying,  

<span id="021">21</span> These men are peaceable with us; therefore let
them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is
large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and
let us give them our daughters.  

<span id="022">22</span> Only herein will the men consent unto us for to
dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised,
as they are circumcised.  

<span id="023">23</span> Shall not their [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002)
and their substance and every [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) of their's
be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.  

<span id="024">24</span> And unto [Hamor](../ebd/ebd161.htm#004) and
unto [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003) his son hearkened all that went
out of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of his city; and every male was
circumcised, all that went out of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of
his city.  

<span id="025">25</span> And it came to pass on the third day, when they
were sore, that two of the sons of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007),
[Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002) and [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006),
Dinah's brethren, took each man his [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and
came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.  

<span id="026">26</span> And they slew [Hamor](../ebd/ebd161.htm#004)
and [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003) his son with the edge of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and took [Dinah](../ebd/ebd103.htm#008)
out of Shechem's house, and went out.  

<span id="027">27</span> The sons of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) came
upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their
sister.  

<span id="028">28</span> They took their [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005),
and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and
that which was in the field,  

<span id="029">29</span> And all their wealth, and all their little
ones, and their wives took they [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001), and
spoiled even all that was in the house.  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) said to
[Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002) and [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006), Ye
have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land,
among the [Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007) and the
[Perizzites](../ebd/ebd290.htm#006): and I being few in number, they
shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be
destroyed, I and my house.  

<span id="031">31</span> And they said, Should he deal with our sister
as with an [harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005)?
