### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 65

<span id="001">1</span> I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am
found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a
nation that was not called by my name.  

<span id="002">2</span> I have spread out my hands all the day unto a
rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their
own thoughts;  

<span id="003">3</span> A people that provoketh me to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) continually to my face; that sacrificeth
in [gardens](../ebd/ebd143.htm#001.md), and burneth
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) upon altars of brick;  

<span id="004">4</span> Which remain among the graves, and
[lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002.md) in the monuments, which eat swine's
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), and broth of abominable things is in
their vessels;  

<span id="005">5</span> Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to
me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that
burneth all the day.  

<span id="006">6</span> Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep
silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their
[bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md),  

<span id="007">7</span> Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your
fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) upon the mountains, and blasphemed me
upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their
[bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Thus saith the LORD, As the new
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) is found in the cluster, and one saith,
Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants'
sakes, that I may not destroy them all.  

<span id="009">9</span> And I will bring forth a seed out of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and out of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) an inheritor of my mountains: and mine
elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Sharon](../ebd/ebd331.htm#009.md) shall be a
[fold](../ebd/ebd136.htm#007.md) of flocks, and the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [Achor](../ebd/ebd007.htm#000.md) a
place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.  

<span id="011">11</span> But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that
forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that
furnish the [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) unto that number.  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore will I number you to the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), and ye shall all
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) down to the slaughter: because when I
called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil
before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.  

<span id="013">13</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my
servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my
servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:  

<span id="014">14</span> Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of
heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation
of [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And ye shall leave your name for a
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) unto my [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md):
for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another
name:  

<span id="016">16</span> That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) himself in the God of truth; and he that
sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the
former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine
eyes.  

<span id="017">17</span> For, behold, I create new heavens and a new
earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.  

<span id="018">18</span> But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that
which I create: for, behold, I create [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md)
a rejoicing, and her people a joy.  

<span id="019">19</span> And I will rejoice in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and joy in my people: and the voice
of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.  

<span id="020">20</span> There shall be no more thence an infant of
days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall
die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old
shall be accursed.  

<span id="021">21</span> And they shall build houses, and inhabit them;
and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of them.  

<span id="022">22</span> They shall not build, and another inhabit; they
shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days
of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.  

<span id="023">23</span> They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth
for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their
offspring with them.  

<span id="024">24</span> And it shall come to pass, that before they
call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.  

<span id="025">25</span> The [wolf](../ebd/ebd383.htm#001.md) and the
[lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md) shall feed together, and the lion shall
eat [straw](../ebd/ebd352.htm#000.md) like the
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003): and [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md)
shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my
holy mountain, saith the LORD.
