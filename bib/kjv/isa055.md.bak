### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 55

<span id="001">1</span> Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the
waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) and [milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000.md) without
money and without price.  

<span id="002">2</span> Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is
not [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md)? and your labour for that which
satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is
good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.  

<span id="003">3</span> Incline your [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md), and
come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md)
with you, even the sure mercies of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Behold, I have given him for a
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) to the people, a leader and commander
to the people.  

<span id="005">5</span> Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou
knowest not, and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because
of the LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); for he hath glorified thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye
upon him while he is near:  

<span id="007">7</span> Let the wicked forsake his way, and the
unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he
will have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) upon him; and to our God, for
he will abundantly [pardon](../ebd/ebd285.htm#001.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither
are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.  

<span id="009">9</span> For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so
are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.  

<span id="010">10</span> For as the [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) cometh
down, and the [snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000.md) from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and returneth not thither, but watereth
the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to
the sower, and [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) to the eater:  

<span id="011">11</span> So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my
mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that
which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.  

<span id="012">12</span> For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth
with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you
into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.  

<span id="013">13</span> Instead of the [thorn](../ebd/ebd364.htm#006.md)
shall come up the [fir](../ebd/ebd133.htm#005.md) tree, and instead of the
[brier](../ebd/ebd065.htm#003.md) shall come up the
[myrtle](../ebd/ebd263.htm#004.md) tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a
name, for an [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) sign that shall not be
cut off.
