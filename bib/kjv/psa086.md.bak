### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 86

<span id="001">1</span> [Bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) down thine
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md), O LORD, hear me: for I am
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) and needy.  

<span id="002">2</span> Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God,
save thy servant that trusteth in thee.  

<span id="003">3</span> Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee
daily.  

<span id="004">4</span> Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee,
O Lord, do I lift up my soul.  

<span id="005">5</span> For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive;
and plenteous in [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) unto all them that call
upon thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> Give [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md), O LORD, unto
my [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md); and attend to the voice of my
supplications.  

<span id="007">7</span> In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee:
for thou wilt answer me.  

<span id="008">8</span> Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O
Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works.  

<span id="009">9</span> All nations whom thou hast made shall come and
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) before thee, O Lord; and shall
[glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005.md) thy name.  

<span id="010">10</span> For thou art great, and doest wondrous things:
thou art God alone.  

<span id="011">11</span> Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy
truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.  

<span id="012">12</span> I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my
heart: and I will [glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005.md) thy name for
evermore.  

<span id="013">13</span> For great is thy [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md)
toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> O God, the proud are risen against me, and the
assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set
thee before them.  

<span id="015">15</span> But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion,
and gracious, long suffering, and plenteous in
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) and truth.  

<span id="016">16</span> O turn unto me, and have
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) upon me; give thy strength unto thy
servant, and save the son of thine [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Shew me a token for good; that they which hate
me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and
comforted me.
