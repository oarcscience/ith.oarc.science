</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;When the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of God, they brought it into the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</A>, and set it by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And when they of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#006">Ashdod</A> arose early on the morrow, behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</A> was fallen upon his face to the earth before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the LORD. And they took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</A>, and set him in his place again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</A> was fallen upon his face to the ground before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the LORD; and the head of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</A> and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#000">threshold</A>; only the stump of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</A> was left to him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Therefore neither the priests of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</A>, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#000">threshold</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#006">Ashdod</A> unto this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#006">Ashdod</A>, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#006">Ashdod</A> and the coasts thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And when the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#006">Ashdod</A> saw that it was so, they said, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</A> our god.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> unto them, and said, What shall we do with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>? And they answered, Let the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> be carried about unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</A>. And they carried the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> about thither.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Therefore they sent the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of God to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#001">Ekron</A>. And it came to pass, as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of God came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#001">Ekron</A>, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> to us, to slay us and our people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>, and said, Send away the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A> throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
