</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">Grace</A> and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> our Lord,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd151.htm#007">godliness</A>, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> and virtue:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience <A HREF="../ebd/ebd151.htm#007">godliness</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd151.htm#007">godliness</A> brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#009">charity</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</A> nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But he that lacketh these things is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">calling</A> and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> kingdom of our Lord and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A>, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Knowing that shortly I must put off this my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A>, even as our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> hath shewed me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For he received from God the Father honour and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And this voice which came from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> we heard, when we were with him in the holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;We have also a more sure word of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</A>; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Knowing this first, that no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A> is of any private interpretation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</A> came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>.<BR>
