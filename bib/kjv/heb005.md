### King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> For every high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God,
that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:  

<span id="002">2</span> Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on
them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with
infirmity.  

<span id="003">3</span> And by reason hereof he ought, as for the
people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.  

<span id="004">4</span> And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but
he that is called of God, as was [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> So also [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
glorified not himself to be made an high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md); but he that said unto him, Thou art my
Son, to day have I begotten thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> As he saith also in another place, Thou art a
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) for ever after the order of
Melchisedec.  

<span id="007">7</span> Who in the days of his
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), when he had offered up prayers and
supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to
save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;  

<span id="008">8</span> Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience
by the things which he suffered;  

<span id="009">9</span> And being made perfect, he became the author of
eternal [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) unto all them that obey
him;  

<span id="010">10</span> Called of God an high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) after the order of Melchisedec.  

<span id="011">11</span> Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to
be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.  

<span id="012">12</span> For when for the time ye ought to be teachers,
ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of
the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000.md), and not of strong meat.  

<span id="013">13</span> For every one that useth
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000.md) is unskilful in the word of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md): for he is a
[babe](../ebd/ebd040.htm#009.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> But strong meat belongeth to them that are of
full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to
discern both good and evil.
