<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 10</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;But he that entereth in by the door is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;To him the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd299.htm#000">porter</A> openeth; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> hear his voice: and he calleth his own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> by name, and leadeth them out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And when he putteth forth his own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, he goeth before them, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> follow him: for they know his voice.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A> will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;This <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A> spake <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> did not hear them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;I am the good <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A>: the good <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A> giveth his life for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;But he that is an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#004">hireling</A>, and not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A>, whose own the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> are not, seeth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#001">wolf</A> coming, and leaveth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, and fleeth: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#001">wolf</A> catcheth them, and scattereth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#004">hireling</A> fleeth, because he is an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#004">hireling</A>, and careth not for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;I am the good <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A>, and know my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, and am known of mine.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> I have, which are not of this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#007">fold</A>: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#007">fold</A>, and one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And many of them said, He hath a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A>, and is mad; why hear ye him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A>. Can a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A> open the eyes of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And it was at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> of the dedication, and it was winter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> walked in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> in Solomon's porch.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, tell us plainly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> of me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;But ye believe not, because ye are not of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, as I said unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;My <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;I and my Father are one.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Then the Jews took up stones again to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> thee not; but for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</A>; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A> cannot be broken;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And went away again beyond <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A> into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd256.htm#002">miracle</A>: but all things that John spake of this man were true.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And many believed on him there.<BR>
