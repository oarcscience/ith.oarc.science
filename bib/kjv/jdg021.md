### King James Version: Judges Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> Now the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter
unto [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) to wife.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the people came to the house of God, and
abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept
sore;  

<span id="003">3</span> And said, O LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), why is this come to pass in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that there should be to day one
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) lacking in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)?  

<span id="004">4</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the
people rose early, and built there an [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006),
and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) said, Who is there among all the tribes
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) that came not up with the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) unto the LORD? For they had made a
great [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) concerning him that came not up to
the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) repented them for
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) their brother, and said, There is one
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) cut off from
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) this day.  

<span id="007">7</span> How shall we do for wives for them that remain,
seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our
daughters to wives?  

<span id="008">8</span> And they said, What one is there of the tribes
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) that came not up to Mizpeh to the
LORD? And, behold, there came none to the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002)
from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.  

<span id="009">9</span> For the people were numbered, and, behold, there
were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004)
sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them,
saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of
the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), with the women and the children.  

<span id="011">11</span> And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye
shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by
man.  

<span id="012">12</span> And they found among the inhabitants of
Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying
with any male: and they brought them unto the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) to [Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008), which
is in the land of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005).  

<span id="013">13</span> And the whole
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) sent some to speak to the children
of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) that were in the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) [Rimmon](../ebd/ebd313.htm#005), and to
call peaceably unto them.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) came
again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive
of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the people repented them for
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008), because that the LORD had made a
[breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005) in the tribes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="016">16</span> Then the elders of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) said, How shall we do for wives
for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008)?  

<span id="017">17</span> And they said, There must be an inheritance for
them that be escaped of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008), that a
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) be not destroyed out of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="018">18</span> Howbeit we may not give them wives of our
daughters: for the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) have
sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008).  

<span id="019">19</span> Then they said, Behold, there is a
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of the LORD in
[Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008) yearly in a place which is on the north
side of [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006), on the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) side of the
[highway](../ebd/ebd178.htm#005) that goeth up from
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006) to [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003), and
on the south of [Lebonah](../ebd/ebd226.htm#003).  

<span id="020">20</span> Therefore they commanded the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008), saying, Go and lie in wait in the
vineyards;  

<span id="021">21</span> And see, and, behold, if the daughters of
[Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008) come out to
[dance](../ebd/ebd097.htm#000) in dances, then come ye out of the
vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of
[Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008), and go to the land of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008).  

<span id="022">22</span> And it shall be, when their fathers or their
brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be
favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man
his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye
should be guilty.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) did so, and took them wives, according
to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went
and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt
in them.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) departed thence at that time, every man
to his [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) and to his family, and they went
out from thence every man to his inheritance.  

<span id="025">25</span> In those days there was no
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): every
man did that which was right in his own eyes.
