### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as
was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of
[Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003.md) and the land of
[Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006.md), and afterward did more grievously
afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), in [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md) of
the nations.  

<span id="002">2</span> The people that walked in
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) have seen a great light: they that
dwell in the land of the [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) of death, upon
them hath the light shined.  

<span id="003">3</span> Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not
increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md), and as men rejoice when they divide
the spoil.  

<span id="004">4</span> For thou hast broken the
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) of his [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md),
and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day
of [Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> For every battle of the warrior is with confused
noise, and garments rolled in [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md); but this
shall be with burning and [fuel](../ebd/ebd139.htm#002.md) of fire.  

<span id="006">6</span> For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is
given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall
be called Wonderful, [Counsellor](../ebd/ebd091.htm#005.md), The mighty
God, The [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) Father, The
[Prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) of Peace.  

<span id="007">7</span> Of the increase of his government and peace
there shall be no end, upon the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and upon his kingdom, to order it, and
to establish it with judgment and with [justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007.md)
from henceforth even for ever. The [zeal](../ebd/ebd388.htm#003.md) of the
LORD of hosts will perform this.  

<span id="008">8</span> The Lord sent a word into
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and it hath lighted upon
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And all the people shall know, even
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) and the inhabitant of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md), that say in the pride and stoutness of
heart,  

<span id="010">10</span> The [bricks](../ebd/ebd065.htm#000.md) are fallen
down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycomores are cut down,
but we will change them into cedars.  

<span id="011">11</span> Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries
of [Rezin](../ebd/ebd312.htm#006.md) against him, and join his enemies
together;  

<span id="012">12</span> The Syrians before, and the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) behind; and they shall devour
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) with open mouth. For all this his
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) is not turned away, but his hand is
stretched out still.  

<span id="013">13</span> For the people turneth not unto him that
smiteth them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="014">14</span> Therefore the LORD will cut off from
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) head and tail,
[branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002) and [rush](../ebd/ebd316.htm#007.md), in
one day.  

<span id="015">15</span> The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and
the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) that teacheth lies, he is the
tail.  

<span id="016">16</span> For the leaders of this people cause them to
err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.  

<span id="017">17</span> Therefore the LORD shall have no joy in their
young men, neither shall have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) on their
fatherless and [widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003.md): for every one is an
[hypocrite](../ebd/ebd185.htm#006.md) and an evildoer, and every mouth
speaketh folly. For all this his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) is not
turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.  

<span id="018">18</span> For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall
devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006.md), and they shall
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) up like the lifting up of smoke.  

<span id="019">19</span> Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the
land darkened, and the people shall be as the
[fuel](../ebd/ebd139.htm#002.md) of the fire: no man shall spare his
brother.  

<span id="020">20</span> And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be
hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be
satisfied: they shall eat every man the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md)
of his own arm:  

<span id="021">21</span> [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md),
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000); and [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md),
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md): and they together shall be against
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md). For all this his
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) is not turned away, but his hand is
stretched out still.
