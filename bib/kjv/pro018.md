### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> Through desire a man, having separated himself,
seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom.  

<span id="002">2</span> A fool hath no delight in understanding, but
that his heart may discover itself.  

<span id="003">3</span> When the wicked cometh, then cometh also
contempt, and with ignominy reproach.  

<span id="004">4</span> The words of a man's mouth are as
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008) waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a
flowing [brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006).  

<span id="005">5</span> It is not good to accept the person of the
wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.  

<span id="006">6</span> A fool's lips enter into contention, and his
mouth calleth for strokes.  

<span id="007">7</span> A fool's mouth is his
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004), and his lips are the
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009) of his soul.  

<span id="008">8</span> The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and
they go down into the innermost parts of the
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000).  

<span id="009">9</span> He also that is slothful in his work is brother
to him that is a great waster.  

<span id="010">10</span> The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the
righteous runneth into it, and is safe.  

<span id="011">11</span> The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and
as an high wall in his own conceit.  

<span id="012">12</span> Before [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) the
heart of man is haughty, and before honour is
[humility](../ebd/ebd184.htm#007).  

<span id="013">13</span> He that answereth a matter before he heareth
it, it is folly and shame unto him.  

<span id="014">14</span> The [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of a man
will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) who can bear?  

<span id="015">15</span> The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and
the [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) of the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004)
seeketh knowledge.  

<span id="016">16</span> A man's [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005) maketh
room for him, and bringeth him before great men.  

<span id="017">17</span> He that is first in his own cause seemeth just;
but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.  

<span id="018">18</span> The lot causeth contentions to cease, and
parteth between the mighty.  

<span id="019">19</span> A brother offended is harder to be won than a
strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a
[castle](../ebd/ebd073.htm#008).  

<span id="020">20</span> A man's [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000) shall be
satisfied with the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of his mouth; and with
the increase of his lips shall he be filled.  

<span id="021">21</span> Death and life are in the power of the tongue:
and they that love it shall eat the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000)
thereof.  

<span id="022">22</span> Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and
obtaineth favour of the LORD.  

<span id="023">23</span> The [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) useth
intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.  

<span id="024">24</span> A man that hath friends must shew himself
friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.
