### King James Version: Romans Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God
forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md)
of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> God hath not cast away his people which he
foreknew. Wot ye not what the [scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005.md) saith
of [Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002.md)? how he maketh intercession to God
against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) saying,  

<span id="003">3</span> Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged
down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.  

<span id="004">4</span> But what saith the answer of God unto him? I
have reserved to myself [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) thousand men, who
have not bowed the knee to the image of [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Even so then at this present time also there is
a remnant according to the election of [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And if by [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md), then
is it no more of works: otherwise [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) is no
more [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md). But if it be of works, then it is
no more [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md): otherwise work is no more
work.  

<span id="007">7</span> What then? [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) hath
not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained
it, and the rest were blinded.  

<span id="008">8</span> (According as it is written, God hath given them
the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of slumber, eyes that they should
not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) saith, Let
their table be made a [snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009.md), and a trap, and a
stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:  

<span id="010">10</span> Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not
see, and [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) down their back alway.  

<span id="011">11</span> I say then, Have they stumbled that they should
fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) is come unto the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md), for to provoke them to
[jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> Now if the fall of them be the riches of the
world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md); how much more their
[fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007.md)?  

<span id="013">13</span> For I speak to you
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md), inasmuch as I am the
[apostle](../ebd/ebd026.htm#008.md) of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md), I magnify mine office:  

<span id="014">14</span> If by any means I may provoke to emulation them
which are my [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), and might save some of
them.  

<span id="015">15</span> For if the casting away of them be the
reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life
from the dead?  

<span id="016">16</span> For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also
holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.  

<span id="017">17</span> And if some of the branches be broken off, and
thou, being a wild [olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009.md) tree, wert graffed in
among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the
[olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009.md) tree;  

<span id="018">18</span> Boast not against the branches. But if thou
boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.  

<span id="019">19</span> Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken
off, that I might be graffed in.  

<span id="020">20</span> Well; because of unbelief they were broken off,
and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:  

<span id="021">21</span> For if God spared not the natural branches,
take heed lest he also spare not thee.  

<span id="022">22</span> Behold therefore the
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md) and severity of God: on them which
fell, severity; but toward thee, [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md), if
thou continue in his [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md): otherwise thou
also shalt be cut off.  

<span id="023">23</span> And they also, if they abide not still in
unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.  

<span id="024">24</span> For if thou wert cut out of the
[olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009.md) tree which is wild by nature, and wert
graffed contrary to nature into a good [olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009.md)
tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be
graffed into their own [olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009.md) tree?  

<span id="025">25</span> For I would not, brethren, that ye should be
ignorant of this [mystery](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006.md), lest ye should be
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) in your own conceits; that blindness in
part is happened to [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), until the
[fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007.md) of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) be come in.  

<span id="026">26</span> And so all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of
[Sion](../ebd/ebd345.htm#003.md) the Deliverer, and shall turn away
ungodliness from [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md):  

<span id="027">27</span> For this is my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) unto them, when I shall take away
their sins.  

<span id="028">28</span> As concerning the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md), they are enemies for your sakes: but as
touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes.  

<span id="029">29</span> For the gifts and
[calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007.md) of God are without
[repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> For as ye in times past have not believed God,
yet have now obtained [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) through their
unbelief:  

<span id="031">31</span> Even so have these also now not believed, that
through your [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) they also may obtain
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> For God hath concluded them all in unbelief,
that he might have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) upon all.  

<span id="033">33</span> O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom
and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways
past finding out!  

<span id="034">34</span> For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who
hath been his [counsellor](../ebd/ebd091.htm#005.md)?  

<span id="035">35</span> Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be
recompensed unto him again?  

<span id="036">36</span> For of him, and through him, and to him, are
all things: to whom be [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) for ever.
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).
