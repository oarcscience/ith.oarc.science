### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) spake unto
the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered
him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002):  

<span id="002">2</span> And he said, The LORD is my
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001), and my fortress, and my deliverer;  

<span id="003">3</span> The God of my [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001); in
him will I trust: he is my [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001), and the
[horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003) of my [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003),
my high tower, and my refuge, my [saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003); thou
savest me from violence.  

<span id="004">4</span> I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be
praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.  

<span id="005">5</span> When the waves of death compassed me, the floods
of ungodly men made me afraid;  

<span id="006">6</span> The sorrows of [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003)
compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;  

<span id="007">7</span> In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried
to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), and my cry did enter into his ears.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then the earth shook and trembled; the
foundations of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) moved and shook, because
he was wroth.  

<span id="009">9</span> There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and
fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.  

<span id="010">10</span> He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) was under his feet.  

<span id="011">11</span> And he rode upon a
[cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003), and did [fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004):
and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he made [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008)
pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.  

<span id="013">13</span> Through the brightness before him were coals of
fire kindled.  

<span id="014">14</span> The LORD thundered from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and the most High uttered his voice.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he sent out
[arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005), and scattered them;
[lightning](../ebd/ebd229.htm#002), and discomfited them.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the channels of the sea appeared, the
foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD,
at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.  

<span id="017">17</span> He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out
of many waters;  

<span id="018">18</span> He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from
them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.  

<span id="019">19</span> They prevented me in the day of my calamity:
but the LORD was my stay.  

<span id="020">20</span> He brought me forth also into a large place: he
delivered me, because he delighted in me.  

<span id="021">21</span> The LORD rewarded me according to my
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004): according to the cleanness of my
hands hath he recompensed me.  

<span id="022">22</span> For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have
not wickedly departed from my God.  

<span id="023">23</span> For all his judgments were before me: and as
for his statutes, I did not depart from them.  

<span id="024">24</span> I was also upright before him, and have kept
myself from mine iniquity.  

<span id="025">25</span> Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me
according to my [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004); according to my
cleanness in his eye sight.  

<span id="026">26</span> With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself
merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.  

<span id="027">27</span> With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and
with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.  

<span id="028">28</span> And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but
thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.  

<span id="029">29</span> For thou art my [lamp](../ebd/ebd223.htm#007),
O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008).  

<span id="030">30</span> For by thee I have run through a troop: by my
God have I leaped over a wall.  

<span id="031">31</span> As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the
LORD is tried: he is a [buckler](../ebd/ebd066.htm#000) to all them that
trust in him.  

<span id="032">32</span> For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001), save our God?  

<span id="033">33</span> God is my strength and power: and he maketh my
way perfect.  

<span id="034">34</span> He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth
me upon my high places.  

<span id="035">35</span> He teacheth my hands to war; so that a
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) of [steel](../ebd/ebd351.htm#000) is broken
by mine arms.  

<span id="036">36</span> Thou hast also given me the
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001) of thy
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003): and thy gentleness hath made me
great.  

<span id="037">37</span> Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that
my feet did not slip.  

<span id="038">38</span> I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed
them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.  

<span id="039">39</span> And I have consumed them, and wounded them,
that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.  

<span id="040">40</span> For thou hast girded me with strength to
battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.  

<span id="041">41</span> Thou hast also given me the necks of mine
enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.  

<span id="042">42</span> They looked, but there was none to save; even
unto the LORD, but he answered them not.  

<span id="043">43</span> Then did I beat them as small as the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire
of the street, and did spread them abroad.  

<span id="044">44</span> Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings
of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005): a people which I knew not shall serve
me.  

<span id="045">45</span> Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as
soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.  

<span id="046">46</span> Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be
afraid out of their close places.  

<span id="047">47</span> The LORD liveth; and blessed be my
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001); and exalted be the God of the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) of my
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003).  

<span id="048">48</span> It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth
down the people under me.  

<span id="049">49</span> And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies:
thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me:
thou hast delivered me from the violent man.  

<span id="050">50</span> Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD,
among the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), and I will sing praises unto
thy name.  

<span id="051">51</span> He is the tower of
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) for his
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001): and sheweth
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) to his anointed, unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and to his seed for evermore.
