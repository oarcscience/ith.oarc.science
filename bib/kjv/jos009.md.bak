### King James Version: Joshua Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, when all the kings which
were on this side [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), in the hills, and in
the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md), the Hittite, and the Amorite, the
[Canaanite](../ebd/ebd070.htm#008.md), the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the
Jebusite, heard thereof;  

<span id="002">2</span> That they gathered themselves together, to fight
with [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) and with
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), with one accord.  

<span id="003">3</span> And when the inhabitants of
[Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002.md) heard what
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) had done unto
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008) and to [Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md),  

<span id="004">4</span> They did work wilily, and went and made as if
they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) bottles, old, and
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md), and bound up;  

<span id="005">5</span> And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and
old garments upon them; and all the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) of
their provision was dry and [mouldy](../ebd/ebd260.htm#006.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And they went to [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md)
unto the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md) at
[Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md), and said unto him, and to the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), We be come from a far country: now
therefore make ye a [league](../ebd/ebd225.htm#005.md) with us.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
said unto the [Hivites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#007.md), Peradventure ye dwell
among us; and how shall we make a [league](../ebd/ebd225.htm#005.md) with
you?  

<span id="008">8</span> And they said unto
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), We are thy servants. And
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) said unto them, Who are ye? and from
whence come ye?  

<span id="009">9</span> And they said unto him, From a very far country
thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we
have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md),  

<span id="010">10</span> And all that he did to the two kings of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md), that were beyond
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), to [Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009.md), and
to [Og](../ebd/ebd277.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003.md), which was at
[Ashtaroth](../ebd/ebd034.htm#004.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of
our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md), and go to meet them, and say unto
them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a
[league](../ebd/ebd225.htm#005.md) with us.  

<span id="012">12</span> This our [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) we took
hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go
unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is
[mouldy](../ebd/ebd260.htm#006.md):  

<span id="013">13</span> And these bottles of
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), which we filled, were new; and, behold,
they be [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md): and these our garments and our
shoes are become old by reason of the very long
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And the men took of their victuals, and asked
not counsel at the mouth of the LORD.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) made peace
with them, and made a [league](../ebd/ebd225.htm#005.md) with them, to let
them live: and the princes of the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md)
sware unto them.  

<span id="016">16</span> And it came to pass at the end of three days
after they had made a [league](../ebd/ebd225.htm#005.md) with them, that
they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among
them.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) journeyed, and came unto their cities on
the third day. Now their cities were [Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002.md),
and [Chephirah](../ebd/ebd079.htm#000.md), and
[Beeroth](../ebd/ebd050.htm#006.md), and Kirjathjearim.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) smote them not, because the princes of
the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) had sworn unto them by the
LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md). And all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) murmured against the princes.  

<span id="019">19</span> But all the princes said unto all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), We have sworn unto them by the
LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): now therefore we may not
touch them.  

<span id="020">20</span> This we will do to them; we will even let them
live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md) which we sware unto them.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the princes said unto them, Let them live;
but let them be hewers of [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) and drawers of
water unto all the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md); as the princes
had promised them.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) called for
them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us,
saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?  

<span id="023">23</span> Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall
none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) and drawers of water for the house of my
God.  

<span id="024">24</span> And they answered
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), and said, Because it was certainly told
thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) to give you all the land, and to destroy
all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore
afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.  

<span id="025">25</span> And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it
seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.  

<span id="026">26</span> And so did he unto them, and delivered them out
of the hand of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), that
they slew them not.  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) made them
that day hewers of [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) and drawers of water
for the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), and for the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) of the LORD, even unto this day, in the
place which he should choose.
