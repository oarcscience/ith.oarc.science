### King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> Now these are they that came to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) to [Ziklag](../ebd/ebd393.htm#003.md), while
he yet kept himself close because of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) the
son of [Kish](../ebd/ebd220.htm#007.md): and they were among the mighty
men, helpers of the war.  

<span id="002">2</span> They were armed with bows, and could use both
the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting
[arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005) out of a [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md),
even of Saul's brethren of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> The chief was [Ahiezer](../ebd/ebd013.htm#008.md),
then [Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md), the sons of
[Shemaah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#004.md) the Gibeathite; and
[Jeziel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#007), and [Pelet](../ebd/ebd288.htm#008.md), the
sons of [Azmaveth](../ebd/ebd038.htm#000.md); and
[Berachah](../ebd/ebd053.htm#001), and [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md) the
[Antothite](../ebd/ebd025.htm#006.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among
the thirty, and over the thirty; and [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md),
and [Jahaziel](../ebd/ebd195.htm#006.md), and
[Johanan](../ebd/ebd208.htm#009.md), and Josabad the
[Gederathite](../ebd/ebd145.htm#002.md),  

<span id="005">5</span> Eluzai, and [Jerimoth](../ebd/ebd203.htm#009.md),
and [Bealiah](../ebd/ebd048.htm#005.md), and
[Shemariah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#006.md), and
[Shephatiah](../ebd/ebd335.htm#005.md) the
[Haruphite](../ebd/ebd165.htm#006.md),  

<span id="006">6</span> [Elkanah](../ebd/ebd118.htm#005.md), and Jesiah,
and Azareel, and [Joezer](../ebd/ebd208.htm#008.md), and
[Jashobeam](../ebd/ebd198.htm#000.md), the
[Korhites](../ebd/ebd222.htm#006.md),  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Joelah](../ebd/ebd208.htm#007.md), and
[Zebadiah](../ebd/ebd388.htm#005.md), the sons of
[Jeroham](../ebd/ebd204.htm#001) of [Gedor](../ebd/ebd145.htm#003.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And of the Gadites there separated themselves
unto [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) into the hold to the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) men of might, and men of war fit for
the battle, that could handle [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001.md) and
[buckler](../ebd/ebd066.htm#000.md), whose faces were like the faces of
[lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001.md), and were as swift as the roes upon the
mountains;  

<span id="009">9</span> [Ezer](../ebd/ebd129.htm#004.md) the first,
[Obadiah](../ebd/ebd276.htm#001.md) the second,
[Eliab](../ebd/ebd115.htm#008.md) the third,  

<span id="010">10</span> [Mishmannah](../ebd/ebd257.htm#001.md) the fourth,
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) the fifth,  

<span id="011">11</span> Attai the sixth, [Eliel](../ebd/ebd116.htm#006.md)
the seventh,  

<span id="012">12</span> [Johanan](../ebd/ebd208.htm#009.md) the eighth,
Elzabad the ninth,  

<span id="013">13</span> [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) the tenth,
[Machbanai](../ebd/ebd235.htm#005.md) the eleventh.  

<span id="014">14</span> These were of the sons of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md), captains of the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md): one of the least was over an hundred, and
the greatest over a thousand.  

<span id="015">15</span> These are they that went over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) in the first month, when it had
overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys,
both toward the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md), and toward the west.  

<span id="016">16</span> And there came of the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) and [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) to
the hold unto [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) went out to
meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto
me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but if ye be come to
betray me to mine enemies, seeing there is no wrong in mine hands, the
God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) came
upon [Amasai](../ebd/ebd019.htm#004.md), who was chief of the captains, and
he said, Thine are we, [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and on thy side,
thou son of [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005.md): peace, peace be unto thee,
and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) received them, and made them captains of
the band.  

<span id="019">19</span> And there fell some of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md),
when he came with the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) against
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) to battle: but they helped them not: for
the lords of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) upon advisement
sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) to the jeopardy of our heads.  

<span id="020">20</span> As he went to [Ziklag](../ebd/ebd393.htm#003.md),
there fell to him of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md),
[Adnah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#004), and [Jozabad](../ebd/ebd212.htm#002.md),
and [Jediael](../ebd/ebd199.htm#007.md), and
[Michael](../ebd/ebd252.htm#009), and [Jozabad](../ebd/ebd212.htm#002.md),
and [Elihu](../ebd/ebd116.htm#008.md), and
[Zilthai](../ebd/ebd393.htm#006.md), captains of the
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md) that were of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And they helped [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
against the band of the rovers: for they were all mighty men of valour,
and were captains in the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> For at that time day by day there came to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) to help him, until it was a great
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007), like the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of
God.  

<span id="023">23</span> And these are the numbers of the
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003.md) that were ready armed to the war, and
came to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) to
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004.md), to turn the kingdom of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) to him, according to the word of the
LORD.  

<span id="024">24</span> The children of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)
that bare [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001.md) and spear were six thousand
and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.  

<span id="025">25</span> Of the children of
[Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002.md), mighty men of valour for the war,
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) thousand and one hundred.  

<span id="026">26</span> Of the children of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006.md) four thousand and six hundred.  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md) was the
leader of the [Aaronites](../ebd/ebd000.htm#002.md), and with him were
three thousand and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) hundred;  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008.md), a young man
mighty of valour, and of his father's house twenty and two captains.  

<span id="029">29</span> And of the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md), the kindred of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), three thousand: for hitherto the greatest
part of them had kept the [ward](../ebd/ebd379.htm#001.md) of the house of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> And of the children of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) twenty thousand and eight hundred,
mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers.  

<span id="031">31</span> And of the half [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md)
of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) eighteen thousand, which were
expressed by name, to come and make [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> And of the children of
[Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002.md), which were men that had understanding
of the times, to know what [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) ought to do;
the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their
commandment.  

<span id="033">33</span> Of [Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003.md), such as
went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty
thousand, which could keep rank: they were not of double heart.  

<span id="034">34</span> And of [Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006.md) a
thousand captains, and with them with [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001.md)
and spear thirty and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) thousand.  

<span id="035">35</span> And of the Danites expert in war twenty and
eight thousand and six hundred.  

<span id="036">36</span> And of [Asher](../ebd/ebd033.htm#008.md), such as
went forth to battle, expert in war, forty thousand.  

<span id="037">37</span> And on the other side of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and
of the half [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md), with all manner of instruments of war
for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand.  

<span id="038">38</span> All these men of war, that could keep rank,
came with a perfect heart to [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004.md), to make
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and all the rest also of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) were of one heart to make
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="039">39</span> And there they were with
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) three days,
[eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006.md) and drinking: for their brethren had
prepared for them.  

<span id="040">40</span> Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto
[Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002) and [Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003.md)
and [Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006.md), brought
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) on asses, and on camels, and on mules,
and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of
[raisins](../ebd/ebd306.htm#000), and [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), and
oil, and oxen, and [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) abundantly: for there
was joy in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).
