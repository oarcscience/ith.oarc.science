<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 7</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#004">hireling</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;As a servant earnestly desireth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A>, and as an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#004">hireling</A> looketh for the reward of his work:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;My <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> is clothed with worms and clods of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A>; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;As the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A> is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A> shall come up no more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Am I a sea, or a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd380.htm#009">whale</A>, that thou settest a watch over me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#002">couch</A> shall ease my complaints;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#009">swallow</A> down my spittle?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men?  why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A> to myself?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And why dost thou not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd285.htm#001">pardon</A> my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A>; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.<BR>
