### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> And after these things I heard a great voice of
much people in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), saying,
[Alleluia](../ebd/ebd017.htm#005); [Salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md),
and [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), and honour, and power, unto the Lord
our God:  

<span id="002">2</span> For true and righteous are his judgments: for he
hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her
[fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008.md), and hath avenged the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of his servants at her hand.  

<span id="003">3</span> And again they said,
[Alleluia](../ebd/ebd017.htm#005.md) And her smoke rose up for ever and
ever.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the four and twenty elders and the four
beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001), saying, [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md);
[Alleluia](../ebd/ebd017.htm#005.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And a voice came out of the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), saying, Praise our God, all ye his
servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I heard as it were the voice of a great
multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty
thunderings, saying, [Alleluia](../ebd/ebd017.htm#005.md): for the Lord God
omnipotent reigneth.  

<span id="007">7</span> Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to
him: for the marriage of the [Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md) is come, and
his wife hath made herself ready.  

<span id="008">8</span> And to her was granted that she should be
arrayed in fine [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md),
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) and white: for the fine
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md) is the
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) of saints.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they
which are called unto the marriage [supper](../ebd/ebd353.htm#004.md) of
the [Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md). And he saith unto me, These are the
true sayings of God.  

<span id="010">10</span> And I fell at his feet to
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) him. And he said unto me, See thou do
it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md):
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) God: for the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) is
the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of
[prophecy](../ebd/ebd300.htm#007.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And I saw [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)
opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called
[Faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md) and True, and in
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) he doth
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) and make war.  

<span id="012">12</span> His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his
head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but
he himself.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md): and his name is called The Word of
God.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the armies which were in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) followed him upon white horses, clothed
in fine [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md), white and
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And out of his mouth goeth a sharp
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), that with it he should smite the
nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md): and he treadeth the winepress of the
fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a
name written, [KING](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) OF KINGS, AND LORD OF
LORDS.  

<span id="017">17</span> And I saw an [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md)
standing in the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md); and he cried with a loud
voice, saying to all the fowls that [fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004.md) in the
midst of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), Come and gather yourselves
together unto the [supper](../ebd/ebd353.htm#004.md) of the great God;  

<span id="018">18</span> That ye may eat the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of kings, and the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of captains, and the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of mighty men, and the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of horses, and of them that sit on them,
and the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of all men, both free and
[bond](../ebd/ebd062.htm#001.md), both small and great.  

<span id="019">19</span> And I saw the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md),
and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make
war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) was
taken, and with him the false [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) that
wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had
received the mark of the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md), and them that
worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire
burning with [brimstone](../ebd/ebd065.htm#005.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And the remnant were slain with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) of him that sat upon the horse, which
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) proceeded out of his mouth: and all the
fowls were filled with their [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).
