### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> Now it came to pass upon a day, that
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) the son of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said unto the young man that bare his
[armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006.md), Come, and let us go over to the
Philistines' [garrison](../ebd/ebd143.htm#007.md), that is on the other
side. But he told not his father.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) tarried in the
uttermost part of [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008.md) under a
[pomegranate](../ebd/ebd298.htm#000.md) tree which is in
[Migron](../ebd/ebd254.htm#004.md): and the people that were with him were
about six hundred men;  

<span id="003">3</span> And Ahiah, the son of
[Ahitub](../ebd/ebd015.htm#001.md), Ichabod's brother, the son of
[Phinehas](../ebd/ebd294.htm#003.md), the son of
[Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007), the LORD's [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
in [Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008.md), wearing an
[ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md). And the people knew not that
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) was gone.  

<span id="004">4</span> And between the passages, by which
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) sought to go over unto the
Philistines' [garrison](../ebd/ebd143.htm#007.md), there was a sharp
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md) on the one side, and a sharp
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md) on the other side: and the name of the one
was Bozez, and the name of the other [Seneh](../ebd/ebd327.htm#003.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> The forefront of the one was situate
[northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002.md) over against
[Michmash](../ebd/ebd253.htm#002.md), and the other southward over against
[Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) said to
the young man that bare his [armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006.md), Come, and
let us go over unto the [garrison](../ebd/ebd143.htm#007.md) of these
uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no
restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.  

<span id="007">7</span> And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that
is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy
heart.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then said [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md),
Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves
unto them.  

<span id="009">9</span> If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to
you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto
them.  

<span id="010">10</span> But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we
will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this
shall be a sign unto us.  

<span id="011">11</span> And both of them discovered themselves unto the
[garrison](../ebd/ebd143.htm#007.md) of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md): and the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) said, Behold, the
[Hebrews](../ebd/ebd171.htm#001.md) come forth out of the holes where they
had hid themselves.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the men of the
[garrison](../ebd/ebd143.htm#007.md) answered
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) and his armourbearer, and said, Come
up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) said unto his armourbearer, Come up
after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) climbed
up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and
they fell before [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md); and his armourbearer
slew after him.  

<span id="014">14</span> And that first slaughter, which
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) and his armourbearer made, was about
twenty men, within as it were an half [acre](../ebd/ebd007.htm#004.md) of
land, which a [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md) of oxen might plow.  

<span id="015">15</span> And there was trembling in the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md), in the field, and among all the people:
the [garrison](../ebd/ebd143.htm#007.md), and the spoilers, they also
trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the watchmen of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) in [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008.md) of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md) looked; and, behold, the multitude
melted away, and they went on beating down one another.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then said [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) unto
the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us.
And when they had numbered, behold, [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md)
and his armourbearer were not there.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said unto
Ahiah, Bring hither the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God. For the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God was at that time with the children
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And it came to pass, while
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) talked unto the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), that the noise that was in the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) went on and increased: and
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said unto the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), Withdraw thine hand.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) and all the
people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the
battle: and, behold, every man's [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) was
against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.  

<span id="021">21</span> Moreover the [Hebrews](../ebd/ebd171.htm#001.md)
that were with the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) before that
time, which went up with them into the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md)
from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the
Israelites that were with [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) and
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> Likewise all the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) which had hid themselves in
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), when
they heard that the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) fled, even they
also followed hard after them in the battle.  

<span id="023">23</span> So the LORD saved
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) that day: and the battle passed over
unto Bethaven.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
were distressed that day: for [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) had adjured
the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until
evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people
tasted any food.  

<span id="025">25</span> And all they of the land came to a
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md); and there was
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md) upon the ground.  

<span id="026">26</span> And when the people were come into the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md), behold, the
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md) dropped; but no man put his hand to his
mouth: for the people feared the [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> But [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) heard not
when his father charged the people with the
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md): wherefore he put forth the end of the rod
that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to
his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.  

<span id="028">28</span> Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy
father straitly charged the people with an
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md), saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any
food this day. And the people were faint.  

<span id="029">29</span> Then said [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md), My
father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been
enlightened, because I tasted a little of this
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> How much more, if haply the people had eaten
freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had
there not been now a much greater slaughter among the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)?  

<span id="031">31</span> And they smote the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) that day from
[Michmash](../ebd/ebd253.htm#002.md) to Aijalon: and the people were very
faint.  

<span id="032">32</span> And the people flew upon the spoil, and took
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), and oxen, and calves, and slew them on
the ground: and the people did eat them with the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> Then they told [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md),
saying, Behold, the people [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) against the
LORD, in that they eat with the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md). And he
said, Ye have transgressed: [roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004.md) a great
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) unto me this day.  

<span id="034">34</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said,
Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither
every man his [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007.md), and every man his
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), and slay them here, and eat; and
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) not against the LORD in
[eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006) with the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md).
And all the people brought every man his [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007.md)
with him that night, and slew them there.  

<span id="035">35</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) built an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) unto the LORD: the same was the first
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) that he built unto the LORD.  

<span id="036">36</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said, Let us
go down after the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) by night, and
spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them.
And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), Let us draw near hither unto God.  

<span id="037">37</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) asked counsel
of God, Shall I go down after the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)?
wilt thou deliver them into the hand of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)?
But he answered him not that day.  

<span id="038">38</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said, Draw ye
near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) hath been this day.  

<span id="039">39</span> For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), though it be in
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) my son, he shall surely die. But there
was not a man among all the people that answered him.  

<span id="040">40</span> Then said he unto all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), Be ye on one side, and I and
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) my son will be on the other side. And
the people said unto [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), Do what seemeth good
unto thee.  

<span id="041">41</span> Therefore [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said
unto the LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), Give a perfect
lot. And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) and
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) were taken: but the people escaped.  

<span id="042">42</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said, Cast
lots between me and [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) my son. And
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) was taken.  

<span id="043">43</span> Then [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said to
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md), Tell me what thou hast done. And
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) told him, and said, I did but taste a
little [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md) with the end of the rod that was
in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.  

<span id="044">44</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) answered, God
do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die,
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md).  

<span id="045">45</span> And the people said unto
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), Shall [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md)
die, who hath wrought this great [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there
shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought
with God this day. So the people rescued
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md), that he died not.  

<span id="046">46</span> Then [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) went up from
following the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md): and the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) went to their own place.  

<span id="047">47</span> So [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) took the
kingdom over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and fought against all his
enemies on every side, against [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), and
against the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002.md), and against
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md), and against the kings of
[Zobah](../ebd/ebd395.htm#005.md), and against the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md): and whithersoever he turned
himself, he vexed them.  

<span id="048">48</span> And he gathered an
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md), and smote the Amalekites, and delivered
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) out of the hands of them that spoiled
them.  

<span id="049">49</span> Now the sons of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md)
were [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md), and Ishui, and Melchishua: and
the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn
[Merab](../ebd/ebd248.htm#007.md), and the name of the younger
[Michal](../ebd/ebd253.htm#001.md):  

<span id="050">50</span> And the name of Saul's wife was
[Ahinoam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#006.md), the daughter of
[Ahimaaz](../ebd/ebd014.htm#002.md): and the name of the captain of his
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) was [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002.md), the
son of [Ner](../ebd/ebd270.htm#007.md), Saul's uncle.  

<span id="051">51</span> And [Kish](../ebd/ebd220.htm#007.md) was the
father of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md); and
[Ner](../ebd/ebd270.htm#007.md) the father of
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002.md) was the son of
[Abiel](../ebd/ebd002.htm#009.md).  

<span id="052">52</span> And there was sore war against the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) all the days of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002): and when [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md)
saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.
