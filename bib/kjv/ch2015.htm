</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he went out to meet <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</A>, and said unto him, Hear ye me, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</A>, and all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>; The LORD is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Now for a long season <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> hath been without the true God, and without a teaching <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, and without law.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and sought him, he was found of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</A> heard these words, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#009">Oded</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>, and out of the cities which he had taken from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, and renewed the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And he gathered all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>, and the strangers with them out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A>, and out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</A>: for they fell to him out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;So they gathered themselves together at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> hundred oxen and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> thousand <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And they entered into a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;<BR>

<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</A>, and with cornets.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> rejoiced at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A>: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And also concerning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd234.htm#004">Maachah</A> the mother of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, he removed her from being <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</A>, because she had made an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</A> in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#008">grove</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</A> cut down her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</A>, and stamped it, and burnt it at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd218.htm#008">Kidron</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But the high places were not taken away out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: nevertheless the heart of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</A> was perfect all his days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and vessels.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</A>.<BR>
