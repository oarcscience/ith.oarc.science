### King James Version: John Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> And as [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) passed by,
he saw a man which was [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md) from his
[birth](../ebd/ebd059.htm#002.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who
did [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), this man, or his parents, that he was
born [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md)?  

<span id="003">3</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered, Neither
hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should
be made manifest in him.  

<span id="004">4</span> I must work the works of him that sent me, while
it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.  

<span id="005">5</span> As long as I am in the world, I am the light of
the world.  

<span id="006">6</span> When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground,
and made [clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004.md) of the spittle, and he anointed
the eyes of the [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md) man with the
[clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004.md),  

<span id="007">7</span> And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of
Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore,
and washed, and came seeing.  

<span id="008">8</span> The neighbours therefore, and they which before
had seen him that he was [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md), said, Is not
this he that sat and begged?  

<span id="009">9</span> Some said, This is he: others said, He is like
him: but he said, I am he.  

<span id="010">10</span> Therefore said they unto him, How were thine
eyes opened?  

<span id="011">11</span> He answered and said, A man that is called
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) made [clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004.md), and
anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and
wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said,
I know not.  

<span id="013">13</span> They brought to the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md) him that aforetime was
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And it was the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md)
day when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) made the
[clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004.md), and opened his eyes.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then again the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md) also asked him how he had received
his sight. He said unto them, He put [clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004.md) upon
mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.  

<span id="016">16</span> Therefore said some of the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md), This man is not of God, because he
keepeth not the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) day. Others said, How
can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division
among them.  

<span id="017">17</span> They say unto the
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md) man again, What sayest thou of him, that
he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> But the Jews did not believe concerning him,
that he had been [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md), and received his sight,
until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.  

<span id="019">19</span> And they asked them, saying, Is this your son,
who ye say was born [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md)? how then doth he now
see?  

<span id="020">20</span> His parents answered them and said, We know
that this is our son, and that he was born
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md):  

<span id="021">21</span> But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or
who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall
speak for himself.  

<span id="022">22</span> These words spake his parents, because they
feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did
confess that he was [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), he should be put
out of the [synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask
him.  

<span id="024">24</span> Then again called they the man that was
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md), and said unto him, Give God the praise:
we know that this man is a sinner.  

<span id="025">25</span> He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or
no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md), now I see.  

<span id="026">26</span> Then said they to him again, What did he to
thee? how opened he thine eyes?  

<span id="027">27</span> He answered them, I have told you already, and
ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his
disciples?  

<span id="028">28</span> Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his
[disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003.md); but we are Moses' disciples.  

<span id="029">29</span> We know that God spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md): as for this fellow, we know not from
whence he is.  

<span id="030">30</span> The man answered and said unto them, Why herein
is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he
hath opened mine eyes.  

<span id="031">31</span> Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but
if any man be a [worshipper](../ebd/ebd384.htm#003.md) of God, and doeth
his will, him he heareth.  

<span id="032">32</span> Since the world began was it not heard that any
man opened the eyes of one that was born
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> If this man were not of God, he could do
nothing.  

<span id="034">34</span> They answered and said unto him, Thou wast
altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him
out.  

<span id="035">35</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) heard that they
had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou
believe on the Son of God?  

<span id="036">36</span> He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I
might believe on him?  

<span id="037">37</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto
him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.  

<span id="038">38</span> And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped
him.  

<span id="039">39</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said, For
judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see;
and that they which see might be made [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md).  

<span id="040">40</span> And some of the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md) which were with him heard these
words, and said unto him, Are we [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md) also?  

<span id="041">41</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto them,
If ye were [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md), ye should have no
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md): but now ye say, We see; therefore your
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) remaineth.
