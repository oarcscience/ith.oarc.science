### King James Version: Luke Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, that on one of those days,
as he taught the people in the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), and
preached the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003), the chief priests and the
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) came upon him with the elders,  

<span id="002">2</span> And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what
authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this
authority?  

<span id="003">3</span> And he answered and said unto them, I will also
ask you one thing; and answer me:  

<span id="004">4</span> The baptism of John, was it from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), or of men?  

<span id="005">5</span> And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we
shall say, From [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006); he will say, Why then
believed ye him not?  

<span id="006">6</span> But and if we say, Of men; all the people will
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) us: for they be persuaded that John was a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008).  

<span id="007">7</span> And they answered, that they could not tell
whence it was.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto
them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then began he to speak to the people this
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003); A certain man planted a vineyard, and
let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long
time.  

<span id="010">10</span> And at the season he sent a servant to the
husbandmen, that they should give him of the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat
him, and sent him away empty.  

<span id="011">11</span> And again he sent another servant: and they
beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.  

<span id="012">12</span> And again he sent a third: and they wounded him
also, and cast him out.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall
I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when
they see him.  

<span id="014">14</span> But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned
among themselves, saying, This is the [heir](../ebd/ebd171.htm#007):
come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.  

<span id="015">15</span> So they cast him out of the vineyard, and
killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto
them?  

<span id="016">16</span> He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and
shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said,
God forbid.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he beheld them, and said, What is this then
that is written, The [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) which the builders
rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?  

<span id="018">18</span> Whosoever shall fall upon that
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) shall be broken; but on whomsoever it
shall fall, it will [grind](../ebd/ebd155.htm#006) him to powder.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the chief priests and the
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) the same hour sought to lay hands on
him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken
this [parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003) against them.  

<span id="020">20</span> And they watched him, and sent forth
[spies](../ebd/ebd349.htm#007), which should feign themselves just men,
that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him
unto the power and authority of the governor.  

<span id="021">21</span> And they asked him, saying, Master, we know
that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person
of any, but teachest the way of God truly:  

<span id="022">22</span> Is it lawful for us to give
[tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006) unto [Caesar](../ebd/ebd068.htm#002),
or no?  

<span id="023">23</span> But he perceived their craftiness, and said
unto them, Why tempt ye me?  

<span id="024">24</span> Shew me a [penny](../ebd/ebd289.htm#002). Whose
image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's.  

<span id="025">25</span> And he said unto them, Render therefore unto
[Caesar](../ebd/ebd068.htm#002) the things which be Caesar's, and unto
God the things which be God's.  

<span id="026">26</span> And they could not take hold of his words
before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their
peace.  

<span id="027">27</span> Then came to him certain of the
[Sadducees](../ebd/ebd318.htm#003), which deny that there is any
resurrection; and they asked him,  

<span id="028">28</span> Saying, Master, [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003)
wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die
without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up
seed unto his brother.  

<span id="029">29</span> There were therefore
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) brethren: and the first took a wife, and
died without children.  

<span id="030">30</span> And the second took her to wife, and he died
childless.  

<span id="031">31</span> And the third took her; and in like manner the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) also: and they left no children, and
died.  

<span id="032">32</span> Last of all the woman died also.  

<span id="033">33</span> Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of
them is she? for [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) had her to wife.  

<span id="034">34</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answering
said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in
marriage:  

<span id="035">35</span> But they which shall be accounted worthy to
obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry,
nor are given in marriage:  

<span id="036">36</span> Neither can they die any more: for they are
equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children
of the resurrection.  

<span id="037">37</span> Now that the dead are raised, even
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) shewed at the
[bush](../ebd/ebd067.htm#000), when he calleth the Lord the God of
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), and the God of
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006), and the God of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007).  

<span id="038">38</span> For he is not a God of the dead, but of the
living: for all live unto him.  

<span id="039">39</span> Then certain of the
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) answering said, Master, thou hast well
said.  

<span id="040">40</span> And after that they durst not ask him any
question at all.  

<span id="041">41</span> And he said unto them, How say they that
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) is David's son?  

<span id="042">42</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) himself
saith in the book of [Psalms](../ebd/ebd301.htm#005), The LORD said unto
my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,  

<span id="043">43</span> Till I make thine enemies thy
[footstool](../ebd/ebd136.htm#009).  

<span id="044">44</span> [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) therefore
calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?  

<span id="045">45</span> Then in the audience of all the people he said
unto his disciples,  

<span id="046">46</span> Beware of the [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003),
which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets,
and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at
feasts;  

<span id="047">47</span> Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew
make long prayers: the same shall receive greater
[damnation](../ebd/ebd096.htm#008).
