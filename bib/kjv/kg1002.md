### King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> Now the days of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
drew nigh that he should die; and he charged
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) his son, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong
therefore, and shew thyself a man;  

<span id="003">3</span> And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk
in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his
judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), that thou mayest prosper in all that
thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:  

<span id="004">4</span> That the LORD may continue his word which he
spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to
walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul,
there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="005">5</span> Moreover thou knowest also what
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) the son of
[Zeruiah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#009) did to me, and what he did to the two
captains of the hosts of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), unto
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) the son of [Ner](../ebd/ebd270.htm#007),
and unto [Amasa](../ebd/ebd019.htm#003) the son of
[Jether](../ebd/ebd205.htm#007), whom he slew, and shed the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of war in peace, and put the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of war upon his
[girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005) that was about his loins, and in his
shoes that were on his feet.  

<span id="006">6</span> Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let
not his hoar head go down to the [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008) in
peace.  

<span id="007">7</span> But shew kindness unto the sons of
[Barzillai](../ebd/ebd046.htm#002) the Gileadite, and let them be of
those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because
of [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008) thy brother.  

<span id="008">8</span> And, behold, thou hast with thee
[Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002) the son of
[Gera](../ebd/ebd146.htm#003), a Benjamite of
[Bahurim](../ebd/ebd041.htm#009), which cursed me with a grievous
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) in the day when I went to
[Mahanaim](../ebd/ebd237.htm#005): but he came down to meet me at
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), and I sware to him by the LORD, saying,
I will not put thee to death with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="009">9</span> Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou
art a [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) man, and knowest what thou oughtest
to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008) with [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000).  

<span id="010">10</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) slept with
his fathers, and was buried in the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="011">11</span> And the days that
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) reigned over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) were forty years:
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) years reigned he in
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004), and thirty and three years reigned he
in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="012">12</span> Then sat [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) upon
the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006) the son
of [Haggith](../ebd/ebd158.htm#009) came to Bathsheba the mother of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007). And she said, Comest thou peaceably?
And he said, Peaceably.  

<span id="014">14</span> He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto
thee. And she said, Say on.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was
mine, and that all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) set their faces on
me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is
become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.  

<span id="016">16</span> And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me
not. And she said unto him, Say on.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), (for
he will not say thee nay,) that he give me
[Abishag](../ebd/ebd004.htm#004) the [Shunammite](../ebd/ebd342.htm#000)
to wife.  

<span id="018">18</span> And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee
unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="019">19</span> Bathsheba therefore went unto
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007), to speak
unto him for [Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006). And the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) rose up to meet her, and bowed himself
unto her, and sat down on his [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001), and
caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right
hand.  

<span id="020">20</span> Then she said, I desire one small petition of
thee; I pray thee, say me not nay. And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.  

<span id="021">21</span> And she said, Let
[Abishag](../ebd/ebd004.htm#004) the [Shunammite](../ebd/ebd342.htm#000)
be given to [Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006) thy brother to wife.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) answered and said unto his mother, And
why dost thou ask [Abishag](../ebd/ebd004.htm#004) the
[Shunammite](../ebd/ebd342.htm#000) for
[Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006)? ask for him the kingdom also; for he
is mine [elder](../ebd/ebd114.htm#008) brother; even for him, and for
[Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),
and for [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) the son of
[Zeruiah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#009).  

<span id="023">23</span> Then [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to
me, and more also, if [Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006) have not spoken
this word against his own life.  

<span id="024">24</span> Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath
established me, and set me on the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) my father, and who hath made me an house,
as he promised, [Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006) shall be put to death
this day.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) sent by the hand of
[Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003) the son of
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009); and he fell upon him that he died.  

<span id="026">26</span> And unto [Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) said the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001),
Get thee to [Anathoth](../ebd/ebd023.htm#004), unto thine own fields;
for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to
death, because thou barest the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the LORD
God before [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) my father, and because thou
hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.  

<span id="027">27</span> So [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) thrust out
[Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005) from being
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the
word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of
[Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007) in [Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008).  

<span id="028">28</span> Then tidings came to
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006): for [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) had
turned after [Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006), though he turned not
after [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008). And
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) fled unto the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the LORD, and caught hold on the
horns of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006).  

<span id="029">29</span> And it was told [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) that [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) was
fled unto the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the LORD; and,
behold, he is by the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006). Then
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) sent [Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003)
the son of [Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009), saying, Go, fall upon
him.  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003) came to
the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the LORD, and said unto him,
Thus saith the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), Come forth. And he said,
Nay; but I will die here. And [Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003) brought
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) word again, saying, Thus said
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006), and thus he answered me.  

<span id="031">31</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said unto
him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou
mayest take away the innocent [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), which
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) shed, from me, and from the house of my
father.  

<span id="032">32</span> And the LORD shall return his
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) upon his own head, who fell upon two men
more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), my father [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
not knowing thereof, to wit, [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) the son of
[Ner](../ebd/ebd270.htm#007), captain of the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and
[Amasa](../ebd/ebd019.htm#003) the son of
[Jether](../ebd/ebd205.htm#007), captain of the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="033">33</span> Their [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) shall
therefore return upon the head of [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006), and
upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and upon his seed, and upon his house,
and upon his [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001), shall there be peace for
ever from the LORD.  

<span id="034">34</span> So [Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003) the son of
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009) went up, and fell upon him, and slew
him: and he was buried in his own house in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005).  

<span id="035">35</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) put
[Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003) the son of
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009) in his room over the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007): and [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) did the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
put in the room of [Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005).  

<span id="036">36</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) sent and
called for [Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002), and said unto him, Build
thee an house in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and dwell there,
and go not forth thence any whither.  

<span id="037">37</span> For it shall be, that on the day thou goest
out, and passest over the [brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006)
[Kidron](../ebd/ebd218.htm#008), thou shalt know for certain that thou
shalt surely die: thy [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) shall be upon thine
own head.  

<span id="038">38</span> And [Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002) said unto
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), The saying is good: as my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) hath said, so will thy servant do. And
[Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002) dwelt in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) many days.  

<span id="039">39</span> And it came to pass at the end of three years,
that two of the servants of [Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002) ran away
unto [Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008) son of
[Maachah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#004) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009). And they told
[Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002), saying, Behold, thy servants be in
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009).  

<span id="040">40</span> And [Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002) arose, and
saddled his [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001), and went to
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009) to [Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008) to seek
his servants: and [Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002) went, and brought his
servants from [Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009).  

<span id="041">41</span> And it was told
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) that [Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002)
had gone from [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) to
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009), and was come again.  

<span id="042">42</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) sent and
called for [Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002), and said unto him, Did I not
make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know
for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any
whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word
that I have heard is good.  

<span id="043">43</span> Why then hast thou not kept the
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) of the LORD, and the commandment that I
have charged thee with?  

<span id="044">44</span> The [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said moreover
to [Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002), Thou knowest all the wickedness
which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) my father: therefore the LORD shall
return thy wickedness upon thine own head;  

<span id="045">45</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) shall be blessed, and the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) shall
be established before the LORD for ever.  

<span id="046">46</span> So the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) commanded
[Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003) the son of
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009); which went out, and fell upon him,
that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007).
