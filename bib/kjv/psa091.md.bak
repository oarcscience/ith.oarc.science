### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 91

<span id="001">1</span> He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most
High shall abide under the [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) of the
Almighty.  

<span id="002">2</span> I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my
fortress: my God; in him will I trust.  

<span id="003">3</span> Surely he shall deliver thee from the
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009) of the [fowler](../ebd/ebd138.htm#002.md),
and from the noisome pestilence.  

<span id="004">4</span> He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under
his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001) and [buckler](../ebd/ebd066.htm#000.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by
night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;  

<span id="006">6</span> Nor for the pestilence that walketh in
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md); nor for the
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md) that wasteth at noonday.  

<span id="007">7</span> A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten
thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see
the reward of the wicked.  

<span id="009">9</span> Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my
refuge, even the most High, thy [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md);  

<span id="010">10</span> There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall
any [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) come nigh thy dwelling.  

<span id="011">11</span> For he shall give his angels charge over thee,
to keep thee in all thy ways.  

<span id="012">12</span> They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest
thou dash thy foot against a [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou shalt tread upon the lion and
[adder](../ebd/ebd008.htm#005.md): the young lion and the
[dragon](../ebd/ebd107.htm#000.md) shalt thou trample under feet.  

<span id="014">14</span> Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore
will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my
name.  

<span id="015">15</span> He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I
will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.  

<span id="016">16</span> With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him
my [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md).
