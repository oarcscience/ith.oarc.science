### King James Version: Mark Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you,
That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of
death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.  

<span id="002">2</span> And after six days
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) taketh with him
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002), and [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md), and
John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and
he was transfigured before them.  

<span id="003">3</span> And his raiment became shining, exceeding white
as [snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000.md); so as no
[fuller](../ebd/ebd139.htm#004.md) on earth can white them.  

<span id="004">4</span> And there appeared unto them
[Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002) with [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md): and
they were talking with [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) answered and
said to [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), Master, it is good for us to be
here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), and one for
[Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> For he wist not what to say; for they were sore
afraid.  

<span id="007">7</span> And there was a [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md)
that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md), saying, This is my beloved Son: hear
him.  

<span id="008">8</span> And suddenly, when they had looked round about,
they saw no man any more, save [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) only with
themselves.  

<span id="009">9</span> And as they came down from the mountain, he
charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen,
till the Son of man were risen from the dead.  

<span id="010">10</span> And they kept that saying with themselves,
questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should
mean.  

<span id="011">11</span> And they asked him, saying, Why say the
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) that [Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002.md)
must first come?  

<span id="012">12</span> And he answered and told them,
[Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002.md) verily cometh first, and restoreth all
things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer
many things, and be set at nought.  

<span id="013">13</span> But I say unto you, That
[Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002.md) is indeed come, and they have done unto
him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when he came to his disciples, he saw a
great multitude about them, and the [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md)
questioning with them.  

<span id="015">15</span> And straightway all the people, when they
beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he asked the
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md), What question ye with them?  

<span id="017">17</span> And one of the multitude answered and said,
Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a
[dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002) [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md);  

<span id="018">18</span> And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him:
and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I
spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could
not.  

<span id="019">19</span> He answereth him, and saith, O faithless
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md), how long shall I be with you? how
long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.  

<span id="020">20</span> And they brought him unto him: and when he saw
him, straightway the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) tare him; and he
fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.  

<span id="021">21</span> And he asked his father, How long is it ago
since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child.  

<span id="022">22</span> And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire,
and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing,
have compassion on us, and help us.  

<span id="023">23</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto him,
If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.  

<span id="024">24</span> And straightway the father of the child cried
out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.  

<span id="025">25</span> When [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saw that
the people came running together, he rebuked the foul
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), saying unto him, Thou
[dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002) and deaf [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md),
I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.  

<span id="026">26</span> And the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) cried,
and [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) him sore, and came out of him: and he
was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.  

<span id="027">27</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) took him by
the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.  

<span id="028">28</span> And when he was come into the house, his
disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?  

<span id="029">29</span> And he said unto them, This kind can come forth
by nothing, but by [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) and fasting.  

<span id="030">30</span> And they departed thence, and passed through
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md); and he would not that any man should
know it.  

<span id="031">31</span> For he taught his disciples, and said unto
them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall
kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.  

<span id="032">32</span> But they understood not that saying, and were
afraid to ask him.  

<span id="033">33</span> And he came to
[Capernaum](../ebd/ebd071.htm#007.md): and being in the house he asked
them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?  

<span id="034">34</span> But they held their peace: for by the way they
had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.  

<span id="035">35</span> And he sat down, and called the twelve, and
saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last
of all, and servant of all.  

<span id="036">36</span> And he took a child, and set him in the midst
of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,  

<span id="037">37</span> Whosoever shall receive one of such children in
my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me,
but him that sent me.  

<span id="038">38</span> And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw
one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we
forbad him, because he followeth not us.  

<span id="039">39</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said, Forbid
him not: for there is no man which shall do a
[miracle](../ebd/ebd256.htm#002.md) in my name, that can lightly speak evil
of me.  

<span id="040">40</span> For he that is not against us is on our part.  

<span id="041">41</span> For whosoever shall give you a
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) of water to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md)
in my name, because ye belong to [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), verily
I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.  

<span id="042">42</span> And whosoever shall offend one of these little
ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were
hanged about his [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md), and he were cast into
the sea.  

<span id="043">43</span> And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is
better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go
into [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md), into the fire that never shall be
quenched:  

<span id="044">44</span> Where their [worm](../ebd/ebd384.htm#000.md) dieth
not, and the fire is not quenched.  

<span id="045">45</span> And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is
better for thee to enter [halt](../ebd/ebd160.htm#002.md) into life, than
having two feet to be cast into [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md), into the
fire that never shall be quenched:  

<span id="046">46</span> Where their [worm](../ebd/ebd384.htm#000.md) dieth
not, and the fire is not quenched.  

<span id="047">47</span> And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it
is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than
having two eyes to be cast into [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md) fire:  

<span id="048">48</span> Where their [worm](../ebd/ebd384.htm#000.md) dieth
not, and the fire is not quenched.  

<span id="049">49</span> For every one shall be salted with fire, and
every [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) shall be salted with
[salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008.md).  

<span id="050">50</span> [Salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008.md) is good: but if
the [salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008.md) have lost his saltness, wherewith will
ye season it? Have [salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008.md) in yourselves, and have
peace one with another.
