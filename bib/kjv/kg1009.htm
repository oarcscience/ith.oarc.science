</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;That the LORD appeared to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> the second time, as he had appeared unto him at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And if thou wilt walk before me, as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:<BR>
</P>

<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> them:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then will I cut off <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> shall be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#002">proverb</A> and a byword among all people:<BR>
