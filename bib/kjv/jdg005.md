### King James Version: Judges Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Then sang [Deborah](../ebd/ebd099.htm#008) and
[Barak](../ebd/ebd044.htm#005) the son of
[Abinoam](../ebd/ebd004.htm#002) on that day, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), when the people willingly offered
themselves.  

<span id="003">3</span> Hear, O ye kings; give
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004), O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto
the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="004">4</span> LORD, when thou wentest out of
[Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004), when thou marchedst out of the field of
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001), the earth trembled, and the heavens
dropped, the clouds also dropped water.  

<span id="005">5</span> The mountains melted from before the LORD, even
that [Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009) from before the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="006">6</span> In the days of [Shamgar](../ebd/ebd331.htm#000)
the son of [Anath](../ebd/ebd023.htm#002), in the days of
[Jael](../ebd/ebd195.htm#001), the highways were unoccupied, and the
travellers walked through byways.  

<span id="007">7</span> The inhabitants of the
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003) ceased, they ceased in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), until that I
[Deborah](../ebd/ebd099.htm#008) arose, that I arose a mother in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="008">8</span> They chose new gods; then was war in the gates:
was there a [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001) or spear seen among forty
thousand in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)?  

<span id="009">9</span> My heart is toward the governors of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that offered themselves willingly among
the people. [Bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) ye the LORD.  

<span id="010">10</span> Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit
in judgment, and walk by the way.  

<span id="011">11</span> They that are delivered from the noise of
archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the
righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the
inhabitants of his [villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003) in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): then shall the people of the LORD go
down to the gates.  

<span id="012">12</span> Awake, awake, [Deborah](../ebd/ebd099.htm#008):
awake, awake, utter a song: arise, [Barak](../ebd/ebd044.htm#005), and
lead thy [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002)
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001), thou son of
[Abinoam](../ebd/ebd004.htm#002).  

<span id="013">13</span> Then he made him that remaineth have dominion
over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over
the mighty.  

<span id="014">14</span> Out of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) was
there a root of them against [Amalek](../ebd/ebd018.htm#009); after
thee, [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008), among thy people; out of
[Machir](../ebd/ebd235.htm#006) came down governors, and out of
[Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003) they that handle the pen of the
writer.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the princes of
[Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002) were with
[Deborah](../ebd/ebd099.htm#008); even
[Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002), and also
[Barak](../ebd/ebd044.htm#005): he was sent on foot into the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008). For the divisions of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009) there were great thoughts of heart.  

<span id="016">16</span> Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear
the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009) there were great searchings of heart.  

<span id="017">17</span> [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009) abode beyond
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004): and why did
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009) remain in [ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003)?
[Asher](../ebd/ebd033.htm#008) continued on the sea shore, and abode in
his breaches.  

<span id="018">18</span> [Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003) and
[Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006) were a people that jeoparded their
lives unto the death in the high places of the field.  

<span id="019">19</span> The kings came and fought, then fought the
kings of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005) in
[Taanach](../ebd/ebd355.htm#005) by the waters of
[Megiddo](../ebd/ebd246.htm#004); they took no gain of money.  

<span id="020">20</span> They fought from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006); the [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008) in
their [courses](../ebd/ebd091.htm#006) fought against
[Sisera](../ebd/ebd345.htm#007).  

<span id="021">21</span> The river of [Kishon](../ebd/ebd220.htm#009)
swept them away, that ancient river, the river
[Kishon](../ebd/ebd220.htm#009). O my soul, thou hast trodden down
strength.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of
the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.  

<span id="023">23</span> [Curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) ye
[Meroz](../ebd/ebd250.htm#005), said the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001)
of the LORD, [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) ye bitterly the inhabitants
thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of
the LORD against the mighty.  

<span id="024">24</span> Blessed above women shall
[Jael](../ebd/ebd195.htm#001) the wife of [Heber](../ebd/ebd170.htm#008)
the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009).  

<span id="025">25</span> He asked water, and she gave him
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000); she brought forth
[butter](../ebd/ebd067.htm#002) in a lordly
[dish](../ebd/ebd104.htm#004).  

<span id="026">26</span> She put her hand to the
[nail](../ebd/ebd266.htm#000), and her right hand to the workmen's
[hammer](../ebd/ebd161.htm#000); and with the
[hammer](../ebd/ebd161.htm#000) she smote
[Sisera](../ebd/ebd345.htm#007), she smote off his head, when she had
pierced and stricken through his temples.  

<span id="027">27</span> At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at
her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.  

<span id="028">28</span> The mother of [Sisera](../ebd/ebd345.htm#007)
looked out at a window, and cried through the
[lattice](../ebd/ebd224.htm#008), Why is his
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) so long in coming? why tarry the wheels
of his chariots?  

<span id="029">29</span> Her [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) ladies
answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,  

<span id="030">30</span> Have they not sped? have they not divided the
prey; to every man a damsel or two; to [Sisera](../ebd/ebd345.htm#007) a
prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of
divers colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them
that take the spoil?  

<span id="031">31</span> So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but
let them that love him be as the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) when he
goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.
