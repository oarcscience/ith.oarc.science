</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;God came from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#001">Teman</A>, and the Holy One from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#006">Paran</A>. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#008">Selah</A>. His <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A>: his ways are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;I saw the tents of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#006">Cushan</A> in affliction: and the curtains of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</A> did tremble.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> was made quite <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A>, according to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#008">Selah</A>. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A> uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</A> stood still in their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A>: at the light of thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</A> they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Thou wentest forth for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> of thy people, even for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#008">Selah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</A>: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing was as to devour the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> secretly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A> of great waters.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;When I heard, my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A> trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Although the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</A> tree shall not blossom, neither shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> be in the vines; the labour of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</A> shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#007">fold</A>, and there shall be no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#009">herd</A> in the stalls:<BR>

<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.<BR>
