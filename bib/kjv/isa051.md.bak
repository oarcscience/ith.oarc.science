### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 51

<span id="001">1</span> Hearken to me, ye that follow after
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), ye that seek the LORD: look unto
the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md) whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of
the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md) whence ye are digged.  

<span id="002">2</span> Look unto [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) your
father, and unto [Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md) that bare you: for I
called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.  

<span id="003">3</span> For the LORD shall comfort
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md): he will comfort all her waste places; and
he will make her [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) like
[Eden](../ebd/ebd112.htm#009), and her [desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000.md)
like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein,
thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.  

<span id="004">4</span> Hearken unto me, my people; and give
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) unto me, O my nation: for a law shall
proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the
people.  

<span id="005">5</span> My [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) is
near; my [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) is gone forth, and mine arms
shall [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) the people; the isles shall wait
upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust.  

<span id="006">6</span> Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon
the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the
earth shall [wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000.md) old like a garment, and they
that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) shall be for ever, and my
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) shall not be abolished.  

<span id="007">7</span> Hearken unto me, ye that know
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), the people in whose heart is my
law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their
revilings.  

<span id="008">8</span> For the [moth](../ebd/ebd260.htm#005.md) shall eat
them up like a garment, and the [worm](../ebd/ebd384.htm#000.md) shall eat
them like [wool](../ebd/ebd383.htm#005.md): but my
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) shall be for ever, and my
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) from
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) to
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the
LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou
not it that hath cut [Rahab](../ebd/ebd305.htm#006.md), and wounded the
[dragon](../ebd/ebd107.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="010">10</span> Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the
waters of the great [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md); that hath made the
depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?  

<span id="011">11</span> Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall
return, and come with singing unto [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md); and
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) joy shall be upon their head: they
shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee
away.  

<span id="012">12</span> I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art
thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the
son of man which shall be made as [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md);  

<span id="013">13</span> And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath
stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and
hast feared continually every day because of the
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md) of the oppressor, as if he were ready to
destroy? and where is the [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md) of the
oppressor?  

<span id="014">14</span> The [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001.md)
[exile](../ebd/ebd128.htm#004.md) hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that
he should not die in the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md), nor that his
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) should fail.  

<span id="015">15</span> But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the
sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.  

<span id="016">16</span> And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I
have covered thee in the [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) of mine hand,
that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and
say unto [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), Thou art my people.  

<span id="017">17</span> Awake, awake, stand up, O
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), which hast
[drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007.md) at the hand of the LORD the
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) of his [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md); thou
hast drunken the [dregs](../ebd/ebd107.htm#007.md) of the
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000.md) of trembling, and wrung them out.  

<span id="018">18</span> There is none to guide her among all the sons
whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the
hand of all the sons that she hath brought up.  

<span id="019">19</span> These two things are come unto thee; who shall
be sorry for thee? desolation, and [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md),
and the [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md), and the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md): by whom shall I comfort thee?  

<span id="020">20</span> Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of
all the streets, as a wild bull in a [net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002.md): they
are full of the [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md) of the LORD, the rebuke of
thy God.  

<span id="021">21</span> Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and
drunken, but not with [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md):  

<span id="022">22</span> Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that
pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand
the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000.md) of trembling, even the
[dregs](../ebd/ebd107.htm#007) of the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000.md) of my
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md); thou shalt no more
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) it again:  

<span id="023">23</span> But I will put it into the hand of them that
afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, [Bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md)
down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground,
and as the street, to them that went over.
