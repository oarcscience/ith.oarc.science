### King James Version: John Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> When [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) had spoken
these words, he went forth with his disciples over the
[brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006) [Cedron](../ebd/ebd074.htm#008.md), where
was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001.md) also, which
betrayed him, knew the place: for [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.  

<span id="003">3</span> [Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001.md) then, having
received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md), cometh thither with lanterns and
[torches](../ebd/ebd370.htm#008.md) and weapons.  

<span id="004">4</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) therefore,
knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto
them, Whom seek ye?  

<span id="005">5</span> They answered him,
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) of [Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007.md).
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saith unto them, I am he. And
[Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001.md) also, which betrayed him, stood with
them.  

<span id="006">6</span> As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he,
they went backward, and fell to the ground.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they
said, [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) of
[Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered, I have
told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their
way:  

<span id="009">9</span> That the saying might be fulfilled, which he
spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md)
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) having a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md)
drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md). The servant's name was
[Malchus](../ebd/ebd239.htm#003.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Then said [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) unto
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md), Put up thy
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) into the sheath: the
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000.md) which my Father hath given me, shall I not
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) it?  

<span id="012">12</span> Then the band and the captain and officers of
the Jews took [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), and bound him,  

<span id="013">13</span> And led him away to
[Annas](../ebd/ebd024.htm#007.md) first; for he was father in law to
[Caiaphas](../ebd/ebd068.htm#006.md), which was the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) that same year.  

<span id="014">14</span> Now [Caiaphas](../ebd/ebd068.htm#006.md) was he,
which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man
should die for the people.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md)
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) followed [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md),
and so did another [disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003.md): that
[disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003.md) was known unto the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), and went in with
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) into the [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md)
of the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> But [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) stood at the
door without. Then went out that other
[disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003.md), which was known unto the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), and spake unto her that kept the door,
and brought in [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md), Art not thou also one of this man's
disciples? He saith, I am not.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the servants and officers stood there, who
had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves:
and [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) stood with them, and warmed
himself.  

<span id="019">19</span> The high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) then
asked [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) of his disciples, and of his
doctrine.  

<span id="020">20</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered him, I
spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009.md), and in the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), whither the Jews always resort; and in
secret have I said nothing.  

<span id="021">21</span> Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me,
what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.  

<span id="022">22</span> And when he had thus spoken, one of the
officers which stood by struck [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) with the
palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) so?  

<span id="023">23</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered him, If
I have spoken evil, bear [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) of the evil:
but if well, why smitest thou me?  

<span id="024">24</span> Now [Annas](../ebd/ebd024.htm#007.md) had sent him
bound unto [Caiaphas](../ebd/ebd068.htm#006.md) the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md)
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) stood and warmed himself. They said
therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied
it, and said, I am not.  

<span id="026">26</span> One of the servants of the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), being his
[kinsman](../ebd/ebd219.htm#006) whose [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md)
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the
garden with him?  

<span id="027">27</span> [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) then denied
again: and immediately the cock crew.  

<span id="028">28</span> Then led they [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
from [Caiaphas](../ebd/ebd068.htm#006.md) unto the hall of judgment: and it
was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest
they should be defiled; but that they might eat the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What
accusation bring ye against this man?  

<span id="030">30</span> They answered and said unto him, If he were not
a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.  

<span id="031">31</span> Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) him according to your law. The Jews
therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to
death:  

<span id="032">32</span> That the saying of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) might be fulfilled, which he spake,
signifying what death he should die.  

<span id="033">33</span> Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall
again, and called [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), and said unto him, Art
thou the [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of the Jews?  

<span id="034">34</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered him,
Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?  

<span id="035">35</span> Pilate answered, Am I a
[Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004.md)? Thine own nation and the chief priests
have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?  

<span id="036">36</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered, My
kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then
would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but
now is my kingdom not from hence.  

<span id="037">37</span> Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) then? [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
answered, Thou sayest that I am a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md). To this
end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should
bear [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) unto the truth. Every one that is
of the truth heareth my voice.  

<span id="038">38</span> Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when
he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them,
I find in him no fault at all.  

<span id="039">39</span> But ye have a [custom](../ebd/ebd094.htm#008.md),
that I should release unto you one at the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md): will ye therefore that I release unto
you the [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of the Jews?  

<span id="040">40</span> Then cried they all again, saying, Not this
man, but [Barabbas](../ebd/ebd044.htm#002.md). Now
[Barabbas](../ebd/ebd044.htm#002.md) was a robber.
