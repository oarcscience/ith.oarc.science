</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For I could wish that myself were accursed from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#000">adoption</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, which are of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Neither, because they are the seed of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, are they all children: but, In <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> shall thy seed be called.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;That is, They which are the children of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</A> shall have a son.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;It was said unto her, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#008">elder</A> shall serve the younger.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;As it is written, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> have I loved, but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> have I hated.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For he saith to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, I will have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> on whom I will have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A> saith unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Therefore hath he <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> on whom he will have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>, and whom he will he hardeneth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Hath not the potter power over the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A>, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And that he might make known the riches of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> on the vessels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>, which he had afore prepared unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</A> also crieth concerning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, Though the number of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;For he will finish the work, and cut it short in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</A> said before, Except the Lord of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#002">Sabaoth</A> had left us a seed, we had been as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#005">Sodoma</A>, and been made like unto Gomorrha.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;What shall we say then? That the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, which followed not after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, have attained to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, even the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> which is of faith.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, which followed after the law of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, hath not attained to the law of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;As it is written, Behold, I lay in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#003">Sion</A> a stumblingstone and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.<BR>
