### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 148

<span id="001">1</span> Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the
heavens: praise him in the heights.  

<span id="002">2</span> Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him,
all his hosts.  

<span id="003">3</span> Praise ye him, [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) and
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004.md): praise him, all ye
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md) of light.  

<span id="004">4</span> Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters
that be above the heavens.  

<span id="005">5</span> Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he
commanded, and they were created.  

<span id="006">6</span> He hath also stablished them for ever and ever:
he hath made a decree which shall not pass.  

<span id="007">7</span> Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and
all deeps:  

<span id="008">8</span> Fire, and [hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002.md);
[snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000.md), and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his
word:  

<span id="009">9</span> Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and
all cedars:  

<span id="010">10</span> Beasts, and all
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md); creeping things, and flying fowl:  

<span id="011">11</span> Kings of the earth, and all people; princes,
and all judges of the earth:  

<span id="012">12</span> Both young men, and maidens; old men, and
children:  

<span id="013">13</span> Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his
name alone is excellent; his [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) is above the
earth and [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> He also exalteth the
[horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003.md) of his people, the praise of all his
saints; even of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), a
people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD.
