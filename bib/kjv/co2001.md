### King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md), an
[apostle](../ebd/ebd026.htm#008) of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) by the will of God, and
[Timothy](../ebd/ebd367.htm#002.md) our brother, unto the church of God
which is at [Corinth](../ebd/ebd090.htm#002.md), with all the saints which
are in all [Achaia](../ebd/ebd006.htm#004.md):  

<span id="002">2</span> [Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) be to you and
peace from God our Father, and from the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), the
Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;  

<span id="004">4</span> Who comforteth us in all our
[tribulation](../ebd/ebd372.htm#005.md), that we may be able to comfort
them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are
comforted of God.  

<span id="005">5</span> For as the sufferings of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) abound in us, so our consolation also
aboundeth by [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And whether we be afflicted, it is for your
consolation and [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md), which is effectual
in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether
we be comforted, it is for your consolation and
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that
as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the
consolation.  

<span id="008">8</span> For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of
our trouble which came to us in [Asia](../ebd/ebd034.htm#008.md), that we
were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired
even of life:  

<span id="009">9</span> But we had the sentence of death in ourselves,
that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the
dead:  

<span id="010">10</span> Who delivered us from so great a death, and
doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;  

<span id="011">11</span> Ye also helping together by
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) for us, that for the
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005.md) bestowed upon us by the means of many
persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.  

<span id="012">12</span> For our rejoicing is this, the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md) of our
[conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006.md), that in simplicity and godly
sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of God, we have had our
[conversation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#001.md) in the world, and more abundantly
to you-ward.  

<span id="013">13</span> For we write none other things unto you, than
what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to
the end;  

<span id="014">14</span> As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that
we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And in this confidence I was minded to come
unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;  

<span id="016">16</span> And to pass by you into
[Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003.md), and to come again out of
[Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003.md) unto you, and of you to be brought on
my way toward Judaea.  

<span id="017">17</span> When I therefore was thus minded, did I use
lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), that with me there should be yea yea,
and nay nay?  

<span id="018">18</span> But as God is true, our word toward you was not
yea and nay.  

<span id="019">19</span> For the Son of God,
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), who was
preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and
[Timotheus](../ebd/ebd367.htm#001.md), was not yea and nay, but in him was
yea.  

<span id="020">20</span> For all the promises of God in him are yea, and
in him [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md), unto the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of God by us.  

<span id="021">21</span> Now he which stablisheth us with you in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), and hath anointed us, is God;  

<span id="022">22</span> Who hath also sealed us, and given the
[earnest](../ebd/ebd110.htm#006) of the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md)
in our hearts.  

<span id="023">23</span> Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul,
that to spare you I came not as yet unto
[Corinth](../ebd/ebd090.htm#002.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> Not for that we have dominion over your faith,
but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.
