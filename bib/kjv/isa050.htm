<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 50</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you?  Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>: their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</A> stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for thirst.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</A> their covering.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> to hear as the learned.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;The Lord GOD hath opened mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#009">flint</A>, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who is mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</A>? let him come near to me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn me?  lo, they all shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd380.htm#000">wax</A> old as a garment; the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#005">moth</A> shall eat them up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.<BR>
