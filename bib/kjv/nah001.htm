The book of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd265.htm#008">Nahum</A> the Elkoshite.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;The LORD is slow to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> of his feet.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#003">Bashan</A> languisheth, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#006">Carmel</A>, and the flower of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</A> languisheth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>? his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A> is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But with an overrunning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</A> he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> shall pursue his enemies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the LORD, a wicked <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#005">counsellor</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For now will I break his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A>; for thou art vile.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</A>: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.<BR>
