### King James Version: Job Chapter 29

<span id="001">1</span> Moreover Job continued his
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md), and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days
when God preserved me;  

<span id="003">3</span> When his [candle](../ebd/ebd071.htm#000.md) shined
upon my head, and when by his light I walked through
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md);  

<span id="004">4</span> As I was in the days of my youth, when the
secret of God was upon my [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md);  

<span id="005">5</span> When the Almighty was yet with me, when my
children were about me;  

<span id="006">6</span> When I washed my steps with
[butter](../ebd/ebd067.htm#002), and the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md)
poured me out rivers of oil;  

<span id="007">7</span> When I went out to the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) through the city, when I prepared my seat
in the street!  

<span id="008">8</span> The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and
the aged arose, and stood up.  

<span id="009">9</span> The princes refrained talking, and laid their
hand on their mouth.  

<span id="010">10</span> The nobles held their peace, and their tongue
cleaved to the roof of their mouth.  

<span id="011">11</span> When the [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) heard me,
then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) to me:  

<span id="012">12</span> Because I delivered the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) that cried, and the fatherless, and him
that had none to help him.  

<span id="013">13</span> The blessing of him that was ready to perish
came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.  

<span id="014">14</span> I put on
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), and it clothed me: my judgment
was as a robe and a [diadem](../ebd/ebd102.htm#009.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> I was eyes to the
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md), and feet was I to the lame.  

<span id="016">16</span> I was a father to the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md): and the cause which I knew not I searched
out.  

<span id="017">17</span> And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked
the spoil out of his teeth.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I
shall multiply my days as the sand.  

<span id="019">19</span> My root was spread out by the waters, and the
[dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md) lay all night upon my
[branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> My [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) was fresh in
me, and my [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) was renewed in my hand.  

<span id="021">21</span> Unto me men gave [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md),
and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.  

<span id="022">22</span> After my words they spake not again; and my
speech dropped upon them.  

<span id="023">23</span> And they waited for me as for the
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md); and they opened their mouth wide as for
the latter [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and
the light of my countenance they cast not down.  

<span id="025">25</span> I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt
as a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) in the army, as one that comforteth
the mourners.
