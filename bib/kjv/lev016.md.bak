### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) after the death of the two sons of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), when they offered before the LORD, and
died;  

<span id="002">2</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Speak unto
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) thy brother, that he come not at all
times into the holy place within the vail before the
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) seat, which is upon the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md); that he die not: for I will appear in the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) upon the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md)
seat.  

<span id="003">3</span> Thus shall [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) come
into the holy place: with a young [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md) for a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and a
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md) for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> He shall put on the holy
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008) [coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004.md), and he
shall have the [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md)
[breeches](../ebd/ebd064.htm#008.md) upon his
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), and shall be girded with a
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008) [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md), and with
the [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008) [mitre](../ebd/ebd257.htm#006.md) shall
he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) in water, and so put them on.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he shall take of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) two kids of the goats for a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and one
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md) for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) shall offer
his [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) of the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), which is for himself, and make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for himself, and for his house.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he shall take the two goats, and present
them before the LORD at the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) shall cast
lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the
[scapegoat](../ebd/ebd323.htm#004.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) shall bring
the [goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001.md) upon which the LORD's lot fell, and
offer him for a [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> But the [goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001.md), on which
the lot fell to be the [scapegoat](../ebd/ebd323.htm#004.md), shall be
presented alive before the LORD, to make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) with him, and to let him go for a
[scapegoat](../ebd/ebd323.htm#004.md) into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) shall bring
the [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) of the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), which is for himself, and shall make
an [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for himself, and for his house,
and shall kill the [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md) of the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) which is
for himself:  

<span id="012">12</span> And he shall take a
[censer](../ebd/ebd075.htm#002.md) full of burning coals of fire from off
the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) before the LORD, and his hands full
of sweet [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) beaten small, and bring it
within the vail:  

<span id="013">13</span> And he shall put the
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) upon the fire before the LORD, that the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) of the [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md)
may cover the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) seat that is upon the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md), that he die not:  

<span id="014">14</span> And he shall take of the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md),
and sprinkle it with his finger upon the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md)
seat eastward; and before the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) seat shall
he sprinkle of the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) with his finger
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then shall he kill the
[goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001) of the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), that is for the people, and bring his
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) within the vail, and do with that
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) as he did with the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md),
and sprinkle it upon the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) seat, and before
the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) seat:  

<span id="016">16</span> And he shall make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for the holy place, because of the
uncleanness of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and
because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do
for the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), that remaineth among them in the
midst of their uncleanness.  

<span id="017">17</span> And there shall be no man in the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) when he goeth in to make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) in the holy place, until he come out,
and have made an [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for himself, and for
his household, and for all the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And he shall go out unto the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) that is before the LORD, and make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for it; and shall take of the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md),
and of the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of the
[goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001.md), and put it upon the horns of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) round about.  

<span id="019">19</span> And he shall sprinkle of the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) upon it with his finger
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times, and cleanse it, and
[hallow](../ebd/ebd160.htm#001.md) it from the uncleanness of the children
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And when he hath made an end of reconciling the
holy place, and the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), and the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), he shall bring the live
[goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001.md):  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) shall lay
both his hands upon the head of the live [goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001.md),
and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and all their transgressions in all
their sins, putting them upon the head of the
[goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001.md), and shall send him away by the hand of a
fit man into the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md):  

<span id="022">22</span> And the [goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001.md) shall
bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he
shall let go the [goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001.md) in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) shall come
into the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), and shall put off the
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md) garments, which he put on when he went
into the holy place, and shall leave them there:  

<span id="024">24</span> And he shall wash his
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) with water in the holy place, and put on
his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) of the people, and make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for himself, and for the people.  

<span id="025">25</span> And the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) of the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) shall he
burn upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And he that let go the
[goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001) for the [scapegoat](../ebd/ebd323.htm#004.md)
shall wash his clothes, and bathe his [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) in
water, and afterward come into the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And the [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md) for
the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and
the [goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001) for the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), whose [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md)
was brought in to make [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) in the holy
place, shall one carry forth without the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md);
and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), and their
[dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> And he that burneth them shall wash his
clothes, and bathe his [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) in water, and
afterward he shall come into the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> And this shall be a statute for ever unto you:
that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall
afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own
country, or a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) that sojourneth among
you:  

<span id="030">30</span> For on that day shall the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for you, to cleanse you, that ye may
be [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) from all your sins before the LORD.  

<span id="031">31</span> It shall be a [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md)
of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls, by a statute for
ever.  

<span id="032">32</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), whom
he shall [anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008.md), and whom he shall consecrate
to [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) in the priest's office in his
father's stead, shall make the [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md), and
shall put on the [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md) clothes, even the holy
garments:  

<span id="033">33</span> And he shall make an

[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), and he shall make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for the priests, and for all the
people of the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md).  

<span id="034">34</span> And this shall be an
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) statute unto you, to make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) for all their sins once a year. And he
did as the LORD commanded [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).
