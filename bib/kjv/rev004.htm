<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And immediately I was in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>: and, behold, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> was set in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and one sat on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And he that sat was to look upon like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#003">jasper</A> and a sardine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>: and there was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#009">rainbow</A> round about the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, in sight like unto an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd119.htm#007">emerald</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And round about the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A>, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> lamps of fire burning before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, which are the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> Spirits of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> there was a sea of glass like unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#005">crystal</A>: and in the midst of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, and round about the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the first <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> was like a lion, and the second <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</A>, and the third <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> had a face as a man, and the fourth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> was like a flying <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And when those beasts give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> and honour and thanks to him that sat on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, who liveth for ever and ever,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.<BR>
