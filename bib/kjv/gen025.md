### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 25

<span id="001">1</span> Then again [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) took
a wife, and her name was [Keturah](../ebd/ebd218.htm#001.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And she bare him
[Zimran](../ebd/ebd393.htm#008), and [Jokshan](../ebd/ebd210.htm#003.md),
and [Medan](../ebd/ebd245.htm#008), and [Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md),
and [Ishbak](../ebd/ebd190.htm#001.md), and
[Shuah](../ebd/ebd341.htm#006.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Jokshan](../ebd/ebd210.htm#003.md) begat
[Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006), and [Dedan](../ebd/ebd100.htm#005.md). And
the sons of [Dedan](../ebd/ebd100.htm#005.md) were Asshurim, and Letushim,
and [Leummim](../ebd/ebd227.htm#005.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And the sons of [Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md);
[Ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003), and [Epher](../ebd/ebd122.htm#004.md), and
Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of
[Keturah](../ebd/ebd218.htm#001.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) gave all
that he had unto [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> But unto the sons of the concubines, which
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) had, [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md)
gave gifts, and sent them away from [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) his
son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) country.  

<span id="007">7</span> And these are the days of the years of Abraham's
life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) gave up
the [ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md), and died in a good old age, an old
man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.  

<span id="009">9</span> And his sons [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) and
[Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md) buried him in the
[cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006) of [Machpelah](../ebd/ebd235.htm#007.md), in
the field of [Ephron](../ebd/ebd123.htm#008.md) the son of
[Zohar](../ebd/ebd395.htm#006.md) the Hittite, which is before
[Mamre](../ebd/ebd239.htm#008.md);  

<span id="010">10</span> The field which
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) purchased of the sons of
[Heth](../ebd/ebd177.htm#001.md): there was
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) buried, and
[Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md) his wife.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it came to pass after the death of
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), that God blessed his son
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006); and [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) dwelt
by the well Lahairoi.  

<span id="012">12</span> Now these are the generations of
[Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md), Abraham's son, whom
[Hagar](../ebd/ebd158.htm#005.md) the Egyptian, Sarah's
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md), bare unto
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md):  

<span id="013">13</span> And these are the names of the sons of
[Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md), by their names, according to their
generations: the firstborn of [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md),
Nebajoth; and [Kedar](../ebd/ebd216.htm#003.md), and
[Adbeel](../ebd/ebd008.htm#003), and [Mibsam](../ebd/ebd252.htm#003.md),  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Mishma](../ebd/ebd257.htm#000.md), and
[Dumah](../ebd/ebd109.htm#001), and [Massa](../ebd/ebd243.htm#005.md),  

<span id="015">15</span> [Hadar](../ebd/ebd157.htm#003.md), and
[Tema](../ebd/ebd361.htm#000), [Jetur](../ebd/ebd206.htm#001.md),
[Naphish](../ebd/ebd266.htm#005.md), and
[Kedemah](../ebd/ebd216.htm#004.md):  

<span id="016">16</span> These are the sons of
[Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md), and these are their names, by their
towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their
nations.  

<span id="017">17</span> And these are the years of the life of
[Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md), an hundred and thirty and
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) years: and he gave up the
[ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md) and died; and was gathered unto his
people.  

<span id="018">18</span> And they dwelt from
[Havilah](../ebd/ebd167.htm#009) unto [Shur](../ebd/ebd342.htm#002.md),
that is before [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), as thou goest toward
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md): and he died in the presence of all his
brethren.  

<span id="019">19</span> And these are the generations of
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md), Abraham's son:
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) begat [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md):  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) was forty
years old when he took [Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md) to wife, the
daughter of [Bethuel](../ebd/ebd057.htm#003.md) the Syrian of Padanaram,
the sister to [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md) the Syrian.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) intreated
the LORD for his wife, because she was [barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007.md):
and the LORD was intreated of him, and [Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md)
his wife conceived.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the children struggled together within her;
and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the
LORD.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in
thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy
[bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004.md); and the one people shall be stronger
than the other people; and the [elder](../ebd/ebd114.htm#008.md) shall
serve the younger.  

<span id="024">24</span> And when her days to be delivered were
fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.  

<span id="025">25</span> And the first came out red, all over like an
hairy garment; and they called his name [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And after that came his brother out, and his
hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007): and [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) was
threescore years old when she bare them.  

<span id="027">27</span> And the boys grew: and
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) was a cunning hunter, a man of the field;
and [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) was a [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md)
man, dwelling in tents.  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) loved
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md), because he did eat of his venison: but
[Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001) loved [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) sod
[pottage](../ebd/ebd299.htm#005): and [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) came
from the field, and he was faint:  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) said to
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red
[pottage](../ebd/ebd299.htm#005.md); for I am faint: therefore was his name
called [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) said, Sell
me this day thy [birthright](../ebd/ebd059.htm#004.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> And [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) said, Behold,
I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this
[birthright](../ebd/ebd059.htm#004.md) do to me?  

<span id="033">33</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) said, Swear
to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his
[birthright](../ebd/ebd059.htm#004.md) unto
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md).  

<span id="034">34</span> Then [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) gave
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005) [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) and
[pottage](../ebd/ebd299.htm#005) of [lentiles](../ebd/ebd227.htm#001.md);
and he did eat and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), and rose up, and went
his way: thus [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) despised his
[birthright](../ebd/ebd059.htm#004.md).
