### King James Version: Acts Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> And the apostles and brethren that were in
Judaea heard that the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) had also
received the word of God.  

<span id="002">2</span> And when [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) was come
up to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), they that were of the
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007.md) contended with him,  

<span id="003">3</span> Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised,
and didst eat with them.  

<span id="004">4</span> But [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) rehearsed the
matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them,
saying,  

<span id="005">5</span> I was in the city of
[Joppa](../ebd/ebd211.htm#002.md) praying: and in a
[trance](../ebd/ebd371.htm#006) I saw a [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md),
A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) by four corners; and it came even to
me:  

<span id="006">6</span> Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I
considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and
creeping things, and fowls of the air.  

<span id="007">7</span> And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise,
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md); slay and eat.  

<span id="008">8</span> But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or
unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.  

<span id="009">9</span> But the voice answered me again from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), What God hath cleansed, that call not
thou common.  

<span id="010">10</span> And this was done three times: and all were
drawn up again into [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And, behold, immediately there were three men
already come unto the house where I was, sent from
[Caesarea](../ebd/ebd068.htm#003.md) unto me.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) bade me
go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied
me, and we entered into the man's house:  

<span id="013">13</span> And he shewed us how he had seen an
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) in his house, which stood and said unto
him, Send men to [Joppa](../ebd/ebd211.htm#002.md), and call for
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md), whose surname is
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md);  

<span id="014">14</span> Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all
thy house shall be saved.  

<span id="015">15</span> And as I began to speak, the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md) fell on them, as on us at the
beginning.  

<span id="016">16</span> Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how
that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized
with the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Forasmuch then as God gave them the like
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005.md) as he did unto us, who believed on the
Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md);
what was I, that I could withstand God?  

<span id="018">18</span> When they heard these things, they held their
peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) granted
[repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008.md) unto life.  

<span id="019">19</span> Now they which were scattered abroad upon the
[persecution](../ebd/ebd290.htm#007.md) that arose about
[Stephen](../ebd/ebd351.htm#002.md) travelled as far as
[Phenice](../ebd/ebd293.htm#001), and [Cyprus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#003.md),
and [Antioch](../ebd/ebd025.htm#001.md), preaching the word to none but
unto the Jews only.  

<span id="020">20</span> And some of them were men of
[Cyprus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#003) and [Cyrene](../ebd/ebd095.htm#004.md),
which, when they were come to [Antioch](../ebd/ebd025.htm#001.md), spake
unto the [Grecians](../ebd/ebd155.htm#002.md), preaching the LORD
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a
great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then tidings of these things came unto the ears
of the church which was in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): and they
sent forth [Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005.md), that he should go as far
as [Antioch](../ebd/ebd025.htm#001.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> Who, when he came, and had seen the
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of God, was glad, and exhorted them all,
that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.  

<span id="024">24</span> For he was a good man, and full of the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md) and of faith: and much people was added
unto the Lord.  

<span id="025">25</span> Then departed [Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005.md)
to [Tarsus](../ebd/ebd359.htm#003.md), for to seek
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md):  

<span id="026">26</span> And when he had found him, he brought him unto
[Antioch](../ebd/ebd025.htm#001.md). And it came to pass, that a whole year
they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And
the disciples were called Christians first in
[Antioch](../ebd/ebd025.htm#001.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And in these days came prophets from
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) unto
[Antioch](../ebd/ebd025.htm#001.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> And there stood up one of them named
[Agabus](../ebd/ebd011.htm#007.md), and signified by the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) that there should be great
[dearth](../ebd/ebd099.htm#005.md) throughout all the world: which came to
pass in the days of [Claudius](../ebd/ebd084.htm#003.md)
[Caesar](../ebd/ebd068.htm#002.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> Then the disciples, every man according to his
ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in
Judaea:  

<span id="030">30</span> Which also they did, and sent it to the elders
by the hands of [Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005.md) and
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md).
