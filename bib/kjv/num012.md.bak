### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> And [Miriam](../ebd/ebd256.htm#003.md) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) spake against
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) because of the Ethiopian woman whom he
had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.  

<span id="002">2</span> And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only
by [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md)? hath he not spoken also by us? And
the LORD heard it.  

<span id="003">3</span> (Now the man [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) was
very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.)  

<span id="004">4</span> And the LORD spake suddenly unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), and unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md),
and unto [Miriam](../ebd/ebd256.htm#003.md), Come out ye three unto the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md). And they three came out.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the LORD came down in the
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007) of the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md),
and stood in the door of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), and
called [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and
[Miriam](../ebd/ebd256.htm#003.md): and they both came forth.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) among you, I the LORD will make myself
known unto him in a [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md), and will speak unto
him in a [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> My servant [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) is not
so, who is [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md) in all mine house.  

<span id="008">8</span> With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even
apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD
shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my
servant [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md)?  

<span id="009">9</span> And the [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) of the
LORD was kindled against them; and he departed.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md) departed
from off the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md); and, behold,
[Miriam](../ebd/ebd256.htm#003.md) became leprous, white as
[snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000): and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) looked
upon [Miriam](../ebd/ebd256.htm#003.md), and, behold, she was leprous.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not
the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) upon us, wherein we have done
foolishly, and wherein we have sinned.  

<span id="012">12</span> Let her not be as one dead, of whom the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) is half consumed when he cometh out of
his mother's womb.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) cried unto
the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), If her father had but spit in her face,
should she not be ashamed [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days? let her
be shut out from the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md)
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days, and after that let her be received
in again.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Miriam](../ebd/ebd256.htm#003.md) was shut
out from the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md)
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days: and the people journeyed not till
[Miriam](../ebd/ebd256.htm#003.md) was brought in again.  

<span id="016">16</span> And afterward the people removed from
[Hazeroth](../ebd/ebd169.htm#003.md), and pitched in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Paran](../ebd/ebd284.htm#006.md).
