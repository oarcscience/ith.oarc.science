### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 41

<span id="001">1</span> Blessed is he that considereth the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md): the LORD will deliver him in time of
trouble.  

<span id="002">2</span> The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive;
and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him
unto the will of his enemies.  

<span id="003">3</span> The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of
languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.  

<span id="004">4</span> I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul;
for I have sinned against thee.  

<span id="005">5</span> Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he
die, and his name perish?  

<span id="006">6</span> And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity:
his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth
it.  

<span id="007">7</span> All that hate me whisper together against me:
against me do they devise my hurt.  

<span id="008">8</span> An evil disease, say they, cleaveth
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) unto him: and now that he lieth he shall
rise up no more.  

<span id="009">9</span> Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I
trusted, which did eat of my [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), hath lifted
up his heel against me.  

<span id="010">10</span> But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and
raise me up, that I may requite them.  

<span id="011">11</span> By this I know that thou favourest me, because
mine enemy doth not triumph over me.  

<span id="012">12</span> And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine
integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.  

<span id="013">13</span> Blessed be the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) from
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md), and to
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007). [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md), and
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).
