### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 40

<span id="001">1</span> Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your
God.  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak ye comfortably to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and cry unto her, that her warfare
is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of
the LORD's hand double for all her sins.  

<span id="003">3</span> The voice of him that crieth in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), Prepare ye the way of the LORD,
make straight in the [desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000.md) a
[highway](../ebd/ebd178.htm#005.md) for our God.  

<span id="004">4</span> Every [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) shall be
exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked
shall be made straight, and the rough places
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md):  

<span id="005">5</span> And the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the
LORD shall be revealed, and all [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) shall see
it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.  

<span id="006">6</span> The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I
cry? All [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) is
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md), and all the goodliness thereof is as the
flower of the field:  

<span id="007">7</span> The [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md) withereth,
the flower fadeth: because the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the
LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> The [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md) withereth,
the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.  

<span id="009">9</span> O [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), that bringest
good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), that bringest good tidings, lift up
thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), Behold your God!  

<span id="010">10</span> Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong
hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him,
and his work before him.  

<span id="011">11</span> He shall feed his flock like a
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006.md): he shall gather the lambs with his
arm, and carry them in his [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md), and shall
gently lead those that are with young.  

<span id="012">12</span> Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of
his hand, and meted out [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) with the span,
and comprehended the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) of the earth in a
measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a
[balance](../ebd/ebd042.htm#007.md)?  

<span id="013">13</span> Who hath directed the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the LORD, or being his
[counsellor](../ebd/ebd091.htm#005.md) hath taught him?  

<span id="014">14</span> With whom took he counsel, and who instructed
him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge,
and shewed to him the way of understanding?  

<span id="015">15</span> Behold, the nations are as a drop of a
[bucket](../ebd/ebd065.htm#009.md), and are counted as the small
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) of the [balance](../ebd/ebd042.htm#007.md):
behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md) is not
sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> All nations before him are as nothing; and they
are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.  

<span id="018">18</span> To whom then will ye liken God? or what
likeness will ye compare unto him?  

<span id="019">19</span> The workman melteth a graven image, and the
[goldsmith](../ebd/ebd152.htm#003.md) spreadeth it over with
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and casteth
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) chains.  

<span id="020">20</span> He that is so impoverished that he hath no
oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a
cunning workman to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.  

<span id="021">21</span> Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it
not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the
foundations of the earth?  

<span id="022">22</span> It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the
earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth
out the heavens as a [curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004.md), and spreadeth
them out as a [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) to dwell in:  

<span id="023">23</span> That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh
the judges of the earth as vanity.  

<span id="024">24</span> Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall
not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he
shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind
shall take them away as stubble.  

<span id="025">25</span> To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be
equal? saith the Holy One.  

<span id="026">26</span> Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath
created these things, that bringeth out their
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) by number: he calleth them all by names by
the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one
faileth.  

<span id="027">27</span> Why sayest thou, O
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and speakest, O
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), My way is hid from the LORD, and my
judgment is passed over from my God?  

<span id="028">28</span> Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that
the [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) God, the LORD, the Creator of
the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no
searching of his understanding.  

<span id="029">29</span> He giveth power to the faint; and to them that
have no might he increaseth strength.  

<span id="030">30</span> Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and
the young men shall utterly fall:  

<span id="031">31</span> But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew
their strength; they shall [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) up with wings
as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and
not faint.
