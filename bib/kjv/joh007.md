### King James Version: John Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> After these things
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) walked in
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008): for he would not walk in Jewry,
because the Jews sought to kill him.  

<span id="002">2</span> Now the Jew's [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of
tabernacles was at hand.  

<span id="003">3</span> His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart
hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works
that thou doest.  

<span id="004">4</span> For there is no man that doeth any thing in
secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these
things, shew thyself to the world.  

<span id="005">5</span> For neither did his brethren believe in him.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto
them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.  

<span id="007">7</span> The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth,
because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.  

<span id="008">8</span> Go ye up unto this
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000): I go not up yet unto this
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000): for my time is not yet full come.  

<span id="009">9</span> When he had said these words unto them, he abode
still in [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008).  

<span id="010">10</span> But when his brethren were gone up, then went
he also up unto the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000), not openly, but as
it were in secret.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then the Jews sought him at the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000), and said, Where is he?  

<span id="012">12</span> And there was much
[murmuring](../ebd/ebd262.htm#003) among the people concerning him: for
some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the
people.  

<span id="013">13</span> Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of
the Jews.  

<span id="014">14</span> Now about the midst of the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) went up
into the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), and taught.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth
this man letters, having never learned?  

<span id="016">16</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered them,
and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.  

<span id="017">17</span> If any man will do his will, he shall know of
the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.  

<span id="018">18</span> He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006): but he that seeketh his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) that sent him, the same is true, and no
unrighteousness is in him.  

<span id="019">19</span> Did not [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) give you
the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill
me?  

<span id="020">20</span> The people answered and said, Thou hast a
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007): who goeth about to kill thee?  

<span id="021">21</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered and
said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.  

<span id="022">22</span> [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) therefore gave
unto you [circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007); (not because it is of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), but of the fathers;) and ye on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day circumcise a man.  

<span id="023">23</span> If a man on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day receive
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007), that the law of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) should not be broken; are ye angry at me,
because I have made a man every whit whole on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day?  

<span id="024">24</span> [Judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) not according to
the appearance, but [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) righteous judgment.  

<span id="025">25</span> Then said some of them of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), Is not this he, whom they seek to
kill?  

<span id="026">26</span> But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say
nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)?  

<span id="027">27</span> Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.  

<span id="028">28</span> Then cried [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) in
the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) as he taught, saying, Ye both know
me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that
sent me is true, whom ye know not.  

<span id="029">29</span> But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath
sent me.  

<span id="030">30</span> Then they sought to take him: but no man laid
hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.  

<span id="031">31</span> And many of the people believed on him, and
said, When [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) cometh, will he do more
miracles than these which this man hath done?  

<span id="032">32</span> The [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) heard
that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) and the chief priests sent officers
to take him.  

<span id="033">33</span> Then said [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) unto
them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent
me.  

<span id="034">34</span> Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and
where I am, thither ye cannot come.  

<span id="035">35</span> Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither
will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed
among the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001), and teach the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001)?  

<span id="036">36</span> What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye
shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot
come?  

<span id="037">37</span> In the last day, that great day of the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000), [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) stood and
cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009).  

<span id="038">38</span> He that believeth on me, as the
[scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005) hath said, out of his
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000) shall flow rivers of living water.  

<span id="039">39</span> (But this spake he of the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), which they that believe on him should
receive: for the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005) was not yet given;
because that [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) was not yet glorified.)  

<span id="040">40</span> Many of the people therefore, when they heard
this saying, said, Of a truth this is the
[Prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008).  

<span id="041">41</span> Others said, This is the
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000). But some said, Shall
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) come out of
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008)?  

<span id="042">42</span> Hath not the [scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005)
said, That [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) cometh of the seed of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and out of the town of
[Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005), where [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
was?  

<span id="043">43</span> So there was a division among the people
because of him.  

<span id="044">44</span> And some of them would have taken him; but no
man laid hands on him.  

<span id="045">45</span> Then came the officers to the chief priests and
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008); and they said unto them, Why have ye
not brought him?  

<span id="046">46</span> The officers answered, Never man spake like
this man.  

<span id="047">47</span> Then answered them the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008), Are ye also deceived?  

<span id="048">48</span> Have any of the rulers or of the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) believed on him?  

<span id="049">49</span> But this people who knoweth not the law are
cursed.  

<span id="050">50</span> [Nicodemus](../ebd/ebd272.htm#005) saith unto
them, (he that came to [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) by night, being
one of them,)  

<span id="051">51</span> Doth our law [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) any
man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?  

<span id="052">52</span> They answered and said unto him, Art thou also
of [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008)? Search, and look: for out of
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008) ariseth no
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008).  

<span id="053">53</span> And every man went unto his own house.
