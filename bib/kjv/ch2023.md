### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 23

<span id="001">1</span> And in the seventh year
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009) strengthened himself, and took the
captains of hundreds, [Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005) the son of
[Jeroham](../ebd/ebd204.htm#001), and [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005)
the son of [Jehohanan](../ebd/ebd200.htm#008), and
[Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005) the son of
[Obed](../ebd/ebd276.htm#004), and [Maaseiah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#007) the
son of Adaiah, and [Elishaphat](../ebd/ebd118.htm#002) the son of
[Zichri](../ebd/ebd392.htm#007), into [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008)
with him.  

<span id="002">2</span> And they went about in
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and gathered the Levites out of all the
cities of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and the chief of the fathers
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and they came to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="003">3</span> And all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) made a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall
reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="004">4</span> This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part
of you entering on the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003), of the priests
and of the Levites, shall be porters of the
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009);  

<span id="005">5</span> And a third part shall be at the king's house;
and a third part at the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the foundation:
and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> But let none come into the house of the LORD,
save the priests, and they that [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) of the
Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: but all the people shall
keep the watch of the LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the Levites shall compass the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) round about, every man with his weapons in
his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the house, he shall be put to
death: but be ye with the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) when he cometh
in, and when he goeth out.  

<span id="008">8</span> So the Levites and all
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) did according to all things that
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003)
had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003), with them that were to go out on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003): for [Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009)
the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) dismissed not the
[courses](../ebd/ebd091.htm#006).  

<span id="009">9</span> Moreover [Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) delivered to the captains of hundreds
spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) David's, which were in the house of God.  

<span id="010">10</span> And he set all the people, every man having his
weapon in his hand, from the right side of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) to the left side of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), along by the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) and the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004),
by the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) round about.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then they brought out the king's son, and put
upon him the [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001), and gave him the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008), and made him
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001). And [Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009) and
his sons anointed him, and said, God save the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="012">12</span> Now when [Athaliah](../ebd/ebd036.htm#002)
heard the noise of the people running and praising the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), she came to the people into the house of
the LORD:  

<span id="013">13</span> And she looked, and, behold, the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) stood at his
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007) at the entering in, and the princes and
the [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001) by the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001): and all the people of the land rejoiced,
and sounded with [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001), also the singers
with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise. Then
[Athaliah](../ebd/ebd036.htm#002) [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007) her
clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then [Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) brought out the captains of hundreds
that were set over the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007), and said unto
them, Have her forth of the [ranges](../ebd/ebd307.htm#004): and whoso
followeth her, let him be slain with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).
For the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) said, Slay her not in the house
of the LORD.  

<span id="015">15</span> So they laid hands on her; and when she was
come to the entering of the horse [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) by the
king's house, they slew her there.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009) made a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) between him, and between all the
people, and between the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), that they should
be the LORD's people.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then all the people went to the house of
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004), and brake it down, and brake his altars
and his images in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002), and slew
[Mattan](../ebd/ebd243.htm#007) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) of
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004) before the altars.  

<span id="018">18</span> Also [Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009)
appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the
priests the Levites, whom [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) had distributed
in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as
it is written in the law of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), with
rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="019">19</span> And he set the porters at the gates of the
house of the LORD, that none which was unclean in any thing should enter
in.  

<span id="020">20</span> And he took the captains of hundreds, and the
nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land,
and brought down the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) from the house of the
LORD: and they came through the high [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) into
the king's house, and set the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) upon the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of the kingdom.  

<span id="021">21</span> And all the people of the land rejoiced: and
the city was quiet, after that they had slain
[Athaliah](../ebd/ebd036.htm#002) with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).
