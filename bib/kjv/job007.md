### King James Version: Job Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> Is there not an appointed time to man upon
earth? are not his days also like the days of an
[hireling](../ebd/ebd179.htm#004)?  

<span id="002">2</span> As a servant earnestly desireth the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002), and as an
[hireling](../ebd/ebd179.htm#004) looketh for the reward of his work:  

<span id="003">3</span> So am I made to possess months of vanity, and
wearisome nights are appointed to me.  

<span id="004">4</span> When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and
the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning
of the day.  

<span id="005">5</span> My [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) is clothed
with worms and clods of [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008); my skin is
broken, and become loathsome.  

<span id="006">6</span> My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and
are spent without hope.  

<span id="007">7</span> O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall
no more see good.  

<span id="008">8</span> The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no
more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.  

<span id="009">9</span> As the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) is
consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008) shall come up no more.  

<span id="010">10</span> He shall return no more to his house, neither
shall his place know him any more.  

<span id="011">11</span> Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will
speak in the anguish of my [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009); I will
complain in the bitterness of my soul.  

<span id="012">12</span> Am I a sea, or a
[whale](../ebd/ebd380.htm#009), that thou settest a watch over me?  

<span id="013">13</span> When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my
[couch](../ebd/ebd091.htm#002) shall ease my complaints;  

<span id="014">14</span> Then thou scarest me with dreams, and
terrifiest me through visions:  

<span id="015">15</span> So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death
rather than my life.  

<span id="016">16</span> I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me
alone; for my days are vanity.  

<span id="017">17</span> What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him?
and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?  

<span id="018">18</span> And that thou shouldest visit him every
morning, and try him every moment?  

<span id="019">19</span> How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let
me alone till I [swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009) down my spittle?  

<span id="020">20</span> I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O
thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so
that I am a [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) to myself?  

<span id="021">21</span> And why dost thou not
[pardon](../ebd/ebd285.htm#001) my transgression, and take away my
iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008);
and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.
