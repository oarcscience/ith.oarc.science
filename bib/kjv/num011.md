### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> And when the people complained, it displeased
the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002)
was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed
them that were in the uttermost parts of the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the people cried unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003); and when [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003)
prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he called the name of the place
[Taberah](../ebd/ebd356.htm#001): because the fire of the LORD burnt
among them.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the mixt multitude that was among them fell
a lusting: and the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) also wept
again, and said, Who shall give us [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) to
eat?  

<span id="005">5</span> We remember the [fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005),
which we did eat in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) freely; the
[cucumbers](../ebd/ebd093.htm#008), and the
[melons](../ebd/ebd247.htm#007), and the leeks, and the onions, and the
garlick:  

<span id="006">6</span> But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing
at all, beside this [manna](../ebd/ebd240.htm#006), before our eyes.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [manna](../ebd/ebd240.htm#006) was as
[coriander](../ebd/ebd090.htm#001) seed, and the
[colour](../ebd/ebd086.htm#008) thereof as the
[colour](../ebd/ebd086.htm#008) of [bdellium](../ebd/ebd048.htm#003).  

<span id="008">8</span> And the people went about, and gathered it, and
ground it in mills, or beat it in a [mortar](../ebd/ebd260.htm#000), and
baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the
taste of fresh oil.  

<span id="009">9</span> And when the [dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008) fell
upon the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) in the night, the
[manna](../ebd/ebd240.htm#006) fell upon it.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) heard the
people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009): and the [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) of
the LORD was kindled greatly; [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) also was
displeased.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said unto
the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have
I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) of all this people upon me?  

<span id="012">12</span> Have I conceived all this people? have I
begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy
[bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008), as a nursing father beareth the sucking
child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?  

<span id="013">13</span> Whence should I have
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) to give unto all this people? for they
weep unto me, saying, Give us [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), that we
may eat.  

<span id="014">14</span> I am not able to bear all this people alone,
because it is too heavy for me.  

<span id="015">15</span> And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray
thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not
see my wretchedness.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Gather unto me seventy men of the elders
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), whom thou knowest to be the elders
of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), that they may stand there with
thee.  

<span id="017">17</span> And I will come down and talk with thee there:
and I will take of the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) which is upon
thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) of the people with thee, that thou bear
it not thyself alone.  

<span id="018">18</span> And say thou unto the people, Sanctify
yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007): for ye have wept in the ears of the
LORD, saying, Who shall give us [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) to eat?
for it was well with us in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009): therefore the
LORD will give you [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), and ye shall eat.  

<span id="019">19</span> Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor
five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;  

<span id="020">20</span> But even a whole month, until it come out at
your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have
despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying,
Why came we forth out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009)?  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said, The
people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast
said, I will give them [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), that they may eat
a whole month.  

<span id="022">22</span> Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for
them, to suffice them? or shall all the [fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005) of
the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?  

<span id="023">23</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Is the LORD's hand waxed short? thou
shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) went out,
and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men
of the elders of the people, and set them round about the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003).  

<span id="025">25</span> And the LORD came down in a
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001), and spake unto him, and took of the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) that was upon him, and gave it unto the
seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) rested upon them, they prophesied, and
did not cease.  

<span id="026">26</span> But there remained two of the men in the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002), the name of the one was
[Eldad](../ebd/ebd114.htm#007), and the name of the other
[Medad](../ebd/ebd245.htm#007): and the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009)
rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not
out unto the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003): and they prophesied in
the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002).  

<span id="027">27</span> And there ran a young man, and told
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), and said, [Eldad](../ebd/ebd114.htm#007)
and [Medad](../ebd/ebd245.htm#007) do prophesy in the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002).  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) the son of
[Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006), the servant of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), one of his young men, answered and said,
My lord [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), forbid them.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said unto
him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the LORD's people were
prophets, and that the LORD would put his
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) upon them!  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) gat him into
the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002), he and the elders of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="031">31</span> And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and
brought [quails](../ebd/ebd303.htm#002) from the sea, and let them fall
by the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002), as it were a day's
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001) on this side, and as it were a day's
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001) on the other side, round about the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002), and as it were two cubits high upon the
face of the earth.  

<span id="032">32</span> And the people stood up all that day, and all
that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the
[quails](../ebd/ebd303.htm#002): he that gathered least gathered ten
homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002).  

<span id="033">33</span> And while the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007)
was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD
was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a
very great [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001).  

<span id="034">34</span> And he called the name of that place
Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.  

<span id="035">35</span> And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah
unto [Hazeroth](../ebd/ebd169.htm#003); and abode at
[Hazeroth](../ebd/ebd169.htm#003).
