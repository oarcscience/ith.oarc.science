<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 31</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">Bow</A> down thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A>, for an house of defence to save me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For thou art my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Pull me out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</A> that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Into thine hand I commit my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;I will be glad and rejoice in thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Oh how great is thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A>, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#004">pavilion</A> from the strife of tongues.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A>, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.<BR>
