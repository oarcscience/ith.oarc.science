### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 58

<span id="001">1</span> Do ye indeed speak
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), O
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md)? do ye
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) uprightly, O ye sons of men?  

<span id="002">2</span> Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the
violence of your hands in the earth.  

<span id="003">3</span> The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go
astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.  

<span id="004">4</span> Their [poison](../ebd/ebd297.htm#009.md) is like
the [poison](../ebd/ebd297.htm#009.md) of a
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009.md): they are like the deaf
[adder](../ebd/ebd008.htm#005.md) that stoppeth her
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md);  

<span id="005">5</span> Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers,
charming never so wisely.  

<span id="006">6</span> Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break
out the great teeth of the young [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001.md), O
LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> Let them melt away as waters which run
continually: when he bendeth his [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) to shoot
his [arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005.md), let them be as cut in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> As a [snail](../ebd/ebd346.htm#008.md) which
melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely
[birth](../ebd/ebd059.htm#002.md) of a woman, that they may not see the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall
take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.  

<span id="010">10</span> The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the
vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md)
of the wicked.  

<span id="011">11</span> So that a man shall say, Verily there is a
reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the
earth.
