### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> And there went a man of the house of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006.md), and took to wife a daughter of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and
when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.  

<span id="003">3</span> And when she could not longer hide him, she took
for him an [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of bulrushes, and daubed it with
[slime](../ebd/ebd346.htm#004) and with [pitch](../ebd/ebd296.htm#008.md),
and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's
brink.  

<span id="004">4</span> And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would
be done to him.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the daughter of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) came down to wash herself at the river;
and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch
it.  

<span id="006">6</span> And when she had opened it, she saw the child:
and, behold, the [babe](../ebd/ebd040.htm#009.md) wept. And she had
compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter,
Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the
[Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009.md) women, that she may nurse the child for
thee?  

<span id="008">8</span> And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the
maid went and called the child's mother.  

<span id="009">9</span> And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this
child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy
[wages](../ebd/ebd378.htm#004.md). And the women took the child, and nursed
it.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the child grew, and she brought him unto
Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md): and she said, Because I drew him out of
the water.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it came to pass in those days, when
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) was grown, that he went out unto his
brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting
an [Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009.md), one of his brethren.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he looked this way and that way, and when
he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the
sand.  

<span id="013">13</span> And when he went out the second day, behold,
two men of the [Hebrews](../ebd/ebd171.htm#001.md) strove together: and he
said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?  

<span id="014">14</span> And he said, Who made thee a
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) and a [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md)
over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) feared, and said, Surely this thing is
known.  

<span id="015">15</span> Now when [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) heard
this thing, he sought to slay [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md). But
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) fled from the face of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), and dwelt in the land of
[Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md): and he sat down by a well.  

<span id="016">16</span> Now the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) of
[Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007) had [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water
their father's flock.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the shepherds came and drove them away: but
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) stood up and helped them, and watered
their flock.  

<span id="018">18</span> And when they came to
[Reuel](../ebd/ebd312.htm#001.md) their father, he said, How is it that ye
are come so soon to day?  

<span id="019">19</span> And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of
the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and
watered the flock.  

<span id="020">20</span> And he said unto his daughters, And where is
he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) was content
to dwell with the man: and he gave [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md)
[Zipporah](../ebd/ebd394.htm#008.md) his daughter.  

<span id="022">22</span> And she bare him a son, and he called his name
[Gershom](../ebd/ebd146.htm#008.md): for he said, I have been a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) in a strange land.  

<span id="023">23</span> And it came to pass in process of time, that
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md)
died: and the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) sighed by
reason of the [bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md), and they cried, and
their cry came up unto God by reason of the
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And God heard their groaning, and God
remembered his [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), with [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md),
and with [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> And God looked upon the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and God had respect unto them.
