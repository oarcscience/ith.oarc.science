### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 57

<span id="001">1</span> Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me:
for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) of thy wings will I make my refuge,
until these calamities be overpast.  

<span id="002">2</span> I will cry unto God most high; unto God that
performeth all things for me.  

<span id="003">3</span> He shall send from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and save me from the reproach of him
that would [swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009.md) me up.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md). God shall send forth his
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) and his truth.  

<span id="004">4</span> My soul is among [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001.md):
and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men,
whose teeth are spears and [arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005.md), and their
tongue a sharp [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let
thy [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) be above all the earth.  

<span id="006">6</span> They have prepared a
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002.md) for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they
have digged a [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md) before me, into the midst
whereof they are fallen themselves. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I
will sing and give praise.  

<span id="008">8</span> Awake up, my [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md);
awake, [psaltery](../ebd/ebd301.htm#006.md) and
[harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001.md): I myself will awake early.  

<span id="009">9</span> I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I
will sing unto thee among the nations.  

<span id="010">10</span> For thy [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) is great
unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.  

<span id="011">11</span> Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let
thy [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) be above all the earth.
