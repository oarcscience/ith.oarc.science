<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 21</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;After these things <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#006">Tiberias</A>; and on this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> shewed he himself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;There were together <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#005">Thomas</A> called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd103.htm#006">Didymus</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#003">Nathanael</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#004">Cana</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, and the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#008">Zebedee</A>, and two other of his disciples.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But when the morning was now come, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Cast the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</A> on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Therefore that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</A> whom <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> loved saith unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, It is the Lord. Now when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</A> unto him, (for he was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A>,) and did cast himself into the sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</A> with fishes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</A> laid thereon, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto them, Bring of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</A> which ye have now caught.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> went up, and drew the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</A> to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</A> broken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto them, Come and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd103.htm#009">dine</A>. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> then cometh, and taketh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, and giveth them, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</A> likewise.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;This is now the third time that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;So when they had dined, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A>, son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#009">Jonas</A>, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;He saith to him again the second time, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A>, son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#009">Jonas</A>, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;He saith unto him the third time, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A>, son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#009">Jonas</A>, lovest thou me? <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto him, Feed my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;This spake he, signifying by what death he should <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</A> God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, turning about, seeth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</A> whom <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> loved following; which also leaned on his breast at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#004">supper</A>, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> seeing him saith to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, Lord, and what shall this man do?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</A> should not die: yet <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;This is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</A> which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A> is true.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And there are also many other things which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</A>.<BR>
