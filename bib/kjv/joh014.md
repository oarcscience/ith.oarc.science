### King James Version: John Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in
God, believe also in me.  

<span id="002">2</span> In my Father's house are many mansions: if it
were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.  

<span id="003">3</span> And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will
come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may
be also.  

<span id="004">4</span> And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.  

<span id="005">5</span> [Thomas](../ebd/ebd364.htm#005.md) saith unto him,
Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?  

<span id="006">6</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saith unto him, I
am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but
by me.  

<span id="007">7</span> If ye had known me, ye should have known my
Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.  

<span id="008">8</span> [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008.md) saith unto him,
Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.  

<span id="009">9</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saith unto him,
Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me,
[Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008.md)? he that hath seen me hath seen the
Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?  

<span id="010">10</span> Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and
the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself:
but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.  

<span id="011">11</span> Believe me that I am in the Father, and the
Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.  

<span id="012">12</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that
believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works
than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.  

<span id="013">13</span> And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that
will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.  

<span id="014">14</span> If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do
it.  

<span id="015">15</span> If ye love me, keep my commandments.  

<span id="016">16</span> And I will pray the Father, and he shall give
you another [Comforter](../ebd/ebd087.htm#001.md), that he may abide with
you for ever;  

<span id="017">17</span> Even the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of
truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither
knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in
you.  

<span id="018">18</span> I will not leave you comfortless: I will come
to you.  

<span id="019">19</span> Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no
more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.  

<span id="020">20</span> At that day ye shall know that I am in my
Father, and ye in me, and I in you.  

<span id="021">21</span> He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them,
he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my
Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.  

<span id="022">22</span> [Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001.md) saith unto him,
not [Iscariot](../ebd/ebd190.htm#000.md), Lord, how is it that thou wilt
manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?  

<span id="023">23</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered and
said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father
will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.  

<span id="024">24</span> He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings:
and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent
me.  

<span id="025">25</span> These things have I spoken unto you, being yet
present with you.  

<span id="026">26</span> But the [Comforter](../ebd/ebd087.htm#001.md),
which is the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md), whom the Father will
send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to
your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.  

<span id="027">27</span> Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto
you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be
troubled, neither let it be afraid.  

<span id="028">28</span> Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away,
and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I
said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.  

<span id="029">29</span> And now I have told you before it come to pass,
that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.  

<span id="030">30</span> Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for
the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) of this world cometh, and hath
nothing in me.  

<span id="031">31</span> But that the world may know that I love the
Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let
us go hence.
