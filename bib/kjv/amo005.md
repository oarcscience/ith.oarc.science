### King James Version: Amos Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Hear ye this word which I take up against you,
even a [lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005.md), O house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> The [virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) is fallen; she shall no more rise: she
is forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.  

<span id="003">3</span> For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went
out by a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by
an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> For thus saith the LORD unto the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), Seek ye me, and ye shall live:  

<span id="005">5</span> But seek not [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md),
nor enter into [Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md), and pass not to
[Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008): for [Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md)
shall surely go into [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md), and
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md) shall come to nought.  

<span id="006">6</span> Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break
out like fire in the house of [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), and
devour it, and there be none to quench it in
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Ye who turn judgment to
[wormwood](../ebd/ebd384.htm#001.md), and leave off
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) in the earth,  

<span id="008">8</span> Seek him that maketh the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md) and
[Orion](../ebd/ebd280.htm#005.md), and turneth the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) of death into the morning, and maketh
the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and
poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:  

<span id="009">9</span> That strengtheneth the spoiled against the
strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.  

<span id="010">10</span> They hate him that rebuketh in the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md), and they abhor him that speaketh
uprightly.  

<span id="011">11</span> Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon
the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), and ye take from him burdens of
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md): ye have built houses of hewn
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have
planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) of them.  

<span id="012">12</span> For I know your manifold transgressions and
your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a
[bribe](../ebd/ebd064.htm#009.md), and they turn aside the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) in the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) from
their right.  

<span id="013">13</span> Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in
that time; for it is an evil time.  

<span id="014">14</span> Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and
so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.  

<span id="015">15</span> Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish
judgment in the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md): it may be that the LORD
God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD,
saith thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all
the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the
[husbandman](../ebd/ebd185.htm#002.md) to mourning, and such as are skilful
of [lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005.md) to wailing.  

<span id="017">17</span> And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I
will pass through thee, saith the LORD.  

<span id="018">18</span> Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD!
to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), and not light.  

<span id="019">19</span> As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear
met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009) [bit](../ebd/ebd059.htm#006.md) him.  

<span id="020">20</span> Shall not the day of the LORD be
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), and not light? even very dark, and no
brightness in it?  

<span id="021">21</span> I hate, I despise your
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) days, and I will not smell in your solemn
assemblies.  

<span id="022">22</span> Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your
meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace
offerings of your [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) beasts.  

<span id="023">23</span> Take thou away from me the noise of thy
[songs](../ebd/ebd348.htm#002.md); for I will not hear the melody of thy
viols.  

<span id="024">24</span> But let judgment run down as waters, and
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) as a mighty stream.  

<span id="025">25</span> Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and
offerings in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) forty years, O
house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="026">26</span> But ye have borne the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of your
[Moloch](../ebd/ebd259.htm#000) and [Chiun](../ebd/ebd081.htm#004.md) your
images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.  

<span id="027">27</span> Therefore will I cause you to go into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md) beyond
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md), saith the LORD, whose name is The God
of hosts.
