### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 26

<span id="001">1</span> Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image,
neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image
of [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) in your land, to
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.  

<span id="002">2</span> Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md): I am the LORD.  

<span id="003">3</span> If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my
commandments, and do them;  

<span id="004">4</span> Then I will give you
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) in due season, and the land shall yield
her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And your [threshing](../ebd/ebd364.htm#009.md)
shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the
sowing time: and ye shall eat your [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) to the
full, and dwell in your land safely.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall
lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out
of the land, neither shall the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) go through
your land.  

<span id="007">7</span> And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall
fall before you by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an
hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall
fall before you by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> For I will have respect unto you, and make you
fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with you.  

<span id="010">10</span> And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the
old because of the new.  

<span id="011">11</span> And I set my
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) among you: and my soul shall not
abhor you.  

<span id="012">12</span> And I will walk among you, and will be your
God, and ye shall be my people.  

<span id="013">13</span> I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth
out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), that ye should not be
their bondmen; and I have broken the [bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003.md) of
your [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md), and made you go upright.  

<span id="014">14</span> But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will
not do all these commandments;  

<span id="015">15</span> And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your
soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but
that ye break my [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md):  

<span id="016">16</span> I also will do this unto you; I will even
appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning
[ague](../ebd/ebd012.htm#008.md), that shall consume the eyes, and cause
sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies
shall eat it.  

<span id="017">17</span> And I will set my face against you, and ye
shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over
you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.  

<span id="018">18</span> And if ye will not yet for all this hearken
unto me, then I will punish you [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times
more for your sins.  

<span id="019">19</span> And I will break the pride of your power; and I
will make your [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) as
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md), and your earth as
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md):  

<span id="020">20</span> And your strength shall be spent in vain: for
your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the
land yield their fruits.  

<span id="021">21</span> And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not
hearken unto me; I will bring [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times more
plagues upon you according to your sins.  

<span id="022">22</span> I will also send wild beasts among you, which
shall rob you of your children, and destroy your
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), and make you few in number; and your
high ways shall be desolate.  

<span id="023">23</span> And if ye will not be reformed by me by these
things, but will walk contrary unto me;  

<span id="024">24</span> Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and
will punish you yet [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times for your
sins.  

<span id="025">25</span> And I will bring a
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel
of my [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md): and when ye are gathered
together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and
ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.  

<span id="026">26</span> And when I have broken the staff of your
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), ten women shall
[bake](../ebd/ebd042.htm#001) your [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) in one
[oven](../ebd/ebd281.htm#005.md), and they shall deliver you your
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) again by weight: and ye shall eat, and
not be satisfied.  

<span id="027">27</span> And if ye will not for all this hearken unto
me, but walk contrary unto me;  

<span id="028">28</span> Then I will walk contrary unto you also in
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md); and I, even I, will chastise you
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times for your sins.  

<span id="029">29</span> And ye shall eat the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of your sons, and the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of your daughters shall ye eat.  

<span id="030">30</span> And I will destroy your high places, and cut
down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your
idols, and my soul shall abhor you.  

<span id="031">31</span> And I will make your cities waste, and bring
your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of
your sweet odours.  

<span id="032">32</span> And I will bring the land into desolation: and
your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.  

<span id="033">33</span> And I will scatter you among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), and will draw out a
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) after you: and your land shall be
desolate, and your cities waste.  

<span id="034">34</span> Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long
as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall
the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.  

<span id="035">35</span> As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest;
because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.  

<span id="036">36</span> And upon them that are left alive of you I will
send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and
the sound of a shaken [leaf](../ebd/ebd225.htm#004.md) shall chase them;
and they shall flee, as fleeing from a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md);
and they shall fall when none pursueth.  

<span id="037">37</span> And they shall fall one upon another, as it
were before a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), when none pursueth: and ye
shall have no power to stand before your enemies.  

<span id="038">38</span> And ye shall perish among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), and the land of your enemies shall eat
you up.  

<span id="039">39</span> And they that are left of you shall pine away
in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of
their fathers shall they pine away with them.  

<span id="040">40</span> If they shall confess their iniquity, and the
iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed
against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;  

<span id="041">41</span> And that I also have walked contrary unto them,
and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their
uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the
[punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005.md) of their iniquity:  

<span id="042">42</span> Then will I remember my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md),
and also my [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md), and also my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md)
will I remember; and I will remember the land.  

<span id="043">43</span> The land also shall be left of them, and shall
enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they
shall accept of the [punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005.md) of their
iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because
their soul abhorred my statutes.  

<span id="044">44</span> And yet for all that, when they be in the land
of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them,
to destroy them utterly, and to break my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with them: for I am the LORD their
God.  

<span id="045">45</span> But I will for their sakes remember the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of their ancestors, whom I brought
forth out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) in the sight of
the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), that I might be their God: I am
the LORD.  

<span id="046">46</span> These are the statutes and judgments and laws,
which the LORD made between him and the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009.md) by the hand of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).
