### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 42

<span id="001">1</span> Then all the captains of the
[forces](../ebd/ebd137.htm#000), and [Johanan](../ebd/ebd208.htm#009)
the son of [Kareah](../ebd/ebd215.htm#007), and Jezaniah the son of
Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came
near,  

<span id="002">2</span> And said unto [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006)
the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), Let, we beseech thee, our
supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy
God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as
thine eyes do behold us:)  

<span id="003">3</span> That the LORD thy God may shew us the way
wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) said unto them, I have heard you;
behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words; and
it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer you,
I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then they said to
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006), The LORD be a true and
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008)
between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the
LORD thy God shall send thee to us.  

<span id="006">6</span> Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we
will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it
may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.  

<span id="007">7</span> And it came to pass after ten days, that the
word of the LORD came unto [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006).  

<span id="008">8</span> Then called he [Johanan](../ebd/ebd208.htm#009)
the son of [Kareah](../ebd/ebd215.htm#007), and all the captains of the
[forces](../ebd/ebd137.htm#000) which were with him, and all the people
from the least even to the greatest,  

<span id="009">9</span> And said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), unto whom ye sent me to present your
supplication before him;  

<span id="010">10</span> If ye will still abide in this land, then will
I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck
you up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.  

<span id="011">11</span> Be not afraid of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), of
whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I am with
you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.  

<span id="012">12</span> And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may
have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) upon you, and cause you to return to
your own land.  

<span id="013">13</span> But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land,
neither obey the voice of the LORD your God,  

<span id="014">14</span> Saying, No; but we will go into the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), where we shall see no war, nor hear the
sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006);
and there will we dwell:  

<span id="015">15</span> And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye
remnant of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007); Thus saith the LORD of hosts,
the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); If ye wholly set your faces
to enter into [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and go to sojourn there;  

<span id="016">16</span> Then it shall come to pass, that the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), which ye feared, shall overtake you
there in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000), whereof ye were afraid, shall follow
close after you there in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009); and there ye
shall die.  

<span id="017">17</span> So shall it be with all the men that set their
faces to go into [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) to sojourn there; they
shall die by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), by the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000), and by the pestilence: and none of them
shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.  

<span id="018">18</span> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); As mine [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002)
and my [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) hath been poured forth upon the
inhabitants of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005); so shall my
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) be poured forth upon you, when ye shall
enter into [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009): and ye shall be an
execration, and an astonishment, and a [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003),
and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.  

<span id="019">19</span> The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007); Go ye not into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009): know certainly that I have admonished
you this day.  

<span id="020">20</span> For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent
me unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God;
and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto
us, and we will do it.  

<span id="021">21</span> And now I have this day declared it to you; but
ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the
which he hath sent me unto you.  

<span id="022">22</span> Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die
by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), by the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000), and by the pestilence, in the place
whither ye desire to go and to sojourn.
