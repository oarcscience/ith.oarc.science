### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> Now [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) had
riches and honour in abundance, and joined
[affinity](../ebd/ebd011.htm#005) with [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002).  

<span id="002">2</span> And after certain years he went down to
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) to [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004). And
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) killed [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) and
oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and
persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) said
unto [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead?
And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and
we will be with thee in the war.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) said
unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of
the LORD to day.  

<span id="005">5</span> Therefore the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) gathered together of prophets four
hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle,
or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into
the king's hand.  

<span id="006">6</span> But [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) said,
Is there not here a [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) of the LORD
besides, that we might enquire of him?  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) said unto
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006), There is yet one man, by whom we
may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good
unto me, but always evil: the same is [Micaiah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#007)
the son of [Imla](../ebd/ebd187.htm#006). And
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) said, Let not the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) say so.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) called for one of his officers, and
said, Fetch quickly [Micaiah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#007) the son of
[Imla](../ebd/ebd187.htm#006).  

<span id="009">9</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) sat
either of them on his [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001), clothed in their
robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004); and
all the prophets prophesied before them.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) the son
of [Chenaanah](../ebd/ebd078.htm#008) had made him horns of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004), and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these
thou shalt push [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002) until they be consumed.  

<span id="011">11</span> And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go
up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the
hand of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="012">12</span> And the [messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005) that
went to call [Micaiah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#007) spake to him, saying,
Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) with one assent; let thy word therefore, I
pray thee, be like one of their's, and speak thou good.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Micaiah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#007) said, As
the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when he was come to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said
unto him, [Micaiah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#007), shall we go to Ramothgilead
to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and
they shall be delivered into your hand.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said to
him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the
truth to me in the name of the LORD?  

<span id="016">16</span> Then he said, I did see all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) scattered upon the mountains, as
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) that have no
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006): and the LORD said, These have no
master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) said to
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006), Did I not tell thee that he would
not prophesy good unto me, but evil?  

<span id="018">18</span> Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the
LORD; I saw the LORD [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009) upon his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001), and all the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006)
standing on his right hand and on his left.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the LORD said, Who shall entice
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that he may go up and fall at
Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying
after that manner.  

<span id="020">20</span> Then there came out a
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), and stood before the LORD, and said, I
will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?  

<span id="021">21</span> And he said, I will go out, and be a lying
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) in the mouth of all his prophets. And
the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail: go
out, and do even so.  

<span id="022">22</span> Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a
lying [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) in the mouth of these thy
prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.  

<span id="023">23</span> Then [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) the son
of [Chenaanah](../ebd/ebd078.htm#008) came near, and smote
[Micaiah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#007) upon the
[cheek](../ebd/ebd078.htm#004), and said, Which way went the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of the LORD from me to speak unto
thee?  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Micaiah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#007) said,
Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003) to hide thyself.  

<span id="025">25</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) said, Take ye
[Micaiah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#007), and carry him back to
[Amon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#005) the governor of the city, and to
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000) the king's son;  

<span id="026">26</span> And say, Thus saith the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), Put this fellow in the
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006), and feed him with
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) of affliction and with water of
affliction, until I return in peace.  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Micaiah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#007) said, If
thou certainly return in peace, then hath not the LORD spoken by me. And
he said, Hearken, all ye people.  

<span id="028">28</span> So the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006)
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) went
up to Ramothgilead.  

<span id="029">29</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) said unto
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006), I will disguise myself, and I will
go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
disguised himself; and they went to the battle.  

<span id="030">30</span> Now the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002) had commanded the captains of the
chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great,
save only with the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="031">31</span> And it came to pass, when the captains of the
chariots saw [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006), that they said, It is
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).
Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) cried out, and the LORD helped him;
and God moved them to depart from him.  

<span id="032">32</span> For it came to pass, that, when the captains of
the chariots perceived that it was not the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), they turned back again from pursuing
him.  

<span id="033">33</span> And a certain man drew a
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) at a venture, and smote the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) between
the joints of the [harness](../ebd/ebd164.htm#007): therefore he said to
his [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) man, Turn thine hand, that thou
mayest carry me out of the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007); for I am
wounded.  

<span id="034">34</span> And the battle increased that day: howbeit the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) stayed
himself up in his [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) against the Syrians
until the even: and about the time of the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001)
going down he died.
