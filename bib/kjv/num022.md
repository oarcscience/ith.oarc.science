### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) set forward, and pitched in the plains
of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) on this side
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) by [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md) the son of
[Zippor](../ebd/ebd394.htm#007.md) saw all that
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) had done to the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) was sore
afraid of the people, because they were many: and
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) was distressed because of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) said unto the
elders of [Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md), Now shall this company lick
up all that are round about us, as the [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007.md)
licketh up the [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md) of the field. And
[Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md) the son of
[Zippor](../ebd/ebd394.htm#007) was [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of the
Moabites at that time.  

<span id="005">5</span> He sent messengers therefore unto
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003) the son of [Beor](../ebd/ebd052.htm#009.md)
to [Pethor](../ebd/ebd291.htm#006.md), which is by the river of the land of
the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a
people come out from [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): behold, they cover
the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:  

<span id="006">6</span> Come now therefore, I pray thee,
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) me this people; for they are too mighty
for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I
may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest is
blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the elders of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md)
and the elders of [Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md) departed with the
rewards of [divination](../ebd/ebd104.htm#009.md) in their hand; and they
came unto [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md), and spake unto him the words
of [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And he said unto them,
[Lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002.md) here this night, and I will bring you
word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) abode with
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And God came unto
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md), and said, What men are these with
thee?  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) said unto
God, [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md) the son of
[Zippor](../ebd/ebd394.htm#007), [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), hath sent unto me, saying,  

<span id="011">11</span> Behold, there is a people come out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), which covereth the face of the earth:
come now, [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) me them; peradventure I shall
be able to overcome them, and drive them out.  

<span id="012">12</span> And God said unto
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md), Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt
not [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) the people: for they are blessed.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) rose up in
the morning, and said unto the princes of
[Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md), Get you into your land: for the LORD
refuseth to give me leave to go with you.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the princes of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) rose up, and they went unto
[Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md), and said,
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) refuseth to come with us.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md) sent yet
again princes, more, and more honourable than they.  

<span id="016">16</span> And they came to
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md), and said to him, Thus saith
[Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md) the son of
[Zippor](../ebd/ebd394.htm#007.md), Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee
from coming unto me:  

<span id="017">17</span> For I will promote thee unto very great honour,
and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray
thee, [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) me this people.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) answered
and said unto the servants of [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md), If
[Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md) would give me his house full of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), I
cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.  

<span id="019">19</span> Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here
this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.  

<span id="020">20</span> And God came unto
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) at night, and said unto him, If the men
come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I
shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) rose up in
the morning, and saddled his [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md), and went with
the princes of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And God's [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) was
kindled because he went: and the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
LORD stood in the way for an [adversary](../ebd/ebd011.htm#001.md) against
him. Now he was riding upon his [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md), and his
two servants were with him.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md) saw the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the LORD standing in the way, and his
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) drawn in his hand: and the
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md) turned aside out of the way, and went into
the field: and [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) smote the
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md), to turn her into the way.  

<span id="024">24</span> But the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a
wall on that side.  

<span id="025">25</span> And when the [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md) saw
the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the LORD, she thrust herself unto
the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her
again.  

<span id="026">26</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn
either to the right hand or to the left.  

<span id="027">27</span> And when the [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md) saw
the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the LORD, she fell down under
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md): and Balaam's
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) was kindled, and he smote the
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md) with a staff.  

<span id="028">28</span> And the LORD opened the mouth of the
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md), and she said unto
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md), What have I done unto thee, that thou
hast smitten me these three times?  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) said unto
the [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md), Because thou hast mocked me: I would
there were a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) in mine hand, for now would
I kill thee.  

<span id="030">30</span> And the [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md) said unto
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md), Am not I thine
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md), upon which thou hast ridden ever since I
was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he
said, Nay.  

<span id="031">31</span> Then the LORD opened the eyes of
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md), and he saw the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the LORD standing in the way, and his
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his
head, and fell flat on his face.  

<span id="032">32</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md) these three times? behold, I went out to
withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:  

<span id="033">33</span> And the [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md) saw me,
and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me,
surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.  

<span id="034">34</span> And [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) said unto
the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the LORD, I have sinned; for I
knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it
displease thee, I will get me back again.  

<span id="035">35</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
LORD said unto [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md), Go with the men: but
only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) went with the princes of
[Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md).  

<span id="036">36</span> And when [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md) heard
that [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) was come, he went out to meet him
unto a city of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), which is in the border of
[Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000.md), which is in the utmost coast.  

<span id="037">37</span> And [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md) said unto
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md), Did I not earnestly send unto thee to
call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to
promote thee to honour?  

<span id="038">38</span> And [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) said unto
[Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md), Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any
power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth,
that shall I speak.  

<span id="039">39</span> And [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) went with
[Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md), and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.  

<span id="040">40</span> And [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md) offered oxen
and [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), and sent to
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md), and to the princes that were with
him.  

<span id="041">41</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that
[Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006) took [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md), and
brought him up into the high places of [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md),
that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.
