### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 25

<span id="001">1</span> The word of the LORD came again unto me,
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites,
and prophesy against them;  

<span id="003">3</span> And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the
Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst,
[Aha](../ebd/ebd013.htm#001.md), against my
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md), when it was profaned; and against
the land of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), when it was desolate; and
against the house of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), when they went into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md);  

<span id="004">4</span> Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men
of the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) for a possession, and they shall
set their palaces in thee, and make their
[dwellings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#001.md) in thee: they shall eat thy
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md), and they shall
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) thy [milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And I will make [Rabbah](../ebd/ebd304.htm#005.md)
a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couching place for flocks: and
ye shall know that I am the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast
clapped thine hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart
with all thy despite against the land of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md);  

<span id="007">7</span> Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand
upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md); and I will cut thee off from the
people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will
destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.  

<span id="008">8</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005) and [Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004.md) do say,
Behold, the house of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) is like unto all the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md);  

<span id="009">9</span> Therefore, behold, I will open the side of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) from the cities, from his cities which are
on his frontiers, the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the country,
Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim,  

<span id="010">10</span> Unto the men of the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) with the Ammonites, and will give them in
possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the
nations.  

<span id="011">11</span> And I will execute judgments upon
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md); and they shall know that I am the LORD.  

<span id="012">12</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md) hath dealt against the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) by taking vengeance, and hath greatly
offended, and revenged himself upon them;  

<span id="013">13</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also
stretch out mine hand upon [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md), and will cut
off man and [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) from it; and I will make it
desolate from [Teman](../ebd/ebd361.htm#001.md); and they of
[Dedan](../ebd/ebd100.htm#005.md) shall fall by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And I will lay my vengeance upon
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md) by the hand of my people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and they shall do in
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md) according to mine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) and according to my
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md); and they shall know my vengeance, saith
the Lord GOD.  

<span id="015">15</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) have dealt by revenge, and have
taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy it for the old
[hatred](../ebd/ebd167.htm#002.md);  

<span id="016">16</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I
will stretch out mine hand upon the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), and I will cut off the Cherethims,
and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.  

<span id="017">17</span> And I will execute great vengeance upon them
with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I
shall lay my vengeance upon them.
