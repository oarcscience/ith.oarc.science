### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> [Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md) was
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) years old when he began to reign, and he
reigned forty years in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md). His mother's
name also was [Zibiah](../ebd/ebd392.htm#006.md) of
[Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md) did that
which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md) took for
him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.  

<span id="004">4</span> And it came to pass after this, that
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md) was minded to repair the house of the
LORD.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he gathered together the priests and the
Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and gather of all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) money to repair the house of your God
from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the
Levites hastened it not.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) called for
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md) the chief, and said unto him, Why hast
thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and out of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) the
[collection](../ebd/ebd086.htm#005.md), according to the commandment of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) the servant of the LORD, and of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), for the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md)?  

<span id="007">7</span> For the sons of
[Athaliah](../ebd/ebd036.htm#002.md), that wicked woman, had broken up the
house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD
did they bestow upon [Baalim](../ebd/ebd039.htm#007.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And at the king's commandment they made a
[chest](../ebd/ebd079.htm#007.md), and set it without at the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) of the house of the LORD.  

<span id="009">9</span> And they made a proclamation through
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md),
to bring in to the LORD the [collection](../ebd/ebd086.htm#005.md) that
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) the servant of God laid upon
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And all the princes and all the people
rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the
[chest](../ebd/ebd079.htm#007.md), until they had made an end.  

<span id="011">11</span> Now it came to pass, that at what time the
[chest](../ebd/ebd079.htm#007.md) was brought unto the king's office by the
hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the
king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the
[chest](../ebd/ebd079.htm#007.md), and took it, and carried it to his place
again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) and
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md) gave it to such as did the work of the
service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to
repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004) and [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md) to mend
the house of the LORD.  

<span id="013">13</span> So the workmen wrought, and the work was
perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and
strengthened it.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when they had finished it, they brought the
rest of the money before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) and
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md), whereof were made vessels for the
house of the LORD, even vessels to [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md),
and to offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) and [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md). And
they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all
the days of [Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> But [Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md) waxed
old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old
was he when he died.  

<span id="016">16</span> And they buried him in the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) among the kings, because he had done good
in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), both toward God, and toward his
house.  

<span id="017">17</span> Now after the death of
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md) came the princes of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and made
[obeisance](../ebd/ebd276.htm#006) to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).
Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) hearkened unto them.  

<span id="018">18</span> And they left the house of the LORD God of
their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md)
for this their trespass.  

<span id="019">19</span> Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them
again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not
give [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of God
came upon [Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006.md) the son of
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md),
which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why
transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper?
because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you.  

<span id="021">21</span> And they conspired against him, and stoned him
with stones at the commandment of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) in
the court of the house of the LORD.  

<span id="022">22</span> Thus [Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) remembered not the kindness which
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md) his father had done to him, but slew
his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require
it.  

<span id="023">23</span> And it came to pass at the end of the year,
that the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md)
came up against him: and they came to [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and destroyed all the princes of the
people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> For the army of the Syrians came with a small
company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) into their hand, because they had forsaken
the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> And when they were departed from him, (for they
left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for
the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of the sons of
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md),
and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), but they buried him not in the
sepulchres of the kings.  

<span id="026">26</span> And these are they that conspired against him;
[Zabad](../ebd/ebd385.htm#005.md) the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and
[Jehozabad](../ebd/ebd202.htm#005.md) the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.  

<span id="027">27</span> Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of
the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing of the house of God,
behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. And
[Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007.md) his son reigned in his stead.
