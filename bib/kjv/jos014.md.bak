### King James Version: Joshua Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> And these are the countries which the children
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) inherited in the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005), which [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000.md)
the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md)
the son of [Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006.md), and the heads of the fathers of
the tribes of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
distributed for inheritance to them.  

<span id="002">2</span> By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD
commanded by the hand of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), for the nine
tribes, and for the half [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> For [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) had given the
inheritance of two tribes and an half [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) on
the other side [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md): but unto the Levites he
gave none inheritance among them.  

<span id="004">4</span> For the children of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) were two tribes,
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) and [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md):
therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to
dwell in, with their [suburbs](../ebd/ebd352.htm#007.md) for their
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) and for their substance.  

<span id="005">5</span> As the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), so the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) did, and they divided the land.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) came unto [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md)
in [Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001): and [Caleb](../ebd/ebd069.htm#003.md)
the son of [Jephunneh](../ebd/ebd203.htm#004.md) the Kenezite said unto
him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) the man of God concerning me and thee in
Kadeshbarnea.  

<span id="007">7</span> Forty years old was I when
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) the servant of the LORD sent me from
Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it
was in mine heart.  

<span id="008">8</span> Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me
made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my
God.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) sware on that
day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be
thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever, because thou hast wholly
followed the LORD my God.  

<span id="010">10</span> And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive,
as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this
word unto [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), while the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) wandered in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md): and now, lo, I am this day
fourscore and five years old.  

<span id="011">11</span> As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the
day that [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) sent me: as my strength was
then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come
in.  

<span id="012">12</span> Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof
the LORD spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the
Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be
the LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the
LORD said.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) blessed
him, and gave unto [Caleb](../ebd/ebd069.htm#003.md) the son of
[Jephunneh](../ebd/ebd203.htm#004) [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004.md) for
an inheritance.  

<span id="014">14</span> [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004.md) therefore
became the inheritance of [Caleb](../ebd/ebd069.htm#003.md) the son of
[Jephunneh](../ebd/ebd203.htm#004.md) the Kenezite unto this day, because
that he wholly followed the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And the name of [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004.md)
before was Kirjatharba; which [Arba](../ebd/ebd028.htm#007.md) was a great
man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.
