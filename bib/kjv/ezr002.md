came to the house of the LORD which is at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), offered freely for the house of God
to set it up in his place:  

<span id="069">69</span> They gave after their ability unto the treasure
of the work threescore and one thousand drams of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and five thousand

one hundred priests' garments.  

<span id="070">70</span> So the priests, and the Levites, and some of
the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt
in their cities, and all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) in their
cities.
