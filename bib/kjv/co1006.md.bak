### King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> Dare any of you, having a matter against
another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?  

<span id="002">2</span> Do ye not know that the saints shall
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) the world? and if the world shall be
judged by you, are ye unworthy to [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) the
smallest matters?  

<span id="003">3</span> Know ye not that we shall
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) angels? how much more things that pertain
to this life?  

<span id="004">4</span> If then ye have judgments of things pertaining
to this life, set them to [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) who are least
esteemed in the church.  

<span id="005">5</span> I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is
not a [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) man among you? no, not one that
shall be able to [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) between his brethren?  

<span id="006">6</span> But brother goeth to law with brother, and that
before the unbelievers.  

<span id="007">7</span> Now therefore there is utterly a fault among
you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take
wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?  

<span id="008">8</span> Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your
brethren.  

<span id="009">9</span> Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not
inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor
idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves
with mankind,  

<span id="010">10</span> Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor
revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.  

<span id="011">11</span> And such were some of you: but ye are washed,
but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), and by the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of our God.  

<span id="012">12</span> All things are lawful unto me, but all things
are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be
brought under the power of any.  

<span id="013">13</span> Meats for the [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000.md),
and the [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000.md) for meats: but God shall destroy
both it and them. Now the body is not for
[fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008.md), but for the Lord; and the Lord for
the body.  

<span id="014">14</span> And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will
also raise up us by his own power.  

<span id="015">15</span> Know ye not that your bodies are the members of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)? shall I then take the members of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), and make them the members of an
[harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005.md)? God forbid.  

<span id="016">16</span> What? know ye not that he which is joined to an
[harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005.md) is one body? for two, saith he, shall be
one [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> But he that is joined unto the Lord is one
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> Flee [fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008.md).
Every [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) that a man doeth is without the body;
but he that committeth [fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008.md) sinneth
against his own body.  

<span id="019">19</span> What? know ye not that your body is the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) of the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md) which is in you, which ye have of God,
and ye are not your own?  

<span id="020">20</span> For ye are bought with a price: therefore
[glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005.md) God in your body, and in your
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), which are God's.
