### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> In the twelfth year of
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) began [Hoshea](../ebd/ebd183.htm#006) the
son of [Elah](../ebd/ebd114.htm#002) to reign in
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004) over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
nine years.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of
the LORD, but not as the kings of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) that
were before him.  

<span id="003">3</span> Against him came up Shalmaneser
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005); and
[Hoshea](../ebd/ebd183.htm#006) became his servant, and gave him
presents.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) found conspiracy in
[Hoshea](../ebd/ebd183.htm#006): for he had sent messengers to So
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and
brought no present to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005), as he had done year by year: therefore
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005)
shut him up, and bound him in [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006).  

<span id="005">5</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) came up throughout all the land, and
went up to [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004), and besieged it three
years.  

<span id="006">6</span> In the ninth year of
[Hoshea](../ebd/ebd183.htm#006) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) took [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004),
and carried [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) away into
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005), and placed them in
[Halah](../ebd/ebd159.htm#005) and in [Habor](../ebd/ebd156.htm#008) by
the river of [Gozan](../ebd/ebd153.htm#009), and in the cities of the
Medes.  

<span id="007">7</span> For so it was, that the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) had sinned against the LORD their God,
which had brought them up out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), from under the hand of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and had feared other gods,  

<span id="008">8</span> And walked in the statutes of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), whom the LORD cast out from before the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and of the kings of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which they had made.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) did secretly those things that were not
right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all
their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.  

<span id="010">10</span> And they set them up images and groves in every
high hill, and under every green tree:  

<span id="011">11</span> And there they burnt
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) in all the high places, as did the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005) whom the LORD carried away before them;
and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002):  

<span id="012">12</span> For they served idols, whereof the LORD had
said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing.  

<span id="013">13</span> Yet the LORD testified against
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and against
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), by all the prophets, and by all the
seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and
my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers,
and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.  

<span id="014">14</span> Notwithstanding they would not hear, but
hardened their necks, like to the [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000) of their
fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God.  

<span id="015">15</span> And they rejected his statutes, and his
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) that he made with their fathers, and
his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed
vanity, and became vain, and went after the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005) that were round about them, concerning
whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them.  

<span id="016">16</span> And they left all the commandments of the LORD
their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a
[grove](../ebd/ebd155.htm#008), and worshipped all the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and
served [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004).  

<span id="017">17</span> And they caused their sons and their daughters
to pass through the fire, and used [divination](../ebd/ebd104.htm#009)
and [enchantments](../ebd/ebd120.htm#004), and sold themselves to do
evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002).  

<span id="018">18</span> Therefore the LORD was very angry with
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and removed them out of his sight:
there was none left but the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) only.  

<span id="019">19</span> Also [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) kept not
the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) which they made.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the LORD rejected all the seed of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and afflicted them, and delivered them
into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.  

<span id="021">21</span> For he [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007)
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) from the house of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004); and they made
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) the son of
[Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001): and
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) drave [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
from following the LORD, and made them [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) a
great [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="022">22</span> For the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) walked in all the sins of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) which he did; they departed not from
them;  

<span id="023">23</span> Until the LORD removed
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) out of his sight, as he had said by all
his servants the prophets. So was [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
carried away out of their own land to [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005)
unto this day.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) brought men from
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and from
[Cuthah](../ebd/ebd094.htm#009), and from [Ava](../ebd/ebd036.htm#008),
and from [Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005), and from
[Sepharvaim](../ebd/ebd327.htm#009), and placed them in the cities of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004) instead of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and they possessed
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004), and dwelt in the cities thereof.  

<span id="025">25</span> And so it was at the beginning of their
dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent
[lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001) among them, which slew some of them.  

<span id="026">26</span> Wherefore they spake to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005),
saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004), know not the manner of the God of the
land: therefore he hath sent [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001) among them,
and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God
of the land.  

<span id="027">27</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) commanded, saying, Carry thither one of
the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell
there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.  

<span id="028">28</span> Then one of the priests whom they had carried
away from [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004) came and dwelt in
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006), and taught them how they should fear
the LORD.  

<span id="029">29</span> Howbeit every nation made gods of their own,
and put them in the houses of the high places which the
[Samaritans](../ebd/ebd320.htm#005) had made, every nation in their
cities wherein they dwelt.  

<span id="030">30</span> And the men of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001)
made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made
[Nergal](../ebd/ebd270.htm#009), and the men of
[Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005) made Ashima,  

<span id="031">31</span> And the Avites made
[Nibhaz](../ebd/ebd272.htm#002) and [Tartak](../ebd/ebd359.htm#004), and
the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to
[Adrammelech](../ebd/ebd010.htm#003) and
[Anammelech](../ebd/ebd022.htm#008), the gods of
[Sepharvaim](../ebd/ebd327.htm#009).  

<span id="032">32</span> So they feared the LORD, and made unto
themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which
sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.  

<span id="033">33</span> They feared the LORD, and served their own
gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from
thence.  

<span id="034">34</span> Unto this day they do after the former manners:
they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after
their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD
commanded the children of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), whom he named
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000);  

<span id="035">35</span> With whom the LORD had made a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), and charged them, saying, Ye shall
not fear other gods, nor [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) yourselves to
them, nor serve them, nor [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) to them:  

<span id="036">36</span> But the LORD, who brought you up out of the
land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) with great power and a stretched
out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002), and to him shall ye do
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002).  

<span id="037">37</span> And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the
law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do
for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.  

<span id="038">38</span> And the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) that
I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other
gods.  

<span id="039">39</span> But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he
shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.  

<span id="040">40</span> Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did
after their former manner.  

<span id="041">41</span> So these nations feared the LORD, and served
their graven images, both their children, and their children's children:
as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.
