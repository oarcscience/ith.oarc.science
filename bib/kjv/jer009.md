### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a
[fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md) of tears, that I might weep day and
night for the slain of the daughter of my people!  

<span id="002">2</span> Oh that I had in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) a lodging place of wayfaring men;
that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they be all
adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.  

<span id="003">3</span> And they bend their tongues like their
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) for lies: but they are not valiant for the
truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know
not me, saith the LORD.  

<span id="004">4</span> Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and
trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant,
and every neighbour will walk with slanders.  

<span id="005">5</span> And they will deceive every one his neighbour,
and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak
lies, and weary themselves to commit iniquity.  

<span id="006">6</span> Thine [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md) is in
the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the
LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold,
I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of
my people?  

<span id="008">8</span> Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it
speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth,
but in heart he layeth his wait.  

<span id="009">9</span> Shall I not visit them for these things? saith
the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?  

<span id="010">10</span> For the mountains will I take up a weeping and
wailing, and for the habitations of the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) a
[lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005.md), because they are burned up, so
that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md); both the fowl of the heavens and the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) are fled; they are gone.  

<span id="011">11</span> And I will make
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) heaps, and a
[den](../ebd/ebd101.htm#007.md) of dragons; and I will make the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) desolate, without an inhabitant.  

<span id="012">12</span> Who is the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) man,
that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD
hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth and is
burned up like a [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), that none passeth
through?  

<span id="013">13</span> And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken
my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither
walked therein;  

<span id="014">14</span> But have walked after the imagination of their
own heart, and after [Baalim](../ebd/ebd039.htm#007.md), which their
fathers taught them:  

<span id="015">15</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); Behold, I will feed them, even this
people, with [wormwood](../ebd/ebd384.htm#001.md), and give them water of
[gall](../ebd/ebd142.htm#000) to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> I will scatter them also among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), whom neither they nor their fathers
have known: and I will send a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) after them,
till I have consumed them.  

<span id="017">17</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and
call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning
women, that they may come:  

<span id="018">18</span> And let them make haste, and take up a wailing
for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out
with waters.  

<span id="019">19</span> For a voice of wailing is heard out of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), How are we spoiled! we are greatly
confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our
[dwellings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#001.md) have cast us out.  

<span id="020">20</span> Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and
let your [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) receive the word of his mouth, and
teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour
[lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> For death is come up into our windows, and is
entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, and the
young men from the streets.  

<span id="022">22</span> Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases
of men shall fall as [dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003.md) upon the open field,
and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather them.  

<span id="023">23</span> Thus saith the LORD, Let not the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) man [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) in his
wisdom, neither let the mighty man [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) in his
might, let not the rich man [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) in his
riches:  

<span id="024">24</span> But let him that glorieth
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) in this, that he understandeth and
knoweth me, that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment,
and [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), in the earth: for in these
things I delight, saith the LORD.  

<span id="025">25</span> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I
will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised;  

<span id="026">26</span> [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md), and
the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002.md), and
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), and all that are in the utmost corners,
that dwell in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md): for all these
nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) are uncircumcised in the heart.
