### King James Version: Mark Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> The beginning of the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), the Son of God;  

<span id="002">2</span> As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send
my [messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005.md) before thy face, which shall
prepare thy way before thee.  

<span id="003">3</span> The voice of one crying in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
make his paths straight.  

<span id="004">4</span> John did baptize in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), and preach the baptism of
[repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008.md) for the remission of sins.  

<span id="005">5</span> And there went out unto him all the land of
Judaea, and they of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and were all
baptized of him in the river of [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md),
confessing their sins.  

<span id="006">6</span> And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with
a [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md) of a skin about his loins; and he did
eat locusts and wild [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md);  

<span id="007">7</span> And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier
than I after me, the [latchet](../ebd/ebd224.htm#006.md) of whose shoes I
am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.  

<span id="008">8</span> I indeed have baptized you with water: but he
shall baptize you with the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And it came to pass in those days, that
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) came from
[Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007) of [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md),
and was baptized of John in [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And straightway coming up out of the water, he
saw the heavens opened, and the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) like a
[dove](../ebd/ebd106.htm#007.md) descending upon him:  

<span id="011">11</span> And there came a voice from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in
whom I am well pleased.  

<span id="012">12</span> And immediately the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) driveth him into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And he was there in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) forty days, tempted of
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md); and was with the wild beasts; and the
angels ministered unto him.  

<span id="014">14</span> Now after that John was put in
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006), [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) came
into [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md), preaching the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) of the kingdom of God,  

<span id="015">15</span> And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the
kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> Now as he walked by the sea of
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008), he saw [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md)
and [Andrew](../ebd/ebd023.htm#007.md) his brother casting a
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002.md) into the sea: for they were fishers.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto
them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.  

<span id="018">18</span> And straightway they forsook their nets, and
followed him.  

<span id="019">19</span> And when he had gone a little farther thence,
he saw [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md) the son of
[Zebedee](../ebd/ebd388.htm#008.md), and John his brother, who also were in
the ship mending their nets.  

<span id="020">20</span> And straightway he called them: and they left
their father [Zebedee](../ebd/ebd388.htm#008.md) in the ship with the hired
servants, and went after him.  

<span id="021">21</span> And they went into
[Capernaum](../ebd/ebd071.htm#007.md); and straightway on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) day he entered into the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009.md), and taught.  

<span id="022">22</span> And they were astonished at his doctrine: for
he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And there was in their
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009.md) a man with an unclean
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md); and he cried out,  

<span id="024">24</span> Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with
thee, thou [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) of
[Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007.md)? art thou come to destroy us? I know
thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) rebuked him,
saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.  

<span id="026">26</span> And when the unclean
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) had torn him, and cried with a loud
voice, he came out of him.  

<span id="027">27</span> And they were all amazed, insomuch that they
questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new
doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean
spirits, and they do obey him.  

<span id="028">28</span> And immediately his fame spread abroad
throughout all the region round about
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> And forthwith, when they were come out of the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009.md), they entered into the house of
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004) and [Andrew](../ebd/ebd023.htm#007.md), with
[James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md) and John.  

<span id="030">30</span> But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a
[fever](../ebd/ebd132.htm#009.md), and anon they tell him of her.  

<span id="031">31</span> And he came and took her by the hand, and
lifted her up; and immediately the [fever](../ebd/ebd132.htm#009.md) left
her, and she ministered unto them.  

<span id="032">32</span> And at even, when the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) did set, they brought unto him all that
were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.  

<span id="033">33</span> And all the city was gathered together at the
door.  

<span id="034">34</span> And he healed many that were sick of divers
diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to
speak, because they knew him.  

<span id="035">35</span> And in the morning, rising up a great while
before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there
prayed.  

<span id="036">36</span> And [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md) and they
that were with him followed after him.  

<span id="037">37</span> And when they had found him, they said unto
him, All men seek for thee.  

<span id="038">38</span> And he said unto them, Let us go into the next
towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.  

<span id="039">39</span> And he preached in their synagogues throughout
all [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md), and cast out devils.  

<span id="040">40</span> And there came a leper to him, beseeching him,
and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst
make me [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md).  

<span id="041">41</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), moved with
compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I
will; be thou [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md).  

<span id="042">42</span> And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the
[leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md) departed from him, and he was
cleansed.  

<span id="043">43</span> And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent
him away;  

<span id="044">44</span> And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any
man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), and offer for thy cleansing those
things which [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) commanded, for a
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md) unto them.  

<span id="045">45</span> But he went out, and began to publish it much,
and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) could no more openly enter into the city,
but was without in [desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000.md) places: and they came
to him from every quarter.
