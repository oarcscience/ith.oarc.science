<span id="034">34</span> And we cast the lots among the priests, the
Levites, and the people, for the [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), to bring it into the house of our
God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year,
to burn upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) of the LORD our God, as
it is written in the law:

by year, unto the house of the LORD:  

<span id="036">36</span> Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), as it is written in the law, and the
firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our
God, unto the priests that [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) in the
house of our God:  

<span id="037">37</span> And that we should bring the firstfruits of our
[dough](../ebd/ebd106.htm#006.md), and our offerings, and the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of all manner of trees, of
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) and of oil, unto the priests, to the
chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground unto the
Levites, that the same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities
of our tillage.  

<span id="038">38</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) the son
of [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) shall be with the Levites, when the
Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up the
[tithe](../ebd/ebd368.htm#005.md) of the tithes unto the house of our God,
to the chambers, into the treasure house.  

<span id="039">39</span> For the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) and the children of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006.md) shall bring the
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of the [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md),
of the new [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), and the oil, unto the
chambers, where are the vessels of the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md), and the priests that
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md), and the porters, and the singers: and
we will not forsake the house of our God.
