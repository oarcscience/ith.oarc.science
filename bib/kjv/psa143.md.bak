### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 143

<span id="001">1</span> Hear my [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md), O LORD,
give [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) to my supplications: in thy
faithfulness answer me, and in thy
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And enter not into judgment with thy servant:
for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.  

<span id="003">3</span> For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath
smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), as those that have been long dead.  

<span id="004">4</span> Therefore is my [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md)
overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.  

<span id="005">5</span> I remember the days of old; I meditate on all
thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.  

<span id="006">6</span> I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul
thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Hear me speedily, O LORD: my
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest
I be like unto them that go down into the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the
morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I
should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.  

<span id="009">9</span> Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee
unto thee to hide me.  

<span id="010">10</span> Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God:
thy [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) is good; lead me into the land of
uprightness.  

<span id="011">11</span> Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for
thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.  

<span id="012">12</span> And of thy [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) cut
off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am
thy servant.
