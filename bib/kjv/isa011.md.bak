### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem
of [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005), and a [Branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002.md)
shall grow out of his roots:  

<span id="002">2</span> And the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the
LORD shall rest upon him, the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of wisdom
and understanding, the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of counsel and
might, the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of knowledge and of the fear
of the LORD;  

<span id="003">3</span> And shall make him of quick understanding in the
fear of the LORD: and he shall not [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) after
the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:  

<span id="004">4</span> But with [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md)
shall he [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), and reprove with equity for the meek of
the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and
with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) shall
be the [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md) of his loins, and faithfulness
the [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md) of his
[reins](../ebd/ebd310.htm#001.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> The [wolf](../ebd/ebd383.htm#001.md) also shall
dwell with the [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md), and the
[leopard](../ebd/ebd227.htm#002.md) shall lie down with the kid; and the
[calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004.md) and the young lion and the
[fatling](../ebd/ebd131.htm#008.md) together; and a little child shall lead
them.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [cow](../ebd/ebd092.htm#001.md) and the
bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion
shall eat [straw](../ebd/ebd352.htm#000.md) like the
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And the sucking child shall play on the hole of
the [asp](../ebd/ebd035.htm#000.md), and the weaned child shall put his
hand on the cockatrice' [den](../ebd/ebd101.htm#007.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy
mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as
the waters cover the sea.  

<span id="010">10</span> And in that day there shall be a root of
[Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005.md), which shall stand for an
[ensign](../ebd/ebd121.htm#008.md) of the people; to it shall the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) seek: and his rest shall be
glorious.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the
Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of
his people, which shall be left, from [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md),
and from [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and from
[Pathros](../ebd/ebd286.htm#007.md), and from
[Cush](../ebd/ebd094.htm#005), and from [Elam](../ebd/ebd114.htm#003.md),
and from Shinar, and from [Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005.md), and from the
islands of the sea.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he shall set up an
[ensign](../ebd/ebd121.htm#008.md) for the nations, and shall assemble the
outcasts of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and gather together the
dispersed of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) from the four corners of the
earth.  

<span id="013">13</span> The envy also of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) shall depart, and the adversaries of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) shall be cut off:
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) shall not envy
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) shall
not vex [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> But they shall [fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004.md)
upon the shoulders of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) toward
the west; they shall spoil them of the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md)
together: they shall lay their hand upon [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md)
and [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md); and the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002.md) shall obey them.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue
of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand
over the river, and shall smite it in the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
streams, and make men go over dryshod.  

<span id="016">16</span> And there shall be an
[highway](../ebd/ebd178.htm#005.md) for the remnant of his people, which
shall be left, from [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md); like as it was to
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) in the day that he came up out of the
land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).
