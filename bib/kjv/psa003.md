### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Lord, how are they increased that trouble me!
many are they that rise up against me.  

<span id="002">2</span> Many there be which say of my soul, There is no
help for him in God. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> But thou, O LORD, art a
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001.md) for me; my
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), and the lifter up of mine head.  

<span id="004">4</span> I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he
heard me out of his holy hill. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD
sustained me.  

<span id="006">6</span> I will not be afraid of ten
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md) of people, that have set themselves
against me round about.  

<span id="007">7</span> Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast
smitten all mine enemies upon the [cheek](../ebd/ebd078.htm#004.md) bone;
thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.  

<span id="008">8</span> [Salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) belongeth
unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).
