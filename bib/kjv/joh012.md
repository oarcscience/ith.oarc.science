### King James Version: John Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> Then [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) six days
before the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md) came to
[Bethany](../ebd/ebd054.htm#007), where [Lazarus](../ebd/ebd225.htm#003.md)
was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.  

<span id="002">2</span> There they made him a
[supper](../ebd/ebd353.htm#004); and [Martha](../ebd/ebd242.htm#007.md)
served: but [Lazarus](../ebd/ebd225.htm#003.md) was one of them that sat at
the table with him.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then took [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md) a
[pound](../ebd/ebd299.htm#008) of [ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007.md) of
[spikenard](../ebd/ebd349.htm#008.md), very costly, and anointed the feet
of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), and wiped his feet with her hair: and
the house was filled with the odour of the
[ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Then saith one of his disciples,
[Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001) [Iscariot](../ebd/ebd190.htm#000.md),
Simon's son, which should betray him,  

<span id="005">5</span> Why was not this
[ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007.md) sold for three hundred pence, and
given to the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md)?  

<span id="006">6</span> This he said, not that he cared for the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md); but because he was a thief, and had the
[bag](../ebd/ebd041.htm#008.md), and bare what was put therein.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then said [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), Let
her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.  

<span id="008">8</span> For the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) always ye
have with you; but me ye have not always.  

<span id="009">9</span> Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he
was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might
see [Lazarus](../ebd/ebd225.htm#003.md) also, whom he had raised from the
dead.  

<span id="010">10</span> But the chief priests consulted that they might
put [Lazarus](../ebd/ebd225.htm#003.md) also to death;  

<span id="011">11</span> Because that by reason of him many of the Jews
went away, and believed on [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> On the next day much people that were come to
the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md), when they heard that
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) was coming to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md),  

<span id="013">13</span> Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to
meet him, and cried, [Hosanna](../ebd/ebd183.htm#001.md): Blessed is the
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) that
cometh in the name of the Lord.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), when he had
found a young [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md), sat thereon; as it is
written,  

<span id="015">15</span> Fear not, daughter of
[Sion](../ebd/ebd345.htm#003): behold, thy [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
cometh, [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md) on an ass's colt.  

<span id="016">16</span> These things understood not his disciples at
the first: but when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) was glorified, then
remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had
done these things unto him.  

<span id="017">17</span> The people therefore that was with him when he
called [Lazarus](../ebd/ebd225.htm#003.md) out of his
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md), and raised him from the dead, bare
record.  

<span id="018">18</span> For this cause the people also met him, for
that they heard that he had done this
[miracle](../ebd/ebd256.htm#002.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> The [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md)
therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing?
behold, the world is gone after him.  

<span id="020">20</span> And there were certain Greeks among them that
came up to [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) at the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md):  

<span id="021">21</span> The same came therefore to
[Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008.md), which was of
[Bethsaida](../ebd/ebd056.htm#009) of [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md),
and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008.md) cometh and
telleth [Andrew](../ebd/ebd023.htm#007.md): and again
[Andrew](../ebd/ebd023.htm#007) and [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008.md) tell
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered
them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be
glorified.  

<span id="024">24</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) of [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md) fall
into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth
forth much [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he
that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.  

<span id="026">26</span> If any man serve me, let him follow me; and
where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him
will my Father honour.  

<span id="027">27</span> Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?
Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this
hour.  

<span id="028">28</span> Father, [glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005.md) thy
name. Then came there a voice from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md),
saying, I have both glorified it, and will
[glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005.md) it again.  

<span id="029">29</span> The people therefore, that stood by, and heard
it, said that it thundered: others said, An
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) spake to him.  

<span id="030">30</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered and
said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.  

<span id="031">31</span> Now is the judgment of this world: now shall
the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) of this world be cast out.  

<span id="032">32</span> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will
draw all men unto me.  

<span id="033">33</span> This he said, signifying what death he should
die.  

<span id="034">34</span> The people answered him, We have heard out of
the law that [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) abideth for ever: and how
sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?  

<span id="035">35</span> Then [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto
them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the
light, lest [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) come upon you: for he that
walketh in [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) knoweth not whither he
goeth.  

<span id="036">36</span> While ye have light, believe in the light, that
ye may be the children of light. These things spake
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), and departed, and did hide himself from
them.  

<span id="037">37</span> But though he had done so many miracles before
them, yet they believed not on him:  

<span id="038">38</span> That the saying of
[Esaias](../ebd/ebd124.htm#003) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md)
might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report?
and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?  

<span id="039">39</span> Therefore they could not believe, because that
[Esaias](../ebd/ebd124.htm#003.md) said again,  

<span id="040">40</span> He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their
heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with
their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.  

<span id="041">41</span> These things said
[Esaias](../ebd/ebd124.htm#003.md), when he saw his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), and spake of him.  

<span id="042">42</span> Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many
believed on him; but because of the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md)
they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009.md):  

<span id="043">43</span> For they loved the praise of men more than the
praise of God.  

<span id="044">44</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) cried and said,
He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.  

<span id="045">45</span> And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.  

<span id="046">46</span> I am come a light into the world, that
whosoever believeth on me should not abide in
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md).  

<span id="047">47</span> And if any man hear my words, and believe not,
I [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) him not: for I came not to
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) the world, but to save the world.  

<span id="048">48</span> He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my
words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same
shall [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) him in the last day.  

<span id="049">49</span> For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father
which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I
should speak.  

<span id="050">50</span> And I know that his commandment is life
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md): whatsoever I speak therefore, even
as the Father said unto me, so I speak.
