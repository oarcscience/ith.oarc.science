### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) and to
his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and that they profane not
my holy name in those things which they [hallow](../ebd/ebd160.htm#001)
unto me: I am the LORD.  

<span id="003">3</span> Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed
among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
[hallow](../ebd/ebd160.htm#001) unto the LORD, having his uncleanness
upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.  

<span id="004">4</span> What man soever of the seed of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) is a leper, or hath a running issue; he
shall not eat of the holy things, until he be
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005). And whoso toucheth any thing that is
unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;  

<span id="005">5</span> Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing,
whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take
uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;  

<span id="006">6</span> The soul which hath touched any such shall be
unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash
his [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) with water.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) is
down, he shall be [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005), and shall afterward
eat of the holy things; because it is his food.  

<span id="008">8</span> That which dieth of itself, or is torn with
beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD.  

<span id="009">9</span> They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest
they bear [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) for it, and die therefore, if
they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.  

<span id="010">10</span> There shall no
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of
the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), or an hired servant, shall not eat
of the holy thing.  

<span id="011">11</span> But if the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) buy
any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his
house: they shall eat of his meat.  

<span id="012">12</span> If the priest's daughter also be married unto a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), she may not eat of an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of the holy things.  

<span id="013">13</span> But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or
divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as
in her youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall be no
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) eat thereof.  

<span id="014">14</span> And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly,
then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto
the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) with the holy thing.  

<span id="015">15</span> And they shall not profane the holy things of
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which they offer unto
the LORD;  

<span id="016">16</span> Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of
trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify
them.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="018">18</span> Speak unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), and
to his sons, and unto all the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of
the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), or of the strangers in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that will offer his oblation for all
his [vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001), and for all his freewill offerings,
which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001);  

<span id="019">19</span> Ye shall offer at your own will a male without
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007), of the
[beeves](../ebd/ebd051.htm#000), of the [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005),
or of the goats.  

<span id="020">20</span> But whatsoever hath a
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007), that shall ye not offer: for it shall
not be acceptable for you.  

<span id="021">21</span> And whosoever offereth a
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of peace offerings unto the LORD to
accomplish his vow, or a freewill [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) in
[beeves](../ebd/ebd051.htm#000) or [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), it
shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007) therein.  

<span id="022">22</span> [Blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009), or broken, or
maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these
unto the LORD, nor make an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) by fire of
them upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) unto the LORD.  

<span id="023">23</span> Either a [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) or a
[lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003) that hath any thing superfluous or lacking
in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001); but for a vow it shall not be
accepted.  

<span id="024">24</span> Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is
bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) thereof in your land.  

<span id="025">25</span> Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer
the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) of your God of any of these; because
their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be
accepted for you.  

<span id="026">26</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="027">27</span> When a [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003), or a
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), or a [goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001), is
brought forth, then it shall be [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days
under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be
accepted for an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) made by fire unto the
LORD.  

<span id="028">28</span> And whether it be [cow](../ebd/ebd092.htm#001),
or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.  

<span id="029">29</span> And when ye will offer a
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of thanksgiving unto the LORD, offer
it at your own will.  

<span id="030">30</span> On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall
leave none of it until the morrow: I am the LORD.  

<span id="031">31</span> Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do
them: I am the LORD.  

<span id="032">32</span> Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I
will be hallowed among the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000):
I am the LORD which [hallow](../ebd/ebd160.htm#001) you,  

<span id="033">33</span> That brought you out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), to be your God: I am the LORD.
