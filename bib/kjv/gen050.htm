</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And they sent a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> saw Ephraim's children of the third <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>: the children also of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd235.htm#006">Machir</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A> were brought up upon Joseph's knees.<BR>
