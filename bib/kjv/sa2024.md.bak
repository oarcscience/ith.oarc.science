### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> And again the [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) of
the LORD was kindled against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and he
moved [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) against them to say, Go, number
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> For the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said to
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) the captain of the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md), which was with him, Go now through all
the tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), from
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009) even to [Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008.md),
and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) said unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), Now the LORD thy God add unto the people,
how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) may see it: but why doth my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) delight in this thing?  

<span id="004">4</span> Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed
against [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md), and against the captains of the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007). And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) and the
captains of the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) went out from the presence
of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), to number the people of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And they passed over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), and pitched in
[Aroer](../ebd/ebd032.htm#001.md), on the right side of the city that lieth
in the midst of the river of [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md), and toward
Jazer:  

<span id="006">6</span> Then they came to
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md), and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and
they came to Danjaan, and about to [Zidon](../ebd/ebd393.htm#000.md),  

<span id="007">7</span> And came to the strong hold of
[Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001.md), and to all the cities of the
[Hivites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#007.md), and of the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007.md): and they went out to the south of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), even to
[Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> So when they had gone through all the land, they
came to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) at the end of nine months and
twenty days.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) gave up the
sum of the number of the people unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md):
and there were in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) eight hundred thousand
valiant men that drew the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md); and the men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) were five hundred thousand men.  

<span id="010">10</span> And David's heart smote him after that he had
numbered the people. And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said unto the
LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech
thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done
very foolishly.  

<span id="011">11</span> For when [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) was up
in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md), David's
[seer](../ebd/ebd326.htm#000.md), saying,  

<span id="012">12</span> Go and say unto [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md),
Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them,
that I may do it unto thee.  

<span id="013">13</span> So [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md) came to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and told him, and said unto him, Shall
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) years of [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md)
come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine
enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence
in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that
sent me.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said unto
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md), I am in a great strait: let us fall now
into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not
fall into the hand of man.  

<span id="015">15</span> So the LORD sent a pestilence upon
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) from the morning even to the time
appointed: and there died of the people from
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009) even to [Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008.md)
seventy thousand men.  

<span id="016">16</span> And when the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md)
stretched out his hand upon [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) to
destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) that destroyed the people, It is enough:
stay now thine hand. And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the LORD
was by the threshingplace of [Araunah](../ebd/ebd028.htm#006.md) the
Jebusite.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) spake unto
the LORD when he saw the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) that smote the
people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), what have they done? let thine hand, I
pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md) came that day
to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and said unto him, Go up, rear an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of
[Araunah](../ebd/ebd028.htm#006.md) the Jebusite.  

<span id="019">19</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), according
to the saying of [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md), went up as the LORD
commanded.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Araunah](../ebd/ebd028.htm#006.md) looked,
and saw the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) and his servants coming on
toward him: and [Araunah](../ebd/ebd028.htm#006.md) went out, and bowed
himself before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) on his face upon the
ground.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Araunah](../ebd/ebd028.htm#006.md) said,
Wherefore is my lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) come to his
servant? And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said, To buy the
threshingfloor of thee, to build an [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) unto
the LORD, that the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) may be stayed from
the people.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Araunah](../ebd/ebd028.htm#006.md) said unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), Let my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) take and offer up what seemeth good unto
him: behold, here be oxen for burnt [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md),
and [threshing](../ebd/ebd364.htm#009.md) instruments and other instruments
of the oxen for [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> All these things did
[Araunah](../ebd/ebd028.htm#006), as a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),
give unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md). And
[Araunah](../ebd/ebd028.htm#006.md) said unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), The LORD thy God accept thee.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said unto
[Araunah](../ebd/ebd028.htm#006.md), Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee
at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of
that which doth cost me nothing. So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) built there
an [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) unto the LORD, and offered burnt
offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land,
and the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) was stayed from
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).
