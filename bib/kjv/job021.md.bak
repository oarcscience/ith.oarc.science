### King James Version: Job Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> But Job answered and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your
consolations.  

<span id="003">3</span> Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I
have spoken, mock on.  

<span id="004">4</span> As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it
were so, why should not my [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) be
troubled?  

<span id="005">5</span> Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand
upon your mouth.  

<span id="006">6</span> Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling
taketh hold on my [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea,
are mighty in power?  

<span id="008">8</span> Their seed is established in their sight with
them, and their offspring before their eyes.  

<span id="009">9</span> Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the
rod of God upon them.  

<span id="010">10</span> Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their
[cow](../ebd/ebd092.htm#001.md) calveth, and casteth not her
[calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> They send forth their little ones like a flock,
and their children [dance](../ebd/ebd097.htm#000.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> They take the [timbrel](../ebd/ebd366.htm#004.md)
and [harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001.md), and rejoice at the sound of the
[organ](../ebd/ebd280.htm#004.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> They spend their days in wealth, and in a
moment go down to the [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us;
for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.  

<span id="015">15</span> What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?
and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?  

<span id="016">16</span> Lo, their good is not in their hand: the
counsel of the wicked is far from me.  

<span id="017">17</span> How oft is the [candle](../ebd/ebd071.htm#000.md)
of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md) upon them! God distributeth sorrows
in his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> They are as stubble before the wind, and as
[chaff](../ebd/ebd075.htm#007.md) that the storm carrieth away.  

<span id="019">19</span> God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he
rewardeth him, and he shall know it.  

<span id="020">20</span> His eyes shall see his
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md), and he shall
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) of the wrath of the Almighty.  

<span id="021">21</span> For what pleasure hath he in his house after
him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?  

<span id="022">22</span> Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he
judgeth those that are high.  

<span id="023">23</span> One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at
ease and quiet.  

<span id="024">24</span> His breasts are full of
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000.md), and his bones are moistened with
marrow.  

<span id="025">25</span> And another dieth in the bitterness of his
soul, and never eateth with pleasure.  

<span id="026">26</span> They shall lie down alike in the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md), and the worms shall cover them.  

<span id="027">27</span> Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices
which ye wrongfully imagine against me.  

<span id="028">28</span> For ye say, Where is the house of the
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md)? and where are the dwelling places of
the wicked?  

<span id="029">29</span> Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and
do ye not know their tokens,  

<span id="030">30</span> That the wicked is reserved to the day of
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md)? they shall be brought forth to the
day of wrath.  

<span id="031">31</span> Who shall declare his way to his face? and who
shall repay him what he hath done?  

<span id="032">32</span> Yet shall he be brought to the
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md), and shall remain in the tomb.  

<span id="033">33</span> The clods of the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) shall be sweet unto him, and every man
shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.  

<span id="034">34</span> How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your
answers there remaineth falsehood?
