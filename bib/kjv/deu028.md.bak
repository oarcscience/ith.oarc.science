### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 28

<span id="001">1</span> And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken
diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all
his commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God
will set thee on high above all nations of the earth:  

<span id="002">2</span> And all these blessings shall come on thee, and
overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy
God.  

<span id="003">3</span> Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed
shalt thou be in the field.  

<span id="004">4</span> Blessed shall be the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of thy body, and the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of thy ground, and the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of thy [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md),
the increase of thy [kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000.md), and the flocks of thy
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Blessed shall be thy
[basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009.md) and thy store.  

<span id="006">6</span> Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and
blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out.  

<span id="007">7</span> The LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up
against thee to be smitten before thy face: they shall come out against
thee one way, and flee before thee [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
ways.  

<span id="008">8</span> The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in
thy storehouses, and in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and he
shall [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) thee in the land which the LORD thy
God giveth thee.  

<span id="009">9</span> The LORD shall establish thee an holy people
unto himself, as he hath sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the
commandments of the LORD thy God, and walk in his ways.  

<span id="010">10</span> And all people of the earth shall see that thou
art called by the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in
goods, in the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of thy body, and in the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of thy [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md),
and in the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of thy ground, in the land
which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give thee.  

<span id="012">12</span> The LORD shall open unto thee his good
treasure, the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) to give the
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) unto thy land in his season, and to
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) all the work of thine hand: and thou
shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not
[borrow](../ebd/ebd062.htm#007.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And the LORD shall make thee the head, and not
the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath;
if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God, which I
command thee this day, to observe and to do them:  

<span id="014">14</span> And thou shalt not go aside from any of the
words which I command thee this day, to the right hand, or to the left,
to go after other gods to serve them.  

<span id="015">15</span> But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not
hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his
commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all
these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee:  

<span id="016">16</span> Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed
shalt thou be in the field.  

<span id="017">17</span> Cursed shall be thy
[basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009.md) and thy store.  

<span id="018">18</span> Cursed shall be the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of thy body, and the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of thy land, the increase of thy
[kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000.md), and the flocks of thy
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and
cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out.  

<span id="020">20</span> The LORD shall send upon thee cursing,
vexation, and rebuke, in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to
do, until thou be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of
the wickedness of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me.  

<span id="021">21</span> The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto
thee, until he have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest
to possess it.  

<span id="022">22</span> The LORD shall smite thee with a consumption,
and with a [fever](../ebd/ebd132.htm#009.md), and with an inflammation, and
with an extreme burning, and with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md),
and with blasting, and with [mildew](../ebd/ebd254.htm#007.md); and they
shall pursue thee until thou perish.  

<span id="023">23</span> And thy [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) that is
over thy head shall be [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md), and the earth
that is under thee shall be [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> The LORD shall make the
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) of thy land powder and
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008): from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)
shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.  

<span id="025">25</span> The LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before
thine enemies: thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) ways before them: and shalt be removed
into all the kingdoms of the earth.  

<span id="026">26</span> And thy [carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md) shall
be meat unto all fowls of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth, and
no man shall fray them away.  

<span id="027">27</span> The LORD will smite thee with the
[botch](../ebd/ebd063.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and
with the emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou
canst not be healed.  

<span id="028">28</span> The LORD shall smite thee with
[madness](../ebd/ebd236.htm#002.md), and blindness, and astonishment of
heart:  

<span id="029">29</span> And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md) gropeth in
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), and thou shalt not prosper in thy
ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man
shall save thee.  

<span id="030">30</span> Thou shalt [betroth](../ebd/ebd057.htm#005.md) a
wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build an house, and
thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not
gather the grapes thereof.  

<span id="031">31</span> Thine [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007.md) shall be
slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof: thine
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md) shall be violently taken away from before
thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) shall be given unto thine enemies, and
thou shalt have none to rescue them.  

<span id="032">32</span> Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto
another people, and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for
them all the day long; and there shall be no might in thine hand.  

<span id="033">33</span> The [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of thy land,
and all thy labours, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and
thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway:  

<span id="034">34</span> So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of
thine eyes which thou shalt see.  

<span id="035">35</span> The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in
the legs, with a sore [botch](../ebd/ebd063.htm#001.md) that cannot be
healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head.  

<span id="036">36</span> The LORD shall bring thee, and thy
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) which thou shalt set over thee, unto a
nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known; and there shalt
thou serve other gods, [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) and
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md).  

<span id="037">37</span> And thou shalt become an astonishment, a
[proverb](../ebd/ebd301.htm#002.md), and a byword, among all nations
whither the LORD shall lead thee.  

<span id="038">38</span> Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field,
and shalt gather but little in; for the [locust](../ebd/ebd231.htm#000.md)
shall consume it.  

<span id="039">39</span> Thou shalt plant vineyards, and
[dress](../ebd/ebd107.htm#008.md) them, but shalt neither
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of the [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), nor
gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat them.  

<span id="040">40</span> Thou shalt have [olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009.md)
trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou shalt not
[anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008.md) thyself with the oil; for thine
[olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009.md) shall cast his
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md).  

<span id="041">41</span> Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou
shalt not enjoy them; for they shall go into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md).  

<span id="042">42</span> All thy trees and
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of thy land shall the
[locust](../ebd/ebd231.htm#000.md) consume.  

<span id="043">43</span> The [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) that is
within thee shall get up above thee very high; and thou shalt come down
very low.  

<span id="044">44</span> He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend
to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.  

<span id="045">45</span> Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee,
and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed;
because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep
his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee:  

<span id="046">46</span> And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for
a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.  

<span id="047">47</span> Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with
joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all
things;  

<span id="048">48</span> Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which
the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in
nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) of [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md) upon thy
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md), until he have destroyed thee.  

<span id="049">49</span> The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from
far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the
[eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003.md) flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt
not understand;  

<span id="050">50</span> A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not
regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young:  

<span id="051">51</span> And he shall eat the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of thy [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md),
and the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of thy land, until thou be
destroyed: which also shall not leave thee either
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006), [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), or oil, or
the increase of thy [kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000.md), or flocks of thy
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), until he have destroyed thee.  

<span id="052">52</span> And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates,
until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst,
throughout all thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates
throughout all thy land, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.  

<span id="053">53</span> And thou shalt eat the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of thine own body, the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of thy sons and of thy daughters, which
the LORD thy God hath given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness,
wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee:  

<span id="054">54</span> So that the man that is tender among you, and
very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the
wife of his [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md), and toward the remnant of
his children which he shall leave:  

<span id="055">55</span> So that he will not give to any of them of the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of his children whom he shall eat:
because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness,
wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.  

<span id="056">56</span> The tender and delicate woman among you, which
would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for
delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of
her [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md), and toward her son, and toward her
daughter,  

<span id="057">57</span> And toward her young one that cometh out from
between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she
shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and
straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.  

<span id="058">58</span> If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of
this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this
glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;  

<span id="059">59</span> Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful,
and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long
continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.  

<span id="060">60</span> Moreover he will bring upon thee all the
diseases of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), which thou wast afraid of;
and they shall cleave unto thee.  

<span id="061">61</span> Also every sickness, and every
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md), which is not written in the book of
this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.  

<span id="062">62</span> And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye
were as the [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) for multitude; because thou wouldest not
obey the voice of the LORD thy God.  

<span id="063">63</span> And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD
rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will
rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye
shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.  

<span id="064">64</span> And the LORD shall scatter thee among all
people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there
thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have
known, even [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) and
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md).  

<span id="065">65</span> And among these nations shalt thou find no
ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall
give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of
mind:  

<span id="066">66</span> And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee;
and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none
[assurance](../ebd/ebd035.htm#004.md) of thy life:  

<span id="067">67</span> In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it
were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for
the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of
thine eyes which thou shalt see.  

<span id="068">68</span> And the LORD shall bring thee into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) again with
[ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003.md), by the way whereof I spake unto thee,
Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your
enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.
