### King James Version: Zephaniah Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> Gather yourselves together, yea, gather
together, O nation not desired;  

<span id="002">2</span> Before the decree bring forth, before the day
pass as the [chaff](../ebd/ebd075.htm#007), before the fierce
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) of the LORD come upon you, before the day
of the LORD's [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) come upon you.  

<span id="003">3</span> Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth,
which have wrought his judgment; seek
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), seek
[meekness](../ebd/ebd246.htm#003): it may be ye shall be hid in the day
of the LORD's [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002).  

<span id="004">4</span> For [Gaza](../ebd/ebd144.htm#003) shall be
forsaken, and [Ashkelon](../ebd/ebd034.htm#001) a desolation: they shall
drive out [Ashdod](../ebd/ebd033.htm#006) at the noon day, and
[Ekron](../ebd/ebd114.htm#001) shall be rooted up.  

<span id="005">5</span> Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the
nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005), the land of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), I will even destroy thee, that
there shall be no inhabitant.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the sea coast shall be
[dwellings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#001) and cottages for shepherds, and folds
for flocks.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the coast shall be for the remnant of the
house of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007); they shall feed thereupon: in
the houses of [Ashkelon](../ebd/ebd034.htm#001) shall they lie down in
the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away
their [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002).  

<span id="008">8</span> I have heard the reproach of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), and the revilings of the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002), whereby they have reproached my people,
and magnified themselves against their border.  

<span id="009">9</span> Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts,
the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Surely
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005) shall be as
[Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004), and the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) as [Gomorrah](../ebd/ebd152.htm#007),
even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation:
the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people
shall possess them.  

<span id="010">10</span> This shall they have for their pride, because
they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the
LORD of hosts.  

<span id="011">11</span> The LORD will be terrible unto them: for he
will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) him, every one from his place, even all
the isles of the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005).  

<span id="012">12</span> Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="013">13</span> And he will stretch out his hand against the
north, and destroy [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005); and will make
[Nineveh](../ebd/ebd273.htm#006) a desolation, and dry like a
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005).  

<span id="014">14</span> And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her,
all the beasts of the nations: both the
[cormorant](../ebd/ebd090.htm#005) and the
[bittern](../ebd/ebd060.htm#000) shall [lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002) in
the upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the windows;
desolation shall be in the thresholds; for he shall uncover the
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007) work.  

<span id="015">15</span> This is the rejoicing city that dwelt
carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none beside me:
how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every
one that passeth by her shall [hiss](../ebd/ebd179.htm#005), and wag his
hand.
