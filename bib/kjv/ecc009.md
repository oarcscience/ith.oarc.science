### King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> For all this I considered in my heart even to
declare all this, that the righteous, and the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), and their works, are in the hand of God:
no man knoweth either love or [hatred](../ebd/ebd167.htm#002) by all
that is before them.  

<span id="002">2</span> All things come alike to all: there is one event
to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005), and to the unclean; to him that
sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the
sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000).  

<span id="003">3</span> This is an evil among all things that are done
under the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), that there is one event unto
all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and
[madness](../ebd/ebd236.htm#002) is in their heart while they live, and
after that they go to the dead.  

<span id="004">4</span> For to him that is joined to all the living
there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.  

<span id="005">5</span> For the living know that they shall die: but the
dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the
memory of them is forgotten.  

<span id="006">6</span> Also their love, and their
[hatred](../ebd/ebd167.htm#002), and their envy, is now perished;
neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done
under the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001).  

<span id="007">7</span> Go thy way, eat thy
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) with joy, and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) thy [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) with a
merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.  

<span id="008">8</span> Let thy garments be always white; and let thy
head lack no [ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007).  

<span id="009">9</span> Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all
the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), all the days of thy vanity: for that is
thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001).  

<span id="010">10</span> Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with
thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom,
in the [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008), whither thou goest.  

<span id="011">11</span> I returned, and saw under the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), that the race is not to the swift, nor the
battle to the strong, neither yet [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) to the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), nor yet riches to men of understanding,
nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them
all.  

<span id="012">12</span> For man also knoweth not his time: as the
fishes that are taken in an evil [net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002), and as
the birds that are caught in the [snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009); so are
the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon
them.  

<span id="013">13</span> This wisdom have I seen also under the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), and it seemed great unto me:  

<span id="014">14</span> There was a little city, and few men within it;
and there came a great [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) against it, and
besieged it, and built great [bulwarks](../ebd/ebd066.htm#005) against
it:  

<span id="015">15</span> Now there was found in it a
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) man, and he
by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) man.  

<span id="016">16</span> Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength:
nevertheless the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) man's wisdom is despised,
and his words are not heard.  

<span id="017">17</span> The words of [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) men
are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.  

<span id="018">18</span> Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one
sinner destroyeth much good.
