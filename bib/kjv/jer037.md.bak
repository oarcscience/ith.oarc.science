### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 37

<span id="001">1</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008.md) the son of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008.md) reigned instead of Coniah the son of
[Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001.md), whom
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) made [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) in
the land of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people
of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by
the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md)
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) sent [Jehucal](../ebd/ebd202.htm#008.md) the
son of [Shelemiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#001.md) and
[Zephaniah](../ebd/ebd390.htm#008.md) the son of
[Maaseiah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#007) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) to
the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md),
saying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us.  

<span id="004">4</span> Now [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) came in
and went out among the people: for they had not put him into
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): and when the Chaldeans that besieged
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) heard tidings of them, they departed
from [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Then came the word of the LORD unto the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md)
saying,  

<span id="007">7</span> Thus saith the LORD, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); Thus shall ye say to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), that
sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come
forth to help you, shall return to [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) into
their own land.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight
against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.  

<span id="009">9</span> Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves,
saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not
depart.  

<span id="010">10</span> For though ye had smitten the whole army of the
Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men
among them, yet should they rise up every man in his
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md), and burn this city with fire.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it came to pass, that when the army of the
Chaldeans was broken up from [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) for fear
of Pharaoh's army,  

<span id="012">12</span> Then [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) went
forth out of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) to go into the land of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md), to separate himself thence in the
midst of the people.  

<span id="013">13</span> And when he was in the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md), a
captain of the [ward](../ebd/ebd379.htm#001.md) was there, whose name was
Irijah, the son of [Shelemiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#001.md), the son of
[Hananiah](../ebd/ebd162.htm#004.md); and he took
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md),
saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then said [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md), It
is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him:
so Irijah took [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md), and brought him to the
princes.  

<span id="015">15</span> Wherefore the princes were wroth with
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md), and smote him, and put him in
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md) in the house of
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) the scribe: for they had made that the
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> When [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) was
entered into the [dungeon](../ebd/ebd109.htm#006.md), and into the
[cabins](../ebd/ebd068.htm#000), and [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md)
had remained there many days;  

<span id="017">17</span> Then [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) sent, and took him out: and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) asked him secretly in his house, and said,
Is there any word from the LORD? And [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md)
said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> Moreover [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) said
unto [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008.md),
What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against
this people, that ye have put me in [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md)?  

<span id="019">19</span> Where are now your prophets which prophesied
unto you, saying, The [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md) shall not come against you, nor against
this land?  

<span id="020">20</span> Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md): let my supplication, I pray thee, be
accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) the scribe, lest I die there.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) commanded that they should commit
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) into the court of the
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md), and that they should give him daily a
piece of [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) out of the bakers' street, until
all the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) in the city were spent. Thus
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) remained in the court of the
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md).
