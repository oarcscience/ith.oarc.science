### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 41

<span id="001">1</span> Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the
people renew their strength: let them come near; then let them speak:
let us come near together to judgment.  

<span id="002">2</span> Who raised up the righteous man from the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md), called him to his foot, gave the nations
before him, and made him rule over kings? he gave them as the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) to his [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), and
as driven stubble to his [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the
way that he had not gone with his feet.  

<span id="004">4</span> Who hath wrought and done it,
[calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007.md) the generations from the beginning? I
the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.  

<span id="005">5</span> The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the
earth were afraid, drew near, and came.  

<span id="006">6</span> They helped every one his neighbour; and every
one said to his brother, Be of good courage.  

<span id="007">7</span> So the [carpenter](../ebd/ebd072.htm#009.md)
encouraged the [goldsmith](../ebd/ebd152.htm#003.md), and he that smootheth
with the [hammer](../ebd/ebd161.htm#000.md) him that smote the
[anvil](../ebd/ebd025.htm#007.md), saying, It is ready for the sodering:
and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.  

<span id="008">8</span> But thou, [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), art
my servant, [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) whom I have
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md), the seed of
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) my friend.  

<span id="009">9</span> Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the
earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee,
Thou art my servant; I have [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) thee, and
not cast thee away.  

<span id="010">10</span> Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not
dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help
thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Behold, all they that were incensed against
thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they
that strive with thee shall perish.  

<span id="012">12</span> Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them,
even them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be
as nothing, and as a thing of nought.  

<span id="013">13</span> For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right
hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.  

<span id="014">14</span> Fear not, thou [worm](../ebd/ebd384.htm#000.md)
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and ye men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); I will help thee, saith the LORD, and
thy [redeemer](../ebd/ebd308.htm#008.md), the Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> Behold, I will make thee a new sharp
[threshing](../ebd/ebd364.htm#009.md) instrument having teeth: thou shalt
thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as
[chaff](../ebd/ebd075.htm#007.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> Thou shalt [fan](../ebd/ebd131.htm#001.md) them,
and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter
them: and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, and shalt
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) in the Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> When the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) and
needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for
thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) will not forsake them.  

<span id="018">18</span> I will open rivers in high places, and
fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) a pool of water, and the dry land
springs of water.  

<span id="019">19</span> I will plant in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) the [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md),
the shittah tree, and the [myrtle](../ebd/ebd263.htm#004.md), and the oil
tree; I will set in the [desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000.md) the
[fir](../ebd/ebd133.htm#005.md) tree, and the pine, and the
[box](../ebd/ebd063.htm#007.md) tree together:  

<span id="020">20</span> That they may see, and know, and consider, and
understand together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the
Holy One of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) hath created it.  

<span id="021">21</span> Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth
your strong reasons, saith the [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> Let them bring them forth, and shew us what
shall happen: let them shew the former things, what they be, that we may
consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for
to come.  

<span id="023">23</span> Shew the things that are to come hereafter,
that we may know that ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may
be dismayed, and behold it together.  

<span id="024">24</span> Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work of
nought: an [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md) is he that chooseth
you.  

<span id="025">25</span> I have raised up one from the north, and he
shall come: from the rising of the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) shall he
call upon my name: and he shall come upon princes as upon morter, and as
the potter treadeth [clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> Who hath declared from the beginning, that we
may know? and beforetime, that we may say, He is righteous? yea, there
is none that sheweth, yea, there is none that declareth, yea, there is
none that heareth your words.  

<span id="027">27</span> The first shall say to
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), Behold, behold them: and I will give to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) one that bringeth good tidings.  

<span id="028">28</span> For I beheld, and there was no man; even among
them, and there was no [counsellor](../ebd/ebd091.htm#005.md), that, when I
asked of them, could answer a word.  

<span id="029">29</span> Behold, they are all vanity; their works are
nothing: their molten images are wind and confusion.
