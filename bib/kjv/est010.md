### King James Version: Esther Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md) laid a
[tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006.md) upon the land, and upon the isles of
the sea.  

<span id="002">2</span> And all the acts of his power and of his might,
and the declaration of the greatness of
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md), whereunto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) advanced him, are they not written in the
book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003.md) of the kings of
[Media](../ebd/ebd246.htm#001) and [Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009.md)?  

<span id="003">3</span> For [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md) the
[Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004) was next unto [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md), and great among the Jews, and
accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his
people, and speaking peace to all his seed.
