### King James Version: Judges Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> And after [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md)
there arose to defend [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
[Tola](../ebd/ebd369.htm#007) the son of [Puah](../ebd/ebd301.htm#008.md),
the son of [Dodo](../ebd/ebd105.htm#005.md), a man of
[Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002.md); and he dwelt in
[Shamir](../ebd/ebd331.htm#001) in [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he judged [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in
[Shamir](../ebd/ebd331.htm#001.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And after him arose
[Jair](../ebd/ebd196.htm#001.md), a Gileadite, and judged
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) twenty and two years.  

<span id="004">4</span> And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md) colts, and they had thirty cities, which
are called Havothjair unto this day, which are in the land of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Jair](../ebd/ebd196.htm#001.md) died, and was
buried in [Camon](../ebd/ebd070.htm#001.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) did evil again in the sight of the LORD,
and served [Baalim](../ebd/ebd039.htm#007.md), and
[Ashtaroth](../ebd/ebd034.htm#004.md), and the gods of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md), and the gods of
[Zidon](../ebd/ebd393.htm#000.md), and the gods of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), and the gods of the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002.md), and the gods of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), and forsook the LORD, and served
not him.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) of the
LORD was hot against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and he sold them
into the hands of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), and into the
hands of the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And that year they vexed and oppressed the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): eighteen years, all the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) that were on the other side
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) in the land of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md), which is in
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Moreover the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002.md) passed over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) to fight also against
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and against
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md), and against the house of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md); so that
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) was sore distressed.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) cried unto the LORD, saying, We have
sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also
served [Baalim](../ebd/ebd039.htm#007.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And the LORD said unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), Did not I deliver you from the
Egyptians, and from the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md), from the
children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002.md), and from the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)?  

<span id="012">12</span> The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the
Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out
of their hand.  

<span id="013">13</span> Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods:
wherefore I will deliver you no more.  

<span id="014">14</span> Go and cry unto the gods which ye have
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md); let them deliver you in the time of
your [tribulation](../ebd/ebd372.htm#005.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do
thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we pray
thee, this day.  

<span id="016">16</span> And they put away the strange gods from among
them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Then the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002.md) were gathered together, and encamped in
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md). And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) assembled themselves together, and
encamped in Mizpeh.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the people and princes of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md) said one to another, What man is he that
will begin to fight against the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002.md)? he shall be head over all the
inhabitants of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md).
