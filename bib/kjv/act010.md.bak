### King James Version: Acts Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> There was a certain man in
[Caesarea](../ebd/ebd068.htm#003.md) called
[Cornelius](../ebd/ebd090.htm#007), a [centurion](../ebd/ebd075.htm#004.md)
of the band called the Italian band,  

<span id="002">2</span> A devout man, and one that feared God with all
his house, which gave much [alms](../ebd/ebd018.htm#002.md) to the people,
and prayed to God alway.  

<span id="003">3</span> He saw in a [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md)
evidently about the ninth hour of the day an
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of God coming in to him, and saying unto
him, [Cornelius](../ebd/ebd090.htm#007.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and
said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine
[alms](../ebd/ebd018.htm#002.md) are come up for a memorial before God.  

<span id="005">5</span> And now send men to
[Joppa](../ebd/ebd211.htm#002.md), and call for one
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md), whose surname is
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md):  

<span id="006">6</span> He lodgeth with one
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md) a tanner, whose house is by the sea side:
he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md)
which spake unto [Cornelius](../ebd/ebd090.htm#007.md) was departed, he
called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that
waited on him continually;  

<span id="008">8</span> And when he had declared all these things unto
them, he sent them to [Joppa](../ebd/ebd211.htm#002.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> On the morrow, as they went on their
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md), and drew nigh unto the city,
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) went up upon the housetop to pray about
the sixth hour:  

<span id="010">10</span> And he became very hungry, and would have
eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a
[trance](../ebd/ebd371.htm#006.md),  

<span id="011">11</span> And saw [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) opened,
and a certain vessel descending upon him, as it had been a great sheet
knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:  

<span id="012">12</span> Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of
the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.  

<span id="013">13</span> And there came a voice to him, Rise,
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md); kill, and eat.  

<span id="014">14</span> But [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) said, Not
so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the voice spake unto him again the second
time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.  

<span id="016">16</span> This was done thrice: and the vessel was
received up again into [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Now while [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md)
doubted in himself what this [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md) which he
had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from
[Cornelius](../ebd/ebd090.htm#007.md) had made enquiry for Simon's house,
and stood before the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md),  

<span id="018">18</span> And called, and asked whether
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md), which was surnamed
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md), were lodged there.  

<span id="019">19</span> While [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) thought on
the [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000), the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md)
said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.  

<span id="020">20</span> Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with
them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) went down
to the men which were sent unto him from
[Cornelius](../ebd/ebd090.htm#007.md); and said, Behold, I am he whom ye
seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?  

<span id="022">22</span> And they said,
[Cornelius](../ebd/ebd090.htm#007.md) the
[centurion](../ebd/ebd075.htm#004.md), a just man, and one that feareth
God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned
from God by an holy [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) to send for thee into
his house, and to hear words of thee.  

<span id="023">23</span> Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on
the morrow [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) went away with them, and
certain brethren from [Joppa](../ebd/ebd211.htm#002.md) accompanied him.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the morrow after they entered into
[Caesarea](../ebd/ebd068.htm#003.md). And
[Cornelius](../ebd/ebd090.htm#007.md) waited for them, and he had called
together his kinsmen and near friends.  

<span id="025">25</span> And as [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) was
coming in, [Cornelius](../ebd/ebd090.htm#007.md) met him, and fell down at
his feet, and worshipped him.  

<span id="026">26</span> But [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) took him up,
saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.  

<span id="027">27</span> And as he talked with him, he went in, and
found many that were come together.  

<span id="028">28</span> And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is
an unlawful thing for a man that is a [Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004.md) to
keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me
that I should not call any man common or unclean.  

<span id="029">29</span> Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying,
as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent
for me?  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Cornelius](../ebd/ebd090.htm#007.md) said,
Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I
prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright
clothing,  

<span id="031">31</span> And said, [Cornelius](../ebd/ebd090.htm#007.md),
thy [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) is heard, and thine
[alms](../ebd/ebd018.htm#002.md) are had in remembrance in the sight of
God.  

<span id="032">32</span> Send therefore to
[Joppa](../ebd/ebd211.htm#002.md), and call hither
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md), whose surname is
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md); he is lodged in the house of one
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md) a tanner by the sea side: who, when he
cometh, shall speak unto thee.  

<span id="033">33</span> Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou
hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present
before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.  

<span id="034">34</span> Then [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) opened his
mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of
persons:  

<span id="035">35</span> But in every nation he that feareth him, and
worketh [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), is accepted with him.  

<span id="036">36</span> The word which God sent unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), preaching peace by
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md): (he is
Lord of all:)  

<span id="037">37</span> That word, I say, ye know, which was published
throughout all Judaea, and began from [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md),
after the baptism which John preached;  

<span id="038">38</span> How God anointed [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
of [Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007.md) with the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md) and with power: who went about doing
good, and healing all that were oppressed of the
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md); for God was with him.  

<span id="039">39</span> And we are witnesses of all things which he did
both in the land of the Jews, and in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md);
whom they slew and hanged on a tree:  

<span id="040">40</span> Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him
openly;  

<span id="041">41</span> Not to all the people, but unto witnesses
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) before God, even to us, who did eat and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) with him after he rose from the dead.  

<span id="042">42</span> And he commanded us to preach unto the people,
and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the
[Judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) of quick and dead.  

<span id="043">43</span> To him give all the prophets
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md), that through his name whosoever
believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.  

<span id="044">44</span> While [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) yet spake
these words, the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md) fell on all them
which heard the word.  

<span id="045">45</span> And they of the
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007.md) which believed were astonished, as
many as came with [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md), because that on the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) also was poured out the
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005.md) of the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md).  

<span id="046">46</span> For they heard them speak with tongues, and
magnify God. Then answered [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md),  

<span id="047">47</span> Can any man forbid water, that these should not
be baptized, which have received the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md)
as well as we?  

<span id="048">48</span> And he commanded them to be baptized in the
name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.
