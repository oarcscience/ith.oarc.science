### King James Version: Daniel Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> In the third year of the reign of
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Belshazzar](../ebd/ebd052.htm#001.md) a
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md) appeared unto me, even unto me
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md), after that which appeared unto me at
the first.  

<span id="002">2</span> And I saw in a [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md);
and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at
[Shushan](../ebd/ebd342.htm#003) in the [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md),
which is in the province of [Elam](../ebd/ebd114.htm#003.md); and I saw in
a [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md), and I was by the river of
[Ulai](../ebd/ebd374.htm#004.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and,
behold, there stood before the river a [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md)
which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher
than the other, and the higher came up last.  

<span id="004">4</span> I saw the [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md) pushing
[westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008.md), and
[northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002.md), and southward; so that no beasts
might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of
his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.  

<span id="005">5</span> And as I was considering, behold, an he
[goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001.md) came from the west on the face of the
whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the
[goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001.md) had a notable
[horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003.md) between his eyes.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he came to the [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md)
that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran
unto him in the [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md) of his power.  

<span id="007">7</span> And I saw him come close unto the
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md), and he was moved with choler against him,
and smote the [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md), and brake his two horns: and
there was no power in the [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md) to stand before
him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there
was none that could deliver the [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md) out of his
hand.  

<span id="008">8</span> Therefore the he [goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001.md)
waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great
[horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003.md) was broken; and for it came up four
notable ones toward the four [winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009.md) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And out of one of them came forth a little
[horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003.md), which waxed exceeding great, toward the
south, and toward the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md), and toward the
pleasant land.  

<span id="010">10</span> And it waxed great, even to the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md); and it
cast down some of the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) and of the
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md) to the ground, and stamped upon them.  

<span id="011">11</span> Yea, he magnified himself even to the
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) of the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md),
and by him the daily [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) was taken away,
and the place of the [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md) was cast down.  

<span id="012">12</span> And an [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) was given
him against the daily [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) by reason of
transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it
practised, and prospered.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then I heard one saint speaking, and another
saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md) concerning the daily
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md), and the transgression of desolation,
to give both the [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md) and the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) to be trodden under foot?  

<span id="014">14</span> And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and
three hundred days; then shall the [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md) be
cleansed.  

<span id="015">15</span> And it came to pass, when I, even I
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md), had seen the
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md), and sought for the meaning, then,
behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.  

<span id="016">16</span> And I heard a man's voice between the banks of
[Ulai](../ebd/ebd374.htm#004.md), which called, and said,
[Gabriel](../ebd/ebd140.htm#006.md), make this man to understand the
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> So he came near where I stood: and when he
came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me,
Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) sleep on my face toward the ground: but he
touched me, and set me upright.  

<span id="019">19</span> And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what
shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed
the end shall be.  

<span id="020">20</span> The [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md) which thou
sawest having two horns are the kings of [Media](../ebd/ebd246.htm#001.md)
and [Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And the rough [goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001.md) is
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of Grecia: and the great
[horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003.md) that is between his eyes is the first
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> Now that being broken, whereas four stood up
for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his
power.  

<span id="023">23</span> And in the latter time of their kingdom, when
the transgressors are come to the full, a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand
up.  

<span id="024">24</span> And his power shall be mighty, but not by his
own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and
practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.  

<span id="025">25</span> And through his policy also he shall cause
craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart,
and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the
[Prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) of princes; but he shall be broken
without hand.  

<span id="026">26</span> And the [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md) of the
evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up
the [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md); for it shall be for many days.  

<span id="027">27</span> And I [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) fainted,
and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's
business; and I was astonished at the [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md),
but none understood it.
