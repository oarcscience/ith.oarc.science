### King James Version: Nehemiah Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> Now it came to pass, when the wall was built,
and I had set up the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009), and the porters and
the singers and the Levites were appointed,  

<span id="002">2</span> That I gave my brother
[Hanani](../ebd/ebd162.htm#003), and [Hananiah](../ebd/ebd162.htm#004)
the ruler of the [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008), charge over
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): for he was a
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) man, and feared God above many.  

<span id="003">3</span> And I said unto them, Let not the gates of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) be opened until the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) be hot; and while they stand by, let them
shut the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009), and bar them: and appoint
[watches](../ebd/ebd379.htm#003) of the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), every one in his watch, and every
one to be over against his house.  

<span id="004">4</span> Now the city was large and great: but the people
were few therein, and the houses were not builded.  

<span id="005">5</span> And my God put into mine heart to gather
together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be
reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them
which came up at the first, and found written therein,  

<span id="006">6</span> These are the children of the province, that
went up out of the [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002), of those that had
been carried away, whom [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) had
carried away, and came again to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) and
to [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), every one unto his city;  

<span id="007">7</span> Who came with
[Zerubbabel](../ebd/ebd391.htm#008), [Jeshua](../ebd/ebd205.htm#003),

say, of the men of the people of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) was

<span id="064">64</span> These sought their register among those that
were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they,
as polluted, put from the priesthood.  

<span id="065">65</span> And the [Tirshatha](../ebd/ebd368.htm#001) said
unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there
stood up a [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) with

maidservants, of whom there were [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) thousand
three hundred thirty and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005): and they had
two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women.  

<span id="068">68</span> Their horses, [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
hundred thirty and six: their mules, two hundred forty and five:

thousand [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) hundred and twenty asses.  

<span id="070">70</span> And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto
the work. The [Tirshatha](../ebd/ebd368.htm#001) gave to the treasure a
thousand drams of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), fifty basons, five
hundred and thirty priests' garments.  

<span id="071">71</span> And some of the chief of the fathers gave to
the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and two thousand and two hundred
[pound](../ebd/ebd299.htm#008) of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000).  

<span id="072">72</span> And that which the rest of the people gave was
twenty thousand drams of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and two thousand
[pound](../ebd/ebd299.htm#008) of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and
threescore and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) priests' garments.  

<span id="073">73</span> So the priests, and the Levites, and the
porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and
all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), dwelt in their cities; and when the
seventh month came, the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) were
in their cities.
