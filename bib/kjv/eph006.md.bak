### King James Version: Ephesians Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for
this is right.  

<span id="002">2</span> Honour thy father and mother; which is the first
commandment with promise;  

<span id="003">3</span> That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest
live long on the earth.  

<span id="004">4</span> And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to
wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.  

<span id="005">5</span> Servants, be obedient to them that are your
masters according to the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), with fear and
trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md);  

<span id="006">6</span> Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the
servants of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), doing the will of God from
the heart;  

<span id="007">7</span> With good will doing service, as to the Lord,
and not to men:  

<span id="008">8</span> Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man
doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be
[bond](../ebd/ebd062.htm#001.md) or free.  

<span id="009">9</span> And, ye masters, do the same things unto them,
forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md); neither is there respect of persons
with him.  

<span id="010">10</span> Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord,
and in the power of his might.  

<span id="011">11</span> Put on the whole
[armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006.md) of God, that ye may be able to stand
against the wiles of the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> For we [wrestle](../ebd/ebd384.htm#004.md) not
against [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) and
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), but against principalities, against
powers, against the rulers of the [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) of
this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.  

<span id="013">13</span> Wherefore take unto you the whole
[armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006.md) of God, that ye may be able to withstand
in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.  

<span id="014">14</span> Stand therefore, having your loins girt about
with truth, and having on the [breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007.md) of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md);  

<span id="015">15</span> And your feet shod with the preparation of the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) of peace;  

<span id="016">16</span> Above all, taking the
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001.md) of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to
quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.  

<span id="017">17</span> And take the [helmet](../ebd/ebd173.htm#004.md) of
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md), and the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) of the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md),
which is the word of God:  

<span id="018">18</span> Praying always with all
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) and supplication in the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), and watching thereunto with all
perseverance and supplication for all saints;  

<span id="019">19</span> And for me, that utterance may be given unto
me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the
[mystery](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006.md) of the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md),  

<span id="020">20</span> For which I am an
[ambassador](../ebd/ebd019.htm#008.md) in bonds: that therein I may speak
boldly, as I ought to speak.  

<span id="021">21</span> But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I
do, [Tychicus](../ebd/ebd373.htm#008.md), a beloved brother and
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) in
the Lord, shall make known to you all things:  

<span id="022">22</span> Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose,
that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.  

<span id="023">23</span> Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith,
from God the Father and the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> [Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) be with all them
that love our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) in sincerity.
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).
