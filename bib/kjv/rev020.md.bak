### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> And I saw an [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) come
down from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), having the
[key](../ebd/ebd218.htm#002.md) of the bottomless
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007) and a great [chain](../ebd/ebd075.htm#008.md)
in his hand.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he laid hold on the
[dragon](../ebd/ebd107.htm#000.md), that old
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009.md), which is the
[Devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007), and [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md), and
bound him a thousand years,  

<span id="003">3</span> And cast him into the bottomless
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md), and shut him up, and set a
[seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002.md) upon him, that he should deceive the
nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after
that he must be loosed a little season.  

<span id="004">4</span> And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and
judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were
beheaded for the [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), and for the word of God, and which had
not worshipped the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md), neither his image,
neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands;
and they lived and reigned with [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) a
thousand years.  

<span id="005">5</span> But the rest of the dead lived not again until
the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.  

<span id="006">6</span> Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the
first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they
shall be priests of God and of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), and
shall reign with him a thousand years.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when the thousand years are expired,
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md) shall be loosed out of his
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md),  

<span id="008">8</span> And shall go out to deceive the nations which
are in the four quarters of the earth, [Gog](../ebd/ebd151.htm#009.md), and
[Magog](../ebd/ebd236.htm#009.md), to gather them together to battle: the
number of whom is as the sand of the sea.  

<span id="009">9</span> And they went up on the breadth of the earth,
and compassed the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md) of the saints about, and
the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and devoured them.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md) that
deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and
[brimstone](../ebd/ebd065.htm#005.md), where the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) and the false
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) are, and shall be tormented day and
night for ever and ever.  

<span id="011">11</span> And I saw a great white
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), and him that sat on it, from whose face
the earth and the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) fled away; and there
was found no place for them.  

<span id="012">12</span> And I saw the dead, small and great, stand
before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened,
which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things
which were written in the books, according to their works.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the sea gave up the dead which were in it;
and death and [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md) delivered up the dead which
were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.  

<span id="014">14</span> And death and [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md)
were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.  

<span id="015">15</span> And whosoever was not found written in the book
of life was cast into the lake of fire.
