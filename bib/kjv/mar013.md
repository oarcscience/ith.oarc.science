### King James Version: Mark Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> And as he went out of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), one of his disciples saith unto him,
Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answering
said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left
one [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) upon another, that shall not be
thrown down.  

<span id="003">3</span> And as he sat upon the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) of Olives over against the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) and
[James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md) and John and
[Andrew](../ebd/ebd023.htm#007.md) asked him privately,  

<span id="004">4</span> Tell us, when shall these things be? and what
shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answering
them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:  

<span id="006">6</span> For many shall come in my name, saying, I am
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md); and shall deceive many.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of
wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end
shall not be yet.  

<span id="008">8</span> For nation shall rise against nation, and
kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers
places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the
beginnings of sorrows.  

<span id="009">9</span> But take heed to yourselves: for they shall
deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten:
and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md) against them.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) must
first be published among all nations.  

<span id="011">11</span> But when they shall lead you, and deliver you
up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye
premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak
ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> Now the brother shall betray the brother to
death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their
parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.  

<span id="013">13</span> And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's
sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.  

<span id="014">14</span> But when ye shall see the
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md) of desolation, spoken of by
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md),
standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let
them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:  

<span id="015">15</span> And let him that is on the housetop not go down
into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his
house:  

<span id="016">16</span> And let him that is in the field not turn back
again for to take up his garment.  

<span id="017">17</span> But woe to them that are with child, and to
them that give suck in those days!  

<span id="018">18</span> And pray ye that your flight be not in the
winter.  

<span id="019">19</span> For in those days shall be affliction, such as
was not from the beginning of the [creation](../ebd/ebd092.htm#003.md)
which God created unto this time, neither shall be.  

<span id="020">20</span> And except that the Lord had shortened those
days, no [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) should be saved: but for the
elect's sake, whom he hath [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md), he hath
shortened the days.  

<span id="021">21</span> And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here
is [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md); or, lo, he is there; believe him
not:  

<span id="022">22</span> For false Christs and false prophets shall
rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible,
even the elect.  

<span id="023">23</span> But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you
all things.  

<span id="024">24</span> But in those days, after that
[tribulation](../ebd/ebd372.htm#005), the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md)
shall be darkened, and the [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004.md) shall not give
her light,  

<span id="025">25</span> And the [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) shall fall, and the powers that are in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) shall be shaken.  

<span id="026">26</span> And then shall they see the Son of man coming
in the clouds with great power and [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And then shall he send his angels, and shall
gather together his elect from the four [winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009.md),
from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> Now learn a [parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md) of
the [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001.md) tree; When her
[branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002.md) is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves,
ye know that summer is near:  

<span id="029">29</span> So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these
things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> Verily I say unto you, that this
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) shall not pass, till all these
things be done.  

<span id="031">31</span> [Heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) and earth shall
pass away: but my words shall not pass away.  

<span id="032">32</span> But of that day and that hour knoweth no man,
no, not the angels which are in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), neither
the Son, but the Father.  

<span id="033">33</span> Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not
when the time is.  

<span id="034">34</span> For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md), who left his house, and gave authority
to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the
[porter](../ebd/ebd299.htm#000.md) to watch.  

<span id="035">35</span> Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the
master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the
cockcrowing, or in the morning:  

<span id="036">36</span> Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.  

<span id="037">37</span> And what I say unto you I say unto all,
Watch.
