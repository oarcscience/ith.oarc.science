</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> appeared unto our father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, when he was in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#003">Mesopotamia</A>, before he dwelt in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd078.htm#001">Charran</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd078.htm#001">Charran</A>: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And God spake on this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</A>, and entreat them evil four hundred years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the nation to whom they shall be in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</A> will I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A>, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And he gave him the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A>: and so <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> begat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, and circumcised him the eighth day; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> begat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> begat the twelve patriarchs.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>: but God was with him,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And delivered him out of all his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd011.htm#006">afflictions</A>, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>; and he made him governor over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> and all his house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Now there came a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd099.htm#005">dearth</A> over all the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;But when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> heard that there was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, he sent out our fathers first.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And at the second time <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then sent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, and called his father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> went down into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and died, he, and our fathers,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And were carried over into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#007">Sychem</A>, and laid in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A> that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> bought for a sum of money of the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd120.htm#002">Emmor</A> the father of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#007">Sychem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, the people grew and multiplied in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Till another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> arose, which knew not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;In which time <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> over us?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Then fled <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> at this saying, and was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A> in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> Sina an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the Lord in a flame of fire in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd067.htm#000">bush</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the LORD came unto him,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, and the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, and the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>. Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> trembled, and durst not behold.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;This <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A>? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> which appeared to him in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd067.htm#000">bush</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and in the Red sea, and in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> forty years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;This is that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, which said unto the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, A <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;This is he, that was in the church in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> which spake to him in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;Saying unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A>, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, which brought us out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, we wot not what is become of him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And they made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</A> in those days, and offered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</A>, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;Then God turned, and gave them up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;Yea, ye took up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#000">Moloch</A>, and the star of your god <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#006">Remphan</A>, figures which ye made to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> them: and I will carry you away beyond <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;Our fathers had the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, as he had appointed, speaking unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;Which also our fathers that came after brought in with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> into the possession of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;Who found favour before God, and desired to find a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A> for the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> built him an house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>,<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;Hath not my hand made all these things?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>: as your fathers did, so do ye.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="053">53</A>&nbsp;Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="054">54</A>&nbsp;When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="055">55</A>&nbsp;But he, being full of the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>, looked up stedfastly into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and saw the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of God, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> standing on the right hand of God,<BR>

<P><a name="057">57</A>&nbsp;Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,<BR>
