### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is
beyond the rivers of [Ethiopia](../ebd/ebd126.htm#005):  

<span id="002">2</span> That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in
vessels of bulrushes upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers,
to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their
beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the
rivers have spoiled!  

<span id="003">3</span> All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on
the earth, see ye, when he lifteth up an [ensign](../ebd/ebd121.htm#008)
on the mountains; and when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.  

<span id="004">4</span> For so the LORD said unto me, I will take my
rest, and I will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon
herbs, and like a [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) of
[dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008) in the heat of
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008).  

<span id="005">5</span> For afore the [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008),
when the bud is perfect, and the sour [grape](../ebd/ebd154.htm#004) is
ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning
hooks, and take away and cut down the branches.  

<span id="006">6</span> They shall be left together unto the fowls of
the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall
summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon
them.  

<span id="007">7</span> In that time shall the present be brought unto
the LORD of hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people
terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden
under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name
of the LORD of hosts, the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002).
