<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Sufficient to such a man is this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</A>, which was inflicted of many.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Lest <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A> should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Furthermore, when I came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#008">Troas</A> to preach Christ's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A>, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;I had no rest in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, because I found not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd368.htm#007">Titus</A> my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For we are unto God a sweet savour of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
