### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 29

<span id="001">1</span> And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto
them to [hallow](../ebd/ebd160.htm#001.md) them, to
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) unto me in the priest's office: Take
one young [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md), and two rams without
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md),  

<span id="002">2</span> And unleavened [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md),
and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and
[wafers](../ebd/ebd378.htm#003.md) unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten
[flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001.md) shalt thou make them.  

<span id="003">3</span> And thou shalt put them into one
[basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009.md), and bring them in the
[basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009.md), with the
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md) and the two rams.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and his sons
thou shalt bring unto the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), and shalt wash them with water.  

<span id="005">5</span> And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) the [coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004.md), and
the robe of the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md), and the
[ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md), and the
[breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007.md), and gird him with the curious
[girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005) of the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md):  

<span id="006">6</span> And thou shalt put the
[mitre](../ebd/ebd257.htm#006.md) upon his head, and put the holy
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) upon the
[mitre](../ebd/ebd257.htm#006.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour
it upon his head, and [anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008.md) him.  

<span id="008">8</span> And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats
upon them.  

<span id="009">9</span> And thou shalt gird them with girdles,
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and his sons, and put the bonnets on
them: and the priest's office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute:
and thou shalt consecrate [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and his sons.  

<span id="010">10</span> And thou shalt cause a
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md) to be brought before the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md): and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and his sons shall put their hands upon
the head of the [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And thou shalt kill the
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md) before the LORD, by the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And thou shalt take of the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md),
and put it upon the horns of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) with thy
finger, and pour all the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) beside the
bottom of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And thou shalt take all the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) that covereth the inwards, and the
[caul](../ebd/ebd074.htm#003.md) that is above the
[liver](../ebd/ebd230.htm#004.md), and the two kidneys, and the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) that is upon them, and burn them upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> But the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of the
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md), and his skin, and his
[dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003.md), shalt thou burn with fire without the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002): it is a [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> Thou shalt also take one
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003); and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and his
sons shall put their hands upon the head of the
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And thou shalt slay the
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md), and thou shalt take his
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), and sprinkle it round about upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And thou shalt cut the
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003) in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md), and
wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put them unto his
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md), and unto his head.  

<span id="018">18</span> And thou shalt burn the whole
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003) upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md): it
is a burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) unto the LORD: it is a
sweet savour, an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) made by fire unto the
LORD.  

<span id="019">19</span> And thou shalt take the other
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003); and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and his
sons shall put their hands upon the head of the
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> Then shalt thou kill the
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md), and take of his
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), and put it upon the tip of the right
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) of [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and upon
the tip of the right [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) of his sons, and upon
the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right
foot, and sprinkle the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) round about.  

<span id="021">21</span> And thou shalt take of the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) that is upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle
it upon [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and upon his garments, and upon
his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be
hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with
him.  

<span id="022">22</span> Also thou shalt take of the
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003) the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) and the
rump, and the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) that covereth the inwards,
and the [caul](../ebd/ebd074.htm#003.md) above the
[liver](../ebd/ebd230.htm#004.md), and the two kidneys, and the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) that is upon them, and the right shoulder;
for it is a [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md) of
[consecration](../ebd/ebd088.htm#007.md):  

<span id="023">23</span> And one loaf of [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md),
and one [cake](../ebd/ebd068.htm#009.md) of oiled
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), and one wafer out of the
[basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009.md) of the unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) that is before the LORD:  

<span id="024">24</span> And thou shalt put all in the hands of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and in the hands of his sons; and shalt
wave them for a wave [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) before the
LORD.  

<span id="025">25</span> And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and
burn them upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), for a sweet savour before the LORD:
it is an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) made by fire unto the LORD.  

<span id="026">26</span> And thou shalt take the breast of the
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md) of Aaron's
[consecration](../ebd/ebd088.htm#007.md), and wave it for a wave
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) before the LORD: and it shall be thy
part.  

<span id="027">27</span> And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and the shoulder of the heave
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), which is waved, and which is heaved
up, of the [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md) of the
[consecration](../ebd/ebd088.htm#007.md), even of that which is for
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and of that which is for his sons:  

<span id="028">28</span> And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a
statute for ever from the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):
for it is an heave [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md): and it shall be an
heave [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) from the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) of the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) of their peace offerings, even their
heave [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) unto the LORD.  

<span id="029">29</span> And the holy garments of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) shall be his sons' after him, to be
anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.  

<span id="030">30</span> And that son that is
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) in his stead shall put them on
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days, when he cometh into the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) to
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) in the holy place.  

<span id="031">31</span> And thou shalt take the
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md) of the
[consecration](../ebd/ebd088.htm#007.md), and
[seethe](../ebd/ebd326.htm#001) his [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) in
the holy place.  

<span id="032">32</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and his sons
shall eat the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of the
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003), and the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md)
that is in the [basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009.md) by the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> And they shall eat those things wherewith the
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) was made, to consecrate and to
sanctify them: but a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) shall not eat
thereof, because they are holy.  

<span id="034">34</span> And if ought of the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of the consecrations, or of the
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), remain unto the morning, then thou shalt
burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is
holy.  

<span id="035">35</span> And thus shalt thou do unto
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and to his sons, according to all things
which I have commanded thee: [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days shalt
thou consecrate them.  

<span id="036">36</span> And thou shalt offer every day a
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) for a [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) for
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md): and thou shalt cleanse the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), when thou hast made an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for it, and thou shalt
[anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008.md) it, to sanctify it.  

<span id="037">37</span> [Seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days thou shalt
make an [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), and sanctify it; and it shall be an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) most holy: whatsoever toucheth the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) shall be holy.  

<span id="038">38</span> Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon
the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md); two lambs of the first year day by
day continually.  

<span id="039">39</span> The one [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md) thou
shalt offer in the morning; and the other [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md)
thou shalt offer at even:  

<span id="040">40</span> And with the one [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md)
a tenth deal of [flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001.md) mingled with the fourth
part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) for a [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="041">41</span> And the other [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md)
thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) of the morning, and according to the
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md)
thereof, for a sweet savour, an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) made
by fire unto the LORD.  

<span id="042">42</span> This shall be a continual burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) throughout your generations at the
door of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) before the LORD: where I will meet
you, to speak there unto thee.  

<span id="043">43</span> And there I will meet with the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) shall be sanctified by my
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="044">44</span> And I will sanctify the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), and the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md): I will sanctify also both
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and his sons, to
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) to me in the priest's office.  

<span id="045">45</span> And I will dwell among the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and will be their God.  

<span id="046">46</span> And they shall know that I am the LORD their
God, that brought them forth out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), that I may dwell among them: I am the
LORD their God.
