### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 25

<span id="001">1</span> [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007) was twenty and
five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine
years in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005). And his mother's name was
[Jehoaddan](../ebd/ebd200.htm#005) of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he did that which was right in the sight of
the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.  

<span id="003">3</span> Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was
established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) his father.  

<span id="004">4</span> But he slew not their children, but did as it is
written in the law in the book of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), where
the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children,
neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die
for his own [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="005">5</span> Moreover [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007)
gathered [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) together, and made them captains
over [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008), and captains over hundreds,
according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008):
and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them
three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could
handle spear and [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001).  

<span id="006">6</span> He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of
valour out of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) for an hundred talents of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000).  

<span id="007">7</span> But there came a man of God to him, saying, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), let not the army of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) go with thee; for the LORD is not with
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), to wit, with all the children of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000).  

<span id="008">8</span> But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the
battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to
help, and to cast down.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007) said to the
man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have
given to the army of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)? And the man of God
answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007) separated
them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000), to go home again: wherefore their
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) was greatly kindled against
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and they returned home in great
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002).  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007)
strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008), and
smote of the children of [Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004) ten thousand.  

<span id="012">12</span> And other ten thousand left alive did the
children of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) carry away
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001), and brought them unto the top of the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001), and cast them down from the top of the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001), that they all were broken in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002).  

<span id="013">13</span> But the soldiers of the army which
[Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007) sent back, that they should not go with
him to battle, fell upon the cities of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007),
from [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004) even unto Bethhoron, and smote
three thousand of them, and took much spoil.  

<span id="014">14</span> Now it came to pass, after that
[Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007) was come from the slaughter of the
Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of
[Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004), and set them up to be his gods, and bowed
down himself before them, and burned [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002)
unto them.  

<span id="015">15</span> Wherefore the [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) of
the LORD was kindled against [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007), and he
sent unto him a [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), which said unto him,
Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not
deliver their own people out of thine hand?  

<span id="016">16</span> And it came to pass, as he talked with him,
that the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said unto him, Art thou made of
the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) forbare, and said, I know that God hath
determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not
hearkened unto my counsel.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) took
advice, and sent to [Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000), the son of
[Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006), the son of
[Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007), [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saying, Come, let us see one another in
the face.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) sent to
[Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), saying, The
[thistle](../ebd/ebd364.htm#004) that was in
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001) sent to the
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007) that was in
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001), saying, Give thy daughter to my son to
wife: and there passed by a wild [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) that was
in [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001), and trode down the
[thistle](../ebd/ebd364.htm#004).  

<span id="019">19</span> Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the
Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home;
why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even
thou, and [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) with thee?  

<span id="020">20</span> But [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007) would not
hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of
their enemies, because they sought after the gods of
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001).  

<span id="021">21</span> So [Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) went
up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and
[Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) was put to
the worse before [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and they fled every
man to his [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009).  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) took
[Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), the son of
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000), the son of
[Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006), at Bethshemesh, and brought him to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and brake down the wall of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) from the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) to the
corner [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), four hundred cubits.  

<span id="024">24</span> And he took all the
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) and the [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000),
and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom,
and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned
to [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004).  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007) the son of
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) lived after the death of
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000) son of [Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) fifteen
years.  

<span id="026">26</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007), first and last, behold, are they not
written in the book of the kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)?  

<span id="027">27</span> Now after the time that
[Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007) did turn away from following the LORD
they made a conspiracy against him in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005); and he fled to
[Lachish](../ebd/ebd222.htm#009): but they sent to
[Lachish](../ebd/ebd222.htm#009) after him, and slew him there.  

<span id="028">28</span> And they brought him upon horses, and buried
him with his fathers in the city of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).
