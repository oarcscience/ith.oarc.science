### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 48

<span id="001">1</span> Hear ye this, O house of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), which are called by the name of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and are come forth out of the waters of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), which swear by the name of the LORD, and
make mention of the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), but not in
truth, nor in [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="002">2</span> For they call themselves of the holy city, and
stay themselves upon the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); The
LORD of hosts is his name.  

<span id="003">3</span> I have declared the former things from the
beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did
them suddenly, and they came to pass.  

<span id="004">4</span> Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000) is an [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004) sinew,
and thy brow [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003);  

<span id="005">5</span> I have even from the beginning declared it to
thee; before it came to pass I shewed it thee: lest thou shouldest say,
Mine [idol](../ebd/ebd186.htm#006) hath done them, and my graven image,
and my molten image, hath commanded them.  

<span id="006">6</span> Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye
declare it? I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden
things, and thou didst not know them.  

<span id="007">7</span> They are created now, and not from the
beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou
shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.  

<span id="008">8</span> Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not;
yea, from that time that thine [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) was not
opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast
called a transgressor from the womb.  

<span id="009">9</span> For my name's sake will I defer mine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), and for my praise will I refrain for
thee, that I cut thee not off.  

<span id="010">10</span> Behold, I have refined thee, but not with
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000); I have [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008)
thee in the [furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000) of affliction.  

<span id="011">11</span> For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will
I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) unto another.  

<span id="012">12</span> Hearken unto me, O
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), my
called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.  

<span id="013">13</span> Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the
earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto
them, they stand up together.  

<span id="014">14</span> All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which
among them hath declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will
do his pleasure on [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and his arm shall
be on the Chaldeans.  

<span id="015">15</span> I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him:
I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.  

<span id="016">16</span> Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not
spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am
I: and now the Lord GOD, and his [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), hath
sent me.  

<span id="017">17</span> Thus saith the LORD, thy
[Redeemer](../ebd/ebd308.htm#008), the Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); I am the LORD thy God which teacheth
thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.  

<span id="018">18</span> O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments!
then had thy peace been as a river, and thy
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) as the waves of the sea:  

<span id="019">19</span> Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the
offspring of thy [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004) like the gravel
thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before
me.  

<span id="020">20</span> Go ye forth of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a
voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the
earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007).  

<span id="021">21</span> And they thirsted not when he led them through
the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) for them: he clave the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) also, and the waters gushed out.  

<span id="022">22</span> There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the
wicked.
