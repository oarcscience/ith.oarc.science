### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my
trust.  

<span id="002">2</span> O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou
art my Lord: my [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md) extendeth not to
thee;  

<span id="003">3</span> But to the saints that are in the earth, and to
the excellent, in whom is all my delight.  

<span id="004">4</span> Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten
after another god: their [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) offerings of
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) will I not offer, nor take up their names
into my lips.  

<span id="005">5</span> The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and
of my [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000.md): thou maintainest my lot.  

<span id="006">6</span> The [lines](../ebd/ebd229.htm#007.md) are fallen
unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.  

<span id="007">7</span> I will [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) the LORD,
who hath given me counsel: my [reins](../ebd/ebd310.htm#001.md) also
instruct me in the night [seasons](../ebd/ebd325.htm#003.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> I have set the LORD always before me: because he
is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.  

<span id="009">9</span> Therefore my heart is glad, and my
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) rejoiceth: my
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) also shall rest in hope.  

<span id="010">10</span> For thou wilt not leave my soul in
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md); neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One
to see corruption.  

<span id="011">11</span> Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy
presence is [fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007.md) of joy; at thy right hand
there are pleasures for evermore.
