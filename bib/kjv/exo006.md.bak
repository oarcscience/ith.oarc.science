### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> Then the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Now shalt thou see what I will do to
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md): for with a strong hand shall he let
them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.  

<span id="002">2</span> And God spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), and said unto him, I am the LORD:  

<span id="003">3</span> And I appeared unto
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), unto [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md),
and unto [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), by the name of God Almighty,
but by my name [JEHOVAH](../ebd/ebd201.htm#009.md) was I not known to
them.  

<span id="004">4</span> And I have also established my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with them, to give them the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md), the land of their pilgrimage, wherein
they were strangers.  

<span id="005">5</span> And I have also heard the groaning of the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), whom the Egyptians keep in
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md); and I have remembered my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Wherefore say unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), I am the LORD, and I will bring you out
from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md), and I will redeem you with a stretched
out arm, and with great judgments:  

<span id="007">7</span> And I will take you to me for a people, and I
will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God,
which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.  

<span id="008">8</span> And I will bring you in unto the land,
concerning the which I did swear to give it to
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), to [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md), and
to [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md); and I will give it you for an
heritage: I am the LORD.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) spake so unto
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): but they hearkened not
unto [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) for anguish of
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), and for cruel
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="011">11</span> Go in, speak unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), that he let the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) go out of his land.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) spake before
the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) have not hearkened unto me; how then
shall [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) hear me, who am of uncircumcised
lips?  

<span id="013">13</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md),
and gave them a charge unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), to bring the children of
