<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> treasure cities, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#000">Pithom</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd304.htm#004">Raamses</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> spake to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</A> midwives, of which the name of the one was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd339.htm#005">Shiphrah</A>, and the name of the other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#008">Puah</A>:<BR>

<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And he said, When ye do the office of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#009">midwife</A> to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</A> women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.<BR>

<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But the midwives feared God, and did not as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> commanded them, but saved the men children alive.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the midwives said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>, Because the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</A> women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.<BR>
