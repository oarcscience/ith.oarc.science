### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> Now it came to pass in the third year of
[Hoshea](../ebd/ebd183.htm#006) son of [Elah](../ebd/ebd114.htm#002.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), that
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) the son of
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) began to reign.  

<span id="002">2</span> Twenty and five years old was he when he began
to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md). His mother's name also was Abi, the
daughter of [Zachariah](../ebd/ebd386.htm#005.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And he did that which was right in the sight of
the LORD, according to all that [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) his
father did.  

<span id="004">4</span> He removed the high places, and brake the
images, and cut down the groves, and brake in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md) the brasen
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009) that [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) had
made: for unto those days the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) did burn
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) to it: and he called it
[Nehushtan](../ebd/ebd270.htm#001.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> He trusted in the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); so that after him was none like him
among all the kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), nor any that were
before him.  

<span id="006">6</span> For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from
following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And the LORD was with him; and he prospered
whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md), and
served him not.  

<span id="008">8</span> He smote the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), even unto
[Gaza](../ebd/ebd144.htm#003.md), and the borders thereof, from the tower
of the watchmen to the fenced city.  

<span id="009">9</span> And it came to pass in the fourth year of
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md), which
was the seventh year of [Hoshea](../ebd/ebd183.htm#006.md) son of
[Elah](../ebd/ebd114.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), that Shalmaneser
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md) came
up against [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md), and besieged it.  

<span id="010">10</span> And at the end of three years they took it:
even in the sixth year of [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md), that is in
the ninth year of [Hoshea](../ebd/ebd183.htm#006.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md) was taken.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md) did carry away
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) unto [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md),
and put them in [Halah](../ebd/ebd159.htm#005.md) and in
[Habor](../ebd/ebd156.htm#008.md) by the river of
[Gozan](../ebd/ebd153.htm#009.md), and in the cities of the Medes:  

<span id="012">12</span> Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD
their God, but transgressed his [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md), and
all that [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) the servant of the LORD
commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.  

<span id="013">13</span> Now in the fourteenth year of
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) did
[Sennacherib](../ebd/ebd327.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md) come up against all the fenced cities
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and took them.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) sent to
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md) to
[Lachish](../ebd/ebd222.htm#009.md), saying, I have offended; return from
me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md)
appointed unto [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) three
hundred talents of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) and thirty talents of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) gave him
all the [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) that was found in the house of
the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house.  

<span id="016">16</span> At that time did
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) cut off the
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) from the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) of
the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) of the LORD, and from the pillars
which [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) had overlaid, and gave it to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) sent [Tartan](../ebd/ebd359.htm#005.md)
and [Rabsaris](../ebd/ebd304.htm#009.md) and
[Rabshakeh](../ebd/ebd305.htm#000) from [Lachish](../ebd/ebd222.htm#009.md)
to [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) with
a great [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) against
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md). And they went up and came to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md). And when they were come up, they
came and stood by the [conduit](../ebd/ebd087.htm#009.md) of the upper
pool, which is in the [highway](../ebd/ebd178.htm#005.md) of the fuller's
field.  

<span id="018">18</span> And when they had called to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), there came out to them
[Eliakim](../ebd/ebd116.htm#000.md) the son of
[Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006.md), which was over the household, and
[Shebna](../ebd/ebd332.htm#009.md) the scribe, and
[Joah](../ebd/ebd207.htm#007) the son of [Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002.md)
the [recorder](../ebd/ebd308.htm#005.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Rabshakeh](../ebd/ebd305.htm#000.md) said
unto them, Speak ye now to [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md), Thus saith
the great [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md), What
confidence is this wherein thou trustest?  

<span id="020">20</span> Thou sayest, (but they are but vain words,) I
have counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that
thou rebellest against me?  

<span id="021">21</span> Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of
this bruised [reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000.md), even upon
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), on which if a man lean, it will go into
his hand, and pierce it: so is [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) unto all
that trust on him.  

<span id="022">22</span> But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our
God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) hath taken away, and hath said to
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md),
Ye shall [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) before this
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md)?  

<span id="023">23</span> Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my
lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md), and I will deliver thee two thousand
horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.  

<span id="024">24</span> How then wilt thou turn away the face of one
captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) for chariots and for horsemen?  

<span id="025">25</span> Am I now come up without the LORD against this
place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and
destroy it.  

<span id="026">26</span> Then said [Eliakim](../ebd/ebd116.htm#000.md) the
son of [Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006.md), and
[Shebna](../ebd/ebd332.htm#009), and [Joah](../ebd/ebd207.htm#007.md), unto
[Rabshakeh](../ebd/ebd305.htm#000.md), Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants
in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in
the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.  

<span id="027">27</span> But [Rabshakeh](../ebd/ebd305.htm#000.md) said
unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak
these words? hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that
they may eat their own [dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003.md), and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) their own piss with you?  

<span id="028">28</span> Then [Rabshakeh](../ebd/ebd305.htm#000.md) stood
and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spake, saying,
Hear the word of the great [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md):  

<span id="029">29</span> Thus saith the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),
Let not [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) deceive you: for he shall not
be able to deliver you out of his hand:  

<span id="030">30</span> Neither let [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md)
make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and
this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> Hearken not to
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md): for thus saith the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md), Make
an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then eat ye
every man of his own [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md), and every one of his
[fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001) tree, and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) ye
every one the waters of his [cistern](../ebd/ebd083.htm#008.md):  

<span id="032">32</span> Until I come and take you away to a land like
your own land, a land of [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md) and
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), a land of [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md)
and vineyards, a land of oil [olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009.md) and of
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md), that ye may live, and not die: and
hearken not unto [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md), when he persuadeth
you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.  

<span id="033">33</span> Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered
at all his land out of the hand of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md)?  

<span id="034">34</span> Where are the gods of
[Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005), and of [Arpad](../ebd/ebd032.htm#002.md)?
where are the gods of [Sepharvaim](../ebd/ebd327.htm#009.md),
[Hena](../ebd/ebd174.htm#003), and [Ivah](../ebd/ebd191.htm#009.md)? have
they delivered [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md) out of mine hand?  

<span id="035">35</span> Who are they among all the gods of the
countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the
LORD should deliver [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) out of mine
hand?  

<span id="036">36</span> But the people held their peace, and answered
him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him
not.  

<span id="037">37</span> Then came [Eliakim](../ebd/ebd116.htm#000.md) the
son of [Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006.md), which was over the household,
and [Shebna](../ebd/ebd332.htm#009.md) the scribe, and
[Joah](../ebd/ebd207.htm#007) the son of [Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002.md)
the [recorder](../ebd/ebd308.htm#005.md), to
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) with their clothes
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md), and told him the words of
[Rabshakeh](../ebd/ebd305.htm#000.md).
