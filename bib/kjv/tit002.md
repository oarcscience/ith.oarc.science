### King James Version: Titus Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> But speak thou the things which become sound
doctrine:  

<span id="002">2</span> That the aged men be sober,
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md), temperate, sound in faith, in
[charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009.md), in patience.  

<span id="003">3</span> The aged women likewise, that they be in
behaviour as becometh [holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md), not false
accusers, not given to much [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), teachers of
good things;  

<span id="004">4</span> That they may teach the young women to be sober,
to love their husbands, to love their children,  

<span id="005">5</span> To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good,
obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not
blasphemed.  

<span id="006">6</span> Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.  

<span id="007">7</span> In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good
works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,  

<span id="008">8</span> Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he
that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say
of you.  

<span id="009">9</span> Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own
masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;  

<span id="010">10</span> Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity;
that they may adorn the doctrine of God our
[Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003.md) in all things.  

<span id="011">11</span> For the [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of God
that bringeth [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) hath appeared to all
men,  

<span id="012">12</span> Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and
worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this
present world;  

<span id="013">13</span> Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious
appearing of the great God and our [Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003.md)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md);  

<span id="014">14</span> Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem
us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a
[peculiar](../ebd/ebd287.htm#008.md) people, zealous of good works.  

<span id="015">15</span> These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with
all authority. Let no man despise thee.
