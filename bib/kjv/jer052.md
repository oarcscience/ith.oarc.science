### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 52

<span id="001">1</span> [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) was one and
twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005). And his mother's name was
[Hamutal](../ebd/ebd161.htm#009) the daughter of
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) of [Libnah](../ebd/ebd228.htm#004).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he did that which was evil in the eyes of
the LORD, according to all that [Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) had
done.  

<span id="003">3</span> For through the [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002)
of the LORD it came to pass in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) and
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), till he had cast them out from his
presence, that [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) rebelled against the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001).  

<span id="004">4</span> And it came to pass in the ninth year of his
reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) came, he and all his army, against
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and pitched against it, and built
forts against it round about.  

<span id="005">5</span> So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year
of [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008).  

<span id="006">6</span> And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the
month, the [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) was sore in the city, so that
there was no [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) for the people of the
land.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then the city was broken up, and all the men of
war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) between the two walls, which was by the
king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and
they went by the way of the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002).  

<span id="008">8</span> But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and overtook
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) in the plains of
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008); and all his army was scattered from
him.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then they took the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and carried him up unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) to
[Riblah](../ebd/ebd313.htm#002) in the land of
[Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005); where he gave judgment upon him.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) slew the sons of
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) before his eyes: he slew also all the
princes of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) in
[Riblah](../ebd/ebd313.htm#002).  

<span id="011">11</span> Then he put out the eyes of
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008); and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) bound him in chains, and carried him
to [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and put him in
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006) till the day of his death.  

<span id="012">12</span> Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the
month, which was the nineteenth year of
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), came
[Nebuzaradan](../ebd/ebd268.htm#008), captain of the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009), which served the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), into
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),  

<span id="013">13</span> And burned the house of the LORD, and the
king's house; and all the houses of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),
and all the houses of the great men, burned he with fire:  

<span id="014">14</span> And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were
with the captain of the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009), brake down all
the walls of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) round about.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then [Nebuzaradan](../ebd/ebd268.htm#008) the
captain of the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009) carried away
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) certain of the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) of the people, and the residue of the
people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001),
and the rest of the multitude.  

<span id="016">16</span> But [Nebuzaradan](../ebd/ebd268.htm#008) the
captain of the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009) left certain of the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) of the land for vinedressers and for
husbandmen.  

<span id="017">17</span> Also the pillars of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003) that were in the house of the LORD, and
the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the
Chaldeans brake, and carried all the [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003) of
them to [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001).  

<span id="018">18</span> The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the
snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003) wherewith they ministered, took they
away.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the basons, and the firepans, and the
bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the
cups; that which was of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) in
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and that which was of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) in [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), took
the captain of the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009) away.  

<span id="020">20</span> The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen
bulls that were under the bases, which [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) had made in the house of the LORD: the
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003) of all these vessels was without
weight.  

<span id="021">21</span> And concerning the pillars, the height of one
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007) was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of
twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four
fingers: it was hollow.  

<span id="022">22</span> And a [chapiter](../ebd/ebd077.htm#004) of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003) was upon it; and the height of one
[chapiter](../ebd/ebd077.htm#004) was five cubits, with network and
pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003). The second
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007) also and the pomegranates were like unto
these.  

<span id="023">23</span> And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a
side; and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round
about.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the captain of the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009) took [Seraiah](../ebd/ebd328.htm#003) the
chief [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and
[Zephaniah](../ebd/ebd390.htm#008) the second
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and the three keepers of the door:  

<span id="025">25</span> He took also out of the city an
[eunuch](../ebd/ebd126.htm#008), which had the charge of the men of war;
and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) men of them that were near the king's
person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007), who mustered the people of the land; and
threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst
of the city.  

<span id="026">26</span> So [Nebuzaradan](../ebd/ebd268.htm#008) the
captain of the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009) took them, and brought
them to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) to [Riblah](../ebd/ebd313.htm#002).  

<span id="027">27</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) smote them, and put them to death in
[Riblah](../ebd/ebd313.htm#002) in the land of
[Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005). Thus [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) was
carried away [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) out of his own land.  

<span id="028">28</span> This is the people whom
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) carried away
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001): in the seventh year three thousand
Jews and three and twenty:  

<span id="029">29</span> In the eighteenth year of
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) he carried away
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) from [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005)
eight hundred thirty and two persons:  

<span id="030">30</span> In the three and twentieth year of
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006)
[Nebuzaradan](../ebd/ebd268.htm#008) the captain of the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009) carried away
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) of the Jews
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) hundred forty and five persons: all the
persons were four thousand and six hundred.  

<span id="031">31</span> And it came to pass in the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) and thirtieth year of the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) of
[Jehoiachin](../ebd/ebd201.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), in the twelfth month, in the five and
twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) in the
first year of his reign lifted up the head of
[Jehoiachin](../ebd/ebd201.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and brought him forth out of
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006).  

<span id="032">32</span> And spake kindly unto him, and set his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) above the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of the kings that were with him in
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001),  

<span id="033">33</span> And changed his [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006)
garments: and he did continually eat [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006)
before him all the days of his life.  

<span id="034">34</span> And for his diet, there was a continual diet
given him of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), every day a portion until the day of
his death, all the days of his life.
