### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 26

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, when
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) had finished all these sayings, he said
unto his disciples,  

<span id="002">2</span> Ye know that after two days is the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md),
and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then assembled together the chief priests, and
the [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md), and the elders of the people, unto
the [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md) of the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), who was called
[Caiaphas](../ebd/ebd068.htm#006.md),  

<span id="004">4</span> And consulted that they might take
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) by subtilty, and kill him.  

<span id="005">5</span> But they said, Not on the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) day, lest there be an uproar among the
people.  

<span id="006">6</span> Now when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) was in
[Bethany](../ebd/ebd054.htm#007.md), in the house of
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md) the leper,  

<span id="007">7</span> There came unto him a woman having an
[alabaster](../ebd/ebd016.htm#005) [box](../ebd/ebd063.htm#007.md) of very
precious [ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007.md), and poured it on his head,
as he sat at meat.  

<span id="008">8</span> But when his disciples saw it, they had
indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?  

<span id="009">9</span> For this [ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007.md) might
have been sold for much, and given to the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> When [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) understood
it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a
good work upon me.  

<span id="011">11</span> For ye have the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md)
always with you; but me ye have not always.  

<span id="012">12</span> For in that she hath poured this
[ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007.md) on my body, she did it for my
[burial](../ebd/ebd066.htm#008.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) shall be preached in the whole world,
there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial
of her.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then one of the twelve, called
[Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001) [Iscariot](../ebd/ebd190.htm#000.md), went
unto the chief priests,  

<span id="015">15</span> And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I
will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And from that time he sought opportunity to
betray him.  

<span id="017">17</span> Now the first day of the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) of unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) the disciples came to
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we
prepare for thee to eat the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md)?  

<span id="018">18</span> And he said, Go into the city to such a man,
and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md) at thy house with my disciples.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the disciples did as
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) had appointed them; and they made ready
the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> Now when the even was come, he sat down with
the twelve.  

<span id="021">21</span> And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto
you, that one of you shall betray me.  

<span id="022">22</span> And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began
every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?  

<span id="023">23</span> And he answered and said, He that dippeth his
hand with me in the [dish](../ebd/ebd104.htm#004.md), the same shall betray
me.  

<span id="024">24</span> The Son of man goeth as it is written of him:
but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been
good for that man if he had not been born.  

<span id="025">25</span> Then [Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001.md), which
betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou
hast said.  

<span id="026">26</span> And as they were
[eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006), [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) took
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), and blessed it, and brake it, and gave
it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.  

<span id="027">27</span> And he took the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000.md),
and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying,
[Drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) ye all of it;  

<span id="028">28</span> For this is my [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md)
of the new [testament](../ebd/ebd362.htm#007.md), which is shed for many
for the remission of sins.  

<span id="029">29</span> But I say unto you, I will not
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) henceforth of this
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of the [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md),
until that day when I [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) it new with you in
my Father's kingdom.  

<span id="030">30</span> And when they had sung an
[hymn](../ebd/ebd185.htm#005.md), they went out into the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) of Olives.  

<span id="031">31</span> Then saith [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) unto
them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is
written, I will smite the [shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006.md), and the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) of the flock shall be scattered abroad.  

<span id="032">32</span> But after I am risen again, I will go before
you into [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) answered and
said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet
will I never be offended.  

<span id="034">34</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto him,
Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou
shalt deny me thrice.  

<span id="035">35</span> [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) said unto him,
Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also
said all the disciples.  

<span id="036">36</span> Then cometh [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) with
them unto a place called [Gethsemane](../ebd/ebd147.htm#003.md), and saith
unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.  

<span id="037">37</span> And he took with him
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) and the two sons of
[Zebedee](../ebd/ebd388.htm#008.md), and began to be sorrowful and very
heavy.  

<span id="038">38</span> Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding
sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.  

<span id="039">39</span> And he went a little farther, and fell on his
face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000.md) pass from me: nevertheless not as I will,
but as thou wilt.  

<span id="040">40</span> And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth
them asleep, and saith unto [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md), What, could
ye not watch with me one hour?  

<span id="041">41</span> Watch and pray, that ye enter not into
[temptation](../ebd/ebd361.htm#008): the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md)
indeed is willing, but the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) is weak.  

<span id="042">42</span> He went away again the second time, and prayed,
saying, O my Father, if this [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000.md) may not pass
away from me, except I [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) it, thy will be
done.  

<span id="043">43</span> And he came and found them asleep again: for
their eyes were heavy.  

<span id="044">44</span> And he left them, and went away again, and
prayed the third time, saying the same words.  

<span id="045">45</span> Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto
them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and
the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.  

<span id="046">46</span> Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand
that doth betray me.  

<span id="047">47</span> And while he yet spake, lo,
[Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001.md), one of the twelve, came, and with him a
great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and
elders of the people.  

<span id="048">48</span> Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign,
saying, Whomsoever I shall [kiss](../ebd/ebd221.htm#000.md), that same is
he: hold him [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md).  

<span id="049">49</span> And forthwith he came to
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), and said, [Hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002.md),
master; and kissed him.  

<span id="050">50</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto
him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) and took him.  

<span id="051">51</span> And, behold, one of them which were with
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) stretched out his hand, and drew his
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), and struck a servant of the high
priest's, and smote off his [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md).  

<span id="052">52</span> Then said [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) unto
him, Put up again thy [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) into his place: for
all they that take the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) shall perish with
the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md).  

<span id="053">53</span> Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my
Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of
angels?  

<span id="054">54</span> But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled,
that thus it must be?  

<span id="055">55</span> In that same hour said
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) to the multitudes, Are ye come out as
against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with
you teaching in the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), and ye laid no hold
on me.  

<span id="056">56</span> But all this was done, that the scriptures of
the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and
fled.  

<span id="057">57</span> And they that had laid hold on
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) led him away to
[Caiaphas](../ebd/ebd068.htm#006.md) the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), where the
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md) and the elders were assembled.  

<span id="058">58</span> But [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) followed him
afar off unto the high priest's [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md), and
went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.  

<span id="059">59</span> Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the
[council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004.md), sought false
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) against [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md),
to put him to death;  

<span id="060">60</span> But found none: yea, though many false
witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false
witnesses,  

<span id="061">61</span> And said, This fellow said, I am able to
destroy the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) of God, and to build it in
three days.  

<span id="062">62</span> And the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) against thee?  

<span id="063">63</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) held his
peace, And the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) answered and said
unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether
thou be the [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), the Son of God.  

<span id="064">64</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saith unto him,
Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the
Son of man [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md) on the right hand of power,
and coming in the clouds of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="065">65</span> Then the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) his clothes, saying, He hath spoken
[blasphemy](../ebd/ebd060.htm#005.md); what further need have we of
witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his
[blasphemy](../ebd/ebd060.htm#005.md).  

<span id="066">66</span> What think ye? They answered and said, He is
guilty of death.  

<span id="067">67</span> Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted
him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,  

<span id="068">68</span> Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), Who is he that smote thee?  

<span id="069">69</span> Now [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) sat without
in the [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md): and a damsel came unto him,
saying, Thou also wast with [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) of
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md).  

<span id="070">70</span> But he denied before them all, saying, I know
not what thou sayest.  

<span id="071">71</span> And when he was gone out into the porch,
another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow
was also with [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) of
[Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007.md).  

<span id="072">72</span> And again he denied with an
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md), I do not know the man.  

<span id="073">73</span> And after a while came unto him they that stood
by, and said to [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md), Surely thou also art one
of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.  

<span id="074">74</span> Then began he to [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md)
and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock
crew.  

<span id="075">75</span> And [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) remembered
the word of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), which said unto him, Before
the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept
bitterly.
