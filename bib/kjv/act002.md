### King James Version: Acts Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> And when the day of
[Pentecost](../ebd/ebd289.htm#004) was fully come, they were all with
one accord in one place.  

<span id="002">2</span> And suddenly there came a sound from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) as of a rushing mighty wind, and it
filled all the house where they were [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009).  

<span id="003">3</span> And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like
as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.  

<span id="004">4</span> And they were all filled with the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005), and began to speak with other tongues,
as the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) gave them utterance.  

<span id="005">5</span> And there were dwelling at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) Jews, devout men, out of every nation
under [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="006">6</span> Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude
came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them
speak in his own language.  

<span id="007">7</span> And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying
one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?  

<span id="008">8</span> And how hear we every man in our own tongue,
wherein we were born?  

<span id="009">9</span> [Parthians](../ebd/ebd285.htm#006), and Medes,
and Elamites, and the dwellers in [Mesopotamia](../ebd/ebd251.htm#003),
and in Judaea, and [Cappadocia](../ebd/ebd071.htm#009), in
[Pontus](../ebd/ebd298.htm#003), and [Asia](../ebd/ebd034.htm#008),  

<span id="010">10</span> [Phrygia](../ebd/ebd294.htm#006), and
[Pamphylia](../ebd/ebd283.htm#008), in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009),
and in the parts of [Libya](../ebd/ebd228.htm#006) about
[Cyrene](../ebd/ebd095.htm#004), and strangers of
[Rome](../ebd/ebd315.htm#007), Jews and proselytes,  

<span id="011">11</span> Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in
our tongues the wonderful works of God.  

<span id="012">12</span> And they were all amazed, and were in doubt,
saying one to another, What meaneth this?  

<span id="013">13</span> Others mocking said, These men are full of new
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000).  

<span id="014">14</span> But [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002), standing up
with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of
Judaea, and all ye that dwell at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), be
this known unto you, and hearken to my words:  

<span id="015">15</span> For these are not drunken, as ye suppose,
seeing it is but the third hour of the day.  

<span id="016">16</span> But this is that which was spoken by the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) [Joel](../ebd/ebd208.htm#005);  

<span id="017">17</span> And it shall come to pass in the last days,
saith God, I will pour out of my [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) upon
all [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007): and your sons and your daughters
shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men
shall [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005) dreams:  

<span id="018">18</span> And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will
pour out in those days of my [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009); and they
shall prophesy:  

<span id="019">19</span> And I will shew wonders in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) above, and signs in the earth beneath;
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and fire, and vapour of smoke:  

<span id="020">20</span> The [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) shall be
turned into [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008), and the
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004) into [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000),
before the great and notable day of the Lord come:  

<span id="021">21</span> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall
call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  

<span id="022">22</span> Ye men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), hear
these words; [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) of
[Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007), a man approved of God among you by
miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of
you, as ye yourselves also know:  

<span id="023">23</span> Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel
and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have
crucified and slain:  

<span id="024">24</span> Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the
pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of
it.  

<span id="025">25</span> For [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) speaketh
concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on
my right hand, that I should not be moved:  

<span id="026">26</span> Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue
was glad; moreover also my [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) shall rest in
hope:  

<span id="027">27</span> Because thou wilt not leave my soul in
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003), neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One
to see corruption.  

<span id="028">28</span> Thou hast made known to me the ways of life;
thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.  

<span id="029">29</span> Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you
of the [patriarch](../ebd/ebd286.htm#009)
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), that he is both dead and buried, and his
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001) is with us unto this day.  

<span id="030">30</span> Therefore being a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), and knowing that God had sworn with an
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) to him, that of the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of his loins, according to the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), he would raise up
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) to sit on his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001);  

<span id="031">31</span> He seeing this before spake of the resurrection
of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), that his soul was not left in
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003), neither his
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) did see corruption.  

<span id="032">32</span> This [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) hath God
raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.  

<span id="033">33</span> Therefore being by the right hand of God
exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005), he hath shed forth this, which ye now
see and hear.  

<span id="034">34</span> For [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) is not
ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my
Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,  

<span id="035">35</span> Until I make thy foes thy
[footstool](../ebd/ebd136.htm#009).  

<span id="036">36</span> Therefore let all the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) know assuredly, that God hath made the
same [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), whom ye have crucified, both Lord
and [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="037">37</span> Now when they heard this, they were pricked in
their heart, and said unto [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) and to the
rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?  

<span id="038">38</span> Then [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) said unto
them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) for the
remission of sins, and ye shall receive the
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005) of the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005).  

<span id="039">39</span> For the promise is unto you, and to your
children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God
shall call.  

<span id="040">40</span> And with many other words did he testify and
exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008).  

<span id="041">41</span> Then they that gladly received his word were
baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three
thousand souls.  

<span id="042">42</span> And they continued stedfastly in the apostles'
doctrine and [fellowship](../ebd/ebd132.htm#002), and in breaking of
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and in prayers.  

<span id="043">43</span> And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders
and signs were done by the apostles.  

<span id="044">44</span> And all that believed were together, and had
all things common;  

<span id="045">45</span> And sold their possessions and goods, and
parted them to all men, as every man had need.  

<span id="046">46</span> And they, continuing daily with one accord in
the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), and breaking
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) from house to house, did eat their meat
with gladness and singleness of heart,  

<span id="047">47</span> Praising God, and having favour with all the
people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be
saved.
