### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> And the child [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md)
ministered unto the LORD before [Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007.md). And the
word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And it came to pass at that time, when
[Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007.md) was laid down in his place, and his eyes
began to [wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000.md) dim, that he could not see;  

<span id="003">3</span> And ere the [lamp](../ebd/ebd223.htm#007.md) of God
went out in the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) of the LORD, where the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God was, and
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) was laid down to sleep;  

<span id="004">4</span> That the LORD called
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md): and he answered, Here am I.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he ran unto [Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007.md),
and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not;
lie down again. And he went and lay down.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the LORD called yet again,
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001). And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md)
arose and went to [Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007.md), and said, Here am I; for
thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down
again.  

<span id="007">7</span> Now [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) did not yet
know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the LORD called
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) again the third time. And he arose and
went to [Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007.md), and said, Here am I; for thou
didst call me. And [Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007.md) perceived that the LORD
had called the child.  

<span id="009">9</span> Therefore [Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007.md) said unto
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md), Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he
call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) went and lay down in his place.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at
other times, [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md),
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001). Then [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md)
answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the LORD said to
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md), Behold, I will do a thing in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), at which both the ears of every one
that heareth it shall tingle.  

<span id="012">12</span> In that day I will perform against
[Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007.md) all things which I have spoken concerning
his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.  

<span id="013">13</span> For I have told him that I will
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) his house for ever for the iniquity which
he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained
them not.  

<span id="014">14</span> And therefore I have sworn unto the house of
[Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007.md), that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not
be purged with [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) nor
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) for ever.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) lay until
the morning, and opened the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) of the house
of the LORD. And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) feared to shew
[Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007) the [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> Then [Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007.md) called
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md), and said,
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md), my son. And he answered, Here am I.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he said, What is the thing that the LORD
hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee,
and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he
said unto thee.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) told him
every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let
him do what seemeth him good.  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) grew, and
the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the
ground.  

<span id="020">20</span> And all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) from
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009) even to [Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008.md)
knew that [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) was established to be a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) of the LORD.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the LORD appeared again in
[Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008.md): for the LORD revealed himself to
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) in [Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008.md) by
the word of the LORD.
