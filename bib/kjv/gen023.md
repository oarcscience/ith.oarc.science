### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 23

<span id="001">1</span> And [Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md) was an
hundred and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) and twenty years old: these
were the years of the life of [Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md) died in
Kirjatharba; the same is [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004.md) in the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005): and [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md)
came to [mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004.md) for
[Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md), and to weep for her.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) stood up
from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of
[Heth](../ebd/ebd177.htm#001.md), saying,  

<span id="004">4</span> I am a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) and a
sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you,
that I may bury my dead out of my sight.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the children of
[Heth](../ebd/ebd177.htm#001) answered [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md),
saying unto him,  

<span id="006">6</span> Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) among us: in the choice of our
sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md), but that thou mayest bury thy
dead.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) stood up,
and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of
[Heth](../ebd/ebd177.htm#001.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And he communed with them, saying, If it be your
mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat
for me to [Ephron](../ebd/ebd123.htm#008.md) the son of
[Zohar](../ebd/ebd395.htm#006.md),  

<span id="009">9</span> That he may give me the
[cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006) of [Machpelah](../ebd/ebd235.htm#007.md),
which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it
is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst
you.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Ephron](../ebd/ebd123.htm#008.md) dwelt among
the children of [Heth](../ebd/ebd177.htm#001.md): and
[Ephron](../ebd/ebd123.htm#008.md) the Hittite answered
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) in the audience of the children of
[Heth](../ebd/ebd177.htm#001.md), even of all that went in at the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) of his city, saying,  

<span id="011">11</span> Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee,
and the [cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006.md) that is therein, I give it thee;
in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy
dead.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) bowed down
himself before the people of the land.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he spake unto
[Ephron](../ebd/ebd123.htm#008.md) in the audience of the people of the
land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will
give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead
there.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Ephron](../ebd/ebd123.htm#008.md) answered
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), saying unto him,  

<span id="015">15</span> My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth
four hundred shekels of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md); what is that
betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) hearkened
unto [Ephron](../ebd/ebd123.htm#008.md); and
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) weighed to
[Ephron](../ebd/ebd123.htm#008) the [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md),
which he had named in the audience of the sons of
[Heth](../ebd/ebd177.htm#001.md), four hundred shekels of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), current money with the
[merchant](../ebd/ebd249.htm#003.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And the field of
[Ephron](../ebd/ebd123.htm#008.md) which was in
[Machpelah](../ebd/ebd235.htm#007.md), which was before
[Mamre](../ebd/ebd239.htm#008.md), the field, and the
[cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006.md) which was therein, and all the trees that
were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made
sure  

<span id="018">18</span> Unto [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) for a
possession in the presence of the children of
[Heth](../ebd/ebd177.htm#001.md), before all that went in at the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) of his city.  

<span id="019">19</span> And after this,
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) buried [Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md)
his wife in the [cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006.md) of the field of
[Machpelah](../ebd/ebd235.htm#007.md) before
[Mamre](../ebd/ebd239.htm#008.md): the same is
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004.md) in the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And the field, and the
[cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006.md) that is therein, were made sure unto
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) for a possession of a buryingplace by
the sons of [Heth](../ebd/ebd177.htm#001.md).
