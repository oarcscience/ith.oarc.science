### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 27

<span id="001">1</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) with the
elders of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) commanded the people, saying,
Keep all the commandments which I command you this day.  

<span id="002">2</span> And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass
over [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) unto the land which the LORD thy
God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaister
them with plaister:  

<span id="003">3</span> And thou shalt write upon them all the words of
this law, when thou art passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the
land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth with
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000) and [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001); as the
LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), that ye shall set up these stones,
which I command you this day, in [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Ebal](../ebd/ebd111.htm#007), and thou shalt plaister them with
plaister.  

<span id="005">5</span> And there shalt thou build an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) unto the LORD thy God, an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of stones: thou shalt not lift up any
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004) tool upon them.  

<span id="006">6</span> Thou shalt build the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of the LORD thy God of whole stones: and
thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God:  

<span id="007">7</span> And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt
eat there, and rejoice before the LORD thy God.  

<span id="008">8</span> And thou shalt write upon the stones all the
words of this law very plainly.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and the
priests the Levites spake unto all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),
saying, Take heed, and hearken, O [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); this
day thou art become the people of the LORD thy God.  

<span id="010">10</span> Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD
thy God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee
this day.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) charged the
people the same day, saying,  

<span id="012">12</span> These shall stand upon
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Gerizim](../ebd/ebd146.htm#007) to
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) the people, when ye are come over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004); [Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002), and
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006), and [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and
[Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002), and [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005),
and [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008):  

<span id="013">13</span> And these shall stand upon
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Ebal](../ebd/ebd111.htm#007) to
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003); [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009),
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007), and [Asher](../ebd/ebd033.htm#008), and
[Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003), [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009), and
[Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006).  

<span id="014">14</span> And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all
the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) with a loud voice,  

<span id="015">15</span> Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or
molten image, an [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) unto the LORD, the
work of the hands of the craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place.
And all the people shall answer and say,
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).  

<span id="016">16</span> Cursed be he that setteth light by his father
or his mother. And all the people shall say,
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).  

<span id="017">17</span> Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour's
[landmark](../ebd/ebd223.htm#008). And all the people shall say,
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).  

<span id="018">18</span> Cursed be he that maketh the
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009) to wander out of the way. And all the
people shall say, [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).  

<span id="019">19</span> Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of
the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), fatherless, and widow. And all
the people shall say, [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).  

<span id="020">20</span> Cursed be he that lieth with his father's wife;
because he uncovereth his father's skirt. And all the people shall say,
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).  

<span id="021">21</span> Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001). And all the people shall say,
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).  

<span id="022">22</span> Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the
daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the
people shall say, [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).  

<span id="023">23</span> Cursed be he that lieth with his mother in law.
And all the people shall say, [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).  

<span id="024">24</span> Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour
secretly. And all the people shall say, [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).  

<span id="025">25</span> Cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an
innocent person. And all the people shall say,
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).  

<span id="026">26</span> Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words
of this law to do them. And all the people shall say,
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).
