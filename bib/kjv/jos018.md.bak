### King James Version: Joshua Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> And the whole
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) assembled together at
[Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008.md), and set up the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) there. And the land was subdued
before them.  

<span id="002">2</span> And there remained among the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) tribes,
which had not yet received their inheritance.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) said unto
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), How long are ye slack
to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given
you?  

<span id="004">4</span> Give out from among you three men for each
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md): and I will send them, and they shall
rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the
inheritance of them; and they shall come again to me.  

<span id="005">5</span> And they shall divide it into
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) parts: [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)
shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) shall abide in their coasts on the
north.  

<span id="006">6</span> Ye shall therefore describe the land into
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) parts, and bring the description hither
to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.  

<span id="007">7</span> But the Levites have no part among you; for the
priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance: and
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007), and [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009.md), and
half the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md), have received their inheritance
beyond [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) on the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000), which [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) the
servant of the LORD gave them.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the men arose, and went away: and
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) charged them that went to describe the
land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come
again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in
[Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And the men went and passed through the land,
and described it by cities into [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) parts in
a book, and came again to [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) to the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) at [Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) cast lots
for them in [Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008.md) before the LORD: and there
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) divided the land unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) according to their divisions.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the lot of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md) came up according to their families:
and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and the children of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And their border on the north side was from
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md); and the border went up to the side of
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md) on the north side, and went up through
the mountains [westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008.md); and the goings out
thereof were at the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) of Bethaven.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the border went over from thence toward
[Luz](../ebd/ebd233.htm#006.md), to the side of
[Luz](../ebd/ebd233.htm#006), which is [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md),
southward; and the border descended to Atarothadar, near the hill that
lieth on the south side of the nether Bethhoron.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the border was drawn thence, and compassed
the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that lieth before
Bethhoron southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal,
which is Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md): this was the west quarter.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the south quarter was from the end of
Kirjathjearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the
well of waters of [Nephtoah](../ebd/ebd270.htm#006.md):  

<span id="016">16</span> And the border came down to the end of the
mountain that lieth before the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) of the
son of [Hinnom](../ebd/ebd179.htm#002.md), and which is in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of the [giants](../ebd/ebd147.htm#006.md)
on the north, and descended to the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) of
[Hinnom](../ebd/ebd179.htm#002.md), to the side of Jebusi on the south, and
descended to Enrogel,  

<span id="017">17</span> And was drawn from the north, and went forth to
Enshemesh, and went forth toward [Geliloth](../ebd/ebd145.htm#006.md),
which is over against the going up of [Adummim](../ebd/ebd011.htm#000.md),
and descended to the [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) of Bohan the son of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009.md),  

<span id="018">18</span> And passed along toward the side over against
[Arabah](../ebd/ebd027.htm#008) [northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002.md), and
went down unto [Arabah](../ebd/ebd027.htm#008.md):  

<span id="019">19</span> And the border passed along to the side of
Bethhoglah [northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002.md): and the outgoings of the
border were at the north [bay](../ebd/ebd048.htm#001.md) of the
[salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008.md) sea at the south end of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md): this was the south coast.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) was the
border of it on the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) side. This was the
inheritance of the children of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md), by the
coasts thereof round about, according to their families.  

<span id="021">21</span> Now the cities of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md) according to their families were
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md), and Bethhoglah, and the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [Keziz](../ebd/ebd218.htm#004.md),  

<span id="022">22</span> And Betharabah, and
[Zemaraim](../ebd/ebd390.htm#004.md), and
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md),  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Avim](../ebd/ebd037.htm#001.md), and Pharah,
and [Ophrah](../ebd/ebd279.htm#009.md),  

<span id="024">24</span> And Chepharhaammonai, and
[Ophni](../ebd/ebd279.htm#008.md), and Gaba; twelve cities with their
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md):  

<span id="025">25</span> [Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002.md), and
[Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005), and [Beeroth](../ebd/ebd050.htm#006.md),  

<span id="026">26</span> And Mizpeh, and
[Chephirah](../ebd/ebd079.htm#000.md), and
[Mozah](../ebd/ebd261.htm#008.md),  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Rekem](../ebd/ebd310.htm#002.md), and Irpeel,
and Taralah,  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Zelah](../ebd/ebd390.htm#000.md), Eleph, and
Jebusi, which is [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), Gibeath, and
[Kirjath](../ebd/ebd220.htm#000.md); fourteen cities with their
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md). This is the inheritance of the
children of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md) according to their
families.
