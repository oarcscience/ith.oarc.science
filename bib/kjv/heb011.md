### King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> Now faith is the substance of things hoped for,
the evidence of things not seen.  

<span id="002">2</span> For by it the elders obtained a good report.  

<span id="003">3</span> Through faith we understand that the worlds were
framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made
of things which do appear.  

<span id="004">4</span> By faith [Abel](../ebd/ebd001.htm#004) offered
unto God a more excellent [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) than
[Cain](../ebd/ebd068.htm#007), by which he obtained
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) that he was righteous, God testifying
of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.  

<span id="005">5</span> By faith [Enoch](../ebd/ebd121.htm#004) was
translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God
had translated him: for before his translation he had this
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008), that he pleased God.  

<span id="006">6</span> But without faith it is impossible to please
him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a
rewarder of them that diligently seek him.  

<span id="007">7</span> By faith [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002), being
warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) to the saving of his house; by the which he
condemned the world, and became [heir](../ebd/ebd171.htm#007) of the
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) which is by faith.  

<span id="008">8</span> By faith [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), when
he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for
an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.  

<span id="009">9</span> By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as
in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006) and [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), the
heirs with him of the same promise:  

<span id="010">10</span> For he looked for a city which hath
foundations, whose builder and maker is God.  

<span id="011">11</span> Through faith also Sara herself received
strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was
past age, because she judged him [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) who
had promised.  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as
good as dead, so many as the [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008) of the sky
in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.  

<span id="013">13</span> These all died in faith, not having received
the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them,
and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims
on the earth.  

<span id="014">14</span> For they that say such things declare plainly
that they seek a country.  

<span id="015">15</span> And truly, if they had been mindful of that
country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to
have returned.  

<span id="016">16</span> But now they desire a better country, that is,
an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he
hath prepared for them a city.  

<span id="017">17</span> By faith [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), when
he was tried, offered up [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006): and he that had
received the promises offered up his only begotten son,  

<span id="018">18</span> Of whom it was said, That in
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006) shall thy seed be called:  

<span id="019">19</span> Accounting that God was able to raise him up,
even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.  

<span id="020">20</span> By faith [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006) blessed
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) and [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005)
concerning things to come.  

<span id="021">21</span> By faith [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), when
he was a dying, blessed both the sons of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005); and worshipped, leaning upon the top of
his staff.  

<span id="022">22</span> By faith [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), when
he died, made mention of the departing of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and gave commandment concerning his
bones.  

<span id="023">23</span> By faith [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), when
he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he
was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's
commandment.  

<span id="024">24</span> By faith [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), when
he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's
daughter;  

<span id="025">25</span> Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the
people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) for a season;  

<span id="026">26</span> Esteeming the reproach of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) greater riches than the treasures in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009): for he had respect unto the recompence
of the reward.  

<span id="027">27</span> By faith he forsook
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), not fearing the wrath of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001): for he endured, as seeing him who is
invisible.  

<span id="028">28</span> Through faith he kept the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005), and the sprinkling of
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), lest he that destroyed the firstborn
should touch them.  

<span id="029">29</span> By faith they passed through the Red sea as by
dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.  

<span id="030">30</span> By faith the walls of
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008) fell down, after they were compassed
about [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days.  

<span id="031">31</span> By faith the [harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005)
[Rahab](../ebd/ebd305.htm#006) perished not with them that believed not,
when she had received the [spies](../ebd/ebd349.htm#007) with peace.  

<span id="032">32</span> And what shall I more say? for the time would
fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of [Barak](../ebd/ebd044.htm#005), and of
[Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000), and of Jephthae; of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) also, and
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001), and of the prophets:  

<span id="033">33</span> Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), obtained promises, stopped the
mouths of [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001).  

<span id="034">34</span> Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge
of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), out of weakness were made strong,
waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.  

<span id="035">35</span> Women received their dead raised to life again:
and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might
obtain a better resurrection:  

<span id="036">36</span> And others had trial of cruel mockings and
scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:  

<span id="037">37</span> They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were
tempted, were slain with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003): they
wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted,
tormented;  

<span id="038">38</span> (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they
wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the
earth.  

<span id="039">39</span> And these all, having obtained a good report
through faith, received not the promise:  

<span id="040">40</span> God having provided some better thing for us,
that they without us should not be made perfect.
