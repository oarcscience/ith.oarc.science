### King James Version: Luke Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> Now upon the first day of the week, very early
in the morning, they came unto the [sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md),
bringing the [spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005.md) which they had prepared,
and certain others with them.  

<span id="002">2</span> And they found the
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) rolled away from the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And they entered in, and found not the body of
the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed
thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:  

<span id="005">5</span> And as they were afraid, and bowed down their
faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among
the dead?  

<span id="006">6</span> He is not here, but is risen: remember how he
spake unto you when he was yet in [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md),  

<span id="007">7</span> Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into
the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise
again.  

<span id="008">8</span> And they remembered his words,  

<span id="009">9</span> And returned from the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md), and told all these things unto the
eleven, and to all the rest.  

<span id="010">10</span> It was [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md)
[Magdalene](../ebd/ebd236.htm#005) and [Joanna](../ebd/ebd207.htm#009.md),
and [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md) the mother of
[James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md), and other women that were with them,
which told these things unto the apostles.  

<span id="011">11</span> And their words seemed to them as idle tales,
and they believed them not.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then arose [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md), and
ran unto the [sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md); and stooping down, he
beheld the [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md) clothes laid by themselves,
and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.  

<span id="013">13</span> And, behold, two of them went that same day to
a village called [Emmaus](../ebd/ebd120.htm#001.md), which was from
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) about threescore furlongs.  

<span id="014">14</span> And they talked together of all these things
which had happened.  

<span id="015">15</span> And it came to pass, that, while they communed
together and reasoned, [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) himself drew near,
and went with them.  

<span id="016">16</span> But their eyes were holden that they should not
know him.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he said unto them, What manner of
communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and
are sad?  

<span id="018">18</span> And the one of them, whose name was
[Cleopas](../ebd/ebd084.htm#007.md), answering said unto him, Art thou only
a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and hast not known the things which
are come to pass there in these days?  

<span id="019">19</span> And he said unto them, What things? And they
said unto him, Concerning [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) of
[Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007.md), which was a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) mighty in deed and word before God and
all the people:  

<span id="020">20</span> And how the chief priests and our rulers
delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.  

<span id="021">21</span> But we trusted that it had been he which should
have redeemed [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and beside all this, to
day is the third day since these things were done.  

<span id="022">22</span> Yea, and certain women also of our company made
us astonished, which were early at the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md);  

<span id="023">23</span> And when they found not his body, they came,
saying, that they had also seen a [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md) of
angels, which said that he was alive.  

<span id="024">24</span> And certain of them which were with us went to
the [sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md), and found it even so as the
women had said: but him they saw not.  

<span id="025">25</span> Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of
heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:  

<span id="026">26</span> Ought not [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) to
have suffered these things, and to enter into his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md)?  

<span id="027">27</span> And beginning at [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md)
and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the
things concerning himself.  

<span id="028">28</span> And they drew nigh unto the village, whither
they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.  

<span id="029">29</span> But they constrained him, saying, Abide with
us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in
to tarry with them.  

<span id="030">30</span> And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with
them, he took [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), and blessed it, and brake,
and gave to them.  

<span id="031">31</span> And their eyes were opened, and they knew him;
and he vanished out of their sight.  

<span id="032">32</span> And they said one to another, Did not our heart
burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened
to us the scriptures?  

<span id="033">33</span> And they rose up the same hour, and returned to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and found the eleven gathered
together, and them that were with them,  

<span id="034">34</span> Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath
appeared to [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md).  

<span id="035">35</span> And they told what things were done in the way,
and how he was known of them in breaking of
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md).  

<span id="036">36</span> And as they thus spake,
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) himself stood in the midst of them, and
saith unto them, Peace be unto you.  

<span id="037">37</span> But they were terrified and affrighted, and
supposed that they had seen a [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md).  

<span id="038">38</span> And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and
why do thoughts arise in your hearts?  

<span id="039">39</span> Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I
myself: handle me, and see; for a [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) hath
not [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) and bones, as ye see me have.  

<span id="040">40</span> And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his
hands and his feet.  

<span id="041">41</span> And while they yet believed not for joy, and
wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?  

<span id="042">42</span> And they gave him a piece of a broiled
[fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005.md), and of an honeycomb.  

<span id="043">43</span> And he took it, and did eat before them.  

<span id="044">44</span> And he said unto them, These are the words
which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must
be fulfilled, which were written in the law of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), and in the prophets, and in the
[psalms](../ebd/ebd301.htm#005.md), concerning me.  

<span id="045">45</span> Then opened he their understanding, that they
might understand the scriptures,  

<span id="046">46</span> And said unto them, Thus it is written, and
thus it behoved [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) to suffer, and to rise
from the dead the third day:  

<span id="047">47</span> And that [repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008.md)
and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations,
beginning at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="048">48</span> And ye are witnesses of these things.  

<span id="049">49</span> And, behold, I send the promise of my Father
upon you: but tarry ye in the city of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), until ye be endued with power from
on high.  

<span id="050">50</span> And he led them out as far as to
[Bethany](../ebd/ebd054.htm#007.md), and he lifted up his hands, and
blessed them.  

<span id="051">51</span> And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he
was parted from them, and carried up into
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="052">52</span> And they worshipped him, and returned to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) with great joy:  

<span id="053">53</span> And were continually in the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), praising and blessing God.
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).
