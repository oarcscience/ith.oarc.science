</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;One <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#009">basket</A> had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#009">basket</A> had very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A>? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and his princes, and the residue of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#002">proverb</A>, a taunt and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A>, in all places whither I shall drive them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And I will send the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.<BR>
