<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 18</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And he spake a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A> unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Saying, There was in a city a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A>, which feared not God, neither regarded man:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> saith.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And he spake this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A> unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Two men went up into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#009">publican</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#009">publican</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#009">publican</A>, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> enter therein.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A>, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A>, Honour thy father and thy mother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Now when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>, and thou shalt have treasure in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>: and come, follow me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;For it is easier for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#000">camel</A> to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;For he shall be delivered unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</A>, a certain <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> man sat by the way side begging:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And they told him, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</A> passeth by.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And he cried, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, thou son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> on me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> on me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.<BR>
