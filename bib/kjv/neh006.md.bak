### King James Version: Nehemiah Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> Now it came to pass when
[Sanballat](../ebd/ebd321.htm#003), and [Tobiah](../ebd/ebd369.htm#001.md),
and [Geshem](../ebd/ebd147.htm#000.md) the Arabian, and the rest of our
enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no
[breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005.md) left therein; (though at that time I had
not set up the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009) upon the gates;.md)  

<span id="002">2</span> That [Sanballat](../ebd/ebd321.htm#003.md) and
[Geshem](../ebd/ebd147.htm#000.md) sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet
together in some one of the [villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md) in the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) of [Ono](../ebd/ebd279.htm#002.md). But they
thought to do me mischief.  

<span id="003">3</span> And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am
doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work
cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?  

<span id="004">4</span> Yet they sent unto me four times after this
sort; and I answered them after the same manner.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then sent [Sanballat](../ebd/ebd321.htm#003.md) his
servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his
hand;  

<span id="006">6</span> Wherein was written, It is reported among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the
Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou
mayest be their [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), according to these
words.  

<span id="007">7</span> And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach
of thee at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), saying, There is a
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) in [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md): and now
shall it be reported to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) according to
these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such
things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own
heart.  

<span id="009">9</span> For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands
shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O
God, strengthen my hands.  

<span id="010">10</span> Afterward I came unto the house of
[Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005.md) the son of
[Delaiah](../ebd/ebd101.htm#001.md) the son of
[Mehetabeel](../ebd/ebd246.htm#005.md), who was shut up; and he said, Let
us meet together in the house of God, within the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), and let us shut the
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009) of the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md):
for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to
slay thee.  

<span id="011">11</span> And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and
who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) to save his life? I will not go in.  

<span id="012">12</span> And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him;
but that he pronounced this [prophecy](../ebd/ebd300.htm#007.md) against
me: for [Tobiah](../ebd/ebd369.htm#001.md) and
[Sanballat](../ebd/ebd321.htm#003.md) had hired him.  

<span id="013">13</span> Therefore was he hired, that I should be
afraid, and do so, and [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), and that they might
have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.  

<span id="014">14</span> My God, think thou upon
[Tobiah](../ebd/ebd369.htm#001) and [Sanballat](../ebd/ebd321.htm#003.md)
according to these their works, and on the prophetess
[Noadiah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#001.md), and the rest of the prophets, that
would have put me in fear.  

<span id="015">15</span> So the wall was finished in the twenty and
fifth day of the month [Elul](../ebd/ebd119.htm#003.md), in fifty and two
days.  

<span id="016">16</span> And it came to pass, that when all our enemies
heard thereof, and all the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) that were
about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes:
for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.  

<span id="017">17</span> Moreover in those days the nobles of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) sent many letters unto
[Tobiah](../ebd/ebd369.htm#001.md), and the letters of
[Tobiah](../ebd/ebd369.htm#001.md) came unto them.  

<span id="018">18</span> For there were many in
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) sworn unto him, because he was the son in
law of [Shechaniah](../ebd/ebd333.htm#002.md) the son of Arah; and his son
[Johanan](../ebd/ebd208.htm#009.md) had taken the daughter of
[Meshullam](../ebd/ebd251.htm#001.md) the son of
[Berechiah](../ebd/ebd053.htm#003.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> Also they reported his good deeds before me,
and uttered my words to him. And [Tobiah](../ebd/ebd369.htm#001.md) sent
letters to put me in fear.
