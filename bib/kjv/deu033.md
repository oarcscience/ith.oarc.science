### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 33

<span id="001">1</span> And this is the blessing, wherewith
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) the man of God blessed the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) before his death.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he said, The LORD came from
[Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009.md), and rose up from
[Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004.md) unto them; he shined forth from
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Paran](../ebd/ebd284.htm#006.md), and he
came with ten [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md) of saints: from his
right hand went a fiery law for them.  

<span id="003">3</span> Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in
thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy
words.  

<span id="004">4</span> [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) commanded us a
law, even the inheritance of the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md)
of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And he was [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) in
[Jeshurun](../ebd/ebd205.htm#004.md), when the heads of the people and the
tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) were gathered together.  

<span id="006">6</span> Let [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009.md) live, and
not die; and let not his men be few.  

<span id="007">7</span> And this is the blessing of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md): and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and bring him unto his people: let his
hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his
enemies.  

<span id="008">8</span> And of [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006.md) he said,
Let thy [Thummim](../ebd/ebd365.htm#002.md) and thy
[Urim](../ebd/ebd375.htm#005.md) be with thy holy one, whom thou didst
prove at [Massah](../ebd/ebd243.htm#006.md), and with whom thou didst
strive at the waters of [Meribah](../ebd/ebd249.htm#009.md);  

<span id="009">9</span> Who said unto his father and to his mother, I
have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his
own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> They shall teach [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md)
thy judgments, and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) thy law: they shall
put [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) before thee, and whole burnt
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) upon thine
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> [Bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md), LORD, his
substance, and accept the work of his hands; smite through the loins of
them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise
not again.  

<span id="012">12</span> And of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md) he
said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord
shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his
shoulders.  

<span id="013">13</span> And of [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) he said,
Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the precious things of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), for the [dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md),
and for the [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) that coucheth beneath,  

<span id="014">14</span> And for the precious fruits brought forth by
the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md), and for the precious things put forth
by the [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004.md),  

<span id="015">15</span> And for the chief things of the ancient
mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,  

<span id="016">16</span> And for the precious things of the earth and
[fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007.md) thereof, and for the good will of him
that dwelt in the [bush](../ebd/ebd067.htm#000.md): let the blessing come
upon the head of [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), and upon the top of
the head of him that was separated from his brethren.  

<span id="017">17</span> His [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) is like the
firstling of his [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md), and his horns are
like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together
to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008) of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md),
and they are the [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md) of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And of [Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003.md) he
said, Rejoice, [Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003.md), in thy going out; and,
[Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002.md), in thy tents.  

<span id="019">19</span> They shall call the people unto the mountain;
there they shall offer sacrifices of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md): for they shall suck of the
abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.  

<span id="020">20</span> And of [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md) he said,
Blessed be he that enlargeth [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md): he dwelleth
as a lion, and teareth the arm with the [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md)
of the head.  

<span id="021">21</span> And he provided the first part for himself,
because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came
with the heads of the people, he executed the
[justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007.md) of the LORD, and his judgments with
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And of [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md) he said,
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md) is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And of [Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006.md) he
said, O [Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006.md), satisfied with favour, and
full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the
south.  

<span id="024">24</span> And of [Asher](../ebd/ebd033.htm#008.md) he said,
Let [Asher](../ebd/ebd033.htm#008.md) be blessed with children; let him be
acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.  

<span id="025">25</span> Thy shoes shall be
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004) and [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md); and as
thy days, so shall thy strength be.  

<span id="026">26</span> There is none like unto the God of
[Jeshurun](../ebd/ebd205.htm#004.md), who rideth upon the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) in thy help, and in his excellency on
the sky.  

<span id="027">27</span> The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath
are the [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) arms: and he shall thrust
out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.  

<span id="028">28</span> [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) then shall
dwell in safety alone: the [fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md) of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) shall be upon a land of
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) and [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md); also
his heavens shall drop down [dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> Happy art thou, O
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): who is like unto thee, O people saved
by the LORD, the [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001.md) of thy help, and who is
the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) of thy excellency! and thine enemies
shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high
places.
