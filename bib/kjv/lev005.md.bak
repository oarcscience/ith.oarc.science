### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> And if a soul [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), and
hear the voice of swearing, and is a [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md),
whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it, then he
shall bear his iniquity.  

<span id="002">2</span> Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it
be a [carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md) of an unclean
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), or a [carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md) of
unclean [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), or the
[carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md) of unclean creeping things, and if it
be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.  

<span id="003">3</span> Or if he touch the uncleanness of man,
whatsoever uncleanness it be that a man shall be defiled withal, and it
be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.  

<span id="004">4</span> Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to
do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with
an [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md), and it be hid from him; when he
knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these.  

<span id="005">5</span> And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one
of these things, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that
thing:  

<span id="006">6</span> And he shall bring his trespass
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) unto the LORD for his
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) which he hath sinned, a female from the
flock, a [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md) or a kid of the goats, for a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md); and the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for him concerning his
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And if he be not able to bring a
[lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md), then he shall bring for his trespass,
which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the
LORD; one for a [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and the other for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And he shall bring them unto the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), who shall offer that which is for the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) first,
and wring off his head from his [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md), but shall
not divide it asunder:  

<span id="009">9</span> And he shall sprinkle of the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) upon the side of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md); and the rest of the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) shall be wrung out at the bottom of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006): it is a [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And he shall offer the second for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), according to the manner: and the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for him for his
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) which he hath sinned, and it shall be
forgiven him.  

<span id="011">11</span> But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves,
or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) the tenth part of an
[ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003) of fine [flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001.md)
for a [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md); he
shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any
[frankincense](../ebd/ebd138.htm#004.md) thereon: for it is a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> Then shall he bring it to the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
shall take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on
the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), according to the offerings made by
fire unto the LORD: it is a [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
make an [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for him as touching his
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) that he hath sinned in one of these, and it
shall be forgiven him: and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="015">15</span> If a soul commit a trespass, and
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) through ignorance, in the holy things of
the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003) without [blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md)
out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), after the
[shekel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#009.md) of the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md), for a trespass
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And he shall make amends for the harm that he
hath done in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and
give it unto the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md): and the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for him with the
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md) of the trespass
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and it shall be forgiven him.  

<span id="017">17</span> And if a soul [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), and
commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the
commandments of the LORD; though he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and
shall bear his iniquity.  

<span id="018">18</span> And he shall bring a
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003) without [blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md)
out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), unto the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003): and the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
shall make an [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for him concerning his
ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven
him.  

<span id="019">19</span> It is a trespass
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md): he hath certainly trespassed against
the LORD.
