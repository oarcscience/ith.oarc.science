### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) determined
to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his
kingdom.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) told out
threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand
to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee
them.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) sent to
Huram the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001.md), saying, As thou didst deal with
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) my father, and didst send him cedars to
build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.  

<span id="004">4</span> Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD
my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md), and for the continual
[shewbread](../ebd/ebd336.htm#008.md), and for the burnt offerings morning
and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn
feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance for ever to
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the house which I build is great: for great
is our God above all gods.  

<span id="006">6</span> But who is able to build him an house, seeing
the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) and [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)
of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him an
house, save only to burn [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) before
him?  

<span id="007">7</span> Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and in [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md),
and in [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md), and in
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md), and in purple, and
[crimson](../ebd/ebd092.htm#007), and [blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003.md), and
that can skill to [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md) with the cunning men
that are with me in [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), whom [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
my father did provide.  

<span id="008">8</span> Send me also [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md)
trees, [fir](../ebd/ebd133.htm#005.md) trees, and
[algum](../ebd/ebd017.htm#002.md) trees, out of
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md): for I know that thy servants can skill
to cut timber in [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md); and, behold, my
servants shall be with thy servants,  

<span id="009">9</span> Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the
house which I am about to build shall be wonderful great.  

<span id="010">10</span> And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the
hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md), and twenty thousand measures of
[barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003.md), and twenty thousand
[baths](../ebd/ebd047.htm#004) of [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), and
twenty thousand [baths](../ebd/ebd047.htm#004.md) of oil.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then Huram the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001.md) answered in
[writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005.md), which he sent to
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), Because the LORD hath loved his
people, he hath made thee [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over them.  

<span id="012">12</span> Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), that made
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) and earth, who hath given to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) a
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) son, endued with prudence and
understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for
his kingdom.  

<span id="013">13</span> And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with
understanding, of Huram my father's,  

<span id="014">14</span> The son of a woman of the daughters of
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md), and his father was a man of
[Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001.md), skilful to work in
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and in [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md),
in [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003), in [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md), in
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), and in timber, in purple, in
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003.md), and in fine
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), and in [crimson](../ebd/ebd092.htm#007.md);
also to [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md) any manner of
[graving](../ebd/ebd155.htm#000.md), and to find out every device which
shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of
my lord [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) thy father.  

<span id="015">15</span> Now therefore the
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000), and the [barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003.md),
the oil, and the [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), which my lord hath
spoken of, let him send unto his servants:  

<span id="016">16</span> And we will cut [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md)
out of [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md), as much as thou shalt need: and
we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to
[Joppa](../ebd/ebd211.htm#002.md); and thou shalt carry it up to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) numbered
all the strangers that were in the land of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), after the numbering wherewith
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) his father had numbered them; and they
were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six
hundred.  

<span id="018">18</span> And he set threescore and ten thousand of them
to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the
mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people
a work.
