### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father,
and attend to know understanding.  

<span id="002">2</span> For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my
law.  

<span id="003">3</span> For I was my father's son, tender and only
beloved in the sight of my mother.  

<span id="004">4</span> He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine
heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.  

<span id="005">5</span> Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not;
neither decline from the words of my mouth.  

<span id="006">6</span> Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee:
love her, and she shall keep thee.  

<span id="007">7</span> Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get
wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.  

<span id="008">8</span> Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall
bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.  

<span id="009">9</span> She shall give to thine head an ornament of
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000): a [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) of
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) shall she deliver to thee.  

<span id="010">10</span> Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the
years of thy life shall be many.  

<span id="011">11</span> I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have
led thee in right paths.  

<span id="012">12</span> When thou goest, thy steps shall not be
straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.  

<span id="013">13</span> Take [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) hold of
instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.  

<span id="014">14</span> Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go
not in the way of evil men.  

<span id="015">15</span> Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and
pass away.  

<span id="016">16</span> For they sleep not, except they have done
mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to
fall.  

<span id="017">17</span> For they eat the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md)
of wickedness, and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) the
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) of violence.  

<span id="018">18</span> But the path of the just is as the shining
light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.  

<span id="019">19</span> The way of the wicked is as
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md): they know not at what they stumble.  

<span id="020">20</span> My son, attend to my words; incline thine
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) unto my sayings.  

<span id="021">21</span> Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them
in the midst of thine heart.  

<span id="022">22</span> For they are life unto those that find them,
and health to all their [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of
it are the issues of life.  

<span id="024">24</span> Put away from thee a froward mouth, and
perverse lips put far from thee.  

<span id="025">25</span> Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine
eyelids look straight before thee.  

<span id="026">26</span> Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy
ways be established.  

<span id="027">27</span> Turn not to the right hand nor to the left:
remove thy foot from evil.
