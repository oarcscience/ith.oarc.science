### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 31

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> See, I have called by name
[Bezaleel](../ebd/ebd057.htm#009) the son of Uri, the son of
[Hur](../ebd/ebd184.htm#009), of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007):  

<span id="003">3</span> And I have filled him with the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of God, in wisdom, and in understanding,
and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,  

<span id="004">4</span> To devise cunning works, to work in
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and in [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000),
and in [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003),  

<span id="005">5</span> And in [cutting](../ebd/ebd095.htm#000) of
stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of
workmanship.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I, behold, I have given with him
[Aholiab](../ebd/ebd015.htm#006), the son of Ahisamach, of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009): and in
the hearts of all that are [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) hearted I have
put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee;  

<span id="007">7</span> The [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), and the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008),
and the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) seat that is thereupon, and all
the furniture of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003),  

<span id="008">8</span> And the table and his furniture, and the pure
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001) with all his furniture, and the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002),  

<span id="009">9</span> And the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) with all his furniture, and the
[laver](../ebd/ebd224.htm#009) and his foot,  

<span id="010">10</span> And the cloths of service, and the holy
garments for [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and the garments of his sons, to
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) in the priest's office,  

<span id="011">11</span> And the anointing oil, and sweet
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) for the holy place: according to all
that I have commanded thee shall they do.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="013">13</span> Speak thou also unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall
keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations;
that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.  

<span id="014">14</span> Ye shall keep the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) therefore; for it is holy unto you:
every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever
doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his
people.  

<span id="015">15</span> Six days may work be done; but in the seventh
is the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) of rest, holy to the LORD:
whosoever doeth any work in the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day, he
shall surely be put to death.  

<span id="016">16</span> Wherefore the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall keep the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003), to observe the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) throughout their generations, for a
perpetual [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008).  

<span id="017">17</span> It is a sign between me and the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) for ever: for in six days the LORD made
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) and earth, and on the seventh day he
rested, and was refreshed.  

<span id="018">18</span> And he gave unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), when he had made an end of communing
with him upon [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009), two [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) of
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008), [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) of
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), written with the finger of God.
