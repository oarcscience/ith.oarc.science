</P>
<P><a name="059">59</A>&nbsp;And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> at all times, as the matter shall require:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="060">60</A>&nbsp;That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.<BR>

<P><a name="061">61</A>&nbsp;Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="063">63</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> offered a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>.
