<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 17</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;These words spake <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, and lifted up his eyes to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and said, Father, the hour is come; <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</A> thy Son, that thy Son also may <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</A> thee:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;As thou hast given him power over all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, whom thou hast sent.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And now, O Father, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</A> thou me with thine own self with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> which I had with thee before the world was.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A> might be fulfilled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.<BR>
