### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> Thus saith the LORD, Go and get a potter's
earthen [bottle](../ebd/ebd063.htm#002.md), and take of the ancients of the
people, and of the ancients of the priests;  

<span id="002">2</span> And go forth unto the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) of the son of
[Hinnom](../ebd/ebd179.htm#002.md), which is by the entry of the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md), and
proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee,  

<span id="003">3</span> And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md); Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the
God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); Behold, I will bring evil upon
this place, the which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.  

<span id="004">4</span> Because they have forsaken me, and have
estranged this place, and have burned [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md)
in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known,
nor the kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and have filled this
place with the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of innocents;  

<span id="005">5</span> They have built also the high places of
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md), to burn their sons with fire for burnt
offerings unto [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md), which I commanded not, nor
spake it, neither came it into my mind:  

<span id="006">6</span> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the
LORD, that this place shall no more be called
[Tophet](../ebd/ebd370.htm#007), nor The [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md)
of the son of [Hinnom](../ebd/ebd179.htm#002.md), but The
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) of slaughter.  

<span id="007">7</span> And I will make void the counsel of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) in
this place; and I will cause them to fall by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) before their enemies, and by the hands of
them that seek their lives: and their carcases will I give to be meat
for the fowls of the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and for the beasts
of the earth.  

<span id="008">8</span> And I will make this city desolate, and an
hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and
[hiss](../ebd/ebd179.htm#005.md) because of all the plagues thereof.  

<span id="009">9</span> And I will cause them to eat the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of their sons and the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of their daughters, and they shall eat
every one the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of his friend in the siege
and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives,
shall straiten them.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then shalt thou break the
[bottle](../ebd/ebd063.htm#002.md) in the sight of the men that go with
thee,  

<span id="011">11</span> And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of
hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a
potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury
them in [Tophet](../ebd/ebd370.htm#007.md), till there be no place to
bury.  

<span id="012">12</span> Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD,
and to the inhabitants thereof, and even make this city as
[Tophet](../ebd/ebd370.htm#007.md):  

<span id="013">13</span> And the houses of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and the houses of the kings of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), shall be defiled as the place of
[Tophet](../ebd/ebd370.htm#007.md), because of all the houses upon whose
roofs they have burned [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) unto all the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and
have poured out [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) offerings unto other
gods.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then came [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md)
from [Tophet](../ebd/ebd370.htm#007.md), whither the LORD had sent him to
prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD's house; and said to all
the people,  

<span id="015">15</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); Behold, I will bring upon this city and
upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it,
because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my
words.
