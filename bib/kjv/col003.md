### King James Version: Colossians Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> If ye then be risen with
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), seek those things which are above,
where [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) sitteth on the right hand of
God.  

<span id="002">2</span> Set your [affection](../ebd/ebd011.htm#004.md) on
things above, not on things on the earth.  

<span id="003">3</span> For ye are dead, and your life is hid with
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) in God.  

<span id="004">4</span> When [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), who is our
life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Mortify therefore your members which are upon
the earth; [fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008.md), uncleanness, inordinate
[affection](../ebd/ebd011.htm#004.md), evil
[concupiscence](../ebd/ebd087.htm#008.md), and
[covetousness](../ebd/ebd092.htm#000.md), which is
[idolatry](../ebd/ebd186.htm#007.md):  

<span id="006">6</span> For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh
on the children of disobedience:  

<span id="007">7</span> In the which ye also walked some time, when ye
lived in them.  

<span id="008">8</span> But now ye also put off all these;
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md), wrath, malice,
[blasphemy](../ebd/ebd060.htm#005.md), filthy communication out of your
mouth.  

<span id="009">9</span> Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put
off the old man with his deeds;  

<span id="010">10</span> And have put on the new man, which is renewed
in knowledge after the image of him that created him:  

<span id="011">11</span> Where there is neither
[Greek](../ebd/ebd155.htm#004) nor [Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004.md),
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007.md) nor uncircumcision,
[Barbarian](../ebd/ebd044.htm#006), [Scythian](../ebd/ebd324.htm#006.md),
[bond](../ebd/ebd062.htm#001.md) nor free: but
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) is all, and in all.  

<span id="012">12</span> Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and
beloved, [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004.md) of mercies, kindness,
humbleness of mind, [meekness](../ebd/ebd246.htm#003.md), longsuffering;  

<span id="013">13</span> Forbearing one another, and forgiving one
another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) forgave you, so also do ye.  

<span id="014">14</span> And above all these things put on
[charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009.md), which is the
[bond](../ebd/ebd062.htm#001.md) of perfectness.  

<span id="015">15</span> And let the peace of God rule in your hearts,
to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.  

<span id="016">16</span> Let the word of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another
in [psalms](../ebd/ebd301.htm#005.md) and hymns and spiritual
[songs](../ebd/ebd348.htm#002.md), singing with
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) in your hearts to the Lord.  

<span id="017">17</span> And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in
the name of the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), giving thanks to
God and the Father by him.  

<span id="018">18</span> Wives, submit yourselves unto your own
husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.  

<span id="019">19</span> Husbands, love your wives, and be not
[bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009.md) against them.  

<span id="020">20</span> Children, obey your parents in all things: for
this is well pleasing unto the Lord.  

<span id="021">21</span> Fathers, provoke not your children to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md), lest they be discouraged.  

<span id="022">22</span> Servants, obey in all things your masters
according to the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md); not with eyeservice, as
menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;  

<span id="023">23</span> And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the
Lord, and not unto men;  

<span id="024">24</span> Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the
reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the
wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
