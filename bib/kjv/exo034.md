### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 34

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Hew thee two
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) of [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) like
unto the first: and I will write upon these
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) the words that were in the first
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006), which thou brakest.  

<span id="002">2</span> And be ready in the morning, and come up in the
morning unto [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009), and present thyself there to me in the
top of the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007).  

<span id="003">3</span> And no man shall come up with thee, neither let
any man be seen throughout all the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007);
neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007).  

<span id="004">4</span> And he hewed two [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006)
of [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) like unto the first; and
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) rose up early in the morning, and went up
unto [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009), as
the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) of [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the LORD descended in the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001), and stood with him there, and proclaimed
the name of the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the LORD passed by before him, and
proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious,
longsuffering, and abundant in [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000) and
truth,  

<span id="007">7</span> Keeping [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) for
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008), forgiving iniquity and transgression
and [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), and that will by no means clear the
guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon
the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008).  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) made haste,
and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he said, If now I have found
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) in thy sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray
thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and
[pardon](../ebd/ebd285.htm#001) our iniquity and our
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), and take us for thine inheritance.  

<span id="010">10</span> And he said, Behold, I make a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008): before all thy people I will do
marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation:
and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD:
for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.  

<span id="011">11</span> Observe thou that which I command thee this
day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the
[Canaanite](../ebd/ebd070.htm#008), and the Hittite, and the Perizzite,
and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.  

<span id="012">12</span> Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with the inhabitants of the land
whither thou goest, lest it be for a [snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009) in
the midst of thee:  

<span id="013">13</span> But ye shall destroy their altars, break their
images, and cut down their groves:  

<span id="014">14</span> For thou shalt [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002)
no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:  

<span id="015">15</span> Lest thou make a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with the inhabitants of the land, and
they go a whoring after their gods, and do
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) unto their gods, and one call thee,
and thou eat of his [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002);  

<span id="016">16</span> And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons,
and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go
a whoring after their gods.  

<span id="017">17</span> Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.  

<span id="018">18</span> The [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of
unleavened [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) shalt thou keep.
[Seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days thou shalt eat unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), as I commanded thee, in the time of the
month [Abib](../ebd/ebd002.htm#006): for in the month
[Abib](../ebd/ebd002.htm#006) thou camest out from
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="019">19</span> All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every
firstling among thy [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002), whether
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) or [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), that is
male.  

<span id="020">20</span> But the firstling of an
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001) thou shalt redeem with a
[lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003): and if thou redeem him not, then shalt
thou break his [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000). All the firstborn of thy
sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.  

<span id="021">21</span> Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh
day thou shalt rest: in [earing](../ebd/ebd110.htm#005) time and in
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008) thou shalt rest.  

<span id="022">22</span> And thou shalt observe the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of weeks, of the firstfruits of
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000) [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008), and the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of ingathering at the year's end.  

<span id="023">23</span> Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren
appear before the LORD God, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="024">24</span> For I will cast out the nations before thee,
and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when
thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.  

<span id="025">25</span> Thou shalt not offer the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of my [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002)
with [leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000); neither shall the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000)
of the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005) be left unto the morning.  

<span id="026">26</span> The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou
shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not
[seethe](../ebd/ebd326.htm#001) a kid in his mother's
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000).  

<span id="027">27</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Write thou these words: for after the
tenor of these words I have made a [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008)
with thee and with [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="028">28</span> And he was there with the LORD forty days and
forty nights; he did neither eat [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), nor
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) water. And he wrote upon the
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) the words of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), the ten commandments.  

<span id="029">29</span> And it came to pass, when
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) came down from
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009) with the
two [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) of
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) in Moses' hand, when he came down
from the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007), that
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) wist not that the skin of his face shone
while he talked with him.  

<span id="030">30</span> And when [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) and all
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) saw
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), behold, the skin of his face shone; and
they were afraid to come nigh him.  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) called unto
them; and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) and all the rulers of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) returned unto him: and
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) talked with them.  

<span id="032">32</span> And afterward all the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) came nigh: and he gave them in
commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009).  

<span id="033">33</span> And till [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) had
done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.  

<span id="034">34</span> But when [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) went in
before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came
out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) that which he was commanded.  

<span id="035">35</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) saw the face of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), that the skin of Moses' face shone: and
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) put the vail upon his face again, until
he went in to speak with him.
