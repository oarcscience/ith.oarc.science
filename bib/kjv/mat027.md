### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 27

<span id="001">1</span> When the morning was come, all the chief priests
and elders of the people took counsel against
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) to put him to death:  

<span id="002">2</span> And when they had bound him, they led him away,
and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then [Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001.md), which had
betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and
brought again the thirty [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md) of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) to the chief priests and elders,  

<span id="004">4</span> Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed
the innocent [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md). And they said, What is that
to us? see thou to that.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he cast down the
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) in
the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), and departed, and went and hanged
himself.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the chief priests took the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md), and
said, It is not lawful for to put them into the
[treasury](../ebd/ebd372.htm#000.md), because it is the price of
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And they took counsel, and bought with them the
potter's field, to bury strangers in.  

<span id="008">8</span> Wherefore that field was called, The field of
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), unto this day.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by
Jeremy the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md), saying, And they took the
thirty [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md) of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), the price of him that was valued, whom
they of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) did value;  

<span id="010">10</span> And gave them for the potter's field, as the
Lord appointed me.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) stood before
the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of the Jews? And
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto him, Thou sayest.  

<span id="012">12</span> And when he was accused of the chief priests
and elders, he answered nothing.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how
many things they [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) against thee?  

<span id="014">14</span> And he answered him to never a word; insomuch
that the governor marvelled greatly.  

<span id="015">15</span> Now at that [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) the
governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they
would.  

<span id="016">16</span> And they had then a notable prisoner, called
[Barabbas](../ebd/ebd044.htm#002.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Therefore when they were gathered together,
Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you?
[Barabbas](../ebd/ebd044.htm#002), or [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
which is called [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="018">18</span> For he knew that for envy they had delivered
him.  

<span id="019">19</span> When he was set down on the judgment seat, his
wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man:
for I have suffered many things this day in a
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md) because of him.  

<span id="020">20</span> But the chief priests and elders persuaded the
multitude that they should ask [Barabbas](../ebd/ebd044.htm#002.md), and
destroy [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> The governor answered and said unto them,
Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said,
[Barabbas](../ebd/ebd044.htm#002.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then
with [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) which is called
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)? They all say unto him, Let him be
crucified.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he
done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.  

<span id="024">24</span> When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing,
but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands
before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of this just person: see ye to it.  

<span id="025">25</span> Then answered all the people, and said, His
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) be on us, and on our children.  

<span id="026">26</span> Then released he
[Barabbas](../ebd/ebd044.htm#002.md) unto them: and when he had scourged
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), he delivered him to be crucified.  

<span id="027">27</span> Then the soldiers of the governor took
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) into the common hall, and gathered unto
him the whole band of soldiers.  

<span id="028">28</span> And they stripped him, and put on him a
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md) robe.  

<span id="029">29</span> And when they had platted a
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) of thorns, they put it upon his head, and
a [reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000.md) in his right hand: and they bowed the
knee before him, and mocked him, saying, [Hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002.md),
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of the Jews!  

<span id="030">30</span> And they spit upon him, and took the
[reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000.md), and smote him on the head.  

<span id="031">31</span> And after that they had mocked him, they took
the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away
to crucify him.  

<span id="032">32</span> And as they came out, they found a man of
[Cyrene](../ebd/ebd095.htm#004), [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md) by name:
him they compelled to bear his [cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> And when they were come unto a place called
[Golgotha](../ebd/ebd152.htm#004.md), that is to say, a place of a skull,  

<span id="034">34</span> They gave him [vinegar](../ebd/ebd377.htm#006.md)
to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) mingled with
[gall](../ebd/ebd142.htm#000.md): and when he had tasted thereof, he would
not [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md).  

<span id="035">35</span> And they crucified him, and parted his
garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by
the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md), They parted my garments among
them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.  

<span id="036">36</span> And [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md) down they
watched him there;  

<span id="037">37</span> And set up over his head his accusation
written, THIS IS [JESUS](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) THE
[KING](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) OF THE JEWS.  

<span id="038">38</span> Then were there two thieves crucified with him,
one on the right hand, and another on the left.  

<span id="039">39</span> And they that passed by reviled him, wagging
their heads,  

<span id="040">40</span> And saying, Thou that destroyest the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), and buildest it in three days, save
thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the
[cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000.md).  

<span id="041">41</span> Likewise also the chief priests mocking him,
with the [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md) and elders, said,  

<span id="042">42</span> He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he
be the [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
let him now come down from the [cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000.md), and we
will believe him.  

<span id="043">43</span> He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if
he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.  

<span id="044">44</span> The thieves also, which were crucified with
him, cast the same in his teeth.  

<span id="045">45</span> Now from the sixth hour there was
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) over all the land unto the ninth
hour.  

<span id="046">46</span> And about the ninth hour
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) cried with a loud voice, saying,
[Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007), [Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007.md),
[lama](../ebd/ebd223.htm#002) [sabachthani](../ebd/ebd317.htm#001.md)? that
is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  

<span id="047">47</span> Some of them that stood there, when they heard
that, said, This man calleth for [Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002.md).  

<span id="048">48</span> And straightway one of them ran, and took a
spunge, and filled it with [vinegar](../ebd/ebd377.htm#006.md), and put it
on a [reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000.md), and gave him to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md).  

<span id="049">49</span> The rest said, Let be, let us see whether
[Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002.md) will come to save him.  

<span id="050">50</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), when he had
cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the
[ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md).  

<span id="051">51</span> And, behold, the [veil](../ebd/ebd377.htm#001.md)
of the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) was [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md)
in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the
rocks [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md);  

<span id="052">52</span> And the graves were opened; and many bodies of
the saints which slept arose,  

<span id="053">53</span> And came out of the graves after his
resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.  

<span id="054">54</span> Now when the
[centurion](../ebd/ebd075.htm#004.md), and they that were with him,
watching [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), saw the
[earthquake](../ebd/ebd110.htm#009.md), and those things that were done,
they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.  

<span id="055">55</span> And many women were there beholding afar off,
which followed [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) from
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md), ministering unto him:  

<span id="056">56</span> Among which was [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md)
[Magdalene](../ebd/ebd236.htm#005), and [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md)
the mother of [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md) and Joses, and the mother
of Zebedees children.  

<span id="057">57</span> When the even was come, there came a rich man
of Arimathaea, named [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), who also himself
was Jesus' [disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003.md):  

<span id="058">58</span> He went to Pilate, and begged the body of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md). Then Pilate commanded the body to be
delivered.  

<span id="059">59</span> And when [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) had
taken the body, he wrapped it in a [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md)
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md) cloth,  

<span id="060">60</span> And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had
hewn out in the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md): and he rolled a great
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) to the door of the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md), and departed.  

<span id="061">61</span> And there was [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md)
[Magdalene](../ebd/ebd236.htm#005.md), and the other
[Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009), [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md) over
against the [sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md).  

<span id="062">62</span> Now the next day, that followed the day of the
preparation, the chief priests and [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md)
came together unto Pilate,  

<span id="063">63</span> Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver
said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.  

<span id="064">64</span> Command therefore that the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md) be made sure until the third day,
lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the
people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than
the first.  

<span id="065">65</span> Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your
way, make it as sure as ye can.  

<span id="066">66</span> So they went, and made the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md) sure, sealing the
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), and setting a watch.
