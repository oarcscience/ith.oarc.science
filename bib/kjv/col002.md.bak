### King James Version: Colossians Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> For I would that ye knew what great conflict I
have for you, and for them at [Laodicea](../ebd/ebd223.htm#009.md), and for
as many as have not seen my face in the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md);  

<span id="002">2</span> That their hearts might be comforted, being knit
together in love, and unto all riches of the full
[assurance](../ebd/ebd035.htm#004.md) of understanding, to the
acknowledgement of the [mystery](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006.md) of God, and of
the Father, and of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md);  

<span id="003">3</span> In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge.  

<span id="004">4</span> And this I say, lest any man should beguile you
with enticing words.  

<span id="005">5</span> For though I be absent in the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), yet am I with you in the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), joying and beholding your order, and
the stedfastness of your faith in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> As ye have therefore received
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) the Lord,
so walk ye in him:  

<span id="007">7</span> Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in
the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with
thanksgiving.  

<span id="008">8</span> Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy
and vain deceit, after the [tradition](../ebd/ebd371.htm#005.md) of men,
after the rudiments of the world, and not after
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> For in him dwelleth all the
[fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007) of the [Godhead](../ebd/ebd151.htm#006.md)
bodily.  

<span id="010">10</span> And ye are complete in him, which is the head
of all principality and power:  

<span id="011">11</span> In whom also ye are circumcised with the
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007.md) made without hands, in putting off
the body of the sins of the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) by the
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007.md) of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md):  

<span id="012">12</span> Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are
risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath
raised him from the dead.  

<span id="013">13</span> And you, being dead in your sins and the
uncircumcision of your [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), hath he quickened
together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;  

<span id="014">14</span> Blotting out the
[handwriting](../ebd/ebd162.htm#009.md) of ordinances that was against us,
which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his
[cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000.md);  

<span id="015">15</span> And having spoiled principalities and powers,
he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.  

<span id="016">16</span> Let no man therefore
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) you in meat, or in
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), or in respect of an holyday, or of the
new [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004.md), or of the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) days:  

<span id="017">17</span> Which are a [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) of
things to come; but the body is of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> Let no man beguile you of your reward in a
voluntary [humility](../ebd/ebd184.htm#007.md) and worshipping of angels,
intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by
his fleshly mind,  

<span id="019">19</span> And not holding the Head, from which all the
body by joints and [bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003.md) having nourishment
ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.  

<span id="020">20</span> Wherefore if ye be dead with
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) from the rudiments of the world, why, as
though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,  

<span id="021">21</span> (Touch not; taste not; handle not;  

<span id="022">22</span> Which all are to perish with the using;) after
the commandments and doctrines of men?  

<span id="023">23</span> Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in
will [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md), and
[humility](../ebd/ebd184.htm#007.md), and neglecting of the body: not in
any honour to the satisfying of the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).
