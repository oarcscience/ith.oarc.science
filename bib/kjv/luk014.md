### King James Version: Luke Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, as he went into the house
of one of the chief [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) to eat
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) on the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003)
day, that they watched him.  

<span id="002">2</span> And, behold, there was a certain man before him
which had the [dropsy](../ebd/ebd108.htm#003).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answering
spake unto the lawyers and [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008), saying,
Is it lawful to heal on the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day?  

<span id="004">4</span> And they held their peace. And he took him, and
healed him, and let him go;  

<span id="005">5</span> And answered them, saying, Which of you shall
have an [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001) or an [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007)
fallen into a [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007), and will not straightway
pull him out on the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day?  

<span id="006">6</span> And they could not answer him again to these
things.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he put forth a
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003) to those which were bidden, when he
marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them.  

<span id="008">8</span> When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding,
sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou
be bidden of him;  

<span id="009">9</span> And he that bade thee and him come and say to
thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest
room.  

<span id="010">10</span> But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in
the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto
thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) in the presence of them that sit at
meat with thee.  

<span id="011">11</span> For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased;
and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then said he also to him that bade him, When
thou makest a dinner or a [supper](../ebd/ebd353.htm#004), call not thy
friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours;
lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.  

<span id="013">13</span> But when thou makest a
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000), call the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006),
the maimed, the lame, the [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009):  

<span id="014">14</span> And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot
recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of
the just.  

<span id="015">15</span> And when one of them that sat at meat with him
heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) in the kingdom of God.  

<span id="016">16</span> Then said he unto him, A certain man made a
great [supper](../ebd/ebd353.htm#004), and bade many:  

<span id="017">17</span> And sent his servant at
[supper](../ebd/ebd353.htm#004) time to say to them that were bidden,
Come; for all things are now ready.  

<span id="018">18</span> And they all with one consent began to make
excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I
must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.  

<span id="019">19</span> And another said, I have bought five
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray
thee have me excused.  

<span id="020">20</span> And another said, I have married a wife, and
therefore I cannot come.  

<span id="021">21</span> So that servant came, and shewed his lord these
things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go
out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither
the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006), and the maimed, and the
[halt](../ebd/ebd160.htm#002), and the [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009).  

<span id="022">22</span> And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou
hast commanded, and yet there is room.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into
the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may
be filled.  

<span id="024">24</span> For I say unto you, That none of those men
which were bidden shall taste of my [supper](../ebd/ebd353.htm#004).  

<span id="025">25</span> And there went great multitudes with him: and
he turned, and said unto them,  

<span id="026">26</span> If any man come to me, and hate not his father,
and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and
his own life also, he cannot be my [disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003).  

<span id="027">27</span> And whosoever doth not bear his
[cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000), and come after me, cannot be my
[disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003).  

<span id="028">28</span> For which of you, intending to build a tower,
sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have
sufficient to finish it?  

<span id="029">29</span> Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation,
and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,  

<span id="030">30</span> Saying, This man began to build, and was not
able to finish.  

<span id="031">31</span> Or what [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), going to
make war against another [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), sitteth not down
first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him
that cometh against him with twenty thousand?  

<span id="032">32</span> Or else, while the other is yet a great way
off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.  

<span id="033">33</span> So likewise, whosoever he be of you that
forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my
[disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003).  

<span id="034">34</span> [Salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008) is good: but if
the [salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008) have lost his savour, wherewith shall
it be seasoned?  

<span id="035">35</span> It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the
dunghill; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him
hear.
