### King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> For as touching the ministering to the saints,
it is superfluous for me to write to you:  

<span id="002">2</span> For I know the forwardness of your mind, for
which I boast of you to them of [Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003.md), that
[Achaia](../ebd/ebd006.htm#004.md) was ready a year ago; and your
[zeal](../ebd/ebd388.htm#003.md) hath provoked very many.  

<span id="003">3</span> Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting
of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be
ready:  

<span id="004">4</span> Lest haply if they of
[Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003.md) come with me, and find you
unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same
confident boasting.  

<span id="005">5</span> Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the
brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand
your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready,
as a matter of bounty, and not as of
[covetousness](../ebd/ebd092.htm#000.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall
reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also
bountifully.  

<span id="007">7</span> Every man according as he purposeth in his
heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth
a cheerful giver.  

<span id="008">8</span> And God is able to make all
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) abound toward you; that ye, always having
all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:  

<span id="009">9</span> (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he
hath given to the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md): his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) remaineth for ever.  

<span id="010">10</span> Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) for
your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004);.md)  

<span id="011">11</span> Being enriched in every thing to all
bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.  

<span id="012">12</span> For the administration of this service not only
supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many
thanksgivings unto God;  

<span id="013">13</span> Whiles by the experiment of this ministration
they [glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005.md) God for your professed subjection
unto the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), and for your liberal distribution unto
them, and unto all men;  

<span id="014">14</span> And by their [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md)
for you, which long after you for the exceeding
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of God in you.  

<span id="015">15</span> Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005.md).
