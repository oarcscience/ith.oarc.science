### King James Version: Joel Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> For, behold, in those days, and in that time,
when I shall bring again the [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),  

<span id="002">2</span> I will also gather all nations, and will bring
them down into the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006), and will plead with them there for
my people and for my heritage [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), whom they
have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.  

<span id="003">3</span> And they have cast lots for my people; and have
given a boy for an [harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005), and sold a girl for
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), that they might
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009).  

<span id="004">4</span> Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O
[Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001), and [Zidon](../ebd/ebd393.htm#000), and
all the coasts of [Palestine](../ebd/ebd282.htm#009)? will ye render me
a recompence? and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I
return your recompence upon your own head;  

<span id="005">5</span> Because ye have taken my
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and my [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001),
and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things:  

<span id="006">6</span> The children also of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and the children of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) have ye sold unto the
[Grecians](../ebd/ebd155.htm#002), that ye might remove them far from
their border.  

<span id="007">7</span> Behold, I will raise them out of the place
whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own
head:  

<span id="008">8</span> And I will sell your sons and your daughters
into the hand of the children of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and
they shall sell them to the [Sabeans](../ebd/ebd317.htm#006), to a
people far off: for the LORD hath spoken it.  

<span id="009">9</span> Proclaim ye this among the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001); Prepare war, wake up the mighty men,
let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:  

<span id="010">10</span> Beat your plowshares into swords and your
pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.  

<span id="011">11</span> Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), and gather yourselves together round
about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD.  

<span id="012">12</span> Let the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005) be
wakened, and come up to the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006): for there will I sit to
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) all the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005)
round about.  

<span id="013">13</span> Put ye in the [sickle](../ebd/ebd342.htm#008),
for the [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008) is ripe: come, get you down;
for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is
great.  

<span id="014">14</span> Multitudes, multitudes in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of decision: for the day of the LORD is
near in the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of decision.  

<span id="015">15</span> The [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) and the
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004) shall be darkened, and the
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008) shall withdraw their shining.  

<span id="016">16</span> The LORD also shall roar out of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), and utter his voice from
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005); and the heavens and the earth shall
shake: but the LORD will be the hope of his people, and the strength of
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="017">17</span> So shall ye know that I am the LORD your God
dwelling in [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), my holy mountain: then shall
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) be holy, and there shall no strangers
pass through her any more.  

<span id="018">18</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the
mountains shall drop down new [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), and the
hills shall flow with [milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000), and all the rivers
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) shall flow with waters, and a
[fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000) shall come forth out of the house of
the LORD, and shall water the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of
[Shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009).  

<span id="019">19</span> [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) shall be a
desolation, and [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001) shall be a desolate
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), for the violence against the
children of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), because they have shed
innocent [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) in their land.  

<span id="020">20</span> But [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) shall dwell
for ever, and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) from
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) to
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008).  

<span id="021">21</span> For I will cleanse their
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) that I have not cleansed: for the LORD
dwelleth in [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002).
