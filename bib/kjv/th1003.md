### King James Version: 1 Thessalonians Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we
thought it good to be left at [Athens](../ebd/ebd036.htm#003.md) alone;  

<span id="002">2</span> And sent [Timotheus](../ebd/ebd367.htm#001.md), our
brother, and [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) of God, and our
fellowlabourer in the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), to establish you, and to comfort you
concerning your faith:  

<span id="003">3</span> That no man should be moved by these
[afflictions](../ebd/ebd011.htm#006.md): for yourselves know that we are
appointed thereunto.  

<span id="004">4</span> For verily, when we were with you, we told you
before that we should suffer [tribulation](../ebd/ebd372.htm#005.md); even
as it came to pass, and ye know.  

<span id="005">5</span> For this cause, when I could no longer forbear,
I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted
you, and our labour be in vain.  

<span id="006">6</span> But now when [Timotheus](../ebd/ebd367.htm#001.md)
came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and
[charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009.md), and that ye have good remembrance of
us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you
in all our affliction and distress by your faith:  

<span id="008">8</span> For now we live, if ye stand
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) in the Lord.  

<span id="009">9</span> For what thanks can we render to God again for
you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;  

<span id="010">10</span> Night and day praying exceedingly that we might
see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?  

<span id="011">11</span> Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), direct
our way unto you.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the Lord make you to increase and abound in
love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:  

<span id="013">13</span> To the end he may stablish your hearts
unblameable in [holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md) before God, even our
Father, at the coming of our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) with all his saints.
