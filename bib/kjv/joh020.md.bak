### King James Version: John Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> The first day of the week cometh
[Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009) [Magdalene](../ebd/ebd236.htm#005.md) early,
when it was yet dark, unto the [sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md), and
seeth the [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) taken away from the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Then she runneth, and cometh to
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004) [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md), and to
the other [disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003.md), whom
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) loved, and saith unto them, They have
taken away the LORD out of the [sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md), and
we know not where they have laid him.  

<span id="003">3</span> [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) therefore went
forth, and that other [disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003.md), and came to the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> So they ran both together: and the other
[disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003.md) did outrun
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md), and came first to the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md) clothes lying; yet went he not in.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then cometh [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md)
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) following him, and went into the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md), and seeth the
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md) clothes lie,  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [napkin](../ebd/ebd267.htm#000.md), that
was about his head, not lying with the [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md)
clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then went in also that other
[disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003.md), which came first to the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md), and he saw, and believed.  

<span id="009">9</span> For as yet they knew not the
[scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005.md), that he must rise again from the
dead.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then the disciples went away again unto their
own home.  

<span id="011">11</span> But [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md) stood without
at the [sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md) weeping: and as she wept, she
stooped down, and looked into the [sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md),  

<span id="012">12</span> And seeth two angels in white
[sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md), the one at the head, and the other at
the feet, where the body of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) had lain.  

<span id="013">13</span> And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou?
She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know
not where they have laid him.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when she had thus said, she turned herself
back, and saw [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) standing, and knew not that
it was [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saith unto her,
Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the
gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me
where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.  

<span id="016">16</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saith unto her,
[Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md). She turned herself, and saith unto him,
[Rabboni](../ebd/ebd304.htm#007.md); which is to say, Master.  

<span id="017">17</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saith unto her,
Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my
brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father;
and to my God, and your God.  

<span id="018">18</span> [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md)
[Magdalene](../ebd/ebd236.htm#005.md) came and told the disciples that she
had seen the LORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her.  

<span id="019">19</span> Then the same day at evening, being the first
day of the week, when the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) were shut where
the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) and stood in the midst, and saith unto
them, Peace be unto you.  

<span id="020">20</span> And when he had so said, he shewed unto them
his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the
LORD.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then said [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) to
them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I
you.  

<span id="022">22</span> And when he had said this, he breathed on them,
and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md):  

<span id="023">23</span> Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted
unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.  

<span id="024">24</span> But [Thomas](../ebd/ebd364.htm#005.md), one of the
twelve, called [Didymus](../ebd/ebd103.htm#006.md), was not with them when
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) came.  

<span id="025">25</span> The other disciples therefore said unto him, We
have seen the LORD. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his
hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the
nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.  

<span id="026">26</span> And after eight days again his disciples were
within, and [Thomas](../ebd/ebd364.htm#005.md) with them: then came
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) being
shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.  

<span id="027">27</span> Then saith he to
[Thomas](../ebd/ebd364.htm#005.md), Reach hither thy finger, and behold my
hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not
faithless, but believing.  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Thomas](../ebd/ebd364.htm#005.md) answered
and said unto him, My LORD and my God.  

<span id="029">29</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saith unto him,
[Thomas](../ebd/ebd364.htm#005.md), because thou hast seen me, thou hast
believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.  

<span id="030">30</span> And many other signs truly did
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) in the presence of his disciples, which
are not written in this book:  

<span id="031">31</span> But these are written, that ye might believe
that [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) is the
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), the Son of God; and that believing ye
might have life through his name.
