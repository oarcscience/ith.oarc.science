### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 45

<span id="001">1</span> Then [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) could not
refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause
every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) made himself known unto his brethren.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the
house of [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) heard.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) said unto
his brethren, I am [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005); doth my father yet
live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at
his presence.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) said unto
his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he
said, I am [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) your brother, whom ye sold
into [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="005">5</span> Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with
yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to
preserve life.  

<span id="006">6</span> For these two years hath the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) been in the land: and yet there are five
years, in the which there shall neither be
[earing](../ebd/ebd110.htm#005) nor [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008).  

<span id="007">7</span> And God sent me before you to preserve you a
posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.  

<span id="008">8</span> So now it was not you that sent me hither, but
God: and he hath made me a father to [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005),
and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="009">9</span> Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto
him, Thus saith thy son [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), God hath made
me lord of all [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009): come down unto me, tarry
not:  

<span id="010">10</span> And thou shalt dwell in the land of
[Goshen](../ebd/ebd153.htm#002), and thou shalt be near unto me, thou,
and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy
herds, and all that thou hast:  

<span id="011">11</span> And there will I nourish thee; for yet there
are five years of [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000); lest thou, and thy
household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.  

<span id="012">12</span> And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my
brother [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008), that it is my mouth that
speaketh unto you.  

<span id="013">13</span> And ye shall tell my father of all my
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and of
all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father
hither.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000), and wept; and
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) wept upon his
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000).  

<span id="015">15</span> Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept
upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's
house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) well, and his servants.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) said unto
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade
your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005);  

<span id="018">18</span> And take your father and your households, and
come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and ye shall eat the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) of the land.  

<span id="019">19</span> Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you
wagons out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) for your little
ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.  

<span id="020">20</span> Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all
the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) is your's.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) did so: and
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) gave them wagons, according to the
commandment of [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), and gave them provision
for the way.  

<span id="022">22</span> To all of them he gave each man changes of
raiment; but to [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) he gave three hundred
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and
five changes of raiment.  

<span id="023">23</span> And to his father he sent after this manner;
ten asses laden with the good things of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009),
and ten she asses laden with [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) and
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) and meat for his father by the way.  

<span id="024">24</span> So he sent his brethren away, and they
departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.  

<span id="025">25</span> And they went up out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and came into the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005) unto [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007)
their father,  

<span id="026">26</span> And told him, saying,
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) is yet alive, and he is governor over
all the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009). And Jacob's heart
fainted, for he believed them not.  

<span id="027">27</span> And they told him all the words of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), which he had said unto them: and when
he saw the wagons which [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) had sent to
carry him, the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) their father revived:  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) said, It is
enough; [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) my son is yet alive: I will go
and see him before I die.
