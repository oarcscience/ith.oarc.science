### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and say unto them, I am the LORD your
God.  

<span id="003">3</span> After the doings of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and
after the doings of the land of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md), whither
I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their
ordinances.  

<span id="004">4</span> Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine
ordinances, to walk therein: I am the LORD your God.  

<span id="005">5</span> Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my
judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> None of you shall approach to any that is near
of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of
thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not
uncover her nakedness.  

<span id="008">8</span> The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou
not uncover: it is thy father's nakedness.  

<span id="009">9</span> The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy
father, or daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born
abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.  

<span id="010">10</span> The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy
daughter's daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for
theirs is thine own nakedness.  

<span id="011">11</span> The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter,
begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her
nakedness.  

<span id="012">12</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy
father's sister: she is thy father's near kinswoman.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy
mother's sister: for she is thy mother's near kinswoman.  

<span id="014">14</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy
father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine
aunt.  

<span id="015">15</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy
daughter in law: she is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her
nakedness.  

<span id="016">16</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy
brother's wife: it is thy brother's nakedness.  

<span id="017">17</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman
and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her
daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near
kinswomen: it is wickedness.  

<span id="018">18</span> Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister,
to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life
time.  

<span id="019">19</span> Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to
uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her
uncleanness.  

<span id="020">20</span> Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy
neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her.  

<span id="021">21</span> And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass
through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy
God: I am the LORD.  

<span id="022">22</span> Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with
womankind: it is [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> Neither shalt thou lie with any
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) to defile thyself therewith: neither
shall any woman stand before a [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) to lie
down thereto: it is confusion.  

<span id="024">24</span> Defile not ye yourselves in any of these
things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before
you:  

<span id="025">25</span> And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit
the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her
inhabitants.  

<span id="026">26</span> Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my
judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any
of your own nation, nor any [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) that
sojourneth among you:  

<span id="027">27</span> (For all these abominations have the men of the
land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;)  

<span id="028">28</span> That the land spue not you out also, when ye
defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you.  

<span id="029">29</span> For whosoever shall commit any of these
abominations, even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from
among their people.  

<span id="030">30</span> Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye
commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed
before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD
your God.
