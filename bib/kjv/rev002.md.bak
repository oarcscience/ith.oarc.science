### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> Unto the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
church of [Ephesus](../ebd/ebd122.htm#007.md) write; These things saith he
that holdeth the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md) in his right hand, who walketh in the
midst of the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) golden candlesticks;  

<span id="002">2</span> I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy
patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast
tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them
liars:  

<span id="003">3</span> And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my
name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.  

<span id="004">4</span> Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee,
because thou hast left thy first love.  

<span id="005">5</span> Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen,
and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee
quickly, and will remove thy [candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md) out of
his place, except thou repent.  

<span id="006">6</span> But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds
of the [Nicolaitanes](../ebd/ebd272.htm#006.md), which I also hate.  

<span id="007">7</span> He that hath an [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md),
let him hear what the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) saith unto the
churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life,
which is in the midst of the [paradise](../ebd/ebd284.htm#004.md) of God.  

<span id="008">8</span> And unto the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of
the church in [Smyrna](../ebd/ebd346.htm#007.md) write; These things saith
the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;  

<span id="009">9</span> I know thy works, and
[tribulation](../ebd/ebd372.htm#005), and poverty, (but thou art rich.md)
and I know the [blasphemy](../ebd/ebd060.htm#005.md) of them which say they
are Jews, and are not, but are the [synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009.md) of
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> Fear none of those things which thou shalt
suffer: behold, the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md) shall cast some of
you into [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md), that ye may be tried; and ye
shall have [tribulation](../ebd/ebd372.htm#005.md) ten days: be thou
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md) unto death, and I will give thee a
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) of life.  

<span id="011">11</span> He that hath an [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md),
let him hear what the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) saith unto the
churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.  

<span id="012">12</span> And to the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of
the church in [Pergamos](../ebd/ebd290.htm#004.md) write; These things
saith he which hath the sharp [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) with two
edges;  

<span id="013">13</span> I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even
where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) my
name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein
[Antipas](../ebd/ebd025.htm#003.md) was my
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) [martyr](../ebd/ebd242.htm#008.md), who
was slain among you, where [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md) dwelleth.  

<span id="014">14</span> But I have a few things against thee, because
thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md), who taught Balac to cast a
stumblingblock before the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit
[fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine
of the [Nicolaitanes](../ebd/ebd272.htm#006.md), which thing I hate.  

<span id="016">16</span> Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly,
and will fight against them with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) of
my mouth.  

<span id="017">17</span> He that hath an [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md),
let him hear what the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) saith unto the
churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden
[manna](../ebd/ebd240.htm#006.md), and will give him a white
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), and in the
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) a new name written, which no man knoweth
saving he that receiveth it.  

<span id="018">18</span> And unto the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of
the church in [Thyatira](../ebd/ebd365.htm#004.md) write; These things
saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and
his feet are like fine [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md);  

<span id="019">19</span> I know thy works, and
[charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009.md), and service, and faith, and thy
patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.  

<span id="020">20</span> Notwithstanding I have a few things against
thee, because thou sufferest that woman
[Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006.md), which calleth herself a prophetess, to
teach and to seduce my servants to commit
[fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008.md), and to eat things sacrificed unto
idols.  

<span id="021">21</span> And I gave her space to repent of her
[fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008.md); and she repented not.  

<span id="022">22</span> Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them
that commit [adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009.md) with her into great
[tribulation](../ebd/ebd372.htm#005.md), except they repent of their
deeds.  

<span id="023">23</span> And I will kill her children with death; and
all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the
[reins](../ebd/ebd310.htm#001.md) and hearts: and I will give unto every
one of you according to your works.  

<span id="024">24</span> But unto you I say, and unto the rest in
[Thyatira](../ebd/ebd365.htm#004.md), as many as have not this doctrine,
and which have not known the depths of [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md),
as they speak; I will put upon you none other
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> But that which ye have already hold
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) till I come.  

<span id="026">26</span> And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works
unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:  

<span id="027">27</span> And he shall rule them with a rod of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md); as the vessels of a potter shall they be
broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.  

<span id="028">28</span> And I will give him the morning star.  

<span id="029">29</span> He that hath an [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md),
let him hear what the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) saith unto the
churches.
