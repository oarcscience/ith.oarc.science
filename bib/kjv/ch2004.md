### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Moreover he made an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md), twenty
cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and
ten cubits the height thereof.  

<span id="002">2</span> Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from
brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and
a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.  

<span id="003">3</span> And under it was the similitude of oxen, which
did compass it round about: ten in a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md),
compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was
cast.  

<span id="004">4</span> It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward
the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward
the south, and three looking toward the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md):
and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were
inward.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the thickness of it was an
[handbreadth](../ebd/ebd162.htm#006.md), and the brim of it like the work
of the brim of a [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000.md), with
[flowers](../ebd/ebd136.htm#002.md) of lilies; and it received and held
three thousand [baths](../ebd/ebd047.htm#004.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> He made also ten lavers, and put five on the
right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they
offered for the burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) they washed in
them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he made ten candlesticks of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) according to their form, and set them in
the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), five on the right hand, and five on
the left.  

<span id="008">8</span> He made also ten
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006.md), and placed them in the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), five on the right side, and five on the
left. And he made an hundred basons of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Furthermore he made the court of the priests,
and the great court, and [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) for the court,
and overlaid the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) of them with
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And he set the sea on the right side of the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) end, over against the south.  

<span id="011">11</span> And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and
the basons. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) for the
house of God;  

<span id="012">12</span> To wit, the two pillars, and the
[pommels](../ebd/ebd298.htm#001.md), and the chapiters which were on the
top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two
[pommels](../ebd/ebd298.htm#001.md) of the chapiters which were on the top
of the pillars;  

<span id="013">13</span> And four hundred pomegranates on the two
wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two
[pommels](../ebd/ebd298.htm#001.md) of the chapiters which were upon the
pillars.  

<span id="014">14</span> He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the
bases;  

<span id="015">15</span> One sea, and twelve oxen under it.  

<span id="016">16</span> The pots also, and the shovels, and the
fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) for the
house of the LORD of bright [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> In the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md) of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) did the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
cast them, in the [clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004.md) ground between
[Succoth](../ebd/ebd352.htm#008.md) and
[Zeredathah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#004.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> Thus [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) made all
these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md) could not be found out.  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) made all
the vessels that were for the house of God, the golden
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) also, and the
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006.md) whereon the
[shewbread](../ebd/ebd336.htm#008.md) was set;  

<span id="020">20</span> Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps,
that they should burn after the manner before the
[oracle](../ebd/ebd280.htm#000.md), of pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md);  

<span id="021">21</span> And the [flowers](../ebd/ebd136.htm#002.md), and
the lamps, and the tongs, made he of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and
that perfect [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md);  

<span id="022">22</span> And the snuffers, and the basons, and the
spoons, and the censers, of pure [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md): and the
entry of the house, the inner [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) thereof for
the most holy place, and the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) of the house
of the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), were of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).
