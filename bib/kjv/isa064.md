### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 64

<span id="001">1</span> Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that
thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy
presence,  

<span id="002">2</span> As when the melting fire burneth, the fire
causeth the waters to [boil](../ebd/ebd061.htm#008), to make thy name
known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy
presence!  

<span id="003">3</span> When thou didst terrible things which we looked
not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.  

<span id="004">4</span> For since the beginning of the world men have
not heard, nor perceived by the [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004), neither
hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him
that waiteth for him.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), those that remember thee in thy
ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is
continuance, and we shall be saved.  

<span id="006">6</span> But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our
righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a
[leaf](../ebd/ebd225.htm#004); and our iniquities, like the wind, have
taken us away.  

<span id="007">7</span> And there is none that calleth upon thy name,
that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy
face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.  

<span id="008">8</span> But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the
[clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004), and thou our potter; and we all are the
work of thy hand.  

<span id="009">9</span> Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember
iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy
people.  

<span id="010">10</span> Thy holy cities are a
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002) is a
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005)
a desolation.  

<span id="011">11</span> Our holy and our beautiful house, where our
fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant
things are laid waste.  

<span id="012">12</span> Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O
LORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?
