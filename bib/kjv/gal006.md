### King James Version: Galatians Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye
which are spiritual, restore such an one in the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of [meekness](../ebd/ebd246.htm#003.md);
considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.  

<span id="002">2</span> Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the
law of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> For if a man think himself to be something, when
he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.  

<span id="004">4</span> But let every man prove his own work, and then
shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.  

<span id="005">5</span> For every man shall bear his own
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Let him that is taught in the word communicate
unto him that teacheth in all good things.  

<span id="007">7</span> Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for
whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.  

<span id="008">8</span> For he that soweth to his
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) shall of the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) reap corruption; but he that soweth to
the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) shall of the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) reap life
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And let us not be weary in well doing: for in
due season we shall reap, if we faint not.  

<span id="010">10</span> As we have therefore opportunity, let us do
good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of
faith.  

<span id="011">11</span> Ye see how large a letter I have written unto
you with mine own hand.  

<span id="012">12</span> As many as desire to make a fair shew in the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), they constrain you to be circumcised;
only lest they should suffer [persecution](../ebd/ebd290.htm#007.md) for
the [cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000) of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> For neither they themselves who are circumcised
keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) in your [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> But God forbid that I should
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), save in the
[cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000.md) of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), by whom
the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.  

<span id="015">15</span> For in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) neither
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007.md) availeth any thing, nor
uncircumcision, but a new [creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And as many as walk according to this rule,
peace be on them, and [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md), and upon the
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) of God.  

<span id="017">17</span> From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I
bear in my body the marks of the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> Brethren, the [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of
our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
be with your [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md).
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).
