<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 31</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the families of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and they shall be my people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> found <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>; even <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, when I went to cause him to rest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>: the planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A> unto the LORD our God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, and shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall return thither.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> is my firstborn.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> will gather him, and keep him, as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A> doth his flock.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For the LORD hath redeemed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>, and shall flow together to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A> of the LORD, for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</A>, and for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#009">herd</A>: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</A> rejoice in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#000">dance</A>, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A>, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</A> weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy children shall come again to their own border.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;I have surely heard <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</A> unaccustomed to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A>: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the LORD my God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A> are troubled for him; I will surely have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> upon him, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart toward the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd178.htm#005">highway</A>, even the way which thou wentest: turn again, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, turn again to these thy cities.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A>; The LORD <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> thee, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</A>, and mountain of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And there shall dwell in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> itself, and in all the cities thereof together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> with the seed of man, and with the seed of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#004">grape</A>, and the children's teeth are set on edge.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#004">grape</A>, his teeth shall be set on edge.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and with the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Not according to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>; which my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;But this shall be the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> that I will make with the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> no more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> for a light by day, and the ordinances of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</A> and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</A> for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts is his name:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, then the seed of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD; If <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> for all that they have done, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#002">Hananeel</A> unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of the corner.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#002">Gareb</A>, and shall compass about to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd151.htm#002">Goath</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And the whole <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> of the dead bodies, and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</A>, and all the fields unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd218.htm#008">Kidron</A>, unto the corner of the horse <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> toward the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A>, shall be holy unto the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.<BR>
