### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass in the days of
[Amraphel](../ebd/ebd022.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
Shinar, [Arioch](../ebd/ebd030.htm#007) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Ellasar](../ebd/ebd118.htm#007), [Chedorlaomer](../ebd/ebd078.htm#003)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Elam](../ebd/ebd114.htm#003), and
[Tidal](../ebd/ebd366.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
nations;  

<span id="002">2</span> That these made war with
[Bera](../ebd/ebd053.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004), and with [Birsha](../ebd/ebd059.htm#001)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Gomorrah](../ebd/ebd152.htm#007),
[Shinab](../ebd/ebd339.htm#001) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Admah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#003), and [Shemeber](../ebd/ebd334.htm#007)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of Zeboiim, and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Bela](../ebd/ebd051.htm#006), which is
[Zoar](../ebd/ebd395.htm#004).  

<span id="003">3</span> All these were joined together in the vale of
Siddim, which is the [salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008) sea.  

<span id="004">4</span> Twelve years they served
[Chedorlaomer](../ebd/ebd078.htm#003), and in the thirteenth year they
rebelled.  

<span id="005">5</span> And in the fourteenth year came
[Chedorlaomer](../ebd/ebd078.htm#003), and the kings that were with him,
and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the
[Zuzims](../ebd/ebd396.htm#008) in [Ham](../ebd/ebd160.htm#003), and the
Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [Horites](../ebd/ebd182.htm#001) in
their [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004), unto
[Elparan](../ebd/ebd119.htm#001), which is by the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005).  

<span id="007">7</span> And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which
is [Kadesh](../ebd/ebd215.htm#003), and smote all the country of the
Amalekites, and also the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006), that dwelt
in Hazezontamar.  

<span id="008">8</span> And there went out the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004), and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Gomorrah](../ebd/ebd152.htm#007), and
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Admah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#003), and
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of Zeboiim, and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Bela](../ebd/ebd051.htm#006) (the same
is [Zoar](../ebd/ebd395.htm#004);) and they joined battle with them in
the vale of Siddim;  

<span id="009">9</span> With [Chedorlaomer](../ebd/ebd078.htm#003) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Elam](../ebd/ebd114.htm#003), and with
[Tidal](../ebd/ebd366.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of nations,
and [Amraphel](../ebd/ebd022.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
Shinar, and [Arioch](../ebd/ebd030.htm#007)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Ellasar](../ebd/ebd118.htm#007); four
kings with five.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits;
and the kings of [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004) and
[Gomorrah](../ebd/ebd152.htm#007) fled, and fell there; and they that
remained fled to the mountain.  

<span id="011">11</span> And they took all the goods of
[Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004) and [Gomorrah](../ebd/ebd152.htm#007),
and all their victuals, and went their way.  

<span id="012">12</span> And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who
dwelt in [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004), and his goods, and departed.  

<span id="013">13</span> And there came one that had escaped, and told
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004) the [Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009); for
he dwelt in the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) of
[Mamre](../ebd/ebd239.htm#008) the Amorite, brother of
[Eshcol](../ebd/ebd125.htm#000), and brother of
[Aner](../ebd/ebd024.htm#000): and these were confederate with
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004).  

<span id="014">14</span> And when [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004) heard
that his brother was taken [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001), he armed
his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen,
and pursued them unto [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009).  

<span id="015">15</span> And he divided himself against them, he and his
servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto
[Hobah](../ebd/ebd180.htm#001), which is on the left hand of
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007).  

<span id="016">16</span> And he brought back all the goods, and also
brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and
the people.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004) went out to meet him after his return
from the slaughter of [Chedorlaomer](../ebd/ebd078.htm#003), and of the
kings that were with him, at the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of
Shaveh, which is the king's dale.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Melchizedek](../ebd/ebd247.htm#003)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Salem](../ebd/ebd319.htm#001) brought
forth [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) and [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000):
and he was the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) of the most high God.  

<span id="019">19</span> And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004) of the most high God, possessor of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) and earth:  

<span id="020">20</span> And blessed be the most high God, which hath
delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004) said unto [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004),
Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004) said to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004), I have
lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) and earth,  

<span id="023">23</span> That I will not take from a thread even to a
shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou
shouldest say, I have made [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004) rich:  

<span id="024">24</span> Save only that which the young men have eaten,
and the portion of the men which went with me,
[Aner](../ebd/ebd024.htm#000), [Eshcol](../ebd/ebd125.htm#000), and
[Mamre](../ebd/ebd239.htm#008); let them take their portion.
