<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 29</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Moreover Job continued his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A>, and said,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;When his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#000">candle</A> shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;When I washed my steps with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd067.htm#002">butter</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> poured me out rivers of oil;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;When I went out to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;When the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> to me:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Because I delivered the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;I put on <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#009">diadem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;I was eyes to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>, and feet was I to the lame.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;I was a father to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;My root was spread out by the waters, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</A> lay all night upon my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;My <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> was fresh in me, and my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> was renewed in my hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Unto me men gave <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And they waited for me as for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A>; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.<BR>
