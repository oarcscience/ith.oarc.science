### King James Version: Zechariah Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> The [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md) of the word
of the LORD for [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), saith the LORD, which
stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth,
and formeth the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of man within him.  

<span id="002">2</span> Behold, I will make
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) a [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000.md) of
trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the
siege both against [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and against
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And in that day will I make
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) a burdensome
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) for all people: all that
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md) themselves with it shall be cut in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md), though all the people of the earth be
gathered together against it.  

<span id="004">4</span> In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every
horse with astonishment, and his rider with
[madness](../ebd/ebd236.htm#002.md): and I will open mine eyes upon the
house of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and will smite every horse of
the people with blindness.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the governors of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) shall say in their heart, The inhabitants
of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) shall be my strength in the LORD
of hosts their God.  

<span id="006">6</span> In that day will I make the governors of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) like an [hearth](../ebd/ebd170.htm#002.md)
of fire among the [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md), and like a torch of
fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on
the right hand and on the left: and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md)
shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> The LORD also shall save the tents of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) first, that the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the house of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) and the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of
the inhabitants of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) do not magnify
themselves against [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> In that day shall the LORD defend the
inhabitants of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md); and he that is feeble
among them at that day shall be as [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md); and
the house of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) shall be as God, as the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the LORD before them.  

<span id="009">9</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that I
will seek to destroy all the nations that come against
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And I will pour upon the house of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and upon the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md)
of [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) and of supplications: and they shall
look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004.md) for him, as one mourneth for his only
son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness
for his firstborn.  

<span id="011">11</span> In that day shall there be a great mourning in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in
the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) of Megiddon.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the land shall
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004.md), every family apart; the family of the
house of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) apart, and their wives apart;
the family of the house of [Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md) apart, and
their wives apart;  

<span id="013">13</span> The family of the house of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006.md) apart, and their wives apart; the family
of [Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002.md) apart, and their wives apart;  

<span id="014">14</span> All the families that remain, every family
apart, and their wives apart.
