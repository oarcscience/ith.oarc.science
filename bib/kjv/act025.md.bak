### King James Version: Acts Chapter 25

<span id="001">1</span> Now when Festus was come into the province,
after three days he ascended from [Caesarea](../ebd/ebd068.htm#003.md) to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Then the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
and the chief of the Jews informed him against
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md), and besought him,  

<span id="003">3</span> And desired favour against him, that he would
send for him to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), laying wait in the
way to kill him.  

<span id="004">4</span> But Festus answered, that
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) should be kept at
[Caesarea](../ebd/ebd068.htm#003.md), and that he himself would depart
shortly thither.  

<span id="005">5</span> Let them therefore, said he, which among you are
able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness
in him.  

<span id="006">6</span> And when he had tarried among them more than ten
days, he went down unto [Caesarea](../ebd/ebd068.htm#003.md); and the next
day [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md) on the judgment seat commanded
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) to be brought.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when he was come, the Jews which came down
from [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) stood round about, and laid many
and grievous complaints against [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md), which
they could not prove.  

<span id="008">8</span> While he answered for himself, Neither against
the law of the Jews, neither against the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), nor yet against
[Caesar](../ebd/ebd068.htm#002.md), have I offended any thing at all.  

<span id="009">9</span> But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure,
answered [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md), and said, Wilt thou go up to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and there be judged of these things
before me?  

<span id="010">10</span> Then said [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md), I
stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews
have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.  

<span id="011">11</span> For if I be an offender, or have committed any
thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of
these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I
[appeal](../ebd/ebd027.htm#001) unto [Caesar](../ebd/ebd068.htm#002.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> Then Festus, when he had conferred with the
[council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004.md), answered, Hast thou appealed unto
[Caesar](../ebd/ebd068.htm#002)? unto [Caesar](../ebd/ebd068.htm#002.md)
shalt thou go.  

<span id="013">13</span> And after certain days
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) Agrippa and
[Bernice](../ebd/ebd053.htm#006.md) came unto
[Caesarea](../ebd/ebd068.htm#003.md) to salute Festus.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when they had been there many days, Festus
declared Paul's cause unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), saying,
There is a certain man left in bonds by
[Felix](../ebd/ebd132.htm#001.md):  

<span id="015">15</span> About whom, when I was at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), the chief priests and the elders of
the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.  

<span id="016">16</span> To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the
Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have
the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself
concerning the crime laid against him.  

<span id="017">17</span> Therefore, when they were come hither, without
any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the
man to be brought forth.  

<span id="018">18</span> Against whom when the accusers stood up, they
brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:  

<span id="019">19</span> But had certain questions against him of their
own superstition, and of one [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), which was
dead, whom [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) affirmed to be alive.  

<span id="020">20</span> And because I doubted of such manner of
questions, I asked him whether he would go to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and there be judged of these
matters.  

<span id="021">21</span> But when [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) had
appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of
[Augustus](../ebd/ebd036.htm#006.md), I commanded him to be kept till I
might send him to [Caesar](../ebd/ebd068.htm#002.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also
hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.  

<span id="023">23</span> And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and
[Bernice](../ebd/ebd053.htm#006.md), with great pomp, and was entered into
the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the
city, at Festus' commandment [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) was brought
forth.  

<span id="024">24</span> And Festus said, [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man,
about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and also here, crying that he ought
not to live any longer.  

<span id="025">25</span> But when I found that he had committed nothing
worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to
[Augustus](../ebd/ebd036.htm#006.md), I have determined to send him.  

<span id="026">26</span> Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto
my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially
before thee, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) Agrippa, that, after
examination had, I might have somewhat to write.  

<span id="027">27</span> For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a
prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.
