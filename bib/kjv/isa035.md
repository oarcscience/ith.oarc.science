### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 35

<span id="001">1</span> The [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) and the
solitary place shall be glad for them; and the
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000.md) shall rejoice, and blossom as the
rose.  

<span id="002">2</span> It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even
with joy and singing: the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md) shall be given unto it, the excellency
of [Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006) and [Sharon](../ebd/ebd331.htm#009.md),
they shall see the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the LORD, and the
excellency of our God.  

<span id="003">3</span> Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the
feeble knees.  

<span id="004">4</span> Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be
strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God
with a recompence; he will come and save you.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then the eyes of the
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md) shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf
shall be unstopped.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then shall the lame man leap as an
[hart](../ebd/ebd165.htm#004.md), and the tongue of the
[dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002.md) sing: for in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) shall waters break out, and streams
in the [desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And the parched ground shall become a pool, and
the thirsty land springs of water: in the
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md) of dragons, where each lay, shall be
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md) with reeds and rushes.  

<span id="008">8</span> And an [highway](../ebd/ebd178.htm#005.md) shall be
there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of
[holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md); the unclean shall not pass over it;
but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not
err therein.  

<span id="009">9</span> No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) shall go up thereon, it shall not be
found there; but the redeemed shall walk there:  

<span id="010">10</span> And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and
come to [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md) with
[songs](../ebd/ebd348.htm#002) and [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md)
joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and
sighing shall flee away.
