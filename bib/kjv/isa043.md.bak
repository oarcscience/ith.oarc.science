### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 43

<span id="001">1</span> But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and he that formed thee, O
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I
have called thee by thy name; thou art mine.  

<span id="002">2</span> When thou passest through the waters, I will be
with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when
thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall
the flame kindle upon thee.  

<span id="003">3</span> For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), thy [Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003.md): I
gave [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) for thy
[ransom](../ebd/ebd307.htm#005), [Ethiopia](../ebd/ebd126.htm#005.md) and
[Seba](../ebd/ebd325.htm#004.md) for thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast
been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for
thee, and people for thy life.  

<span id="005">5</span> Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy
seed from the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md), and gather thee from the
west;  

<span id="006">6</span> I will say to the north, Give up; and to the
south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the
ends of the earth;  

<span id="007">7</span> Even every one that is called by my name: for I
have created him for my [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), I have formed
him; yea, I have made him.  

<span id="008">8</span> Bring forth the [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md)
people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.  

<span id="009">9</span> Let all the nations be gathered together, and
let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew
us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be
justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.  

<span id="010">10</span> Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my
servant whom I have [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md): that ye may know
and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God
formed, neither shall there be after me.  

<span id="011">11</span> I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is
no [saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> I have declared, and have saved, and I have
shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my
witnesses, saith the LORD, that I am God.  

<span id="013">13</span> Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is
none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let
it?  

<span id="014">14</span> Thus saith the LORD, your
[redeemer](../ebd/ebd308.htm#008.md), the Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); For your sake I have sent to
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), and have brought down all their
nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the
[ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), your [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the
sea, and a path in the mighty waters;  

<span id="017">17</span> Which bringeth forth the
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md) and horse, the army and the power; they
shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are
quenched as [tow](../ebd/ebd371.htm#001.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> Remember ye not the former things, neither
consider the things of old.  

<span id="019">19</span> Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall
spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), and rivers in the
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> The [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) of the field
shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), and rivers in the
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000), to give [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md)
to my people, my [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> This people have I formed for myself; they
shall shew forth my praise.  

<span id="022">22</span> But thou hast not called upon me, O
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md); but thou hast been weary of me, O
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> Thou hast not brought me the small
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) of thy burnt offerings; neither hast
thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve
with an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), nor wearied thee with
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> Thou hast bought me no sweet
[cane](../ebd/ebd071.htm#002.md) with money, neither hast thou filled me
with the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) of thy sacrifices: but thou hast
made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine
iniquities.  

<span id="025">25</span> I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy
transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.  

<span id="026">26</span> Put me in remembrance: let us plead together:
declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.  

<span id="027">27</span> Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers
have transgressed against me.  

<span id="028">28</span> Therefore I have profaned the princes of the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md), and have given
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) to the [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md),
and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) to reproaches.
