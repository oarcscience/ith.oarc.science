### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 95

<span id="001">1</span> O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a
joyful noise to the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md) of our
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Let us come before his presence with
thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with
[psalms](../ebd/ebd301.htm#005.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> For the LORD is a great God, and a great
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) above all gods.  

<span id="004">4</span> In his hand are the
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) places of the earth: the strength of the
hills is his also.  

<span id="005">5</span> The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands
formed the dry land.  

<span id="006">6</span> O come, let us [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md)
and [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) down: let us kneel before the LORD our
maker.  

<span id="007">7</span> For he is our God; and we are the people of his
pasture, and the [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) of his hand. To day if
ye will hear his voice,  

<span id="008">8</span> Harden not your heart, as in the provocation,
and as in the day of [temptation](../ebd/ebd361.htm#008.md) in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md):  

<span id="009">9</span> When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw
my work.  

<span id="010">10</span> Forty years long was I grieved with this
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md), and said, It is a people that do
err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:  

<span id="011">11</span> Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should
not enter into my rest.
