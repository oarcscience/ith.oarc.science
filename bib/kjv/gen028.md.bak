### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 28

<span id="001">1</span> And [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) called
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and blessed him, and charged him, and
said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of
[Bethuel](../ebd/ebd057.htm#003.md) thy mother's father; and take thee a
wife from thence of the daughers of [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md) thy
mother's brother.  

<span id="003">3</span> And God Almighty [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md)
thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a
multitude of people;  

<span id="004">4</span> And give thee the blessing of
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), to thee, and to thy seed with thee;
that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md), which God gave unto
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) sent away
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md): and he went to Padanaram unto
[Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008), son of [Bethuel](../ebd/ebd057.htm#003.md)
the Syrian, the brother of [Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md), Jacob's and
Esau's mother.  

<span id="006">6</span> When [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) saw that
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) had blessed
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and sent him away to Padanaram, to take
him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge,
saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughers of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md);  

<span id="007">7</span> And that [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) obeyed
his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram;  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) seeing that
the daughters of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md) pleased not
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) his father;  

<span id="009">9</span> Then went [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) unto
[Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md), and took unto the wives which he had
[Mahalath](../ebd/ebd237.htm#002.md) the daughter of
[Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md) Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth,
to be his wife.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) went out
from [Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008.md), and went toward
[Haran](../ebd/ebd163.htm#007.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And he lighted upon a certain place, and
tarried there all night, because the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) was
set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his
pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he dreamed, and behold a
[ladder](../ebd/ebd223.htm#000.md) set up on the earth, and the top of it
reached to [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md): and behold the angels of God
ascending and descending on it.  

<span id="013">13</span> And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said,
I am the LORD God of [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) thy father, and
the God of [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md): the land whereon thou liest,
to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;  

<span id="014">14</span> And thy seed shall be as the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad
to the west, and to the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md), and to the north,
and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of
the earth be blessed.  

<span id="015">15</span> And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee
in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this
land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have
spoken to thee of.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) awaked out
of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew
it not.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is
this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) rose up
early in the morning, and took the [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) that
he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md), and poured oil upon the top of it.  

<span id="019">19</span> And he called the name of that place
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md): but the name of that city was called
[Luz](../ebd/ebd233.htm#006.md) at the first.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) vowed a vow,
saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go,
and will give me [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) to eat, and raiment to
put on,  

<span id="021">21</span> So that I come again to my father's house in
peace; then shall the LORD be my God:  

<span id="022">22</span> And this [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), which
I have set for a [pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md), shall be God's house:
and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto
thee.
