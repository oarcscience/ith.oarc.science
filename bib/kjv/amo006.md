### King James Version: Amos Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> Woe to them that are at ease in
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), and trust in the mountain of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004), which are named chief of the nations,
to whom the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) came!  

<span id="002">2</span> Pass ye unto [Calneh](../ebd/ebd069.htm#008),
and see; and from thence go ye to [Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005) the
great: then go down to [Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009) of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002): be they better than these
kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?  

<span id="003">3</span> Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the
seat of violence to come near;  

<span id="004">4</span> That lie upon beds of
[ivory](../ebd/ebd192.htm#000), and stretch themselves upon their
couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the
midst of the stall;  

<span id="005">5</span> That chant to the sound of the
[viol](../ebd/ebd377.htm#007), and invent to themselves instruments of
musick, like [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004);  

<span id="006">6</span> That [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009)
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) in bowls, and
[anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008) themselves with the chief ointments: but
they are not grieved for the affliction of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005).  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore now shall they go
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) with the first that go
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001), and the
[banquet](../ebd/ebd043.htm#006) of them that stretched themselves shall
be removed.  

<span id="008">8</span> The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the
LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), and hate his palaces: therefore will I
deliver up the city with all that is therein.  

<span id="009">9</span> And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten
men in one house, that they shall die.  

<span id="010">10</span> And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he
that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say
unto him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with thee?
and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not
make mention of the name of the LORD.  

<span id="011">11</span> For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will
smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.  

<span id="012">12</span> Shall horses run upon the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001)? will one plow there with oxen? for ye
have turned judgment into [gall](../ebd/ebd142.htm#000), and the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004)
into [hemlock](../ebd/ebd174.htm#001):  

<span id="013">13</span> Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which
say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?  

<span id="014">14</span> But, behold, I will raise up against you a
nation, O house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saith the LORD the
God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of
[Hemath](../ebd/ebd174.htm#000) unto the river of the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005).
