### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 26

<span id="001">1</span> [Judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) me, O LORD; for I
have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD;
therefore I shall not slide.  

<span id="002">2</span> Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my
[reins](../ebd/ebd310.htm#001) and my heart.  

<span id="003">3</span> For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and
I have walked in thy truth.  

<span id="004">4</span> I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I
go in with dissemblers.  

<span id="005">5</span> I have hated the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of evil doers; and will not sit
with the wicked.  

<span id="006">6</span> I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I
compass thine [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), O LORD:  

<span id="007">7</span> That I may publish with the voice of
thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.  

<span id="008">8</span> LORD, I have loved the
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007) of thy house, and the place where
thine honour dwelleth.  

<span id="009">9</span> Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life
with bloody men:  

<span id="010">10</span> In whose hands is mischief, and their right
hand is full of bribes.  

<span id="011">11</span> But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity:
redeem me, and be merciful unto me.  

<span id="012">12</span> My foot standeth in an even place: in the
congregations will I [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) the LORD.
