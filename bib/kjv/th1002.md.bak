### King James Version: 1 Thessalonians Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in
unto you, that it was not in vain:  

<span id="002">2</span> But even after that we had suffered before, and
were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at
[Philippi](../ebd/ebd293.htm#009.md), we were bold in our God to speak unto
you the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) of God with much contention.  

<span id="003">3</span> For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of
uncleanness, nor in guile:  

<span id="004">4</span> But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust
with the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md), even so we speak; not as
pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.  

<span id="005">5</span> For neither at any time used we flattering
words, as ye know, nor a cloke of [covetousness](../ebd/ebd092.htm#000.md);
God is [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md):  

<span id="006">6</span> Nor of men sought we
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), neither of you, nor yet of others, when
we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse
cherisheth her children:  

<span id="008">8</span> So being affectionately desirous of you, we were
willing to have imparted unto you, not the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) of God only, but also our own souls,
because ye were dear unto us.  

<span id="009">9</span> For ye remember, brethren, our labour and
travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable
unto any of you, we preached unto you the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) of God.  

<span id="010">10</span> Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and
justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:  

<span id="011">11</span> As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and
charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,  

<span id="012">12</span> That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath
called you unto his kingdom and [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> For this cause also thank we God without
ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us,
ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word
of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.  

<span id="014">14</span> For ye, brethren, became followers of the
churches of God which in Judaea are in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md): for ye also have suffered like things of
your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:  

<span id="015">15</span> Who both killed the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), and their own prophets, and have
persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:  

<span id="016">16</span> Forbidding us to speak to the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) that they might be saved, to fill up
their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.  

<span id="017">17</span> But we, brethren, being taken from you for a
short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to
see your face with great desire.  

<span id="018">18</span> Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md), once and again; but
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md) hindered us.  

<span id="019">19</span> For what is our hope, or joy, or
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the
presence of our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) at his coming?  

<span id="020">20</span> For ye are our [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md)
and joy.
