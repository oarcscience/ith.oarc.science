</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Son of man, set thy face against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</A>, and prophesy against it,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</A>, I am against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Because thou hast had a perpetual <A HREF="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</A>, and hast shed the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> by the force of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, even <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> shall pursue thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Thus will I make <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</A> most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</A> against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</A>, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the LORD.<BR>
