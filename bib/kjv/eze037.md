### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 37

<span id="001">1</span> The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me
out in the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the LORD, and set me down
in the midst of the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) which was full of
bones,  

<span id="002">2</span> And caused me to pass by them round about: and,
behold, there were very many in the open
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md); and, lo, they were very dry.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones
live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.  

<span id="004">4</span> Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these
bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones;
Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:  

<span id="006">6</span> And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring
up [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) upon you, and cover you with skin, and
put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the
LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I
prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came
together, bone to his bone.  

<span id="008">8</span> And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) came up upon them, and the skin covered
them above: but there was no breath in them.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind,
prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come
from the four [winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009.md), O breath, and breathe upon
these slain, that they may live.  

<span id="010">10</span> So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the
breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an
exceeding great army.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones
are the whole house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): behold, they
say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our
parts.  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus
saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and
cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I
have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your
graves,  

<span id="014">14</span> And shall put my
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) in you, and ye shall live, and I shall
place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have
spoken it, and performed it, saith the LORD.  

<span id="015">15</span> The word of the LORD came again unto me,
saying,  

<span id="016">16</span> Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick,
and write upon it, For [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and for the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) his companions: then take
another stick, and write upon it, For [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md),
the stick of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) and for all the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) his companions:  

<span id="017">17</span> And join them one to another into one stick;
and they shall become one in thine hand.  

<span id="018">18</span> And when the children of thy people shall speak
unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?  

<span id="019">19</span> Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold,
I will take the stick of [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), which is in
the hand of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), and the tribes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) his fellows, and will put them with him,
even with the stick of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and make them one
stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in
thine hand before their eyes.  

<span id="021">21</span> And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
Behold, I will take the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) from
among the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), whither they be gone, and
will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:  

<span id="022">22</span> And I will make them one nation in the land
upon the mountains of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); and one
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) shall be [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) to
them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be
divided into two kingdoms any more at all.  

<span id="023">23</span> Neither shall they defile themselves any more
with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of
their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their
dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so
shall they be my people, and I will be their God.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) my servant
shall be [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over them; and they all shall
have one [shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006.md): they shall also walk in my
judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.  

<span id="025">25</span> And they shall dwell in the land that I have
given unto [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) my servant, wherein your
fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even they, and their
children, and their children's children for ever: and my servant
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) shall be their
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) for ever.  

<span id="026">26</span> Moreover I will make a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of peace with them; it shall be an
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md)
with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md) in the midst of them for evermore.  

<span id="027">27</span> My [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) also
shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my
people.  

<span id="028">28</span> And the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) shall
know that I the LORD do sanctify [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), when
my [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md) shall be in the midst of them for
evermore.
