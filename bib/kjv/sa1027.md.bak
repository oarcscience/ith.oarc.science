### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 27

<span id="001">1</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said in his
heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md): there is nothing better for me than that
I should speedily escape into the land of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002); and [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md)
shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): so shall I escape out of his hand.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) arose, and he
passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto
[Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008.md), the son of
[Maoch](../ebd/ebd241.htm#000), [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) dwelt with
[Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008) at [Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009.md), he and
his men, every man with his household, even
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) with his two wives,
[Ahinoam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#006.md) the Jezreelitess, and
[Abigail](../ebd/ebd003.htm#002.md) the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.  

<span id="004">4</span> And it was told [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md)
that [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) was fled to
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009.md): and he sought no more again for him.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said unto
[Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008.md), If I have now found
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) in thine eyes, let them give me a place
in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy
servant dwell in the royal city with thee?  

<span id="006">6</span> Then [Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008.md) gave him
[Ziklag](../ebd/ebd393.htm#003.md) that day: wherefore
[Ziklag](../ebd/ebd393.htm#003.md) pertaineth unto the kings of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) unto this day.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the time that [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
dwelt in the country of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) was a
full year and four months.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) and his men
went up, and invaded the [Geshurites](../ebd/ebd147.htm#002.md), and the
Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the
inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to [Shur](../ebd/ebd342.htm#002.md),
even unto the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) smote the
land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), and the oxen, and the asses, and the
camels, and the [apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000.md), and returned, and came
to [Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008.md) said,
Whither have ye made a road to day? And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
said, Against the south of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and against
the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the
[Kenites](../ebd/ebd217.htm#004.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) saved
neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009.md), saying, Lest they should tell on us,
saying, So did [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and so will be his manner
all the while he dwelleth in the country of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008.md) believed
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), saying, He hath made his people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall
be my servant for ever.
