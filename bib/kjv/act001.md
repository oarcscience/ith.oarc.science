### King James Version: Acts Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> The former treatise have I made, O
[Theophilus](../ebd/ebd363.htm#008.md), of all that
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) began both to do and teach,  

<span id="002">2</span> Until the day in which he was taken up, after
that he through the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md) had given
commandments unto the apostles whom he had
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md):  

<span id="003">3</span> To whom also he shewed himself alive after his
[passion](../ebd/ebd286.htm#004.md) by many infallible proofs, being seen
of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom
of God:  

<span id="004">4</span> And, being assembled together with them,
commanded them that they should not depart from
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), but wait for the promise of the
Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.  

<span id="005">5</span> For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall
be baptized with the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md) not many days
hence.  

<span id="006">6</span> When they therefore were come together, they
asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the
kingdom to [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="007">7</span> And he said unto them, It is not for you to know
the times or the [seasons](../ebd/ebd325.htm#003.md), which the Father hath
put in his own power.  

<span id="008">8</span> But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md) is come upon you: and ye shall be
witnesses unto me both in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and in all
Judaea, and in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md), and unto the uttermost
part of the earth.  

<span id="009">9</span> And when he had spoken these things, while they
beheld, he was taken up; and a [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md) received
him out of their sight.  

<span id="010">10</span> And while they looked stedfastly toward
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) as he went up, behold, two men stood by
them in white [apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000.md);  

<span id="011">11</span> Which also said, Ye men of
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md), why stand ye gazing up into
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)? this same
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), which is taken up from you into
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), shall so come in like manner as ye have
seen him go into [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> Then returned they unto
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) from the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) called Olivet, which is from
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) a [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md)
day's [journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And when they were come in, they went up into
an upper room, where abode both [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md), and
[James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md), and John, and
[Andrew](../ebd/ebd023.htm#007), [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008.md), and
[Thomas](../ebd/ebd364.htm#005), [Bartholomew](../ebd/ebd045.htm#009.md),
and [Matthew](../ebd/ebd244.htm#003), [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md) the
son of [Alphaeus](../ebd/ebd018.htm#005.md), and
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004) [Zelotes](../ebd/ebd390.htm#003.md), and
[Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001.md) the brother of
[James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> These all continued with one accord in
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) and supplication, with the women, and
[Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md) the mother of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), and with his brethren.  

<span id="015">15</span> And in those days
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) stood up in the midst of the disciples,
and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and
twenty,)  

<span id="016">16</span> Men and brethren, this
[scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005.md) must needs have been fulfilled, which
the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md) by the mouth of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) spake before concerning
[Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001.md), which was guide to them that took
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> For he was numbered with us, and had obtained
part of this ministry.  

<span id="018">18</span> Now this man purchased a field with the reward
of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and
all his [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004.md) gushed out.  

<span id="019">19</span> And it was known unto all the dwellers at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md); insomuch as that field is called in
their proper tongue, [Aceldama](../ebd/ebd006.htm#003.md), that is to say,
The field of [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> For it is written in the book of
[Psalms](../ebd/ebd301.htm#005.md), Let his
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md) be desolate, and let no man dwell
therein: and his bishoprick let another take.  

<span id="021">21</span> Wherefore of these men which have companied
with us all the time that the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) went
in and out among us,  

<span id="022">22</span> Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that
same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) with us of his resurrection.  

<span id="023">23</span> And they appointed two,
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) called
[Barsabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#008.md), who was surnamed
[Justus](../ebd/ebd215.htm#000.md), and
[Matthias](../ebd/ebd244.htm#005.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which
knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md),  

<span id="025">25</span> That he may take part of this ministry and
apostleship, from which [Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001.md) by transgression
fell, that he might go to his own place.  

<span id="026">26</span> And they gave forth their lots; and the lot
fell upon [Matthias](../ebd/ebd244.htm#005.md); and he was numbered with
the eleven apostles.
