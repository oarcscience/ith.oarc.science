### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 111

<span id="001">1</span> Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with
my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> The works of the LORD are great, sought out of
all them that have pleasure therein.  

<span id="003">3</span> His work is honourable and glorious: and his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) endureth for ever.  

<span id="004">4</span> He hath made his wonderful works to be
remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion.  

<span id="005">5</span> He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he
will ever be mindful of his [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> He hath shewed his people the power of his
works, that he may give them the heritage of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> The works of his hands are verity and judgment;
all his commandments are sure.  

<span id="008">8</span> They stand [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) for
ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.  

<span id="009">9</span> He sent [redemption](../ebd/ebd308.htm#009.md) unto
his people: he hath commanded his [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) for
ever: holy and reverend is his name.  

<span id="010">10</span> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of
wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his
praise endureth for ever.
