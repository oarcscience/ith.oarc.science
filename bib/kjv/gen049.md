### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 49

<span id="001">1</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) called unto
his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that
which shall befall you in the last days.  

<span id="002">2</span> Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007); and hearken unto
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) your father.  

<span id="003">3</span> [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009), thou art my
firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of
dignity, and the excellency of power:  

<span id="004">4</span> Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because
thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up
to my [couch](../ebd/ebd091.htm#002).  

<span id="005">5</span> [Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002) and
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006) are brethren; instruments of cruelty are
in their habitations.  

<span id="006">6</span> O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto
their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) they slew a man, and in their selfwill
they digged down a wall.  

<span id="007">7</span> Cursed be their [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002),
for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them
in [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), and scatter them in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="008">8</span> [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), thou art he whom
thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000) of thine enemies; thy father's children
shall [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) down before thee.  

<span id="009">9</span> [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) is a lion's
whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he
couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?  

<span id="010">10</span> The [sceptre](../ebd/ebd323.htm#006) shall not
depart from [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), nor a lawgiver from between
his feet, until [Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008) come; and unto him shall
the gathering of the people be.  

<span id="011">11</span> Binding his foal unto the
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004), and his ass's colt unto the choice
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004); he washed his garments in
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), and his clothes in the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of grapes:  

<span id="012">12</span> His eyes shall be red with
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), and his teeth white with
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000).  

<span id="013">13</span> [Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003) shall dwell at
the [haven](../ebd/ebd167.htm#008) of the sea; and he shall be for an
[haven](../ebd/ebd167.htm#008) of [ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003); and
his border shall be unto [Zidon](../ebd/ebd393.htm#000).  

<span id="014">14</span> [Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002) is a strong
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001) couching down between two burdens:  

<span id="015">15</span> And he saw that rest was good, and the land
that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a
servant unto [tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006).  

<span id="016">16</span> [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009) shall
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) his people, as one of the tribes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="017">17</span> [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009) shall be a
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009) by the way, an
[adder](../ebd/ebd008.htm#005) in the path, that biteth the horse heels,
so that his rider shall fall backward.  

<span id="018">18</span> I have waited for thy
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003), O LORD.  

<span id="019">19</span> [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007), a troop shall
overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.  

<span id="020">20</span> Out of [Asher](../ebd/ebd033.htm#008) his
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) shall be [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005),
and he shall yield royal dainties.  

<span id="021">21</span> [Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006) is a
[hind](../ebd/ebd179.htm#000) let loose: he giveth goodly words.  

<span id="022">22</span> [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) is a fruitful
bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the
wall:  

<span id="023">23</span> The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot
at him, and hated him:  

<span id="024">24</span> But his [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) abode in
strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the
mighty God of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007); (from thence is the
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006), the [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000):)  

<span id="025">25</span> Even by the God of thy father, who shall help
thee; and by the Almighty, who shall [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) thee
with blessings of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) above, blessings of
the [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008) that lieth under, blessings of the
breasts, and of the womb:  

<span id="026">26</span> The blessings of thy father have prevailed
above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) hills: they shall be on the head of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), and on the
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of the head of him that was separate from
his brethren.  

<span id="027">27</span> [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) shall ravin
as a [wolf](../ebd/ebd383.htm#001): in the morning he shall devour the
prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.  

<span id="028">28</span> All these are the twelve tribes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and this is it that their father spake
unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he
blessed them.  

<span id="029">29</span> And he charged them, and said unto them, I am
to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the
[cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006) that is in the field of
[Ephron](../ebd/ebd123.htm#008) the Hittite,  

<span id="030">30</span> In the [cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006) that is in
the field of [Machpelah](../ebd/ebd235.htm#007), which is before
[Mamre](../ebd/ebd239.htm#008), in the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005), which [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005)
bought with the field of [Ephron](../ebd/ebd123.htm#008) the Hittite for
a possession of a buryingplace.  

<span id="031">31</span> There they buried
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) and [Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003) his
wife; there they buried [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006) and
[Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001) his wife; and there I buried
[Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006).  

<span id="032">32</span> The purchase of the field and of the
[cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006) that is therein was from the children of
[Heth](../ebd/ebd177.htm#001).  

<span id="033">33</span> And when [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) had
made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the
bed, and yielded up the [ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005), and was gathered
unto his people.
