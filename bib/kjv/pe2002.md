### King James Version: 2 Peter Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> But there were false prophets also among the
people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily
shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought
them, and bring upon themselves swift
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by
reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.  

<span id="003">3</span> And through
[covetousness](../ebd/ebd092.htm#000.md) shall they with feigned words make
merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and
their [damnation](../ebd/ebd096.htm#008.md) slumbereth not.  

<span id="004">4</span> For if God spared not the angels that sinned,
but cast them down to [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md), and delivered them
into chains of [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), to be reserved unto
judgment;  

<span id="005">5</span> And spared not the old world, but saved
[Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002.md) the eighth person, a preacher of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), bringing in the
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000.md) upon the world of the ungodly;  

<span id="006">6</span> And turning the cities of
[Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004.md) and Gomorrha into
[ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000.md) condemned them with an overthrow, making
them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;  

<span id="007">7</span> And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy
[conversation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#001.md) of the wicked:  

<span id="008">8</span> (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in
seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their
unlawful deeds;)  

<span id="009">9</span> The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of
temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be
punished:  

<span id="010">10</span> But chiefly them that walk after the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) in the [lust](../ebd/ebd233.htm#005.md) of
uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled,
they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.  

<span id="011">11</span> Whereas angels, which are greater in power and
might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.  

<span id="012">12</span> But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be
taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not;
and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;  

<span id="013">13</span> And shall receive the reward of
unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time.
Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own
deceivings while they [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) with you;  

<span id="014">14</span> Having eyes full of
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009.md), and that cannot cease from
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md); beguiling unstable souls: an heart they
have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:  

<span id="015">15</span> Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone
astray, following the way of [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) the son of
[Bosor](../ebd/ebd063.htm#000.md), who loved the
[wages](../ebd/ebd378.htm#004.md) of unrighteousness;  

<span id="016">16</span> But was rebuked for his iniquity: the
[dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002) [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md) speaking with
man's voice forbad the [madness](../ebd/ebd236.htm#002.md) of the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> These are wells without water, clouds that are
carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) is reserved for ever.  

<span id="018">18</span> For when they speak great
[swelling](../ebd/ebd354.htm#001.md) words of vanity, they allure through
the lusts of the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), through much
wantonness, those that were [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) escaped from
them who live in error.  

<span id="019">19</span> While they promise them liberty, they
themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is
overcome, of the same is he brought in
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> For if after they have escaped the pollutions
of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and
[Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), they are again entangled therein, and
overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.  

<span id="021">21</span> For it had been better for them not to have
known the way of [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), than, after
they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto
them.  

<span id="022">22</span> But it is happened unto them according to the
true [proverb](../ebd/ebd301.htm#002.md), The dog is turned to his own
vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.
