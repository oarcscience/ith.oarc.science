### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 30

<span id="001">1</span> And when [Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) saw
that she bare [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) no children,
[Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) envied her sister; and said unto
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), Give me children, or else I die.  

<span id="002">2</span> And Jacob's [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) was
kindled against [Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004): and he said, Am I in
God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of the womb?  

<span id="003">3</span> And she said, Behold my maid
[Bilhah](../ebd/ebd058.htm#008), go in unto her; and she shall bear upon
my knees, that I may also have children by her.  

<span id="004">4</span> And she gave him [Bilhah](../ebd/ebd058.htm#008)
her [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008) to wife: and
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) went in unto her.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Bilhah](../ebd/ebd058.htm#008) conceived,
and bare [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) a son.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) said, God
hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son:
therefore called she his name [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009).  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Bilhah](../ebd/ebd058.htm#008) Rachel's
maid conceived again, and bare [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) a second
son.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) said, With
great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed:
and she called his name [Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006).  

<span id="009">9</span> When [Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006) saw that she
had left bearing, she took [Zilpah](../ebd/ebd393.htm#005) her maid, and
gave her [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) to wife.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Zilpah](../ebd/ebd393.htm#005) Leah's maid
bare [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) a son.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006) said, A troop
cometh: and she called his name [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007).  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Zilpah](../ebd/ebd393.htm#005) Leah's maid
bare [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) a second son.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006) said, Happy
am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name
[Asher](../ebd/ebd033.htm#008).  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009) went in the
days of [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000) [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008),
and found [mandrakes](../ebd/ebd240.htm#003) in the field, and brought
them unto his mother [Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006). Then
[Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) said to [Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006),
Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's [mandrakes](../ebd/ebd240.htm#003).  

<span id="015">15</span> And she said unto her, Is it a small matter
that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's
[mandrakes](../ebd/ebd240.htm#003) also? And
[Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) said, Therefore he shall lie with thee
to night for thy son's [mandrakes](../ebd/ebd240.htm#003).  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) came out of
the field in the evening, and [Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006) went out to
meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired
thee with my son's [mandrakes](../ebd/ebd240.htm#003). And he lay with
her that night.  

<span id="017">17</span> And God hearkened unto
[Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006), and she conceived, and bare
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) the fifth son.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006) said, God
hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and
she called his name [Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002).  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006) conceived
again, and bare [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) the sixth son.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006) said, God
hath endued me with a good [dowry](../ebd/ebd106.htm#009); now will my
husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called
his name [Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003).  

<span id="021">21</span> And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called
her name [Dinah](../ebd/ebd103.htm#008).  

<span id="022">22</span> And God remembered
[Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004), and God hearkened to her, and opened
her womb.  

<span id="023">23</span> And she conceived, and bare a son; and said,
God hath taken away my reproach:  

<span id="024">24</span> And she called his name
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005); and said, The LORD shall add to me
another son.  

<span id="025">25</span> And it came to pass, when
[Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) had born
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), that [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007)
said unto [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008), Send me away, that I may go
unto mine own place, and to my country.  

<span id="026">26</span> Give me my wives and my children, for whom I
have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I
have done thee.  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008) said unto
him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I
have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.  

<span id="028">28</span> And he said, Appoint me thy
[wages](../ebd/ebd378.htm#004), and I will give it.  

<span id="029">29</span> And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have
served thee, and how thy [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) was with me.  

<span id="030">30</span> For it was little which thou hadst before I
came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath
blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own
house also?  

<span id="031">31</span> And he said, What shall I give thee? And
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) said, Thou shalt not give me any thing:
if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy
flock.  

<span id="032">32</span> I will pass through all thy flock to day,
removing from thence all the speckled and spotted
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002), and all the brown
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) among the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), and the spotted and speckled among the
goats: and of such shall be my hire.  

<span id="033">33</span> So shall my
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) answer for me in time to come,
when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not
speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), that shall be counted stolen with me.  

<span id="034">34</span> And [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008) said,
Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.  

<span id="035">35</span> And he removed that day the he goats that were
ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and
spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown
among the [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), and gave them into the hand of
his sons.  

<span id="036">36</span> And he set three days'
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001) betwixt himself and
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007): and [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) fed
the rest of Laban's flocks.  

<span id="037">37</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) took him
rods of green [poplar](../ebd/ebd298.htm#007), and of the
[hazel](../ebd/ebd169.htm#001) and chesnut tree; and pilled white
strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.  

<span id="038">38</span> And he set the rods which he had pilled before
the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came
to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), that they should conceive when they
came to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009).  

<span id="039">39</span> And the flocks conceived before the rods, and
brought forth [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) ringstraked, speckled, and
spotted.  

<span id="040">40</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) did separate
the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and
all the brown in the flock of [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008); and he put
his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002).  

<span id="041">41</span> And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) did conceive, that
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) laid the rods before the eyes of the
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) in the gutters, that they might conceive
among the rods.  

<span id="042">42</span> But when the [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002)
were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the
stronger Jacob's.  

<span id="043">43</span> And the man increased exceedingly, and had much
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002), and maidservants, and menservants, and
camels, and asses.
