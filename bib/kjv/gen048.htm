</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And one told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, and said, Behold, thy son <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> cometh unto thee: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, God Almighty appeared unto me at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd233.htm#006">Luz</A> in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</A>, and blessed me,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> possession.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And now thy two sons, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A>, which were born unto thee in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> before I came unto thee into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, are mine; as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd311.htm#009">Reuben</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</A>, they shall be mine.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And as for me, when I came from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#003">Padan</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</A> died by me in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</A> in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Now the eyes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> took them both, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A> in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A> was the firstborn.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And he blessed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, and said, God, before whom my fathers <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">Angel</A> which redeemed me from all evil, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A>, saying, God make thee as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> and as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A>: and he set <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> and with my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A>.<BR>
