### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> The [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) is written with a pen of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md), and with the point of a
[diamond](../ebd/ebd103.htm#001.md): it is graven upon the table of their
heart, and upon the horns of your altars;  

<span id="002">2</span> Whilst their children remember their altars and
their groves by the green trees upon the high hills.  

<span id="003">3</span> O my mountain in the field, I will give thy
substance and all thy treasures to the spoil, and thy high places for
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), throughout all thy borders.  

<span id="004">4</span> And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from
thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine
enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire
in mine [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md), which shall burn for ever.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that
trusteth in man, and maketh [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) his arm, and
whose heart departeth from the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> For he shall be like the
[heath](../ebd/ebd170.htm#004) in the [desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000.md),
and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places
in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), in a
[salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008.md) land and not inhabited.  

<span id="007">7</span> Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD,
and whose hope the LORD is.  

<span id="008">8</span> For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters,
and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when
heat cometh, but her [leaf](../ebd/ebd225.htm#004.md) shall be green; and
shall not be careful in the year of [drought](../ebd/ebd108.htm#005.md),
neither shall cease from yielding [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> The heart is deceitful above all things, and
desperately wicked: who can know it?  

<span id="010">10</span> I the LORD search the heart, I try the
[reins](../ebd/ebd310.htm#001.md), even to give every man according to his
ways, and according to the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of his
doings.  

<span id="011">11</span> As the [partridge](../ebd/ebd285.htm#007.md)
sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he that getteth riches, and
not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end
shall be a fool.  

<span id="012">12</span> A glorious high [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md)
from the beginning is the place of our
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> O LORD, the hope of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), all that forsake thee shall be ashamed,
and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they
have forsaken the LORD, the [fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md) of living
waters.  

<span id="014">14</span> Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save
me, and I shall be saved: for thou art my praise.  

<span id="015">15</span> Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of
the LORD? let it come now.  

<span id="016">16</span> As for me, I have not hastened from being a
pastor to follow thee: neither have I desired the woeful day; thou
knowest: that which came out of my lips was right before thee.  

<span id="017">17</span> Be not a terror unto me: thou art my hope in
the day of evil.  

<span id="018">18</span> Let them be confounded that persecute me, but
let not me be confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be
dismayed: bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> Thus said the LORD unto me; Go and stand in the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) of the children of the people, whereby the
kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) come in, and by the which they
go out, and in all the gates of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md);  

<span id="020">20</span> And say unto them, Hear ye the word of the
LORD, ye kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and all
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and all the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), that enter in by these gates:  

<span id="021">21</span> Thus saith the LORD; Take heed to yourselves,
and bear no [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md) on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) day, nor bring it in by the gates of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md);  

<span id="022">22</span> Neither carry forth a
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md) out of your houses on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) day, neither do ye any work, but
[hallow](../ebd/ebd160.htm#001) ye the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md)
day, as I commanded your fathers.  

<span id="023">23</span> But they obeyed not, neither inclined their
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md), but made their
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md) stiff, that they might not hear, nor
receive instruction.  

<span id="024">24</span> And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently
hearken unto me, saith the LORD, to bring in no
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md) through the gates of this city on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) day, but
[hallow](../ebd/ebd160.htm#001) the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md)
day, to do no work therein;  

<span id="025">25</span> Then shall there enter into the gates of this
city kings and princes [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md) upon the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md),
riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): and this city shall remain for
ever.  

<span id="026">26</span> And they shall come from the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and from the places about
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and from the land of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md), and from the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md), and from the mountains, and from the
south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md), and bringing sacrifices of praise,
unto the house of the LORD.  

<span id="027">27</span> But if ye will not hearken unto me to
[hallow](../ebd/ebd160.htm#001) the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md)
day, and not to bear a [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md), even entering in
at the gates of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) day; then will I kindle a fire in the
gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and it shall not be quenched.
