### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous
words stir up [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002).  

<span id="002">2</span> The tongue of the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004)
useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out
foolishness.  

<span id="003">3</span> The eyes of the LORD are in every place,
beholding the evil and the good.  

<span id="004">4</span> A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but
perverseness therein is a [breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005) in the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009).  

<span id="005">5</span> A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but
he that regardeth reproof is prudent.  

<span id="006">6</span> In the house of the righteous is much treasure:
but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.  

<span id="007">7</span> The lips of the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004)
disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish doeth not so.  

<span id="008">8</span> The [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of the
wicked is an [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) to the LORD: but the
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) of the upright is his delight.  

<span id="009">9</span> The way of the wicked is an
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) unto the LORD: but he loveth him
that followeth after [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="010">10</span> Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh
the way: and he that hateth reproof shall die.  

<span id="011">11</span> [Hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003) and
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) are before the LORD: how much more
then the hearts of the children of men?  

<span id="012">12</span> A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him:
neither will he go unto the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004).  

<span id="013">13</span> A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance:
but by sorrow of the heart the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) is
broken.  

<span id="014">14</span> The heart of him that hath understanding
seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.  

<span id="015">15</span> All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he
that is of a merry heart hath a continual
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000).  

<span id="016">16</span> Better is little with the fear of the LORD than
great treasure and trouble therewith.  

<span id="017">17</span> Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than
a stalled [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) and
[hatred](../ebd/ebd167.htm#002) therewith.  

<span id="018">18</span> A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that
is slow to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) appeaseth strife.  

<span id="019">19</span> The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of
thorns: but the way of the righteous is made
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002).  

<span id="020">20</span> A [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) son maketh a
glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother.  

<span id="021">21</span> Folly is joy to him that is destitute of
wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly.  

<span id="022">22</span> Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but
in the multitude of counsellors they are established.  

<span id="023">23</span> A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and
a word spoken in due season, how good is it!  

<span id="024">24</span> The way of life is above to the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), that he may depart from
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003) beneath.  

<span id="025">25</span> The LORD will destroy the house of the proud:
but he will establish the border of the widow.  

<span id="026">26</span> The thoughts of the wicked are an
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) to the LORD: but the words of the
pure are pleasant words.  

<span id="027">27</span> He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own
house; but he that hateth gifts shall live.  

<span id="028">28</span> The heart of the righteous studieth to answer:
but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.  

<span id="029">29</span> The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth
the [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) of the righteous.  

<span id="030">30</span> The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and
a good report maketh the bones [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005).  

<span id="031">31</span> The [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) that heareth
the reproof of life abideth among the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004).  

<span id="032">32</span> He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own
soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding.  

<span id="033">33</span> The fear of the LORD is the instruction of
wisdom; and before honour is [humility](../ebd/ebd184.htm#007).
