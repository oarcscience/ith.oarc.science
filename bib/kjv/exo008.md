### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Go unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD,
Let my people go, that they may serve me.  

<span id="002">2</span> And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I
will smite all thy borders with frogs:  

<span id="003">3</span> And the river shall bring forth frogs
abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy
bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and
upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:  

<span id="004">4</span> And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and
upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Say unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md),
Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers,
and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) stretched out
his hand over the waters of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md); and the
frogs came up, and covered the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [magicians](../ebd/ebd236.htm#007.md) did
so with their [enchantments](../ebd/ebd120.htm#004.md), and brought up
frogs upon the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Then [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) called for
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and
said, Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and
from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) unto the LORD.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), [Glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) over
me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy
people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may
remain in the river only?  

<span id="010">10</span> And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it
according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like
unto the LORD our God.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from
thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall
remain in the river only.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) went out from
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005): and [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md)
cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And the LORD did according to the word of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md); and the frogs died out of the houses,
out of the [villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md), and out of the fields.  

<span id="014">14</span> And they gathered them together upon heaps: and
the land stank.  

<span id="015">15</span> But when [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) saw
that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto
them; as the LORD had said.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Say unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md),
Stretch out thy rod, and smite the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) of the
land, that it may become [lice](../ebd/ebd228.htm#007.md) throughout all
the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And they did so; for
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) stretched out his hand with his rod, and
smote the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) of the earth, and it became
[lice](../ebd/ebd228.htm#007.md) in man, and in
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001); all the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) of
the land became [lice](../ebd/ebd228.htm#007.md) throughout all the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And the [magicians](../ebd/ebd236.htm#007.md) did
so with their [enchantments](../ebd/ebd120.htm#004.md) to bring forth
[lice](../ebd/ebd228.htm#007.md), but they could not: so there were
[lice](../ebd/ebd228.htm#007.md) upon man, and upon
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> Then the [magicians](../ebd/ebd236.htm#007.md)
said unto [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), This is the finger of God:
and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the
LORD had said.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Rise up early in the morning, and stand
before [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md); lo, he cometh forth to the
water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that
they may serve me.  

<span id="021">21</span> Else, if thou wilt not let my people go,
behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants,
and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the
Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon
they are.  

<span id="022">22</span> And I will sever in that day the land of
[Goshen](../ebd/ebd153.htm#002.md), in which my people dwell, that no
swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am
the LORD in the midst of the earth.  

<span id="023">23</span> And I will put a division between my people and
thy people: to morrow shall this sign be.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous
swarm of flies into the house of [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), and
into his servants' houses, and into all the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): the land was corrupted by reason of the
swarm of flies.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) called for
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and for [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md),
and said, Go ye, [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) to your God in the
land.  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said, It is
not meet so to do; for we shall [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) the
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md) of the Egyptians to the LORD our
God: lo, shall we [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) the
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md) of the Egyptians before their eyes,
and will they not [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) us?  

<span id="027">27</span> We will go three days'
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md) into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), and
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) to the LORD our God, as he shall
command us.  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) said, I
will let you go, that ye may [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) to the
LORD your God in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md); only ye shall
not go very far away: intreat for me.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said,
Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms
of flies may depart from [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), from his
servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) deal deceitfully any more in not
letting the people go to [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) to the
LORD.  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) went out
from [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), and intreated the LORD.  

<span id="031">31</span> And the LORD did according to the word of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md); and he removed the swarms of flies from
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), from his servants, and from his
people; there remained not one.  

<span id="032">32</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) hardened
his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.
