### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 81

<span id="001">1</span> Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful
noise unto the God of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Take a psalm, and bring hither the
[timbrel](../ebd/ebd366.htm#004.md), the pleasant
[harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001.md) with the
[psaltery](../ebd/ebd301.htm#006.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> Blow up the trumpet in the new
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004.md), in the time appointed, on our solemn
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) day.  

<span id="004">4</span> For this was a statute for
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and a law of the God of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> This he ordained in
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) for a
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md), when he went out through the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): where I heard a language that I
understood not.  

<span id="006">6</span> I removed his shoulder from the
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md): his hands were delivered from the
pots.  

<span id="007">7</span> Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee;
I answered thee in the secret place of [thunder](../ebd/ebd365.htm#003.md):
I proved thee at the waters of [Meribah](../ebd/ebd249.htm#009.md).
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee:
O [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), if thou wilt hearken unto me;  

<span id="009">9</span> There shall no strange god be in thee; neither
shalt thou [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) any strange god.  

<span id="010">10</span> I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out
of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): open thy mouth wide, and
I will fill it.  

<span id="011">11</span> But my people would not hearken to my voice;
and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) would none of me.  

<span id="012">12</span> So I gave them up unto their own hearts'
[lust](../ebd/ebd233.htm#005.md): and they walked in their own counsels.  

<span id="013">13</span> Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) had walked in my ways!  

<span id="014">14</span> I should soon have subdued their enemies, and
turned my hand against their adversaries.  

<span id="015">15</span> The haters of the LORD should have submitted
themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.  

<span id="016">16</span> He should have fed them also with the finest of
the [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md): and with
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001) out of the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md)
should I have satisfied thee.
