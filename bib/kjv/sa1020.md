### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) fled from
[Naioth](../ebd/ebd266.htm#002) in [Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005), and
came and said before [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000), What have I
done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
before thy father, that he seeketh my life?  

<span id="002">2</span> And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not
die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that
he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it
is not so.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) sware
moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) know this, lest he be grieved: but
truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step
between me and death.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then said [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will
even do it for thee.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said unto
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000), Behold, to morrow is the new
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004), and I should not fail to sit with the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) at meat: but let me go, that I may hide
myself in the field unto the third day at even.  

<span id="006">6</span> If thy father at all miss me, then say,
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) earnestly asked leave of me that he might
run to [Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005) his city: for there is a
yearly [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) there for all the family.  

<span id="007">7</span> If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall
have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is
determined by him.  

<span id="008">8</span> Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy
servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of the LORD with thee:
notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why
shouldest thou bring me to thy father?  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) said, Far
be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my
father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?  

<span id="010">10</span> Then said [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) to
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000), Who shall tell me? or what if thy
father answer thee roughly?  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) said unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), Come, and let us go out into the field.
And they went out both of them into the field.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) said unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), O LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), when I have sounded my father about to
morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and I then send not unto thee, and shew
it thee;  

<span id="013">13</span> The LORD do so and much more to
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000): but if it please my father to do thee
evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go
in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.  

<span id="014">14</span> And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew
me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:  

<span id="015">15</span> But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness
from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies
of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) every one from the face of the
earth.  

<span id="016">16</span> So [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) made a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with the house of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), saying, Let the LORD even require it at
the hand of David's enemies.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) caused
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) to swear again, because he loved him: for
he loved him as he loved his own soul.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) said to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), To morrow is the new
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004): and thou shalt be missed, because thy
seat will be empty.  

<span id="019">19</span> And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou
shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide
thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) [Ezel](../ebd/ebd129.htm#003).  

<span id="020">20</span> And I will shoot three
[arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005) on the side thereof, as though I shot at
a mark.  

<span id="021">21</span> And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go,
find out the [arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005). If I expressly say unto
the lad, Behold, the [arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005) are on this side of
thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no
hurt; as the LORD liveth.  

<span id="022">22</span> But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold,
the [arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005) are beyond thee; go thy way: for the
LORD hath sent thee away.  

<span id="023">23</span> And as touching the matter which thou and I
have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.  

<span id="024">24</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) hid himself
in the field: and when the new [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004) was come,
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) sat him down to eat meat.  

<span id="025">25</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) sat upon
his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) arose, and
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) sat by Saul's side, and David's place was
empty.  

<span id="026">26</span> Nevertheless [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002)
spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen
him, he is not [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005); surely he is not
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005).  

<span id="027">27</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, which was
the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) said unto
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) his son, Wherefore cometh not the son
of [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005) to meat, neither yesterday, nor to
day?  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) answered
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) earnestly
asked leave of me to go to [Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005):  

<span id="029">29</span> And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our
family hath a [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) in the city; and my
brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found
favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren.
Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.  

<span id="030">30</span> Then Saul's [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) was
kindled against [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000), and he said unto him,
Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) the son of
[Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005) to thine own confusion, and unto the
confusion of thy mother's nakedness?  

<span id="031">31</span> For as long as the son of
[Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005) liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be
established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me,
for he shall surely die.  

<span id="032">32</span> And [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) answered
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) his father, and said unto him, Wherefore
shall he be slain? what hath he done?  

<span id="033">33</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) cast a
[javelin](../ebd/ebd198.htm#006) at him to smite him: whereby
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) knew that it was determined of his
father to slay [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="034">34</span> So [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) arose from
the table in fierce [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), and did eat no meat
the second day of the month: for he was grieved for
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), because his father had done him shame.  

<span id="035">35</span> And it came to pass in the morning, that
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) went out into the field at the time
appointed with [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and a little lad with
him.  

<span id="036">36</span> And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the
[arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005) which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he
shot an arrow beyond him.  

<span id="037">37</span> And when the lad was come to the place of the
arrow which [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) had shot,
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) cried after the lad, and said, Is not
the arrow beyond thee?  

<span id="038">38</span> And [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) cried
after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered
up the [arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005), and came to his master.  

<span id="039">39</span> But the lad knew not any thing: only
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
knew the matter.  

<span id="040">40</span> And [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) gave his
[artillery](../ebd/ebd032.htm#008) unto his lad, and said unto him, Go,
carry them to the city.  

<span id="041">41</span> And as soon as the lad was gone,
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) arose out of a place toward the south,
and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and
they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) exceeded.  

<span id="042">42</span> And [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) said to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn
both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and
thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and
departed: and [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) went into the city.
