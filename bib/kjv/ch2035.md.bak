### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 35

<span id="001">1</span> Moreover [Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008.md) kept a
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md) unto the LORD in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): and they killed the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md) on the fourteenth day of the first
month.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he set the priests in their charges, and
encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD,  

<span id="003">3</span> And said unto the Levites that taught all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), which were holy unto the LORD, Put the
holy [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) in the house which
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) the son of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) did build; it shall not be a
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md) upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD
your God, and his people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),  

<span id="004">4</span> And prepare yourselves by the houses of your
fathers, after your [courses](../ebd/ebd091.htm#006.md), according to the
[writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005) of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and
according to the [writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005.md) of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) his son.  

<span id="005">5</span> And stand in the holy place according to the
divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people,
and after the division of the families of the Levites.  

<span id="006">6</span> So kill the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md),
and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that they may do
according to the word of the LORD by the hand of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008.md) gave to the
people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md) offerings, for all that were present,
to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these
were of the king's substance.  

<span id="008">8</span> And his princes gave willingly unto the people,
to the priests, and to the Levites: [Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006.md) and
[Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006) and [Jehiel](../ebd/ebd200.htm#003.md),
rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md) offerings two thousand and six hundred
small [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) and three hundred oxen.  

<span id="009">9</span> [Conaniah](../ebd/ebd087.htm#005.md) also, and
[Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005.md) and
[Nethaneel](../ebd/ebd271.htm#003.md), his brethren, and
[Hashabiah](../ebd/ebd166.htm#001) and [Jeiel](../ebd/ebd203.htm#000.md)
and [Jozabad](../ebd/ebd212.htm#002.md), chief of the Levites, gave unto
the Levites for [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md) offerings five
thousand small [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), and five hundred oxen.  

<span id="010">10</span> So the service was prepared, and the priests
stood in their place, and the Levites in their
[courses](../ebd/ebd091.htm#006.md), according to the king's commandment.  

<span id="011">11</span> And they killed the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md), and the priests sprinkled the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) from their hands, and the Levites flayed
them.  

<span id="012">12</span> And they removed the burnt offerings, that they
might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to
offer unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md). And so did they with the oxen.  

<span id="013">13</span> And they roasted the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md) with fire according to the ordinance:
but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in
pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.  

<span id="014">14</span> And afterward they made ready for themselves,
and for the priests: because the priests the sons of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) were busied in
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) of burnt offerings and the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) until night; therefore the Levites prepared
for themselves, and for the priests the sons of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And the singers the sons of
[Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002.md) were in their place, according to the
commandment of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and
[Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002), and [Heman](../ebd/ebd173.htm#009.md), and
[Jeduthun](../ebd/ebd199.htm#009.md) the king's
[seer](../ebd/ebd326.htm#000.md); and the porters waited at every
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md); they might not depart from their service;
for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.  

<span id="016">16</span> So all the service of the LORD was prepared the
same day, to keep the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md), and to offer
burnt offerings upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) of the LORD,
according to the commandment of [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) that were present kept the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md) at that time, and the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) of unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days.  

<span id="018">18</span> And there was no
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md) like to that kept in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) from the days of
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md);
neither did all the kings of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) keep such a
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005) as [Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008.md)
kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) that
were present, and the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> In the eighteenth year of the reign of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008.md) was this
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md) kept.  

<span id="020">20</span> After all this, when
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008.md) had prepared the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), Necho [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) came up to fight against Charchemish by
[Euphrates](../ebd/ebd127.htm#001): and [Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008.md)
went out against him.  

<span id="021">21</span> But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What
have I to do with thee, thou [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)? I come not against thee this day, but
against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make
haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he
destroy thee not.  

<span id="022">22</span> Nevertheless [Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008.md)
would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might
fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth
of God, and came to fight in the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) of
[Megiddo](../ebd/ebd246.htm#004.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And the archers shot at
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008.md); and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said to his servants, Have me away; for I
am sore wounded.  

<span id="024">24</span> His servants therefore took him out of that
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md), and put him in the second
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md) that he had; and they brought him to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and he died, and was buried in one
of the sepulchres of his fathers. And all [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)
and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) mourned for
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) lamented
for [Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008.md): and all the singing men and the
singing women spake of [Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008.md) in their
lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and, behold, they are written in the
lamentations.  

<span id="026">26</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008.md), and his
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md), according to that which was written
in the law of the LORD,  

<span id="027">27</span> And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are
written in the book of the kings of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) and
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).
