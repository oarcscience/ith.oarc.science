### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 34

<span id="001">1</span> I will [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) the LORD
at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.  

<span id="002">2</span> My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the
humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.  

<span id="003">3</span> O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his
name together.  

<span id="004">4</span> I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and
delivered me from all my fears.  

<span id="005">5</span> They looked unto him, and were lightened: and
their faces were not ashamed.  

<span id="006">6</span> This [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) man cried,
and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.  

<span id="007">7</span> The [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the LORD
encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.  

<span id="008">8</span> O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed
is the man that trusteth in him.  

<span id="009">9</span> O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no
want to them that fear him.  

<span id="010">10</span> The young [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001) do
lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any
good thing.  

<span id="011">11</span> Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will
teach you the fear of the LORD.  

<span id="012">12</span> What man is he that desireth life, and loveth
many days, that he may see good?  

<span id="013">13</span> Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from
speaking guile.  

<span id="014">14</span> Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and
pursue it.  

<span id="015">15</span> The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous,
and his ears are open unto their cry.  

<span id="016">16</span> The face of the LORD is against them that do
evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.  

<span id="017">17</span> The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and
delivereth them out of all their troubles.  

<span id="018">18</span> The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken
heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009).  

<span id="019">19</span> Many are the
[afflictions](../ebd/ebd011.htm#006) of the righteous: but the LORD
delivereth him out of them all.  

<span id="020">20</span> He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is
broken.  

<span id="021">21</span> Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate
the righteous shall be desolate.  

<span id="022">22</span> The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants:
and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.
