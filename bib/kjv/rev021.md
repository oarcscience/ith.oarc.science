### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> And I saw a new [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)
and a new earth: for the first [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) and the
first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.  

<span id="002">2</span> And I John saw the holy city, new
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), coming down from God out of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), prepared as a
[bride](../ebd/ebd065.htm#001.md) adorned for her husband.  

<span id="003">3</span> And I heard a great voice out of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) saying, Behold, the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of God is with men, and he will
dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be
with them, and be their God.  

<span id="004">4</span> And God shall wipe away all tears from their
eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying,
neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed
away.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he that sat upon the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) said, Behold, I make all things new. And
he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and
[Omega](../ebd/ebd278.htm#004.md), the beginning and the end. I will give
unto him that is athirst of the [fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md) of the
water of life freely.  

<span id="007">7</span> He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and
I will be his God, and he shall be my son.  

<span id="008">8</span> But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the
abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and
idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which
burneth with fire and [brimstone](../ebd/ebd065.htm#005.md): which is the
second death.  

<span id="009">9</span> And there came unto me one of the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) angels which had the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) vials full of the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) last plagues, and talked with me, saying,
Come hither, I will shew thee the [bride](../ebd/ebd065.htm#001.md), the
Lamb's wife.  

<span id="010">10</span> And he carried me away in the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) to a great and high mountain, and shewed
me that great city, the holy [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md),
descending out of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) from God,  

<span id="011">11</span> Having the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of
God: and her light was like unto a [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) most
precious, even like a [jasper](../ebd/ebd198.htm#003.md)
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), clear as
[crystal](../ebd/ebd093.htm#005.md);  

<span id="012">12</span> And had a wall great and high, and had twelve
gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which
are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):  

<span id="013">13</span> On the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) three
gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the
west three gates.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the wall of the city had twelve
foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the
[Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And he that talked with me had a golden
[reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000.md) to measure the city, and the gates
thereof, and the wall thereof.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the city lieth foursquare, and the length
is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the
[reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000.md), twelve thousand furlongs. The length and
the breadth and the height of it are equal.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred
and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is,
of the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And the building of the wall of it was of
[jasper](../ebd/ebd198.htm#003.md): and the city was pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), like unto clear glass.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the foundations of the wall of the city
were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation
was [jasper](../ebd/ebd198.htm#003.md); the second,
[sapphire](../ebd/ebd322.htm#002.md); the third, a
[chalcedony](../ebd/ebd075.htm#009.md); the fourth, an
[emerald](../ebd/ebd119.htm#007.md);  

<span id="020">20</span> The fifth, [sardonyx](../ebd/ebd322.htm#007.md);
the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth,
[beryl](../ebd/ebd053.htm#008.md); the ninth, a
[topaz](../ebd/ebd370.htm#005.md); the tenth, a
[chrysoprasus](../ebd/ebd082.htm#007.md); the eleventh, a
[jacinth](../ebd/ebd194.htm#006.md); the twelfth, an
[amethyst](../ebd/ebd020.htm#002.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every
several [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) was of one
[pearl](../ebd/ebd287.htm#007.md): and the street of the city was pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), as it were transparent glass.  

<span id="022">22</span> And I saw no [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md)
therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the [Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md)
are the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) of it.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the city had no need of the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md), neither of the
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004.md), to shine in it: for the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of God did lighten it, and the
[Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md) is the light thereof.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the nations of them which are saved shall
walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) and honour into it.  

<span id="025">25</span> And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by
day: for there shall be no night there.  

<span id="026">26</span> And they shall bring the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) and honour of the nations into it.  

<span id="027">27</span> And there shall in no
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) enter into it any thing that defileth,
neither whatsoever worketh [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md), or
maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.
