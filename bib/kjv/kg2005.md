### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Now [Naaman](../ebd/ebd263.htm#009.md), captain of
the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md), was a great man with his master, and
honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md): he was also a mighty man in valour, but
he was a leper.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and
had brought away [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001.md) out of the land of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) a little maid; and she waited on
Naaman's wife.  

<span id="003">3</span> And she said unto her mistress, Would God my
lord were with the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) that is in
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md)! for he would recover him of his
[leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus
and thus said the maid that is of the land of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md) said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter
unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md). And he departed, and took with him ten
talents of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and six thousand
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and
ten changes of raiment.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he brought the letter to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith
sent [Naaman](../ebd/ebd263.htm#009.md) my servant to thee, that thou
mayest recover him of his [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And it came to pass, when the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) had
read the letter, that he [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) his clothes, and
said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto
me to recover a man of his [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md)? wherefore
consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.  

<span id="008">8</span> And it was so, when
[Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) the man of God had heard that the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) had
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) his clothes, that he sent to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), saying, Wherefore hast thou
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) thy clothes? let him come now to me, and
he shall know that there is a [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> So [Naaman](../ebd/ebd263.htm#009.md) came with his
horses and with his [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md), and stood at the
door of the house of [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) sent a
[messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005.md) unto him, saying, Go and wash in
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times,
and thy [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) shall come again to thee, and
thou shalt be [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> But [Naaman](../ebd/ebd263.htm#009.md) was wroth,
and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to
me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his
hand over the place, and recover the leper.  

<span id="012">12</span> Are not [Abana](../ebd/ebd000.htm#005.md) and
[Pharpar](../ebd/ebd292.htm#009.md), rivers of
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md), better than all the waters of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)? may I not wash in them, and be
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md)? So he turned and went away in a rage.  

<span id="013">13</span> And his servants came near, and spake unto him,
and said, My father, if the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) had bid
thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much
rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md)?  

<span id="014">14</span> Then went he down, and dipped himself
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) times in [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md),
according to the saying of the man of God: and his
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) came again like unto the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of a little child, and he was
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And he returned to the man of God, he and all
his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I
know that there is no God in all the earth, but in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): now therefore, I pray thee, take a
blessing of thy servant.  

<span id="016">16</span> But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I
stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he
refused.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Naaman](../ebd/ebd263.htm#009.md) said, Shall
there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules'
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md) of earth? for thy servant will
henceforth offer neither burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) nor
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) unto other gods, but unto the LORD.  

<span id="018">18</span> In this thing the LORD
[pardon](../ebd/ebd285.htm#001.md) thy servant, that when my master goeth
into the house of [Rimmon](../ebd/ebd313.htm#005.md) to
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) myself in the house of
[Rimmon](../ebd/ebd313.htm#005): when I [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md)
down myself in the house of [Rimmon](../ebd/ebd313.htm#005.md), the LORD
[pardon](../ebd/ebd285.htm#001.md) thy servant in this thing.  

<span id="019">19</span> And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he
departed from him a little way.  

<span id="020">20</span> But [Gehazi](../ebd/ebd145.htm#004.md), the
servant of [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) the man of God, said, Behold,
my master hath spared [Naaman](../ebd/ebd263.htm#009.md) this Syrian, in
not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD
liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.  

<span id="021">21</span> So [Gehazi](../ebd/ebd145.htm#004.md) followed
after [Naaman](../ebd/ebd263.htm#009.md). And when
[Naaman](../ebd/ebd263.htm#009.md) saw him running after him, he lighted
down from the [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md) to meet him, and said, Is
all well?  

<span id="022">22</span> And he said, All is well. My master hath sent
me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) two
young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a
[talent](../ebd/ebd357.htm#009) of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and
two changes of garments.  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Naaman](../ebd/ebd263.htm#009.md) said, Be
content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) in two bags, with two changes of
garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them
before him.  

<span id="024">24</span> And when he came to the tower, he took them
from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go,
and they departed.  

<span id="025">25</span> But he went in, and stood before his master.
And [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) said unto him, Whence comest thou,
[Gehazi](../ebd/ebd145.htm#004.md)? And he said, Thy servant went no
whither.  

<span id="026">26</span> And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with
thee, when the man turned again from his
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md) to meet thee? Is it a time to receive
money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), and oxen, and menservants, and
maidservants?  

<span id="027">27</span> The [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md) therefore
of [Naaman](../ebd/ebd263.htm#009.md) shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy
seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as
[snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000.md).
