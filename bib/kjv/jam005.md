### King James Version: James Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your
miseries that shall come upon you.  

<span id="002">2</span> Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are
motheaten.  

<span id="003">3</span> Your [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) and
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) is cankered; and the rust of them shall
be a [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) against you, and shall eat your
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure
together for the last days.  

<span id="004">4</span> Behold, the hire of the labourers who have
reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and
the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the
Lord of [sabaoth](../ebd/ebd317.htm#002.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been
wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.  

<span id="006">6</span> Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he
doth not resist you.  

<span id="007">7</span> Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming
of the Lord. Behold, the [husbandman](../ebd/ebd185.htm#002.md) waiteth for
the precious [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of the earth, and hath long
patience for it, until he receive the early and latter
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for
the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.  

<span id="009">9</span> Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest
ye be condemned: behold, the [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) standeth
before the door.  

<span id="010">10</span> Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have
spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction,
and of patience.  

<span id="011">11</span> Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye
have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord;
that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> But above all things, my brethren, swear not,
neither by [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), neither by the earth,
neither by any other [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md): but let your yea be
yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.  

<span id="013">13</span> Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is
any merry? let him sing [psalms](../ebd/ebd301.htm#005.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> Is any sick among you? let him call for the
elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil
in the name of the Lord:  

<span id="015">15</span> And the [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) of
faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he
have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.  

<span id="016">16</span> Confess your faults one to another, and pray
one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) of a righteous man availeth much.  

<span id="017">17</span> [Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002.md) was a man
subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it
might not [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md): and it rained not on the earth
by the space of three years and six months.  

<span id="018">18</span> And he prayed again, and the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) gave [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md), and
the earth brought forth her [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth,
and one convert him;  

<span id="020">20</span> Let him know, that he which converteth the
sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall
hide a multitude of sins.
