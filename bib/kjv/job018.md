### King James Version: Job Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> Then answered [Bildad](../ebd/ebd058.htm#006.md)
the [Shuhite](../ebd/ebd341.htm#008.md), and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> How long will it be ere ye make an end of words?
mark, and afterwards we will speak.  

<span id="003">3</span> Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed
vile in your sight?  

<span id="004">4</span> He teareth himself in his
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md): shall the earth be forsaken for thee?
and shall the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md) be removed out of his
place?  

<span id="005">5</span> Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out,
and the spark of his fire shall not shine.  

<span id="006">6</span> The light shall be dark in his
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), and his
[candle](../ebd/ebd071.htm#000.md) shall be put out with him.  

<span id="007">7</span> The steps of his strength shall be straitened,
and his own counsel shall cast him down.  

<span id="008">8</span> For he is cast into a
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002.md) by his own feet, and he walketh upon a
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> The [gin](../ebd/ebd149.htm#004.md) shall take him
by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.  

<span id="010">10</span> The [snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009.md) is laid for
him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.  

<span id="011">11</span> Terrors shall make him afraid on every side,
and shall drive him to his feet.  

<span id="012">12</span> His strength shall be hungerbitten, and
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md) shall be ready at his side.  

<span id="013">13</span> It shall devour the strength of his skin: even
the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.  

<span id="014">14</span> His confidence shall be rooted out of his
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), and it shall bring him to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of terrors.  

<span id="015">15</span> It shall dwell in his
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), because it is none of his:
[brimstone](../ebd/ebd065.htm#005.md) shall be scattered upon his
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above
shall his [branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002.md) be cut off.  

<span id="017">17</span> His remembrance shall perish from the earth,
and he shall have no name in the street.  

<span id="018">18</span> He shall be driven from light into
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), and chased out of the world.  

<span id="019">19</span> He shall neither have son nor nephew among his
people, nor any remaining in his [dwellings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#001.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> They that come after him shall be astonied at
his day, as they that went before were affrighted.  

<span id="021">21</span> Surely such are the
[dwellings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#001.md) of the wicked, and this is the place
of him that knoweth not God.
