### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass after these things, that God
did tempt [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), and said unto him,
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005): and he said, Behold, here I am.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006), whom thou lovest, and get thee into the
land of [Moriah](../ebd/ebd259.htm#009); and offer him there for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) upon one of the mountains which I will
tell thee of.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) rose up
early in the morning, and saddled his [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001), and
took two of his young men with him, and [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006)
his son, and clave the [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) for the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and rose up, and went unto the place
of which God had told him.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then on the third day
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) lifted up his eyes, and saw the place
afar off.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) said unto
his young men, Abide ye here with the [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001); and
I and the lad will go yonder and [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002), and
come again to you.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) took the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) of the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and laid it upon
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006) his son; and he took the fire in his
hand, and a [knife](../ebd/ebd221.htm#007); and they went both of them
together.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006) spake unto
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) his father, and said, My father: and he
said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003): but where is the
[lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003) for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001)?  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) said, My
son, God will provide himself a [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003) for a
burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001): so they went both of them
together.  

<span id="009">9</span> And they came to the place which God had told
him of; and [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) built an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) there, and laid the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) in order, and bound
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006) his son, and laid him on the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) upon the [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003).  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) stretched
forth his hand, and took the [knife](../ebd/ebd221.htm#007) to slay his
son.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the
LORD called unto him out of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and said,
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005): and
he said, Here am I.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad,
neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest
God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) lifted up
his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003) caught in a thicket by his horns: and
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) went and took the
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003), and offered him up for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) in the stead of his son.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) called the
name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) of the LORD it shall be seen.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the
LORD called unto [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) out of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) the second time,  

<span id="016">16</span> And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the
LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy
son, thine only son:  

<span id="017">17</span> That in blessing I will
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) thee, and in multiplying I will multiply
thy seed as the [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008) of the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and as the sand which is upon the sea
shore; and thy seed shall possess the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of
his enemies;  

<span id="018">18</span> And in thy seed shall all the nations of the
earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.  

<span id="019">19</span> So [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) returned
unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to
[Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008); and [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005)
dwelt at [Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008).  

<span id="020">20</span> And it came to pass after these things, that it
was told [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), saying, Behold, Milcah, she
hath also born children unto thy brother
[Nahor](../ebd/ebd265.htm#006);  

<span id="021">21</span> Huz his firstborn, and
[Buz](../ebd/ebd067.htm#003) his brother, and
[Kemuel](../ebd/ebd217.htm#001) the father of
[Aram](../ebd/ebd028.htm#001),  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Chesed](../ebd/ebd079.htm#005), and
[Hazo](../ebd/ebd169.htm#005), and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and
[Bethuel](../ebd/ebd057.htm#003).  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Bethuel](../ebd/ebd057.htm#003) begat
[Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001): these eight Milcah did bear to
[Nahor](../ebd/ebd265.htm#006), Abraham's brother.  

<span id="024">24</span> And his [concubine](../ebd/ebd087.htm#007),
whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and
[Thahash](../ebd/ebd363.htm#002), and
[Maachah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#004).
