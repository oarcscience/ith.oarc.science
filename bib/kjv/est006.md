### King James Version: Esther Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> On that night could not the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) sleep, and he commanded to bring the book
of records of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003); and they were
read before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="002">2</span> And it was found written, that
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005) had told of Bigthana and
[Teresh](../ebd/ebd362.htm#004), two of the king's chamberlains, the
keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003).  

<span id="003">3</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said, What
honour and dignity hath been done to [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005)
for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There
is nothing done for him.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said, Who
is in the court? Now [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) was come into the
outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) to hang [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005)
on the [gallows](../ebd/ebd142.htm#005) that he had prepared for him.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the king's servants said unto him, Behold,
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) standeth in the court. And the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said, Let him come in.  

<span id="006">6</span> So [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) came in. And
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said unto him, What shall be done unto
the man whom the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) delighteth to honour? Now
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) thought in his heart, To whom would the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) delight to do honour more than to
myself?  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) answered the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), For the man whom the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) delighteth to honour,  

<span id="008">8</span> Let the royal [apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000)
be brought which the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) useth to wear, and
the horse that the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) rideth upon, and the
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) royal which is set upon his head:  

<span id="009">9</span> And let this [apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000)
and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble
princes, that they may array the man withal whom the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) delighteth to honour, and bring him on
horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus
shall it be done to the man whom the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
delighteth to honour.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said to
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004), Make haste, and take the
[apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000) and the horse, as thou hast said, and
do even so to [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005) the
[Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004), that sitteth at the king's
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008): let nothing fail of all that thou hast
spoken.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then took [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) the
[apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000) and the horse, and arrayed
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005), and brought him on horseback through
the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done
unto the man whom the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) delighteth to
honour.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005) came
again to the king's [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008). But
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) hasted to his house mourning, and having
his head covered.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) told
[Zeresh](../ebd/ebd391.htm#006) his wife and all his friends every thing
that had befallen him. Then said his [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) men
and [Zeresh](../ebd/ebd391.htm#006) his wife unto him, If
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005) be of the seed of the Jews, before
whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but
shalt surely fall before him.  

<span id="014">14</span> And while they were yet talking with him, came
the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) unto the [banquet](../ebd/ebd043.htm#006)
that [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) had prepared.
