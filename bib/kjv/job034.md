### King James Version: Job Chapter 34

<span id="001">1</span> Furthermore [Elihu](../ebd/ebd116.htm#008.md)
answered and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> Hear my words, O ye
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) men; and give [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md)
unto me, ye that have knowledge.  

<span id="003">3</span> For the [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) trieth
words, as the mouth tasteth meat.  

<span id="004">4</span> Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among
ourselves what is good.  

<span id="005">5</span> For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath
taken away my judgment.  

<span id="006">6</span> Should I lie against my right? my wound is
incurable without transgression.  

<span id="007">7</span> What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning
like water?  

<span id="008">8</span> Which goeth in company with the workers of
iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.  

<span id="009">9</span> For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing
that he should delight himself with God.  

<span id="010">10</span> Therefore hearken unto me ye men of
understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and
from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.  

<span id="011">11</span> For the work of a man shall he render unto him,
and cause every man to find according to his ways.  

<span id="012">12</span> Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither
will the Almighty pervert judgment.  

<span id="013">13</span> Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or
who hath disposed the whole world?  

<span id="014">14</span> If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto
himself his [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) and his breath;  

<span id="015">15</span> All [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) shall perish
together, and man shall turn again unto [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> If now thou hast understanding, hear this:
hearken to the voice of my words.  

<span id="017">17</span> Shall even he that hateth right govern? and
wilt thou condemn him that is most just?  

<span id="018">18</span> Is it fit to say to a
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are
ungodly?  

<span id="019">19</span> How much less to him that accepteth not the
persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md)? for they all are the work of his hands.  

<span id="020">20</span> In a moment shall they die, and the people
shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be
taken away without hand.  

<span id="021">21</span> For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he
seeth all his goings.  

<span id="022">22</span> There is no [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md),
nor [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) of death, where the workers of
iniquity may hide themselves.  

<span id="023">23</span> For he will not lay upon man more than right;
that he should enter into judgment with God.  

<span id="024">24</span> He shall break in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md) mighty men without number, and set
others in their stead.  

<span id="025">25</span> Therefore he knoweth their works, and he
overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.  

<span id="026">26</span> He striketh them as wicked men in the open
sight of others;  

<span id="027">27</span> Because they turned back from him, and would
not consider any of his ways:  

<span id="028">28</span> So that they cause the cry of the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) to come unto him, and he heareth the cry
of the afflicted.  

<span id="029">29</span> When he giveth quietness, who then can make
trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether
it be done against a nation, or against a man only:  

<span id="030">30</span> That the [hypocrite](../ebd/ebd185.htm#006.md)
reign not, lest the people be ensnared.  

<span id="031">31</span> Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have
borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:  

<span id="032">32</span> That which I see not teach thou me: if I have
done iniquity, I will do no more.  

<span id="033">33</span> Should it be according to thy mind? he will
recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I:
therefore speak what thou knowest.  

<span id="034">34</span> Let men of understanding tell me, and let a
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) man hearken unto me.  

<span id="035">35</span> Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his
words were without wisdom.  

<span id="036">36</span> My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end
because of his answers for wicked men.  

<span id="037">37</span> For he addeth rebellion unto his
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), he clappeth his hands among us, and
multiplieth his words against God.
