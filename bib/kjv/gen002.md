### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> Thus the heavens and the earth were finished,
and all the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of them.  

<span id="002">2</span> And on the seventh day God ended his work which
he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he
had made.  

<span id="003">3</span> And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified
it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created
and made.  

<span id="004">4</span> These are the generations of the heavens and of
the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the
earth and the heavens,  

<span id="005">5</span> And every plant of the field before it was in
the earth, and every [herb](../ebd/ebd174.htm#008.md) of the field before
it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) upon the earth, and there was not a man to
till the ground.  

<span id="006">6</span> But there went up a mist from the earth, and
watered the whole face of the ground.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the LORD God formed man of the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) of the ground, and breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in
[Eden](../ebd/ebd112.htm#009.md); and there he put the man whom he had
formed.  

<span id="009">9</span> And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow
every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of
life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good
and evil.  

<span id="010">10</span> And a river went out of
[Eden](../ebd/ebd112.htm#009.md) to water the garden; and from thence it
was parted, and became into four heads.  

<span id="011">11</span> The name of the first is
[Pison](../ebd/ebd296.htm#006.md): that is it which compasseth the whole
land of [Havilah](../ebd/ebd167.htm#009.md), where there is
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md);  

<span id="012">12</span> And the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) of that
land is good: there is [bdellium](../ebd/ebd048.htm#003.md) and the
[onyx](../ebd/ebd279.htm#004) [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And the name of the second river is
[Gihon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#007.md): the same is it that compasseth the whole
land of [Ethiopia](../ebd/ebd126.htm#005.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And the name of the third river is
[Hiddekel](../ebd/ebd177.htm#009.md): that is it which goeth toward the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md). And
the fourth river is [Euphrates](../ebd/ebd127.htm#001.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And the LORD God took the man, and put him into
the garden of [Eden](../ebd/ebd112.htm#009.md) to
[dress](../ebd/ebd107.htm#008.md) it and to keep it.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of
every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:  

<span id="017">17</span> But of the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof
thou shalt surely die.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the LORD God said, It is not good that the
man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.  

<span id="019">19</span> And out of the ground the LORD God formed every
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) of the field, and every fowl of the air;
and brought them unto [Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007.md) to see what he would
call them: and whatsoever [Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007.md) called every
living [creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004.md), that was the name thereof.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007.md) gave names to
all [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), and to the fowl of the air, and to
every [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) of the field; but for
[Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007.md) there was not found an help meet for
him.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the LORD God caused a
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) sleep to fall upon
[Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007.md), and he slept: and he took one of his
ribs, and closed up the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) instead
thereof;  

<span id="022">22</span> And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from
man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007.md) said, This is
now bone of my bones, and [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of my
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md): she shall be called Woman, because she
was taken out of Man.  

<span id="024">24</span> Therefore shall a man leave his father and his
mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> And they were both
[naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003.md), the man and his wife, and were not
ashamed.
