### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 35

<span id="001">1</span> Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive
with me: fight against them that fight against me.  

<span id="002">2</span> Take hold of [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001) and
[buckler](../ebd/ebd066.htm#000), and stand up for mine help.  

<span id="003">3</span> Draw out also the spear, and stop the way
against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003).  

<span id="004">4</span> Let them be confounded and put to shame that
seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion
that devise my hurt.  

<span id="005">5</span> Let them be as [chaff](../ebd/ebd075.htm#007)
before the wind: and let the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the LORD
chase them.  

<span id="006">6</span> Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the LORD persecute them.  

<span id="007">7</span> For without cause have they hid for me their
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002) in a [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007), which
without cause they have digged for my soul.  

<span id="008">8</span> Let [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) come
upon him at unawares; and let his [net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002) that he
hath hid catch himself: into that very
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) let him fall.  

<span id="009">9</span> And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it
shall rejoice in his [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003).  

<span id="010">10</span> All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto
thee, which deliverest the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) from him that
is too strong for him, yea, the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) and the
needy from him that spoileth him?  

<span id="011">11</span> False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my
charge things that I knew not.  

<span id="012">12</span> They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling
of my soul.  

<span id="013">13</span> But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing
was [sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001): I humbled my soul with fasting;
and my [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) returned into mine own
[bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008).  

<span id="014">14</span> I behaved myself as though he had been my
friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his
mother.  

<span id="015">15</span> But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and
gathered themselves together: yea, the [abjects](../ebd/ebd005.htm#000)
gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did
tear me, and ceased not:  

<span id="016">16</span> With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they
gnashed upon me with their teeth.  

<span id="017">17</span> Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my
soul from their destructions, my [darling](../ebd/ebd098.htm#000) from
the [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001).  

<span id="018">18</span> I will give thee thanks in the great
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004): I will praise thee among much
people.  

<span id="019">19</span> Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully
rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without
a cause.  

<span id="020">20</span> For they speak not peace: but they devise
deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.  

<span id="021">21</span> Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me,
and said, [Aha](../ebd/ebd013.htm#001), [aha](../ebd/ebd013.htm#001),
our eye hath seen it.  

<span id="022">22</span> This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence:
O Lord, be not far from me.  

<span id="023">23</span> Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even
unto my cause, my God and my Lord.  

<span id="024">24</span> [Judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) me, O LORD my
God, according to thy [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004); and let
them not rejoice over me.  

<span id="025">25</span> Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would
we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.  

<span id="026">26</span> Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion
together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and
dishonour that magnify themselves against me.  

<span id="027">27</span> Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that
favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD
be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.  

<span id="028">28</span> And my tongue shall speak of thy
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) and of thy praise all the day
long.
