### King James Version: 2 Thessalonians Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of
our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000),
and by our gathering together unto him,  

<span id="002">2</span> That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be
troubled, neither by [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), nor by word, nor
by letter as from us, as that the day of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)
is at hand.  

<span id="003">3</span> Let no man deceive you by any means: for that
day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man
of [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) be revealed, the son of perdition;  

<span id="004">4</span> Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that
is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of God, shewing himself that he is
God.  

<span id="005">5</span> Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you,
I told you these things?  

<span id="006">6</span> And now ye know what withholdeth that he might
be revealed in his time.  

<span id="007">7</span> For the [mystery](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006) of
iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he
be taken out of the way.  

<span id="008">8</span> And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the
Lord shall consume with the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of his
mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:  

<span id="009">9</span> Even him, whose coming is after the working of
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000) with all power and signs and lying
wonders,  

<span id="010">10</span> And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness
in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth,
that they might be saved.  

<span id="011">11</span> And for this cause God shall send them strong
delusion, that they should believe a lie:  

<span id="012">12</span> That they all might be damned who believed not
the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.  

<span id="013">13</span> But we are bound to give thanks alway to God
for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the
beginning [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) you to
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) through
[sanctification](../ebd/ebd321.htm#004) of the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) and belief of the truth:  

<span id="014">14</span> Whereunto he called you by our
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003), to the obtaining of the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="015">15</span> Therefore, brethren, stand
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004), and hold the traditions which ye have
been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.  

<span id="016">16</span> Now our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) himself, and God, even our Father, which
hath loved us, and hath given us [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007)
consolation and good hope through [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000),  

<span id="017">17</span> Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every
good word and work.
