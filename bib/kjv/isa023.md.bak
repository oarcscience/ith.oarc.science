### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 23

<span id="001">1</span> The [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md) of
[Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001). Howl, ye [ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003.md)
of [Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002.md); for it is laid waste, so that
there is no house, no entering in: from the land of
[Chittim](../ebd/ebd081.htm#003.md) it is revealed to them.  

<span id="002">2</span> Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom
the merchants of [Zidon](../ebd/ebd393.htm#000.md), that pass over the sea,
have replenished.  

<span id="003">3</span> And by great waters the seed of
[Sihor](../ebd/ebd343.htm#003), the [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md) of
the river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.  

<span id="004">4</span> Be thou ashamed, O
[Zidon](../ebd/ebd393.htm#000.md): for the sea hath spoken, even the
strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children,
neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins.  

<span id="005">5</span> As at the report concerning
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), so shall they be sorely pained at the
report of [Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Pass ye over to
[Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002.md); howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.  

<span id="007">7</span> Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of
ancient days? her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.  

<span id="008">8</span> Who hath taken this counsel against
[Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001.md), the crowning city, whose merchants are
princes, whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth?  

<span id="009">9</span> The LORD of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the
pride of all [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), and to bring into contempt
all the honourable of the earth.  

<span id="010">10</span> Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of
[Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002.md): there is no more strength.  

<span id="011">11</span> He stretched out his hand over the sea, he
shook the kingdoms: the LORD hath given a commandment against the
[merchant](../ebd/ebd249.htm#003.md) city, to destroy the strong holds
thereof.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou
oppressed [virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009.md), daughter of
[Zidon](../ebd/ebd393.htm#000.md): arise, pass over to
[Chittim](../ebd/ebd081.htm#003.md); there also shalt thou have no rest.  

<span id="013">13</span> Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people
was not, till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md): they set up the
[towers](../ebd/ebd371.htm#002.md) thereof, they raised up the palaces
thereof; and he brought it to ruin.  

<span id="014">14</span> Howl, ye [ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003.md) of
[Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002.md): for your strength is laid waste.  

<span id="015">15</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that
[Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001.md) shall be forgotten seventy years,
according to the days of one [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md): after the
end of seventy years shall [Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001.md) sing as an
[harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> Take an [harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001.md), go about
the city, thou [harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005.md) that hast been forgotten;
make sweet melody, sing many [songs](../ebd/ebd348.htm#002.md), that thou
mayest be remembered.  

<span id="017">17</span> And it shall come to pass after the end of
seventy years, that the LORD will visit [Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001.md),
and she shall turn to her hire, and shall commit
[fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008.md) with all the kingdoms of the world
upon the face of the earth.  

<span id="018">18</span> And her merchandise and her hire shall be
[holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md) to the LORD: it shall not be treasured
nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the
LORD, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.
