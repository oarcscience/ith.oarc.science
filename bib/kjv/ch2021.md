### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> Now [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) slept
with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004). And [Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005) his
son reigned in his stead.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he had brethren the sons of
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006), [Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005),
and [Jehiel](../ebd/ebd200.htm#003), and
[Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006), and
[Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005), and [Michael](../ebd/ebd252.htm#009),
and [Shephatiah](../ebd/ebd335.htm#005): all these were the sons of
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="003">3</span> And their father gave them great gifts of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001),
and of precious things, with fenced cities in
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007): but the kingdom gave he to
[Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005); because he was the firstborn.  

<span id="004">4</span> Now when [Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005) was
risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew
all his brethren with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and divers
also of the princes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="005">5</span> [Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005) was thirty and
two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="006">6</span> And he walked in the way of the kings of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), like as did the house of
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002): for he had the daughter of
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) to wife: and he wrought that which was
evil in the eyes of the LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), because of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) that he had made with
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and as he promised to give a light to
him and to his sons for ever.  

<span id="008">8</span> In his days the Edomites revolted from under the
dominion of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and made themselves a
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="009">9</span> Then [Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005) went forth
with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by
night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains
of the chariots.  

<span id="010">10</span> So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) unto this day. The same time also did
[Libnah](../ebd/ebd228.htm#004) revolt from under his hand; because he
had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.  

<span id="011">11</span> Moreover he made high places in the mountains
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and caused the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) to commit
[fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008), and compelled
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) thereto.  

<span id="012">12</span> And there came a
[writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005) to him from
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008),
saying, Thus saith the LORD God of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) thy
father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) thy father, nor in the ways of
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007),  

<span id="013">13</span> But hast walked in the way of the kings of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and hast made
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) to go a whoring, like to the
whoredoms of the house of [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002), and also hast
slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better than
thyself:  

<span id="014">14</span> Behold, with a great
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) will the LORD smite thy people, and thy
children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:  

<span id="015">15</span> And thou shalt have great sickness by disease
of thy [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004), until thy
[bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004) fall out by reason of the sickness day
by day.  

<span id="016">16</span> Moreover the LORD stirred up against
[Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005) the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of
the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), and of the Arabians, that were
near the Ethiopians:  

<span id="017">17</span> And they came up into
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and brake into it, and carried away all
the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and
his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save
[Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006), the youngest of his sons.  

<span id="018">18</span> And after all this the LORD smote him in his
[bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004) with an incurable disease.  

<span id="019">19</span> And it came to pass, that in process of time,
after the end of two years, his [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004) fell out
by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people
made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.  

<span id="020">20</span> Thirty and two years old was he when he began
to reign, and he reigned in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) eight
years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in
the city of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), but not in the sepulchres of
the kings.
