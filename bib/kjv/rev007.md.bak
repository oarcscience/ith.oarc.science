### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> And after these things I saw four angels
standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four
[winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009.md) of the earth, that the wind should not
blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.  

<span id="002">2</span> And I saw another [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md)
ascending from the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md), having the
[seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002.md) of the living God: and he cried with a
loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth
and the sea,  

<span id="003">3</span> Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor
the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their
foreheads.  

<span id="004">4</span> And I heard the number of them which were
sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of
all the tribes of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
[Juda](../ebd/ebd212.htm#006.md) were sealed twelve thousand. Of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009.md) were
sealed twelve thousand. Of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md) were sealed twelve thousand.  

<span id="006">6</span> Of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of Aser
were sealed twelve thousand. Of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of Manasses were sealed twelve
thousand.  

<span id="007">7</span> Of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
[Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002.md) were sealed twelve thousand. Of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006.md) were
sealed twelve thousand. Of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
[Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002.md) were sealed twelve thousand.  

<span id="008">8</span> Of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
[Zabulon](../ebd/ebd386.htm#001.md) were sealed twelve thousand. Of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) were
sealed twelve thousand. Of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md) were sealed twelve thousand.  

<span id="009">9</span> After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude,
which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and
tongues, stood before the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), and before
the [Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md), clothed with white robes, and palms
in their hands;  

<span id="010">10</span> And cried with a loud voice, saying,
[Salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) to our God which sitteth upon the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), and unto the
[Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And all the angels stood round about the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), and about the elders and the four
beasts, and fell before the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) on their
faces, and worshipped God,  

<span id="012">12</span> Saying, [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md):
Blessing, and [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), and wisdom, and
thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever
and ever. [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And one of the elders answered, saying unto me,
What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?  

<span id="014">14</span> And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he
said to me, These are they which came out of great
[tribulation](../ebd/ebd372.htm#005.md), and have washed their robes, and
made them white in the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of the
[Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> Therefore are they before the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of God, and serve him day and night in
his [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md): and he that sitteth on the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) shall dwell among them.  

<span id="016">16</span> They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any
more; neither shall the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) light on them, nor
any heat.  

<span id="017">17</span> For the [Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md) which is
in the midst of the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) shall feed them, and
shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away
all tears from their eyes.
