### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 34

<span id="001">1</span> [Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) was eight years
old when he began to reign, and he reigned in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) one and thirty years.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he did that which was right in the sight of
the LORD, and walked in the ways of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) his
father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left.  

<span id="003">3</span> For in the eighth year of his reign, while he
was yet young, he began to seek after the God of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) his father: and in the twelfth year he
began to purge [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) from the high places, and the groves,
and the carved images, and the molten images.  

<span id="004">4</span> And they brake down the altars of
[Baalim](../ebd/ebd039.htm#007) in his presence; and the images, that
were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved
images, and the molten images, he brake in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002), and made [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008)
of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto
them.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their
altars, and cleansed [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="006">6</span> And so did he in the cities of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002), and [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000),
and [Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002), even unto
[Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006), with their mattocks round about.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when he had broken down the altars and the
groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all
the idols throughout all the land of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), he
returned to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="008">8</span> Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he
had purged the land, and the house, he sent
[Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004) the son of Azaliah, and
[Maaseiah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#007) the governor of the city, and
[Joah](../ebd/ebd207.htm#007) the son of [Joahaz](../ebd/ebd207.htm#008)
the [recorder](../ebd/ebd308.htm#005), to repair the house of the LORD
his God.  

<span id="009">9</span> And when they came to
[Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006) the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), they delivered the money that was
brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009) had gathered of the hand of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) and [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000),
and of all the remnant of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and of all
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008);
and they returned to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="010">10</span> And they put it in the hand of the workmen that
had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the
workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the
house:  

<span id="011">11</span> Even to the artificers and builders gave they
it, to buy hewn [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), and timber for
couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) had destroyed.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the men did the work faithfully: and the
overseers of them were [Jahath](../ebd/ebd195.htm#004) and
[Obadiah](../ebd/ebd276.htm#001), the Levites, of the sons of
[Merari](../ebd/ebd249.htm#000); and [Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006)
and [Meshullam](../ebd/ebd251.htm#001), of the sons of the
[Kohathites](../ebd/ebd222.htm#002), to set it forward; and other of the
Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick.  

<span id="013">13</span> Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and
were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service:
and of the Levites there were [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003), and
officers, and porters.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when they brought out the money that was
brought into the house of the LORD, [Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) found a book of the law of the LORD
given by [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003).  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006) answered
and said to [Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004) the scribe, I have found
the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And
[Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006) delivered the book to
[Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004).  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004) carried
the book to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and brought the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) word back again, saying, All that was
committed to thy servants, they do it.  

<span id="017">17</span> And they have gathered together the money that
was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand
of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then [Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004) the
scribe told the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), saying,
[Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003)
hath given me a book. And [Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004) read it
before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="019">19</span> And it came to pass, when the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) had heard the words of the law, that he
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007) his clothes.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) commanded
[Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006), and [Ahikam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#001)
the son of [Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004), and
[Abdon](../ebd/ebd001.htm#002) the son of
[Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005), and [Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004) the
scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,  

<span id="021">21</span> Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them
that are left in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and in
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), concerning the words of the book that is
found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us,
because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all
that is written in this book.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006), and they
that the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) had appointed, went to
[Huldah](../ebd/ebd184.htm#005) the prophetess, the wife of
[Shallum](../ebd/ebd330.htm#008) the son of Tikvath, the son of
[Hasrah](../ebd/ebd166.htm#008), keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt
in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) in the college:) and they spake to
her to that effect.  

<span id="023">23</span> And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Tell ye the man that sent you to
me,  

<span id="024">24</span> Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil
upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses
that are written in the book which they have read before the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007):  

<span id="025">25</span> Because they have forsaken me, and have burned
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) unto other gods, that they might
provoke me to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) with all the works of their
hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall
not be quenched.  

<span id="026">26</span> And as for the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so
shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) concerning the words which thou hast
heard;  

<span id="027">27</span> Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst
humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this
place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before
me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard
thee also, saith the LORD.  

<span id="028">28</span> Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and
thou shalt be gathered to thy [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008) in peace,
neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this
place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) word again.  

<span id="029">29</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) sent and
gathered together all the elders of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="030">30</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) went up
into the house of the LORD, and all the men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and the priests, and the Levites,
and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the
words of the book of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) that was
found in the house of the LORD.  

<span id="031">31</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) stood in
his place, and made a [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) before the LORD,
to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his
testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his
soul, to perform the words of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008)
which are written in this book.  

<span id="032">32</span> And he caused all that were present in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) and [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008)
to stand to it. And the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) did according to the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of God, the God of their fathers.  

<span id="033">33</span> And [Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) took away
all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and made all that were
present in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to serve, even to serve the
LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from following the
LORD, the God of their fathers.
