### King James Version: Luke Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> And he said also unto his disciples, There was a
certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him
that he had wasted his goods.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he called him, and said unto him, How is it
that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou
mayest be no longer steward.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then the steward said within himself, What shall
I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to
[beg](../ebd/ebd051.htm#001) I am ashamed.  

<span id="004">4</span> I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put
out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.  

<span id="005">5</span> So he called every one of his lord's debtors
unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?  

<span id="006">6</span> And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he
said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then said he to another, And how much owest
thou? And he said, An hundred measures of
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000). And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and
write fourscore.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the lord commended the unjust steward,
because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) wiser than the children of light.  

<span id="009">9</span> And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends
of the [mammon](../ebd/ebd239.htm#007) of unrighteousness; that, when ye
fail, they may receive you into [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007)
habitations.  

<span id="010">10</span> He that is [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) in
that which is least is [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) also in much:
and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.  

<span id="011">11</span> If therefore ye have not been
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) in the unrighteous
[mammon](../ebd/ebd239.htm#007), who will commit to your trust the true
riches?  

<span id="012">12</span> And if ye have not been
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) in that which is another man's, who
shall give you that which is your own?  

<span id="013">13</span> No servant can serve two masters: for either he
will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one,
and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and
[mammon](../ebd/ebd239.htm#007).  

<span id="014">14</span> And the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008)
also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he said unto them, Ye are they which
justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that
which is highly esteemed among men is
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) in the sight of God.  

<span id="016">16</span> The law and the prophets were until John: since
that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into
it.  

<span id="017">17</span> And it is easier for
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) and earth to pass, than one
[tittle](../ebd/ebd368.htm#006) of the law to fail.  

<span id="018">18</span> Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth
another, committeth [adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009): and whosoever
marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009).  

<span id="019">19</span> There was a certain rich man, which was clothed
in purple and fine [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), and fared sumptuously
every day:  

<span id="020">20</span> And there was a certain beggar named
[Lazarus](../ebd/ebd225.htm#003), which was laid at his
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), full of sores,  

<span id="021">21</span> And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which
fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his
sores.  

<span id="022">22</span> And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and
was carried by the angels into Abraham's [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008):
the rich man also died, and was buried;  

<span id="023">23</span> And in [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003) he lift up
his eyes, being in torments, and seeth [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005)
afar off, and [Lazarus](../ebd/ebd225.htm#003) in his
[bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008).  

<span id="024">24</span> And he cried and said, Father
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) on
me, and send [Lazarus](../ebd/ebd225.htm#003), that he may dip the tip
of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this
flame.  

<span id="025">25</span> But [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) said, Son,
remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and
likewise [Lazarus](../ebd/ebd225.htm#003) evil things: but now he is
comforted, and thou art tormented.  

<span id="026">26</span> And beside all this, between us and you there
is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you
cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.  

<span id="027">27</span> Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father,
that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:  

<span id="028">28</span> For I have five brethren; that he may testify
unto them, lest they also come into this place of
[torment](../ebd/ebd370.htm#009).  

<span id="029">29</span> [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) saith unto
him, They have [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and the prophets; let them
hear them.  

<span id="030">30</span> And he said, Nay, father
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005): but if one went unto them from the
dead, they will repent.  

<span id="031">31</span> And he said unto him, If they hear not
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and the prophets, neither will they be
persuaded, though one rose from the dead.
