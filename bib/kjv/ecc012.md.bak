### King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy
youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou
shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;  

<span id="002">2</span> While the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md), or the
light, or the [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004.md), or the
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md), be not darkened, nor the clouds return
after the [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md):  

<span id="003">3</span> In the day when the keepers of the house shall
tremble, and the strong men shall [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md)
themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that
look out of the windows be darkened,  

<span id="004">4</span> And the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) shall be
shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall
rise up at the voice of the [bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000.md), and all the
daughters of musick shall be brought low;  

<span id="005">5</span> Also when they shall be afraid of that which is
high, and fears shall be in the way, and the
[almond](../ebd/ebd018.htm#001.md) tree shall flourish, and the
[grasshopper](../ebd/ebd154.htm#006.md) shall be a
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md), and desire shall fail: because man
goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:  

<span id="006">6</span> Or ever the [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md)
[cord](../ebd/ebd090.htm#000.md) be loosed, or the golden
[bowl](../ebd/ebd063.htm#006.md) be broken, or the
[pitcher](../ebd/ebd296.htm#009.md) be broken at the
[fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000), or the [wheel](../ebd/ebd381.htm#001.md)
broken at the [cistern](../ebd/ebd083.htm#008.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Then shall the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md)
return to the earth as it was: and the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md)
shall return unto God who gave it.  

<span id="008">8</span> Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is
vanity.  

<span id="009">9</span> And moreover, because the preacher was
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md), he still taught the people knowledge;
yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many
proverbs.  

<span id="010">10</span> The preacher sought to find out acceptable
words: and that which was written was upright, even words of truth.  

<span id="011">11</span> The words of the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md)
are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which
are given from one [shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And further, by these, my son, be admonished:
of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of
the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter:
Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of
man.  

<span id="014">14</span> For God shall bring every work into judgment,
with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.
