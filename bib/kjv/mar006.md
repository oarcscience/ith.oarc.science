### King James Version: Mark Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> And he went out from thence, and came into his
own country; and his disciples follow him.  

<span id="002">2</span> And when the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md)
day was come, he began to teach in the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009.md): and many hearing him were
astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what
wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are
wrought by his hands?  

<span id="003">3</span> Is not this the
[carpenter](../ebd/ebd072.htm#009.md), the son of
[Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md), the brother of
[James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md), and Joses, and of
[Juda](../ebd/ebd212.htm#006), and [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md)? and
are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.  

<span id="004">4</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), said unto
them, A [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) is not without honour, but in
his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he could there do no mighty work, save that
he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And
he went round about the [villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md), teaching.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he called unto him the twelve, and began to
send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean
spirits;  

<span id="008">8</span> And commanded them that they should take nothing
for their [journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md), save a staff only; no
[scrip](../ebd/ebd324.htm#004), no [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), no
money in their [purse](../ebd/ebd302.htm#008.md):  

<span id="009">9</span> But be shod with
[sandals](../ebd/ebd321.htm#006.md); and not put on two coats.  

<span id="010">10</span> And he said unto them, In what place soever ye
enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.  

<span id="011">11</span> And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear
you, when ye depart thence, shake off the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md)
under your feet for a [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md) against them.
Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for
[Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004.md) and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than
for that city.  

<span id="012">12</span> And they went out, and preached that men should
repent.  

<span id="013">13</span> And they cast out many devils, and anointed
with oil many that were sick, and healed them.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) Herod heard
of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the
Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew
forth themselves in him.  

<span id="015">15</span> Others said, That it is
[Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002.md). And others said, That it is a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md), or as one of the prophets.  

<span id="016">16</span> But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is
John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.  

<span id="017">17</span> For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold
upon John, and bound him in [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md) for
Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.  

<span id="018">18</span> For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful
for thee to have thy brother's wife.  

<span id="019">19</span> Therefore [Herodias](../ebd/ebd176.htm#006.md) had
a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:  

<span id="020">20</span> For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a
just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did
many things, and heard him gladly.  

<span id="021">21</span> And when a convenient day was come, that Herod
on his birthday made a [supper](../ebd/ebd353.htm#004.md) to his lords,
high captains, and chief estates of [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md);  

<span id="022">22</span> And when the daughter of the said
[Herodias](../ebd/ebd176.htm#006.md) came in, and danced, and pleased Herod
and them that sat with him, the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said unto
the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.  

<span id="023">23</span> And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt
ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.  

<span id="024">24</span> And she went forth, and said unto her mother,
What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.  

<span id="025">25</span> And she came in straightway with haste unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and asked, saying, I will that thou give
me by and by in a [charger](../ebd/ebd077.htm#007.md) the head of John the
Baptist.  

<span id="026">26</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) was
exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat
with him, he would not reject her.  

<span id="027">27</span> And immediately the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) sent an
[executioner](../ebd/ebd128.htm#002.md), and commanded his head to be
brought: and he went and beheaded him in the
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md),  

<span id="028">28</span> And brought his head in a
[charger](../ebd/ebd077.htm#007.md), and gave it to the damsel: and the
damsel gave it to her mother.  

<span id="029">29</span> And when his disciples heard of it, they came
and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.  

<span id="030">30</span> And the apostles gathered themselves together
unto [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), and told him all things, both what
they had done, and what they had taught.  

<span id="031">31</span> And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart
into a [desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000.md) place, and rest a while: for
there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to
eat.  

<span id="032">32</span> And they departed into a
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000.md) place by ship privately.  

<span id="033">33</span> And the people saw them departing, and many
knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and
came together unto him.  

<span id="034">34</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), when he
came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them,
because they were as [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) not having a
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006.md): and he began to teach them many
things.  

<span id="035">35</span> And when the day was now far spent, his
disciples came unto him, and said, This is a
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000.md) place, and now the time is far passed:  

<span id="036">36</span> Send them away, that they may go into the
country round about, and into the [villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md), and
buy themselves [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md): for they have nothing to
eat.  

<span id="037">37</span> He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to
eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth
of [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), and give them to eat?  

<span id="038">38</span> He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go
and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.  

<span id="039">39</span> And he commanded them to make all sit down by
companies upon the green [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md).  

<span id="040">40</span> And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by
fifties.  

<span id="041">41</span> And when he had taken the five loaves and the
two fishes, he looked up to [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and
blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set
before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.  

<span id="042">42</span> And they did all eat, and were filled.  

<span id="043">43</span> And they took up twelve baskets full of the
fragments, and of the fishes.  

<span id="044">44</span> And they that did eat of the loaves were about
five thousand men.  

<span id="045">45</span> And straightway he constrained his disciples to
get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto
[Bethsaida](../ebd/ebd056.htm#009.md), while he sent away the people.  

<span id="046">46</span> And when he had sent them away, he departed
into a mountain to pray.  

<span id="047">47</span> And when even was come, the ship was in the
midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.  

<span id="048">48</span> And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind
was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he
cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.  

<span id="049">49</span> But when they saw him walking upon the sea,
they supposed it had been a [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), and cried
out:  

<span id="050">50</span> For they all saw him, and were troubled. And
immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer:
it is I; be not afraid.  

<span id="051">51</span> And he went up unto them into the ship; and the
wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and
wondered.  

<span id="052">52</span> For they considered not the
[miracle](../ebd/ebd256.htm#002.md) of the loaves: for their heart was
hardened.  

<span id="053">53</span> And when they had passed over, they came into
the land of [Gennesaret](../ebd/ebd146.htm#000.md), and drew to the
shore.  

<span id="054">54</span> And when they were come out of the ship,
straightway they knew him,  

<span id="055">55</span> And ran through that whole region round about,
and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard
he was.  

<span id="056">56</span> And whithersoever he entered, into
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md), or cities, or country, they laid the
sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were
but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made
whole.
