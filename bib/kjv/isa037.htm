<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Incline thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see: and hear all the words of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd327.htm#005">Sennacherib</A>, which hath sent to reproach the living God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Of a truth, LORD, the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</A> have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,<BR>
