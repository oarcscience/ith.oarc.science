### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice,
saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even
every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.  

<span id="002">2</span> And, behold, six men came from the way of the
higher [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), which lieth toward the north, and
every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was
clothed with [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), with a writer's
[inkhorn](../ebd/ebd188.htm#005) by his side: and they went in, and
stood beside the brasen [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006).  

<span id="003">3</span> And the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the
God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) was gone up from the
[cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003), whereupon he was, to the
[threshold](../ebd/ebd365.htm#000) of the house. And he called to the
man clothed with [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), which had the writer's
[inkhorn](../ebd/ebd188.htm#005) by his side;  

<span id="004">4</span> And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst
of the city, through the midst of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),
and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for
all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.  

<span id="005">5</span> And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye
after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither
have ye pity:  

<span id="006">6</span> Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and
little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the
mark; and begin at my [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005). Then they
began at the ancient men which were before the house.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he said unto them, Defile the house, and
fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and
slew in the city.  

<span id="008">8</span> And it came to pass, while they were slaying
them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah
Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy all the residue of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in thy pouring out of thy
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) upon [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005)?  

<span id="009">9</span> Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) is
exceeding great, and the land is full of [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000),
and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath forsaken
the earth, and the LORD seeth not.  

<span id="010">10</span> And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare,
neither will I have pity, but I will recompense their way upon their
head.  

<span id="011">11</span> And, behold, the man clothed with
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), which had the
[inkhorn](../ebd/ebd188.htm#005) by his side, reported the matter,
saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.
