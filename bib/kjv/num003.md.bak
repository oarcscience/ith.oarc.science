### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> These also are the generations of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) and [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) in the
day that the LORD spake with [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) in
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And these are the names of the sons of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001); [Nadab](../ebd/ebd264.htm#008.md) the
firstborn, and [Abihu](../ebd/ebd003.htm#004.md),
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000.md), and
[Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> These are the names of the sons of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), the priests which were anointed, whom he
consecrated to [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) in the priest's
office.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Nadab](../ebd/ebd264.htm#008.md) and
[Abihu](../ebd/ebd003.htm#004.md) died before the LORD, when they offered
strange fire before the LORD, in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md)
of [Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009.md), and they had no children: and
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) and [Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005.md)
ministered in the priest's office in the sight of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) their father.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="006">6</span> Bring the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006.md) near, and present them before
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), that
they may [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) unto him.  

<span id="007">7</span> And they shall keep his charge, and the charge
of the whole [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) before the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), to do the service of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And they shall keep all the instruments of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), and the charge of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), to do the service of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And thou shalt give the Levites unto
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and to his sons: they are wholly given
unto him out of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And thou shalt appoint
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and his sons, and they shall wait on
their priest's office: and the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) that
cometh nigh shall be put to death.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="012">12</span> And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from
among the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) instead of all the
firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): therefore the Levites shall be mine;  

<span id="013">13</span> Because all the firstborn are mine; for on the
day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), both man and
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md): mine shall they be: I am the LORD.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009.md),
saying,  

<span id="015">15</span> Number the children of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006.md) after the house of their fathers, by their
families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number
them.
