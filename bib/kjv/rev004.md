### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> After this I looked, and, behold, a door was
opened in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md): and the first voice which I
heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up
hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.  

<span id="002">2</span> And immediately I was in the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md): and, behold, a
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) was set in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and one sat on the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And he that sat was to look upon like a
[jasper](../ebd/ebd198.htm#003.md) and a sardine
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md): and there was a
[rainbow](../ebd/ebd305.htm#009.md) round about the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), in sight like unto an
[emerald](../ebd/ebd119.htm#007.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And round about the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) were four and twenty seats: and upon the
seats I saw four and twenty elders [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md),
clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And out of the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md)
proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) lamps of fire burning before the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), which are the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) Spirits of God.  

<span id="006">6</span> And before the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md)
there was a sea of glass like unto [crystal](../ebd/ebd093.htm#005.md): and
in the midst of the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), and round about the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), were four beasts full of eyes before
and behind.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the first [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) was
like a lion, and the second [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) like a
[calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004.md), and the third
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) had a face as a man, and the fourth
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) was like a flying
[eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And the four beasts had each of them six wings
about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and
night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is,
and is to come.  

<span id="009">9</span> And when those beasts give
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) and honour and thanks to him that sat on
the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), who liveth for ever and ever,  

<span id="010">10</span> The four and twenty elders fall down before him
that sat on the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), and
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) him that liveth for ever and ever, and
cast their crowns before the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), saying,  

<span id="011">11</span> Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) and honour and power: for thou hast
created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.
