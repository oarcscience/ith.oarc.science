</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">Bless</A> the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Who redeemeth thy life from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;The LORD executeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> and judgment for all that are oppressed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;He made known his ways unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, his acts unto the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, and plenteous in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;He will not always chide: neither will he keep his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> is high above the earth, so great is his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> toward them that fear him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;As far as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;As for man, his days are as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A>: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> of the LORD is from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> upon them that fear him, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> unto children's children;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;To such as keep his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The LORD hath prepared his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">Bless</A> the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">Bless</A> the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> the LORD, O my soul.<BR>
