### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Again, thou shalt say to the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), Whosoever he be of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), or of the strangers that sojourn in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), that giveth any of his seed unto
Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) him with stones.  

<span id="003">3</span> And I will set my face against that man, and
will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his
seed unto Molech, to defile my [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md), and
to profane my holy name.  

<span id="004">4</span> And if the people of the land do any ways hide
their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and
kill him not:  

<span id="005">5</span> Then I will set my face against that man, and
against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring
after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the soul that turneth after such as have
familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will
even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his
people.  

<span id="007">7</span> Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy:
for I am the LORD your God.  

<span id="008">8</span> And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am
the LORD which sanctify you.  

<span id="009">9</span> For every one that curseth his father or his
mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his
mother; his [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) shall be upon him.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the man that committeth
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009.md) with another man's wife, even he that
committeth [adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009.md) with his neighbour's wife,
the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the man that lieth with his father's wife
hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put
to death; their [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) shall be upon them.  

<span id="012">12</span> And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both
of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) shall be upon them.  

<span id="013">13</span> If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth
with a woman, both of them have committed an
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md): they shall surely be put to death;
their [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) shall be upon them.  

<span id="014">14</span> And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is
wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there
be no wickedness among you.  

<span id="015">15</span> And if a man lie with a
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md), he shall surely be put to death: and ye
shall slay the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And if a woman approach unto any
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md), and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill
the woman, and the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md): they shall surely be
put to death; their [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) shall be upon them.  

<span id="017">17</span> And if a man shall take his sister, his
father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and
she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off
in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness;
he shall bear his iniquity.  

<span id="018">18</span> And if a man shall lie with a woman having her
sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her
[fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md), and she hath uncovered the
[fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000) of her [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md):
and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.  

<span id="019">19</span> And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy
mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near
kin: they shall bear their iniquity.  

<span id="020">20</span> And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife,
he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md); they shall die childless.  

<span id="021">21</span> And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it
is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they
shall be childless.  

<span id="022">22</span> Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and
all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to
dwell therein, spue you not out.  

<span id="023">23</span> And ye shall not walk in the manners of the
nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these
things, and therefore I abhorred them.  

<span id="024">24</span> But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit
their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that
floweth with [milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000.md) and
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md): I am the LORD your God, which have
separated you from other people.  

<span id="025">25</span> Ye shall therefore put difference between
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) beasts and unclean, and between unclean
fowls and [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md): and ye shall not make your
souls abominable by [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md), or by fowl, or by
any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have
separated from you as unclean.  

<span id="026">26</span> And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am
holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.  

<span id="027">27</span> A man also or woman that hath a familiar
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), or that is a
[wizard](../ebd/ebd383.htm#000.md), shall surely be put to death: they
shall [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) them with stones: their
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) shall be upon them.
