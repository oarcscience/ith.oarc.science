### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye
shall not cut yourselves, nor make any [baldness](../ebd/ebd042.htm#008)
between your eyes for the dead.  

<span id="002">2</span> For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy
God, and the LORD hath [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) thee to be a
[peculiar](../ebd/ebd287.htm#008) people unto himself, above all the
nations that are upon the earth.  

<span id="003">3</span> Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.  

<span id="004">4</span> These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007), the [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), and the
[goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001),  

<span id="005">5</span> The [hart](../ebd/ebd165.htm#004), and the
roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild
[goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001), and the [pygarg](../ebd/ebd303.htm#001),
and the wild [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007), and the
[chamois](../ebd/ebd076.htm#007).  

<span id="006">6</span> And every [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) that
parteth the [hoof](../ebd/ebd181.htm#003), and cleaveth the cleft into
two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall eat.  

<span id="007">7</span> Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that
chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven
[hoof](../ebd/ebd181.htm#003); as the [camel](../ebd/ebd070.htm#000),
and the [hare](../ebd/ebd163.htm#009), and the
[coney](../ebd/ebd088.htm#000): for they chew the cud, but divide not
the [hoof](../ebd/ebd181.htm#003); therefore they are unclean unto
you.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the [swine](../ebd/ebd354.htm#002), because
it divideth the [hoof](../ebd/ebd181.htm#003), yet cheweth not the cud,
it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), nor touch their dead
[carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004).  

<span id="009">9</span> These ye shall eat of all that are in the
waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat:  

<span id="010">10</span> And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may
not eat; it is unclean unto you.  

<span id="011">11</span> Of all [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) birds ye
shall eat.  

<span id="012">12</span> But these are they of which ye shall not eat:
the [eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003), and the
[ossifrage](../ebd/ebd281.htm#000), and the ospray,  

<span id="013">13</span> And the [glede](../ebd/ebd150.htm#004), and the
[kite](../ebd/ebd221.htm#001), and the [vulture](../ebd/ebd378.htm#002)
after his kind,  

<span id="014">14</span> And every [raven](../ebd/ebd307.htm#008) after
his kind,  

<span id="015">15</span> And the [owl](../ebd/ebd281.htm#006), and the
night [hawk](../ebd/ebd168.htm#001), and the cuckow, and the
[hawk](../ebd/ebd168.htm#001) after his kind,  

<span id="016">16</span> The little [owl](../ebd/ebd281.htm#006), and
the great [owl](../ebd/ebd281.htm#006), and the
[swan](../ebd/ebd354.htm#000),  

<span id="017">17</span> And the pelican, and the gier
[eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003), and the
[cormorant](../ebd/ebd090.htm#005),  

<span id="018">18</span> And the [stork](../ebd/ebd351.htm#007), and the
[heron](../ebd/ebd176.htm#008) after her kind, and the
[lapwing](../ebd/ebd224.htm#003), and the
[bat](../ebd/ebd047.htm#002).  

<span id="019">19</span> And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean
unto you: they shall not be eaten.  

<span id="020">20</span> But of all [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) fowls
ye may eat.  

<span id="021">21</span> Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of
itself: thou shalt give it unto the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009)
that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an
[alien](../ebd/ebd017.htm#003): for thou art an holy people unto the
LORD thy God. Thou shalt not [seethe](../ebd/ebd326.htm#001) a kid in
his mother's [milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000).  

<span id="022">22</span> Thou shalt truly [tithe](../ebd/ebd368.htm#005)
all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by
year.  

<span id="023">23</span> And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in
the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the
[tithe](../ebd/ebd368.htm#005) of thy [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006), of
thy [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), and of thine oil, and the firstlings
of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD
thy God always.  

<span id="024">24</span> And if the way be too long for thee, so that
thou art not able to carry it; or if the place be too far from thee,
which the LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD
thy God hath blessed thee:  

<span id="025">25</span> Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up
the money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy
God shall choose:  

<span id="026">26</span> And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever
thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005),
or for [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), or for strong
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and
thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice,
thou, and thine household,  

<span id="027">27</span> And the [Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009) that is
within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no part nor
inheritance with thee.  

<span id="028">28</span> At the end of three years thou shalt bring
forth all the [tithe](../ebd/ebd368.htm#005) of thine increase the same
year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates:  

<span id="029">29</span> And the [Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009),
(because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,) and the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), and the fatherless, and the widow,
which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied;
that the LORD thy God may [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) thee in all the
work of thine hand which thou doest.
