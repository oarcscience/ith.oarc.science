<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 9</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</A> by all that is before them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A>, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;This is an evil among all things that are done under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#002">madness</A> is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Also their love, and their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</A>, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Go thy way, eat thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> with joy, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A>, whither thou goest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;I returned, and saw under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</A>, and as the birds that are caught in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</A>; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;This wisdom have I seen also under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>, and it seemed great unto me:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> against it, and besieged it, and built great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#005">bulwarks</A> against it:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Now there was found in it a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;The words of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good.<BR>
