### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 60

<span id="001">1</span> O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast
scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.  

<span id="002">2</span> Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast
broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.  

<span id="003">3</span> Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou
hast made us to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) the
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) of astonishment.  

<span id="004">4</span> Thou hast given a
[banner](../ebd/ebd043.htm#005.md) to them that fear thee, that it may be
displayed because of the truth. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy
right hand, and hear me.  

<span id="006">6</span> God hath spoken in his
[holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md); I will rejoice, I will divide
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md), and mete out the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [Succoth](../ebd/ebd352.htm#008.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md) is mine, and
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) is mine;
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) also is the strength of mine head;
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) is my lawgiver;  

<span id="008">8</span> [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) is my washpot;
over [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md) will I cast out my
[shoe](../ebd/ebd340.htm#009): [Philistia](../ebd/ebd294.htm#001.md),
triumph thou because of me.  

<span id="009">9</span> Who will bring me into the strong city? who will
lead me into [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md)?  

<span id="010">10</span> Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off?
and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies?  

<span id="011">11</span> Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help
of man.  

<span id="012">12</span> Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is
that shall tread down our enemies.
