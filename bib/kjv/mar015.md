### King James Version: Mark Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> And straightway in the morning the chief priests
held a consultation with the elders and [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003)
and the whole [council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004), and bound
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), and carried him away, and delivered him
to Pilate.  

<span id="002">2</span> And Pilate asked him, Art thou the
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the Jews? And he answering said unto
them, Thou sayest it.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the chief priests accused him of many
things: but he answered nothing.  

<span id="004">4</span> And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest
thou nothing? behold how many things they
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) against thee.  

<span id="005">5</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) yet answered
nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.  

<span id="006">6</span> Now at that [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) he
released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.  

<span id="007">7</span> And there was one named
[Barabbas](../ebd/ebd044.htm#002), which lay bound with them that had
made insurrection with him, who had committed
[murder](../ebd/ebd262.htm#002) in the insurrection.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the multitude crying aloud began to desire
him to do as he had ever done unto them.  

<span id="009">9</span> But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I
release unto you the [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the Jews?  

<span id="010">10</span> For he knew that the chief priests had
delivered him for envy.  

<span id="011">11</span> But the chief priests moved the people, that he
should rather release [Barabbas](../ebd/ebd044.htm#002) unto them.  

<span id="012">12</span> And Pilate answered and said again unto them,
What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the Jews?  

<span id="013">13</span> And they cried out again, Crucify him.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath
he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.  

<span id="015">15</span> And so Pilate, willing to content the people,
released [Barabbas](../ebd/ebd044.htm#002) unto them, and delivered
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), when he had scourged him, to be
crucified.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the soldiers led him away into the hall,
called [Praetorium](../ebd/ebd299.htm#009); and they call together the
whole band.  

<span id="017">17</span> And they clothed him with purple, and platted a
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of thorns, and put it about his head,  

<span id="018">18</span> And began to salute him,
[Hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002), [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the
Jews!  

<span id="019">19</span> And they smote him on the head with a
[reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000), and did spit upon him, and
[bowing](../ebd/ebd063.htm#005) their knees worshipped him.  

<span id="020">20</span> And when they had mocked him, they took off the
purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to
crucify him.  

<span id="021">21</span> And they compel one
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004) a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of
the country, the father of [Alexander](../ebd/ebd016.htm#009) and
[Rufus](../ebd/ebd316.htm#004), to bear his
[cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000).  

<span id="022">22</span> And they bring him unto the place
[Golgotha](../ebd/ebd152.htm#004), which is, being interpreted, The
place of a skull.  

<span id="023">23</span> And they gave him to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) mingled
with [myrrh](../ebd/ebd263.htm#003): but he received it not.  

<span id="024">24</span> And when they had crucified him, they parted
his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.  

<span id="025">25</span> And it was the third hour, and they crucified
him.  

<span id="026">26</span> And the superscription of his accusation was
written over, THE [KING](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) OF THE JEWS.  

<span id="027">27</span> And with him they crucify two thieves; the one
on his right hand, and the other on his left.  

<span id="028">28</span> And the [scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005) was
fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.  

<span id="029">29</span> And they that passed by railed on him, wagging
their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), and buildest it in three days,  

<span id="030">30</span> Save thyself, and come down from the
[cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000).  

<span id="031">31</span> Likewise also the chief priests mocking said
among themselves with the [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003), He saved
others; himself he cannot save.  

<span id="032">32</span> Let [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) the
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) descend
now from the [cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000), that we may see and
believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.  

<span id="033">33</span> And when the sixth hour was come, there was
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) over the whole land until the ninth
hour.  

<span id="034">34</span> And at the ninth hour
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi,
Eloi, [lama](../ebd/ebd223.htm#002)
[sabachthani](../ebd/ebd317.htm#001)? which is, being interpreted, My
God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  

<span id="035">35</span> And some of them that stood by, when they heard
it, said, Behold, he calleth [Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002).  

<span id="036">36</span> And one ran and filled a spunge full of
[vinegar](../ebd/ebd377.htm#006), and put it on a
[reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000), and gave him to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), saying, Let alone; let us see whether
[Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002) will come to take him down.  

<span id="037">37</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) cried with a
loud voice, and gave up the [ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005).  

<span id="038">38</span> And the [veil](../ebd/ebd377.htm#001) of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) was [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007) in
twain from the top to the bottom.  

<span id="039">39</span> And when the
[centurion](../ebd/ebd075.htm#004), which stood over against him, saw
that he so cried out, and gave up the [ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005), he
said, Truly this man was the Son of God.  

<span id="040">40</span> There were also women looking on afar off:
among whom was [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009)
[Magdalene](../ebd/ebd236.htm#005), and [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009)
the mother of [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007) the less and of Joses, and
[Salome](../ebd/ebd319.htm#007);  

<span id="041">41</span> (Who also, when he was in
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008), followed him, and ministered unto
him;) and many other women which came up with him unto
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="042">42</span> And now when the even was come, because it was
the preparation, that is, the day before the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003),  

<span id="043">43</span> [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) of Arimathaea,
an honourable [counsellor](../ebd/ebd091.htm#005), which also waited for
the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the
body of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="044">44</span> And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead:
and [calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007) unto him the
[centurion](../ebd/ebd075.htm#004), he asked him whether he had been any
while dead.  

<span id="045">45</span> And when he knew it of the
[centurion](../ebd/ebd075.htm#004), he gave the body to
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005).  

<span id="046">46</span> And he bought fine
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), and took him down, and wrapped him in
the [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), and laid him in a
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001) which was hewn out of a
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001), and rolled a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) unto the door of the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001).  

<span id="047">47</span> And [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009)
[Magdalene](../ebd/ebd236.htm#005) and [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009) the
mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.
