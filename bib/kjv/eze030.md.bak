### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 30

<span id="001">1</span> The word of the LORD came again unto me,
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the
Lord GOD; Howl ye, Woe worth the day!  

<span id="003">3</span> For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is
near, a cloudy day; it shall be the time of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) shall
come upon [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and great pain shall be in
[Ethiopia](../ebd/ebd126.htm#005.md), when the slain shall fall in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and they shall take away her multitude,
and her foundations shall be broken down.  

<span id="005">5</span> [Ethiopia](../ebd/ebd126.htm#005.md), and
[Libya](../ebd/ebd228.htm#006), and [Lydia](../ebd/ebd234.htm#000.md), and
all the mingled people, and [Chub](../ebd/ebd082.htm#008.md), and the men
of the land that is in [league](../ebd/ebd225.htm#005.md), shall fall with
them by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Thus saith the LORD; They also that uphold
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) shall fall; and the pride of her power
shall come down: from the tower of [Syene](../ebd/ebd354.htm#008.md) shall
they fall in it by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), saith the Lord
GOD.  

<span id="007">7</span> And they shall be desolate in the midst of the
countries that are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the
cities that are wasted.  

<span id="008">8</span> And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I
have set a fire in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and when all her
helpers shall be destroyed.  

<span id="009">9</span> In that day shall messengers go forth from me in
[ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003.md) to make the careless Ethiopians afraid,
and great pain shall come upon them, as in the day of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): for, lo, it cometh.  

<span id="010">10</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also make the
multitude of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) to cease by the hand of
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> He and his people with him, the terrible of the
nations, shall be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their
swords against [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and fill the land with
the slain.  

<span id="012">12</span> And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the
land into the hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and
all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I the LORD have spoken
it.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also destroy
the idols, and I will cause their images to cease out of
[Noph](../ebd/ebd274.htm#009.md); and there shall be no more a
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): and I will put a fear in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And I will make
[Pathros](../ebd/ebd286.htm#007.md) desolate, and will set fire in
[Zoan](../ebd/ebd395.htm#003.md), and will execute judgments in No.  

<span id="015">15</span> And I will pour my
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) upon [Sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), the
strength of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md); and I will cut off the
multitude of No.  

<span id="016">16</span> And I will set fire in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009): [Sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) shall have
great pain, and No shall be [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) asunder, and
[Noph](../ebd/ebd274.htm#009.md) shall have distresses daily.  

<span id="017">17</span> The young men of [Aven](../ebd/ebd036.htm#009.md)
and of Pibeseth shall fall by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md): and
these cities shall go into [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened,
when I shall break there the yokes of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md):
and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her: as for her, a
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md) shall cover her, and her daughters shall
go into [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> Thus will I execute judgments in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): and they shall know that I am the
LORD.  

<span id="020">20</span> And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in
the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of the
LORD came unto me, saying,  

<span id="021">21</span> Son of man, I have broken the arm of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md); and, lo, it shall not be bound up to be
healed, to put a roller to bind it, to make it strong to hold the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am
against [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and will break his arms, the strong,
and that which was broken; and I will cause the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) to fall out of his hand.  

<span id="023">23</span> And I will scatter the Egyptians among the
nations, and will disperse them through the countries.  

<span id="024">24</span> And I will strengthen the arms of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), and
put my [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) in his hand: but I will break
Pharaoh's arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a
deadly wounded man.  

<span id="025">25</span> But I will strengthen the arms of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), and
the arms of [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) shall fall down; and they
shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall put my
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) into the hand of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), and
he shall stretch it out upon the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And I will scatter the Egyptians among the
nations, and disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that
I am the LORD.
