### King James Version: Galatians Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Now I say, That the
[heir](../ebd/ebd171.htm#007), as long as he is a child, differeth
nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;  

<span id="002">2</span> But is under tutors and governors until the time
appointed of the father.  

<span id="003">3</span> Even so we, when we were children, were in
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002) under the
[elements](../ebd/ebd115.htm#004) of the world:  

<span id="004">4</span> But when the [fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007) of
the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under
the law,  

<span id="005">5</span> To redeem them that were under the law, that we
might receive the [adoption](../ebd/ebd010.htm#000) of sons.  

<span id="006">6</span> And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of his Son into your hearts, crying,
[Abba](../ebd/ebd000.htm#007), Father.  

<span id="007">7</span> Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son;
and if a son, then an [heir](../ebd/ebd171.htm#007) of God through
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="008">8</span> Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did
service unto them which by nature are no gods.  

<span id="009">9</span> But now, after that ye have known God, or rather
are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly
[elements](../ebd/ebd115.htm#004), whereunto ye desire again to be in
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002)?  

<span id="010">10</span> Ye observe days, and months, and times, and
years.  

<span id="011">11</span> I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon
you labour in vain.  

<span id="012">12</span> Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am
as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.  

<span id="013">13</span> Ye know how through infirmity of the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) I preached the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) unto you at the first.  

<span id="014">14</span> And my [temptation](../ebd/ebd361.htm#008)
which was in my [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) ye despised not, nor
rejected; but received me as an [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of God,
even as [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="015">15</span> Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for
I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked
out your own eyes, and have given them to me.  

<span id="016">16</span> Am I therefore become your enemy, because I
tell you the truth?  

<span id="017">17</span> They zealously affect you, but not well; yea,
they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.  

<span id="018">18</span> But it is good to be zealously affected always
in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.  

<span id="019">19</span> My little children, of whom I travail in
[birth](../ebd/ebd059.htm#002) again until
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) be formed in you,  

<span id="020">20</span> I desire to be present with you now, and to
change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.  

<span id="021">21</span> Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do
ye not hear the law?  

<span id="022">22</span> For it is written, that
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) had two sons, the one by a bondmaid,
the other by a freewoman.  

<span id="023">23</span> But he who was of the bondwoman was born after
the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007); but he of the freewoman was by
promise.  

<span id="024">24</span> Which things are an
[allegory](../ebd/ebd017.htm#004): for these are the two covenants; the
one from the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009), which gendereth to
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002), which is Agar.  

<span id="025">25</span> For this Agar is [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009) in [Arabia](../ebd/ebd027.htm#009), and
answereth to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) which now is, and is in
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002) with her children.  

<span id="026">26</span> But [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) which is
above is free, which is the mother of us all.  

<span id="027">27</span> For it is written, Rejoice, thou
[barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007) that bearest not; break forth and cry,
thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than
she which hath an husband.  

<span id="028">28</span> Now we, brethren, as
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006) was, are the children of promise.  

<span id="029">29</span> But as then he that was born after the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) persecuted him that was born after the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), even so it is now.  

<span id="030">30</span> Nevertheless what saith the
[scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005)? Cast out the bondwoman and her son:
for the son of the bondwoman shall not be [heir](../ebd/ebd171.htm#007)
with the son of the freewoman.  

<span id="031">31</span> So then, brethren, we are not children of the
bondwoman, but of the free.
