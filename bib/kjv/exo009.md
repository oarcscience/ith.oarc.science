### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> Then the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Go in unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God
of the [Hebrews](../ebd/ebd171.htm#001), Let my people go, that they may
serve me.  

<span id="002">2</span> For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold
them still,  

<span id="003">3</span> Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) which is in the field, upon the horses,
upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005): there shall be a very grievous
[murrain](../ebd/ebd262.htm#004).  

<span id="004">4</span> And the LORD shall sever between the
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and
the [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009):
and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To
morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and
all the [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) died: but of the
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) died not one.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) sent, and,
behold, there was not one of the [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) of the
Israelites dead. And the heart of [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) was
hardened, and he did not let the people go.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001),
Take to you handfuls of [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000) of the
[furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000), and let [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003)
sprinkle it toward the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) in the sight of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005).  

<span id="009">9</span> And it shall become small
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) in all the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and shall be a
[boil](../ebd/ebd061.htm#008) breaking forth with
[blains](../ebd/ebd060.htm#004) upon man, and upon
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), throughout all the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="010">10</span> And they took [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000) of
the [furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000), and stood before
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005); and [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003)
sprinkled it up toward [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006); and it became a
[boil](../ebd/ebd061.htm#008) breaking forth with
[blains](../ebd/ebd060.htm#004) upon man, and upon
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001).  

<span id="011">11</span> And the [magicians](../ebd/ebd236.htm#007)
could not stand before [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) because of the
boils; for the [boil](../ebd/ebd061.htm#008) was upon the
[magicians](../ebd/ebd236.htm#007), and upon all the Egyptians.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the LORD hardened the heart of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), and he hearkened not unto them; as the
LORD had spoken unto [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003).  

<span id="013">13</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Rise up early in the morning, and stand
before [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), and say unto him, Thus saith
the LORD God of the [Hebrews](../ebd/ebd171.htm#001), Let my people go,
that they may serve me.  

<span id="014">14</span> For I will at this time send all my plagues
upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou
mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.  

<span id="015">15</span> For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may
smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off
from the earth.  

<span id="016">16</span> And in very deed for this cause have I raised
thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared
throughout all the earth.  

<span id="017">17</span> As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people,
that thou wilt not let them go?  

<span id="018">18</span> Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause
it to [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) a very grievous
[hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002), such as hath not been in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) since the foundation thereof even until
now.  

<span id="019">19</span> Send therefore now, and gather thy
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002), and all that thou hast in the field;
for upon every man and [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) which shall be
found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the
[hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002) shall come down upon them, and they shall
die.  

<span id="020">20</span> He that feared the word of the LORD among the
servants of [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) made his servants and his
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) flee into the houses:  

<span id="021">21</span> And he that regarded not the word of the LORD
left his servants and his [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) in the
field.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Stretch forth thine hand toward
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), that there may be
[hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002) in all the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), upon man, and upon
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), and upon every
[herb](../ebd/ebd174.htm#008) of the field, throughout the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) stretched
forth his rod toward [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006): and the LORD sent
[thunder](../ebd/ebd365.htm#003) and [hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002), and
the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained
[hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002) upon the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="024">24</span> So there was [hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002), and
fire mingled with the [hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002), very grievous, such
as there was none like it in all the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) since it became a nation.  

<span id="025">25</span> And the [hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002) smote
throughout all the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) all that was
in the field, both man and [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001); and the
[hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002) smote every [herb](../ebd/ebd174.htm#008)
of the field, and brake every tree of the field.  

<span id="026">26</span> Only in the land of
[Goshen](../ebd/ebd153.htm#002), where the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) were, was there no
[hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002).  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) sent, and
called for [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), and said unto them, I have sinned this
time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.  

<span id="028">28</span> Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there
be no more mighty thunderings and [hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002); and I
will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said unto
him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands
unto the LORD; and the [thunder](../ebd/ebd365.htm#003) shall cease,
neither shall there be any more [hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002); that thou
mayest know how that the earth is the LORD's.  

<span id="030">30</span> But as for thee and thy servants, I know that
ye will not yet fear the LORD God.  

<span id="031">31</span> And the [flax](../ebd/ebd135.htm#004) and the
[barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003) was smitten: for the
[barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003) was in the [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004),
and the [flax](../ebd/ebd135.htm#004) was
[bolled](../ebd/ebd061.htm#009).  

<span id="032">32</span> But the [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000) and the
rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up.  

<span id="033">33</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) went out of
the city from [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), and spread abroad his
hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and [hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002)
ceased, and the [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) was not poured upon the
earth.  

<span id="034">34</span> And when [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) saw
that the [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) and the
[hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002) and the thunders were ceased, he sinned
yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.  

<span id="035">35</span> And the heart of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) was hardened, neither would he let the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) go; as the LORD had spoken
by [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003).
