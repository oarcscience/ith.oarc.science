And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</A> his son reigned in his stead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he had brethren the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#003">Jehiel</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#006">Zechariah</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#009">Michael</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#005">Shephatiah</A>: all these were the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And their father gave them great gifts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and of precious things, with fenced cities in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>: but the kingdom gave he to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</A>; because he was the firstborn.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Now when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</A> was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and divers also of the princes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</A> was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he walked in the way of the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, like as did the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A>: for he had the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> to wife: and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, because of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> that he had made with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and made themselves a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</A> went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> unto this day. The same time also did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd228.htm#004">Libnah</A> revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Moreover he made high places in the mountains of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and caused the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> to commit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A>, and compelled <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> thereto.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And there came a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A> to him from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A> thy father, nor in the ways of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But hast walked in the way of the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and hast made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A>, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better than thyself:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Behold, with a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#001">plague</A> will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A>, until thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A> fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Moreover the LORD stirred up against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And they came up into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#006">Jehoahaz</A>, the youngest of his sons.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And after all this the LORD smote him in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A> with an incurable disease.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A> fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> eight years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.<BR>
