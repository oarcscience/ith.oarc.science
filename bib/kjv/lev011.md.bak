### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and to [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md),
saying unto them,  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), saying, These are the beasts which ye
shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.  

<span id="003">3</span> Whatsoever parteth the
[hoof](../ebd/ebd181.htm#003.md), and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud,
among the beasts, that shall ye eat.  

<span id="004">4</span> Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that
chew the cud, or of them that divide the [hoof](../ebd/ebd181.htm#003.md):
as the [camel](../ebd/ebd070.htm#000.md), because he cheweth the cud, but
divideth not the [hoof](../ebd/ebd181.htm#003.md); he is unclean unto
you.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the [coney](../ebd/ebd088.htm#000.md), because
he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the [hoof](../ebd/ebd181.htm#003.md);
he is unclean unto you.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [hare](../ebd/ebd163.htm#009.md), because
he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the [hoof](../ebd/ebd181.htm#003.md);
he is unclean unto you.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [swine](../ebd/ebd354.htm#002.md), though
he divide the [hoof](../ebd/ebd181.htm#003.md), and be clovenfooted, yet he
cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.  

<span id="008">8</span> Of their [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) shall ye
not eat, and their [carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md) shall ye not touch;
they are unclean to you.  

<span id="009">9</span> These shall ye eat of all that are in the
waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and
in the rivers, them shall ye eat.  

<span id="010">10</span> And all that have not fins and scales in the
seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any
living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md) unto you:  

<span id="011">11</span> They shall be even an
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md) unto you; ye shall not eat of their
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), but ye shall have their carcases in
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the
waters, that shall be an [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md) unto
you.  

<span id="013">13</span> And these are they which ye shall have in
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md) among the fowls; they shall not be
eaten, they are an [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md): the
[eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003.md), and the
[ossifrage](../ebd/ebd281.htm#000.md), and the ospray,  

<span id="014">14</span> And the [vulture](../ebd/ebd378.htm#002.md), and
the [kite](../ebd/ebd221.htm#001.md) after his kind;  

<span id="015">15</span> Every [raven](../ebd/ebd307.htm#008.md) after his
kind;  

<span id="016">16</span> And the [owl](../ebd/ebd281.htm#006.md), and the
night [hawk](../ebd/ebd168.htm#001.md), and the cuckow, and the
[hawk](../ebd/ebd168.htm#001.md) after his kind,  

<span id="017">17</span> And the little [owl](../ebd/ebd281.htm#006.md),
and the [cormorant](../ebd/ebd090.htm#005.md), and the great
[owl](../ebd/ebd281.htm#006.md),  

<span id="018">18</span> And the [swan](../ebd/ebd354.htm#000.md), and the
pelican, and the gier [eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003.md),  

<span id="019">19</span> And the [stork](../ebd/ebd351.htm#007.md), the
[heron](../ebd/ebd176.htm#008.md) after her kind, and the
[lapwing](../ebd/ebd224.htm#003.md), and the
[bat](../ebd/ebd047.htm#002.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> All fowls that creep, going upon all four,
shall be an [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md) unto you.  

<span id="021">21</span> Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping
thing that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to
leap withal upon the earth;  

<span id="022">22</span> Even these of them ye may eat; the
[locust](../ebd/ebd231.htm#000.md) after his kind, and the bald
[locust](../ebd/ebd231.htm#000.md) after his kind, and the
[beetle](../ebd/ebd050.htm#009.md) after his kind, and the
[grasshopper](../ebd/ebd154.htm#006.md) after his kind.  

<span id="023">23</span> But all other flying creeping things, which
have four feet, shall be an [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md) unto
you.  

<span id="024">24</span> And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever
toucheth the [carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md) of them shall be unclean
until the even.  

<span id="025">25</span> And whosoever beareth ought of the
[carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md) of them shall wash his clothes, and be
unclean until the even.  

<span id="026">26</span> The carcases of every
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) which divideth the
[hoof](../ebd/ebd181.htm#003.md), and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the
cud, are unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be
unclean.  

<span id="027">27</span> And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all
manner of beasts that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso
toucheth their [carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md) shall be unclean until
the even.  

<span id="028">28</span> And he that beareth the
[carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md) of them shall wash his clothes, and be
unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.  

<span id="029">29</span> These also shall be unclean unto you among the
creeping things that creep upon the earth; the
[weasel](../ebd/ebd380.htm#002), and the [mouse](../ebd/ebd261.htm#005.md),
and the [tortoise](../ebd/ebd371.htm#000.md) after his kind,  

<span id="030">30</span> And the [ferret](../ebd/ebd132.htm#005.md), and
the [chameleon](../ebd/ebd076.htm#006.md), and the
[lizard](../ebd/ebd230.htm#006), and the [snail](../ebd/ebd346.htm#008.md),
and the [mole](../ebd/ebd258.htm#009.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> These are unclean to you among all that creep:
whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the
even.  

<span id="032">32</span> And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are
dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md), or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever
vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it must be put into water, and
it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.  

<span id="033">33</span> And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them
falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.  

<span id="034">34</span> Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which
such water cometh shall be unclean: and all
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) that may be
[drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007.md) in every such vessel shall be unclean.  

<span id="035">35</span> And every thing whereupon any part of their
[carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md) falleth shall be unclean; whether it be
[oven](../ebd/ebd281.htm#005), or [ranges](../ebd/ebd307.htm#004.md) for
pots, they shall be broken down: for they are unclean and shall be
unclean unto you.  

<span id="036">36</span> Nevertheless a
[fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000) or [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md),
wherein there is plenty of water, shall be
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md): but that which toucheth their
[carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md) shall be unclean.  

<span id="037">37</span> And if any part of their
[carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md) fall upon any sowing seed which is to
be sown, it shall be [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md).  

<span id="038">38</span> But if any water be put upon the seed, and any
part of their [carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md) fall thereon, it shall be
unclean unto you.  

<span id="039">39</span> And if any [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md), of
which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the
[carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md) thereof shall be unclean until the
even.  

<span id="040">40</span> And he that eateth of the
[carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md) of it shall wash his clothes, and be
unclean until the even: he also that beareth the
[carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md) of it shall wash his clothes, and be
unclean until the even.  

<span id="041">41</span> And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
earth shall be an [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md); it shall not be
eaten.  

<span id="042">42</span> Whatsoever goeth upon the
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000.md), and whatsoever goeth upon all four, or
whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the
earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md).  

<span id="043">43</span> Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with
any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves
unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.  

<span id="044">44</span> For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore
sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall
ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth
upon the earth.  

<span id="045">45</span> For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of
the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), to be your God: ye shall
therefore be holy, for I am holy.  

<span id="046">46</span> This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl,
and of every living [creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004.md) that moveth in the
waters, and of every [creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004.md) that creepeth
upon the earth:  

<span id="047">47</span> To make a difference between the unclean and
the [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md), and between the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) that may be eaten and the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) that may not be eaten.
