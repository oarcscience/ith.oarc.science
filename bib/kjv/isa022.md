### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> The [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) of the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000). What
aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?  

<span id="002">2</span> Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city,
joyous city: thy slain men are not slain with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), nor dead in battle.  

<span id="003">3</span> All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound
by the archers: all that are found in thee are bound together, which
have fled from far.  

<span id="004">4</span> Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep
bitterly, labour not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the
daughter of my people.  

<span id="005">5</span> For it is a day of trouble, and of treading
down, and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000),
breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Elam](../ebd/ebd114.htm#003) bare the
[quiver](../ebd/ebd304.htm#000) with chariots of men and horsemen, and
[Kir](../ebd/ebd219.htm#007) uncovered the
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001).  

<span id="007">7</span> And it shall come to pass, that thy choicest
valleys shall be full of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves
in array at the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008).  

<span id="008">8</span> And he discovered the covering of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and thou didst look in that day to the
[armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006) of the house of the
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006).  

<span id="009">9</span> Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), that they are many: and ye gathered
together the waters of the lower pool.  

<span id="010">10</span> And ye have numbered the houses of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and the houses have ye broken down
to fortify the wall.  

<span id="011">11</span> Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for
the water of the old pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker
thereof, neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago.  

<span id="012">12</span> And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call
to weeping, and to mourning, and to [baldness](../ebd/ebd042.htm#008),
and to girding with [sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001):  

<span id="013">13</span> And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and
killing [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), [eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006)
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), and drinking
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000): let us eat and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009); for to morrow we shall die.  

<span id="014">14</span> And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of
hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die,
saith the Lord GOD of hosts.  

<span id="015">15</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get thee
unto this treasurer, even unto [Shebna](../ebd/ebd332.htm#009), which is
over the house, and say,  

<span id="016">16</span> What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here,
that thou hast hewed thee out a [sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001) here,
as he that heweth him out a [sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001) on high,
and that graveth an [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007) for himself in a
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001)?  

<span id="017">17</span> Behold, the LORD will carry thee away with a
mighty [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002), and will surely cover thee.  

<span id="018">18</span> He will surely violently turn and toss thee
like a ball into a large country: there shalt thou die, and there the
chariots of thy [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) shall be the shame of thy
lord's house.  

<span id="019">19</span> And I will drive thee from thy station, and
from thy state shall he pull thee down.  

<span id="020">20</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that I
will call my servant [Eliakim](../ebd/ebd116.htm#000) the son of
[Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006):  

<span id="021">21</span> And I will clothe him with thy robe, and
strengthen him with thy [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005), and I will
commit thy government into his hand: and he shall be a father to the
inhabitants of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and to the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="022">22</span> And the [key](../ebd/ebd218.htm#002) of the
house of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) will I lay upon his shoulder; so
he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall
open.  

<span id="023">23</span> And I will fasten him as a
[nail](../ebd/ebd266.htm#000) in a sure place; and he shall be for a
glorious [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) to his father's house.  

<span id="024">24</span> And they shall hang upon him all the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of his father's house, the offspring and
the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even
to all the vessels of flagons.  

<span id="025">25</span> In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the
[nail](../ebd/ebd266.htm#000) that is fastened in the sure place be
removed, and be cut down, and fall; and the
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) that was upon it shall be cut off: for
the LORD hath spoken it.
