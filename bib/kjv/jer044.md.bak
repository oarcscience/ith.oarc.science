### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 44

<span id="001">1</span> The word that came to
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) concerning all the Jews which dwell in
the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), which dwell at
[Migdol](../ebd/ebd254.htm#003.md), and at Tahpanhes, and at
[Noph](../ebd/ebd274.htm#009.md), and in the country of
[Pathros](../ebd/ebd286.htm#007.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); Ye have seen all the evil that I have
brought upon [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and upon all the cities
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md); and, behold, this day they are a
desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,  

<span id="003">3</span> Because of their wickedness which they have
committed to provoke me to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md), in that they
went to burn [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md), and to serve other gods,
whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers.  

<span id="004">4</span> Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the
prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this
abominable thing that I hate.  

<span id="005">5</span> But they hearkened not, nor inclined their
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) to turn from their wickedness, to burn no
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) unto other gods.  

<span id="006">6</span> Wherefore my [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md) and
mine [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) was poured forth, and was kindled in
the cities of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and in the streets of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md); and they are wasted and desolate, as
at this day.  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of
hosts, the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); Wherefore commit ye
this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman,
child and suckling, out of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), to leave you
none to remain;  

<span id="008">8</span> In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works
of your hands, burning [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) unto other gods
in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), whither ye be gone to
dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) and a reproach among all the nations of
the earth?  

<span id="009">9</span> Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your
fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and the wickedness of their wives, and
your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have
committed in the land of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and in the
streets of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md)?  

<span id="010">10</span> They are not humbled even unto this day,
neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that
I set before you and before your fathers.  

<span id="011">11</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); Behold, I will set my face against
you for evil, and to cut off all [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And I will take the remnant of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), that have set their faces to go into the
land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) to sojourn there, and they shall
all be consumed, and fall in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md);
they shall even be consumed by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) and by
the [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md): they shall die, from the least even
unto the greatest, by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) and by the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md): and they shall be an execration, and an
astonishment, and a [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md), and a reproach.  

<span id="013">13</span> For I will punish them that dwell in the land
of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), as I have punished
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), by the [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md),
and by the pestilence:  

<span id="014">14</span> So that none of the remnant of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), which are gone into the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) to sojourn there, shall escape or remain,
that they should return into the land of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md),
to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall
return but such as shall escape.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then all the men which knew that their wives
had burned [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) unto other gods, and all the
women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt
in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), in
[Pathros](../ebd/ebd286.htm#007.md), answered
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md), saying,  

<span id="016">16</span> As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us
in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee.  

<span id="017">17</span> But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth
forth out of our own mouth, to burn [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md)
unto the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and to pour out
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) offerings unto her, as we have done, we,
and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and in the streets of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): for then had we plenty of victuals,
and were well, and saw no evil.  

<span id="018">18</span> But since we left off to burn
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) to the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md)
of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and to pour out
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) offerings unto her, we have wanted all
things, and have been consumed by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) and
by the [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And when we burned
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) to the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md)
of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and poured out
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) offerings unto her, did we make her cakes
to [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) her, and pour out
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) offerings unto her, without our men?  

<span id="020">20</span> Then [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) said
unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people
which had given him that answer, saying,  

<span id="021">21</span> The [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) that ye
burned in the cities of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and in the
streets of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), ye, and your fathers,
your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the
LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind?  

<span id="022">22</span> So that the LORD could no longer bear, because
of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye
have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an
astonishment, and a [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md), without an
inhabitant, as at this day.  

<span id="023">23</span> Because ye have burned
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md), and because ye have sinned against the
LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law,
nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is
happened unto you, as at this day.  

<span id="024">24</span> Moreover [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) said
unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD,
all [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) that are in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md):  

<span id="025">25</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), saying; Ye and your wives have both
spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will
surely perform our [vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001.md) that we have vowed, to
burn [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) to the
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and
to pour out [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) offerings unto her: ye will
surely accomplish your [vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001.md), and surely perform
your [vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) that dwell in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md); Behold, I have sworn by my great name,
saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any
man of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) in all the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), saying, The Lord GOD liveth.  

<span id="027">27</span> Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and
not for good: and all the men of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) that are
in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) shall be consumed by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) and by the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md), until there be an end of them.  

<span id="028">28</span> Yet a small number that escape the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) shall return out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) into the land of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and all the remnant of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), that are gone into the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) to sojourn there, shall know whose words
shall stand, mine, or their's.  

<span id="029">29</span> And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the
LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my
words shall surely stand against you for evil:  

<span id="030">30</span> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give
Pharaohhophra [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) into the hand of his enemies, and into
the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) into the hand of
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), his enemy, and that sought his life.
