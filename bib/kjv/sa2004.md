### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> And when Saul's son heard that
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002.md) was dead in
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004.md), his hands were feeble, and all the
Israelites were troubled.  

<span id="002">2</span> And Saul's son had two men that were captains of
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003.md): the name of the one was
[Baanah](../ebd/ebd040.htm#007.md), and the name of the other
[Rechab](../ebd/ebd308.htm#002.md), the sons of
[Rimmon](../ebd/ebd313.htm#005.md) a Beerothite, of the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008): (for [Beeroth](../ebd/ebd050.htm#006.md)
also was reckoned to [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And the Beerothites fled to
[Gittaim](../ebd/ebd149.htm#008.md), and were sojourners there until this
day.)  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md), Saul's
son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the
tidings came of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) and
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) out of
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008.md), and his nurse took him up, and fled:
and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became
lame. And his name was [Mephibosheth](../ebd/ebd248.htm#006.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the sons of [Rimmon](../ebd/ebd313.htm#005.md)
the Beerothite, [Rechab](../ebd/ebd308.htm#002.md) and
[Baanah](../ebd/ebd040.htm#007.md), went, and came about the heat of the
day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.  

<span id="006">6</span> And they came thither into the midst of the
house, as though they would have fetched [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md);
and they smote him under the fifth rib: and
[Rechab](../ebd/ebd308.htm#002) and [Baanah](../ebd/ebd040.htm#007.md) his
brother escaped.  

<span id="007">7</span> For when they came into the house, he lay on his
bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded
him, and took his head, and gat them away through the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md) all night.  

<span id="008">8</span> And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) to [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004.md), and
said to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), Behold the head of Ishbosheth
the son of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) thine enemy, which sought thy
life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) this day of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md),
and of his seed.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) answered
[Rechab](../ebd/ebd308.htm#002) and [Baanah](../ebd/ebd040.htm#007.md) his
brother, the sons of [Rimmon](../ebd/ebd313.htm#005.md) the Beerothite, and
said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all
adversity,  

<span id="010">10</span> When one told me, saying, Behold,
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) is dead, thinking to have brought good
tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in
[Ziklag](../ebd/ebd393.htm#003.md), who thought that I would have given him
a reward for his tidings:  

<span id="011">11</span> How much more, when wicked men have slain a
righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore
now require his [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of your hand, and take
you away from the earth?  

<span id="012">12</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) commanded
his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their
feet, and hanged them up over the pool in
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004.md). But they took the head of Ishbosheth,
and buried it in the [sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md) of
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) in [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004.md).
