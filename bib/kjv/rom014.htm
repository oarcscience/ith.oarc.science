<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 14</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> him that eateth: for God hath received him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For to this end <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But why dost thou <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Let us not therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> one another any more: but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;I know, and am persuaded by the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> died.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Let not then your good be evil spoken of:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For the kingdom of God is not meat and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>; but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, and peace, and joy in the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For he that in these things serveth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> is acceptable to God, and approved of men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;It is good neither to eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, nor to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
