### King James Version: Acts Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence
which I make now unto you.  

<span id="002">2</span> (And when they heard that he spake in the
[Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009) tongue to them, they kept the more
silence: and he saith,)  

<span id="003">3</span> I am verily a man which am a
[Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004), born in [Tarsus](../ebd/ebd359.htm#003), a
city in [Cilicia](../ebd/ebd083.htm#003), yet brought up in this city at
the feet of [Gamaliel](../ebd/ebd142.htm#006), and taught according to
the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward
God, as ye all are this day.  

<span id="004">4</span> And I persecuted this way unto the death,
binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.  

<span id="005">5</span> As also the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003)
doth bear me [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008), and all the estate of the
elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007), to bring them which were there bound
unto [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), for to be punished.  

<span id="006">6</span> And it came to pass, that, as I made my
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001), and was come nigh unto
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007) about noon, suddenly there shone from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) a great light round about me.  

<span id="007">7</span> And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice
saying unto me, [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002),
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), why persecutest thou me?  

<span id="008">8</span> And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said
unto me, I am [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) of
[Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007), whom thou persecutest.  

<span id="009">9</span> And they that were with me saw indeed the light,
and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.  

<span id="010">10</span> And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord
said unto me, Arise, and go into [Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007); and
there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee
to do.  

<span id="011">11</span> And when I could not see for the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of that light, being led by the hand of
them that were with me, I came into [Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007).  

<span id="012">12</span> And one [Ananias](../ebd/ebd023.htm#001), a
devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews
which dwelt there,  

<span id="013">13</span> Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me,
Brother [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), receive thy sight. And the same
hour I looked up upon him.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he said, The God of our fathers hath
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) thee, that thou shouldest know his will,
and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.  

<span id="015">15</span> For thou shalt be his
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) unto all men of what thou hast seen and
heard.  

<span id="016">16</span> And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be
baptized, and wash away thy sins, [calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007) on
the name of the Lord.  

<span id="017">17</span> And it came to pass, that, when I was come
again to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), even while I prayed in the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), I was in a
[trance](../ebd/ebd371.htm#006);  

<span id="018">18</span> And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get
thee quickly out of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): for they will
not receive thy [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) concerning me.  

<span id="019">19</span> And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned
and beat in every [synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009) them that believed
on thee:  

<span id="020">20</span> And when the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of
thy [martyr](../ebd/ebd242.htm#008) [Stephen](../ebd/ebd351.htm#002) was
shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept
the raiment of them that slew him.  

<span id="021">21</span> And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send
thee far hence unto the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001).  

<span id="022">22</span> And they gave him audience unto this word, and
then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the
earth: for it is not fit that he should live.  

<span id="023">23</span> And as they cried out, and cast off their
clothes, and threw [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) into the air,  

<span id="024">24</span> The chief captain commanded him to be brought
into the [castle](../ebd/ebd073.htm#008), and bade that he should be
examined by [scourging](../ebd/ebd324.htm#002); that he might know
wherefore they cried so against him.  

<span id="025">25</span> And as they bound him with thongs,
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) said unto the
[centurion](../ebd/ebd075.htm#004) that stood by, Is it lawful for you
to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?  

<span id="026">26</span> When the [centurion](../ebd/ebd075.htm#004)
heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what
thou doest: for this man is a Roman.  

<span id="027">27</span> Then the chief captain came, and said unto him,
Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.  

<span id="028">28</span> And the chief captain answered, With a great
sum obtained I this freedom. And [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) said, But
I was free born.  

<span id="029">29</span> Then straightway they departed from him which
should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after
he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.  

<span id="030">30</span> On the morrow, because he would have known the
certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003), and commanded the chief priests and all
their [council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004) to appear, and brought
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) down, and set him before them.
