### King James Version: Nahum Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies
and [robbery](../ebd/ebd315.htm#000.md); the prey departeth not;  

<span id="002">2</span> The noise of a whip, and the noise of the
rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping
chariots.  

<span id="003">3</span> The [horseman](../ebd/ebd183.htm#000.md) lifteth up
both the bright [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) and the glittering spear:
and there is a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases; and
there is none end of their corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:  

<span id="004">4</span> Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the
wellfavoured [harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005.md), the mistress of
witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families
through her witchcrafts.  

<span id="005">5</span> Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of
hosts; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the
nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and
make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock.  

<span id="007">7</span> And it shall come to pass, that all they that
look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say,
[Nineveh](../ebd/ebd273.htm#006.md) is laid waste: who will bemoan her?
whence shall I seek comforters for thee?  

<span id="008">8</span> Art thou better than populous No, that was
situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose
rampart was the sea, and her wall was from the sea?  

<span id="009">9</span> [Ethiopia](../ebd/ebd126.htm#005.md) and
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) were her strength, and it was infinite;
Put and Lubim were thy helpers.  

<span id="010">10</span> Yet was she carried away, she went into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md): her young children also were dashed
in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md) at the top of all the streets: and
they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound
in chains.  

<span id="011">11</span> Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid,
thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy.  

<span id="012">12</span> All thy strong holds shall be like
[fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001.md) trees with the firstripe figs: if they be
shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater.  

<span id="013">13</span> Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are
women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies:
the fire shall devour thy bars.  

<span id="014">14</span> Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy
strong holds: go into [clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004.md), and tread the
morter, make strong the brickkiln.  

<span id="015">15</span> There shall the fire devour thee; the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up
like the [cankerworm](../ebd/ebd071.htm#004.md): make thyself many as the
[cankerworm](../ebd/ebd071.htm#004.md), make thyself many as the locusts.  

<span id="016">16</span> Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md): the
[cankerworm](../ebd/ebd071.htm#004.md) spoileth, and fleeth away.  

<span id="017">17</span> Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy
captains as the great grasshoppers, which [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md)
in the hedges in the cold day, but when the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md)
ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are.  

<span id="018">18</span> Thy shepherds slumber, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md): thy
nobles shall dwell in the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md): thy people is
scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth them.  

<span id="019">19</span> There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is
grievous: all that hear the [bruit](../ebd/ebd065.htm#008.md) of thee shall
clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed
continually?
