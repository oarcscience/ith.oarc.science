### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and
keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his
commandments, alway.  

<span id="002">2</span> And know ye this day: for I speak not with your
children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement
of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched
out arm,  

<span id="003">3</span> And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in
the midst of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and unto all his land;  

<span id="004">4</span> And what he did unto the army of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), unto their horses, and to their
chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they
pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day;  

<span id="005">5</span> And what he did unto you in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), until ye came into this place;  

<span id="006">6</span> And what he did unto
[Dathan](../ebd/ebd098.htm#002) and [Abiram](../ebd/ebd004.htm#003.md), the
sons of [Eliab](../ebd/ebd115.htm#008.md), the son of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009.md): how the earth opened her mouth, and
swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the
substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):  

<span id="007">7</span> But your eyes have seen all the great acts of
the LORD which he did.  

<span id="008">8</span> Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments
which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and
possess the land, whither ye go to possess it;  

<span id="009">9</span> And that ye may prolong your days in the land,
which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their
seed, a land that floweth with [milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000.md) and
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> For the land, whither thou goest in to possess
it, is not as the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), from whence ye
came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot,
as a garden of herbs:  

<span id="011">11</span> But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a
land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md):  

<span id="012">12</span> A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the
eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the
year even unto the end of the year.  

<span id="013">13</span> And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken
diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love
the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all
your soul,  

<span id="014">14</span> That I will give you the
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) of your land in his due season, the first
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) and the latter
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md), that thou mayest gather in thy
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006), and thy [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md),
and thine oil.  

<span id="015">15</span> And I will send [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md)
in thy fields for thy [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), that thou mayest
eat and be full.  

<span id="016">16</span> Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not
deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) them;  

<span id="017">17</span> And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against
you, and he shut up the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), that there be
no [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md), and that the land yield not her
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md); and lest ye perish quickly from off the
good land which the LORD giveth you.  

<span id="018">18</span> Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in
your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand,
that they may be as [frontlets](../ebd/ebd138.htm#008.md) between your
eyes.  

<span id="019">19</span> And ye shall teach them your children, speaking
of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the
way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.  

<span id="020">20</span> And thou shalt write them upon the door posts
of thine house, and upon thy gates:  

<span id="021">21</span> That your days may be multiplied, and the days
of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to
give them, as the days of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) upon the
earth.  

<span id="022">22</span> For if ye shall diligently keep all these
commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God,
to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;  

<span id="023">23</span> Then will the LORD drive out all these nations
from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than
yourselves.  

<span id="024">24</span> Every place whereon the soles of your feet
shall tread shall be yours: from the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md)
and [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md), from the river, the river
[Euphrates](../ebd/ebd127.htm#001.md), even unto the uttermost sea shall
your coast be.  

<span id="025">25</span> There shall no man be able to stand before you:
for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you
upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.  

<span id="026">26</span> Behold, I set before you this day a blessing
and a [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md);  

<span id="027">27</span> A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the
LORD your God, which I command you this day:  

<span id="028">28</span> And a [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md), if ye
will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out
of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which
ye have not known.  

<span id="029">29</span> And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy
God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it,
that thou shalt put the blessing upon [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Gerizim](../ebd/ebd146.htm#007), and the [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md)
upon [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Ebal](../ebd/ebd111.htm#007.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> Are they not on the other side
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), by the way where the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) goeth down, in the land of the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007.md), which dwell in the champaign over
against [Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md), beside the plains of
[Moreh](../ebd/ebd259.htm#006.md)?  

<span id="031">31</span> For ye shall pass over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) to go in to possess the land which the
LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.  

<span id="032">32</span> And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and
judgments which I set before you this day.
