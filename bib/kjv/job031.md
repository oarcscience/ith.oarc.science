### King James Version: Job Chapter 31

<span id="001">1</span> I made a [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with
mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?  

<span id="002">2</span> For what portion of God is there from above? and
what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?  

<span id="003">3</span> Is not [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) to
the wicked? and a strange [punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005) to the
workers of iniquity?  

<span id="004">4</span> Doth not he see my ways, and count all my
steps?  

<span id="005">5</span> If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath
hasted to deceit;  

<span id="006">6</span> Let me be weighed in an even
[balance](../ebd/ebd042.htm#007) that God may know mine integrity.  

<span id="007">7</span> If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine
heart walked after mine eyes, and if any [blot](../ebd/ebd061.htm#002)
hath cleaved to mine hands;  

<span id="008">8</span> Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let
my offspring be rooted out.  

<span id="009">9</span> If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or
if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;  

<span id="010">10</span> Then let my wife [grind](../ebd/ebd155.htm#006)
unto another, and let others [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) down upon
her.  

<span id="011">11</span> For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an
iniquity to be punished by the judges.  

<span id="012">12</span> For it is a fire that consumeth to
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004), and would root out all mine
increase.  

<span id="013">13</span> If I did despise the cause of my manservant or
of my maidservant, when they contended with me;  

<span id="014">14</span> What then shall I do when God riseth up? and
when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?  

<span id="015">15</span> Did not he that made me in the womb make him?
and did not one fashion us in the womb?  

<span id="016">16</span> If I have withheld the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) from their desire, or have caused the eyes
of the widow to fail;  

<span id="017">17</span> Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the
fatherless hath not eaten thereof;  

<span id="018">18</span> (For from my youth he was brought up with me,
as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)  

<span id="019">19</span> If I have seen any perish for want of clothing,
or any [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) without covering;  

<span id="020">20</span> If his loins have not blessed me, and if he
were not warmed with the [fleece](../ebd/ebd135.htm#006) of my
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005);  

<span id="021">21</span> If I have lifted up my hand against the
fatherless, when I saw my help in the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008):  

<span id="022">22</span> Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder
[blade](../ebd/ebd060.htm#003), and mine arm be broken from the bone.  

<span id="023">23</span> For [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) from
God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not
endure.  

<span id="024">24</span> If I have made [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) my
hope, or have said to the fine [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), Thou art
my confidence;  

<span id="025">25</span> If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and
because mine hand had gotten much;  

<span id="026">26</span> If I beheld the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001)
when it shined, or the [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004) walking in
brightness;  

<span id="027">27</span> And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my
mouth hath kissed my hand:  

<span id="028">28</span> This also were an iniquity to be punished by
the [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005): for I should have denied the God
that is above.  

<span id="029">29</span> If I rejoice at the
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) of him that hated me, or lifted up
myself when evil found him:  

<span id="030">30</span> Neither have I suffered my mouth to
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) by wishing a [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003)
to his soul.  

<span id="031">31</span> If the men of my
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) said not, Oh that we had of his
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007)! we cannot be satisfied.  

<span id="032">32</span> The [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) did not
[lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002) in the street: but I opened my
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009) to the traveller.  

<span id="033">33</span> If I covered my transgressions as
[Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007), by hiding mine iniquity in my
[bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008):  

<span id="034">34</span> Did I fear a great multitude, or did the
contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out
of the door?  

<span id="035">35</span> Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire
is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine
[adversary](../ebd/ebd011.htm#001) had written a book.  

<span id="036">36</span> Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and
bind it as a [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) to me.  

<span id="037">37</span> I would declare unto him the number of my
steps; as a [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) would I go near unto him.  

<span id="038">38</span> If my land cry against me, or that the furrows
likewise thereof complain;  

<span id="039">39</span> If I have eaten the fruits thereof without
money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:  

<span id="040">40</span> Let thistles grow instead of
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000), and [cockle](../ebd/ebd085.htm#008)
instead of [barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003). The words of Job are
ended.
