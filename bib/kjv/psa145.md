### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 145

<span id="001">1</span> I will extol thee, my God, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001); and I will [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008)
thy name for ever and ever.  

<span id="002">2</span> Every day will I [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008)
thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.  

<span id="003">3</span> Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised;
and his greatness is unsearchable.  

<span id="004">4</span> One [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) shall
praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.  

<span id="005">5</span> I will speak of the glorious honour of thy
majesty, and of thy wondrous works.  

<span id="006">6</span> And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible
acts: and I will declare thy greatness.  

<span id="007">7</span> They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy
great [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000), and shall sing of thy
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="008">8</span> The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion;
slow to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), and of great
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005).  

<span id="009">9</span> The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies
are over all his works.  

<span id="010">10</span> All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and
thy saints shall [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) thee.  

<span id="011">11</span> They shall speak of the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power;  

<span id="012">12</span> To make known to the sons of men his mighty
acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thy kingdom is an
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) kingdom, and thy dominion endureth
throughout all generations.  

<span id="014">14</span> The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth
up all those that be bowed down.  

<span id="015">15</span> The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest
them their meat in due season.  

<span id="016">16</span> Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the
desire of every living thing.  

<span id="017">17</span> The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy
in all his works.  

<span id="018">18</span> The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon
him, to all that call upon him in truth.  

<span id="019">19</span> He will fulfil the desire of them that fear
him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.  

<span id="020">20</span> The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but
all the wicked will he destroy.  

<span id="021">21</span> My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD:
and let all [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007)
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) his holy name for ever and ever.
