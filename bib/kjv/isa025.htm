</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For thou hast made of a city an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A>; of a defenced city a ruin: a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A> of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Therefore shall the strong people <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</A> thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For thou hast been a strength to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A>: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</A> of the terrible ones shall be brought low.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> things, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> of wines on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#005">lees</A>, of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> things full of marrow, of wines on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#005">lees</A> well refined.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;He will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#009">swallow</A> up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A> shall be trodden down under him, even as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</A> is trodden down for the dunghill.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A>.<BR>
