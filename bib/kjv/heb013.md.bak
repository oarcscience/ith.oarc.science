### King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> Let brotherly love continue.  

<span id="002">2</span> Be not forgetful to
[entertain](../ebd/ebd121.htm#009.md) strangers: for thereby some have
entertained angels unawares.  

<span id="003">3</span> Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with
them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the
body.  

<span id="004">4</span> Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed
undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Let your [conversation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#001.md)
be without [covetousness](../ebd/ebd092.htm#000.md); and be content with
such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor
forsake thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my
helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.  

<span id="007">7</span> Remember them which have the rule over you, who
have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering
the end of their [conversation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#001.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) the same yesterday, and to day, and for
ever.  

<span id="009">9</span> Be not carried about with divers and strange
doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md); not with meats, which have not profited
them that have been occupied therein.  

<span id="010">10</span> We have an [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md),
whereof they have no right to eat which serve the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> For the bodies of those beasts, whose
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) is brought into the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md) by the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) for [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), are
burned without the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> Wherefore [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) also,
that he might sanctify the people with his own
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), suffered without the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> Let us go forth therefore unto him without the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md), bearing his reproach.  

<span id="014">14</span> For here have we no continuing city, but we
seek one to come.  

<span id="015">15</span> By him therefore let us offer the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) of praise to God continually, that
is, the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of our lips giving thanks to his
name.  

<span id="016">16</span> But to do good and to communicate forget not:
for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.  

<span id="017">17</span> Obey them that have the rule over you, and
submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give
account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is
unprofitable for you.  

<span id="018">18</span> Pray for us: for we trust we have a good
[conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006.md), in all things willing to live
honestly.  

<span id="019">19</span> But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I
may be restored to you the sooner.  

<span id="020">20</span> Now the God of peace, that brought again from
the dead our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), that great
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006) of the [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md),
through the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of the
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md)
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md),  

<span id="021">21</span> Make you perfect in every good work to do his
will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md); to whom
be [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) for ever and ever.
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of
exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.  

<span id="023">23</span> Know ye that our brother
[Timothy](../ebd/ebd367.htm#002.md) is set at liberty; with whom, if he
come shortly, I will see you.  

<span id="024">24</span> Salute all them that have the rule over you,
and all the saints. They of [Italy](../ebd/ebd191.htm#004.md) salute you.  

<span id="025">25</span> [Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) be with you all.
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).
