### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> Then [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) took a vial
of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not
because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his
inheritance?  

<span id="002">2</span> When thou art departed from me to day, then thou
shalt find two men by Rachel's [sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001) in the
border of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) at Zelzah; and they will say
unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy
father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying,
What shall I do for my son?  

<span id="003">3</span> Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and
thou shalt come to the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) of
[Tabor](../ebd/ebd356.htm#007), and there shall meet thee three men
going up to God to [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006), one carrying three
kids, and another carrying three loaves of
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and another carrying a
[bottle](../ebd/ebd063.htm#002) of [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000):  

<span id="004">4</span> And they will salute thee, and give thee two
loaves of [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006); which thou shalt receive of
their hands.  

<span id="005">5</span> After that thou shalt come to the hill of God,
where is the [garrison](../ebd/ebd143.htm#007) of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002): and it shall come to pass, when
thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of
prophets coming down from the high place with a
[psaltery](../ebd/ebd301.htm#006), and a
[tabret](../ebd/ebd356.htm#009), and a [pipe](../ebd/ebd296.htm#000),
and a [harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001), before them; and they shall
prophesy:  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of the
LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt
be turned into another man.  

<span id="007">7</span> And let it be, when these signs are come unto
thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> And thou shalt go down before me to
[Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001); and, behold, I will come down unto
thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) sacrifices of peace offerings:
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days shalt thou tarry, till I come to
thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.  

<span id="009">9</span> And it was so, that when he had turned his back
to go from [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001), God gave him another heart:
and all those signs came to pass that day.  

<span id="010">10</span> And when they came thither to the hill, behold,
a company of prophets met him; and the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009)
of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it came to pass, when all that knew him
beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the
people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of
[Kish](../ebd/ebd220.htm#007)? Is [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) also
among the prophets?  

<span id="012">12</span> And one of the same place answered and said,
But who is their father? Therefore it became a
[proverb](../ebd/ebd301.htm#002), Is [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) also
among the prophets?  

<span id="013">13</span> And when he had made an end of prophesying, he
came to the high place.  

<span id="014">14</span> And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his
servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we
saw that they were no where, we came to
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001).  

<span id="015">15</span> And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee,
what [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) said unto you.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) said unto his
uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter
of the kingdom, whereof [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) spake, he told
him not.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) called the
people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;  

<span id="018">18</span> And said unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Thus saith the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), I brought up
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009),
and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand
of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:  

<span id="019">19</span> And ye have this day rejected your God, who
himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and
ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over
us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and
by your [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008).  

<span id="020">20</span> And when [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) had
caused all the tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to come near,
the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008)
was taken.  

<span id="021">21</span> When he had caused the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) to
come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) the son of [Kish](../ebd/ebd220.htm#007)
was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.  

<span id="022">22</span> Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if
the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold he hath
hid himself among the stuff.  

<span id="023">23</span> And they ran and fetched him thence: and when
he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his
shoulders and upward.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) said to all
the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008), that there is none like him among all
the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="025">25</span> Then [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) told the
people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up
before the LORD. And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) sent all the people
away, every man to his house.  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) also went
home to [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008); and there went with him a band
of men, whose hearts God had touched.  

<span id="027">27</span> But the children of
[Belial](../ebd/ebd051.htm#007) said, How shall this man save us? And
they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held his peace.
