### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Run ye to and fro through the streets of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and see now, and know, and seek in
the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that
executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will
[pardon](../ebd/ebd285.htm#001.md) it.  

<span id="002">2</span> And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely
they swear falsely.  

<span id="003">3</span> O LORD, are not thine eyes upon the truth? thou
hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them,
but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces
harder than a [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md); they have refused to
return.  

<span id="004">4</span> Therefore I said, Surely these are
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md); they are foolish: for they know not the
way of the LORD, nor the judgment of their God.  

<span id="005">5</span> I will get me unto the great men, and will speak
unto them; for they have known the way of the LORD, and the judgment of
their God: but these have altogether broken the
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md), and burst the bonds.  

<span id="006">6</span> Wherefore a lion out of the
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006.md) shall slay them, and a
[wolf](../ebd/ebd383.htm#001.md) of the evenings shall spoil them, a
[leopard](../ebd/ebd227.htm#002.md) shall watch over their cities: every
one that goeth out thence shall be torn in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md): because their transgressions are many,
and their backslidings are increased.  

<span id="007">7</span> How shall I [pardon](../ebd/ebd285.htm#001.md) thee
for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no
gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009.md), and assembled themselves by troops in
the harlots' houses.  

<span id="008">8</span> They were as fed horses in the morning: every
one neighed after his neighbour's wife.  

<span id="009">9</span> Shall I not visit for these things? saith the
LORD: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?  

<span id="010">10</span> Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make
not a full end: take away her battlements; for they are not the
LORD's.  

<span id="011">11</span> For the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) and the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) have dealt very treacherously against me,
saith the LORD.  

<span id="012">12</span> They have belied the LORD, and said, It is not
he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) nor [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md):  

<span id="013">13</span> And the prophets shall become wind, and the
word is not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.  

<span id="014">14</span> Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts,
Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth
fire, and this people [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md), and it shall devour
them.  

<span id="015">15</span> Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O
house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), saith the LORD: it is a mighty
nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest
not, neither understandest what they say.  

<span id="016">16</span> Their [quiver](../ebd/ebd304.htm#000.md) is as an
open [sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md), they are all mighty men.  

<span id="017">17</span> And they shall eat up thine
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md), and thy
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), which thy sons and thy daughters should
eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy
vines and thy [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001.md) trees: they shall impoverish
thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I
will not make a full end with you.  

<span id="019">19</span> And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say,
Wherefore doeth the LORD our God all these things unto us? then shalt
thou answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods
in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not
your's.  

<span id="020">20</span> Declare this in the house of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and publish it in
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), saying,  

<span id="021">21</span> Hear now this, O foolish people, and without
understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear
not:  

<span id="022">22</span> Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not
tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the
sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves
thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet
can they not pass over it?  

<span id="023">23</span> But this people hath a revolting and a
rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.  

<span id="024">24</span> Neither say they in their heart, Let us now
fear the LORD our God, that giveth [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md), both
the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the
appointed weeks of the [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> Your iniquities have turned away these things,
and your sins have withholden good things from you.  

<span id="026">26</span> For among my people are found wicked men: they
lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.  

<span id="027">27</span> As a [cage](../ebd/ebd068.htm#005.md) is full of
birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become
great, and waxen rich.  

<span id="028">28</span> They are waxen [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md),
they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) not the cause, the cause of the
fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> Shall I not visit for these things? saith the
LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?  

<span id="030">30</span> A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in
the land;  

<span id="031">31</span> The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests
bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what
will ye do in the end thereof?
