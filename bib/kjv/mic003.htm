<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Micah Chapter 3</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, and ye princes of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; Is it not for you to know judgment?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> from off their bones;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Who also eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>, as for the pot, and as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> within the caldron.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But truly I am full of power by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> his transgression, and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, and princes of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;They build up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A> with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> with iniquity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;The heads thereof <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Therefore shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A> for your sake be plowed as a field, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</A>.<BR>
