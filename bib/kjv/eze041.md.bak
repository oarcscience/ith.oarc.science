### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 41

<span id="001">1</span> Afterward he brought me to the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), and measured the posts, six cubits
broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was
the breadth of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and
the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits
on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and
the breadth, twenty cubits.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then went he inward, and measured the
[post](../ebd/ebd299.htm#001.md) of the door, two cubits; and the door, six
cubits; and the breadth of the door, [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
cubits.  

<span id="004">4</span> So he measured the length thereof, twenty
cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md): and he said unto me, This is the most
holy place.  

<span id="005">5</span> After he measured the wall of the house, six
cubits; and the breadth of every side [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md),
four cubits, round about the house on every side.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the side chambers were three, one over
another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which was
of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have
hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.  

<span id="007">7</span> And there was an enlarging, and a winding about
still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house
went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the
house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md) to the highest by the midst.  

<span id="008">8</span> I saw also the height of the house round about:
the foundations of the side chambers were a full
[reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000.md) of six great cubits.  

<span id="009">9</span> The thickness of the wall, which was for the
side [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md) without, was five cubits: and that
which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within.  

<span id="010">10</span> And between the chambers was the wideness of
twenty cubits round about the house on every side.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) of the
side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the
north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place
that was left was five cubits round about.  

<span id="012">12</span> Now the building that was before the separate
place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall
of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length
thereof ninety cubits.  

<span id="013">13</span> So he measured the house, an hundred cubits
long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof,
an hundred cubits long;  

<span id="014">14</span> Also the breadth of the face of the house, and
of the separate place toward the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md), an
hundred cubits.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he measured the length of the building over
against the separate place which was behind it, and the galleries
thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with
the inner [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), and the porches of the
court;  

<span id="016">16</span> The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the
galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door,
cieled with [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) round about, and from the
ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered;  

<span id="017">17</span> To that above the door, even unto the inner
house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without,
by measure.  

<span id="018">18</span> And it was made with cherubims and palm trees,
so that a palm tree was between a [cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003.md) and a
[cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003.md); and every
[cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003.md) had two faces;  

<span id="019">19</span> So that the face of a man was toward the palm
tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree
on the other side: it was made through all the house round about.  

<span id="020">20</span> From the ground unto above the door were
cherubims and palm trees made, and on the wall of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> The posts of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) were squared, and the face of the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md); the appearance of the one as the
appearance of the other.  

<span id="022">22</span> The [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) of
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) was three cubits high, and the length
thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and
the walls thereof, were of [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md): and he said
unto me, This is the table that is before the LORD.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) and the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md) had two
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) had two
leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two
leaves for the other door.  

<span id="025">25</span> And there were made on them, on the
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009) of the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md),
cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there
were thick planks upon the face of the porch without.  

<span id="026">26</span> And there were narrow windows and palm trees on
the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon
the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.
