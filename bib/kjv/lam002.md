### King James Version: Lamentations Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> How hath the LORD covered the daughter of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002) with a [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md) in
his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md), and cast down from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) unto the earth the beauty of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and remembered not his
[footstool](../ebd/ebd136.htm#009.md) in the day of his
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md)!  

<span id="002">2</span> The LORD hath swallowed up all the habitations
of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and hath not pitied: he hath thrown
down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md); he hath brought them down to the ground:
he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.  

<span id="003">3</span> He hath cut off in his fierce
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) all the [horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): he hath drawn back his right hand from
before the enemy, and he burned against [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md)
like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about.  

<span id="004">4</span> He hath bent his [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md)
like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an
[adversary](../ebd/ebd011.htm#001.md), and slew all that were pleasant to
the eye in the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the daughter of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md): he poured out his
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md) like fire.  

<span id="005">5</span> The LORD was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), he hath swallowed up all her palaces:
he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) mourning and
[lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And he hath violently taken away his
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), as if it were of a garden: he hath
destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn
feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md),
and hath despised in the indignation of his
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) and the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> The LORD hath cast off his
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), he hath abhorred his
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md), he hath given up into the hand of
the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house
of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of
the daughter of [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md): he hath stretched out a
line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made
the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.  

<span id="009">9</span> Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath
destroyed and broken her bars: her [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) and her
princes are among the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md): the law is no
more; her prophets also find no [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md) from the
LORD.  

<span id="010">10</span> The elders of the daughter of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md) sit upon the ground, and keep silence:
they have cast up [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) upon their heads; they
have girded themselves with [sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001.md): the
virgins of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) hang down their heads to
the ground.  

<span id="011">11</span> Mine eyes do fail with tears, my
[bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004.md) are troubled, my
[liver](../ebd/ebd230.htm#004.md) is poured upon the earth, for the
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md) of the daughter of my people;
because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the
city.  

<span id="012">12</span> They say to their mothers, Where is
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) and [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md)? when
they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul
was poured out into their mothers' [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> What thing shall I take to
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) for thee? what thing shall I liken to
thee, O daughter of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md)? what shall I
equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O
[virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009.md) daughter of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002)? for thy [breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005.md)
is great like the sea: who can heal thee?  

<span id="014">14</span> Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things
for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md); but have seen for thee false burdens
and causes of banishment.  

<span id="015">15</span> All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they
[hiss](../ebd/ebd179.htm#005.md) and wag their head at the daughter of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), saying, Is this the city that men
call The [perfection](../ebd/ebd290.htm#001.md) of beauty, The joy of the
whole earth?  

<span id="016">16</span> All thine enemies have opened their mouth
against thee: they [hiss](../ebd/ebd179.htm#005.md) and
[gnash](../ebd/ebd150.htm#008.md) the teeth: they say, We have swallowed
her up: certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we
have seen it.  

<span id="017">17</span> The LORD hath done that which he had devised;
he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he
hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused thine enemy to
rejoice over thee, he hath set up the [horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003.md) of
thine adversaries.  

<span id="018">18</span> Their heart cried unto the LORD, O wall of the
daughter of [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), let tears run down like a
river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the
[apple](../ebd/ebd027.htm#004.md) of thine eye cease.  

<span id="019">19</span> Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning
of the [watches](../ebd/ebd379.htm#003.md) pour out thine heart like water
before the face of the LORD: lift up thy hands toward him for the life
of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every
street.  

<span id="020">20</span> Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast
done this. Shall the women eat their [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md), and
children of a span long? shall the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) and
the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) be slain in the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md) of the Lord?  

<span id="021">21</span> The young and the old lie on the ground in the
streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md); thou hast slain them in the day of thine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md); thou hast killed, and not pitied.  

<span id="022">22</span> Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors
round about, so that in the day of the LORD's
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) none escaped nor remained: those that I
have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.
