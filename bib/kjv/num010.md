### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Make thee two [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001)
of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000); of a whole piece shalt thou make
them: that thou mayest use them for the [calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007)
of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.  

<span id="003">3</span> And when they shall blow with them, all the
assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004).  

<span id="004">4</span> And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the
princes, which are heads of the [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), shall gather themselves unto thee.  

<span id="005">5</span> When ye blow an [alarm](../ebd/ebd016.htm#007),
then the camps that lie on the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) parts shall
go forward.  

<span id="006">6</span> When ye blow an [alarm](../ebd/ebd016.htm#007)
the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take
their [journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001): they shall blow an
[alarm](../ebd/ebd016.htm#007) for their journeys.  

<span id="007">7</span> But when the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) is to be gathered together, ye
shall blow, but ye shall not sound an [alarm](../ebd/ebd016.htm#007).  

<span id="008">8</span> And the sons of [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001),
the priests, shall blow with the [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001); and
they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your
generations.  

<span id="009">9</span> And if ye go to war in your land against the
enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an
[alarm](../ebd/ebd016.htm#007) with the
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001); and ye shall be remembered before the
LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.  

<span id="010">10</span> Also in the day of your gladness, and in your
solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with
the [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001) over your burnt offerings, and
over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for
a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the
second month, in the second year, that the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) was taken up from off the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008).  

<span id="012">12</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) took their journeys out of the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009);
and the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) rested in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Paran](../ebd/ebd284.htm#006).  

<span id="013">13</span> And they first took their
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001) according to the commandment of the
LORD by the hand of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003).  

<span id="014">14</span> In the first place went the standard of the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) of the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) according to their armies: and over his
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) was [Nahshon](../ebd/ebd265.htm#007) the
son of [Amminadab](../ebd/ebd020.htm#008).

son of [Helon](../ebd/ebd173.htm#005).  

<span id="017">17</span> And the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) was
taken down; and the sons of [Gershon](../ebd/ebd146.htm#009) and the
sons of [Merari](../ebd/ebd249.htm#000) set forward, bearing the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003).  

<span id="018">18</span> And the standard of the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) of [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009) set
forward according to their armies: and over his
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) was Elizur the son of Shedeur.  

<span id="019">19</span> And over the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of

[Zurishaddai](../ebd/ebd396.htm#007).  

<span id="020">20</span> And over the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of

[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007) was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the [Kohathites](../ebd/ebd222.htm#002) set
forward, bearing the [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005): and the other
did set up the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) against they came.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the standard of the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) of the children of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) set forward according to their armies:
and over his [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) was
[Elishama](../ebd/ebd118.htm#001) the son of
[Ammihud](../ebd/ebd020.htm#007).  

<span id="023">23</span> And over the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of
the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of the children of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) was [Gamaliel](../ebd/ebd142.htm#006)
the son of [Pedahzur](../ebd/ebd288.htm#000).  

<span id="024">24</span> And over the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of
the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) was [Abidan](../ebd/ebd002.htm#008)
the son of Gideoni.  

<span id="025">25</span> And the standard of the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) of the children of
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009) set forward, which was the
[rereward](../ebd/ebd311.htm#004) of all the camps throughout their
hosts: and over his [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) was
[Ahiezer](../ebd/ebd013.htm#008) the son of
[Ammishaddai](../ebd/ebd021.htm#000).  

<span id="026">26</span> And over the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of
the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of the children of
[Asher](../ebd/ebd033.htm#008) was [Pagiel](../ebd/ebd282.htm#005) the

<span id="027">27</span> And over the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of

<span id="028">28</span> Thus were the journeyings of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) according to their armies, when they set
forward.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said unto
[Hobab](../ebd/ebd180.htm#000), the son of
[Raguel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#005) the [Midianite](../ebd/ebd253.htm#008),
Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD
said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good:
for the LORD hath spoken good concerning
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="030">30</span> And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will
depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.  

<span id="031">31</span> And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee;
forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to [encamp](../ebd/ebd120.htm#003)
in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), and thou mayest be to us
instead of eyes.  

<span id="032">32</span> And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it
shall be, that what [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000) the LORD shall do
unto us, the same will we do unto thee.  

<span id="033">33</span> And they departed from the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) of the LORD three days'
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001): and the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000)
of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of the LORD went before them in
the three days' [journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001), to search out a
resting place for them.  

<span id="034">34</span> And the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) of the
LORD was upon them by day, when they went out of the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002).  

<span id="035">35</span> And it came to pass, when the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) set forward, that
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine
enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.  

<span id="036">36</span> And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD,
unto the many [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).
