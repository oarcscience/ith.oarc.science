### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of
[Mamre](../ebd/ebd239.htm#008.md): and he sat in the
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) door in the heat of the day;  

<span id="002">2</span> And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo,
three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from
the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) door, and bowed himself toward the
ground,  

<span id="003">3</span> And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in
thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:  

<span id="004">4</span> Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and
wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:  

<span id="005">5</span> And I will fetch a morsel of
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), and comfort ye your hearts; after that
ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they
said, So do, as thou hast said.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) hastened
into the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) unto
[Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md), and said, Make ready quickly three
measures of fine meal, [knead](../ebd/ebd221.htm#005.md) it, and make cakes
upon the [hearth](../ebd/ebd170.htm#002.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) ran unto
the [herd](../ebd/ebd174.htm#009.md), and fetcht a
[calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004.md) tender and good, and gave it unto a young
man; and he hasted to [dress](../ebd/ebd107.htm#008.md) it.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he took [butter](../ebd/ebd067.htm#002.md), and
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000), and the [calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004.md)
which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under
the tree, and they did eat.  

<span id="009">9</span> And they said unto him, Where is
[Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md) thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And he said, I will certainly return unto thee
according to the time of life; and, lo, [Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md)
thy wife shall have a son. And [Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md) heard it
in the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) door, which was behind him.  

<span id="011">11</span> Now [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) and
[Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md) were old and well stricken in age; and it
ceased to be with [Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md) after the manner of
women.  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore [Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md)
laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have
pleasure, my lord being old also?  

<span id="013">13</span> And the LORD said unto
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), Wherefore did
[Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md) laugh, saying, Shall I of a
[surety](../ebd/ebd353.htm#005.md) bear a child, which am old?  

<span id="014">14</span> Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time
appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and
[Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md) shall have a son.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then [Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md) denied,
saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou
didst laugh.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the men rose up from thence, and looked
toward [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004.md): and
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) went with them to bring them on the
way.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the LORD said, Shall I hide from
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) that thing which I do;  

<span id="018">18</span> Seeing that [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md)
shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of
the earth shall be blessed in him?  

<span id="019">19</span> For I know him, that he will command his
children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the
LORD, to do [justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007.md) and judgment; that the LORD
may bring upon [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) that which he hath
spoken of him.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the LORD said, Because the cry of
[Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004) and [Gomorrah](../ebd/ebd152.htm#007.md) is
great, and because their [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) is very
grievous;  

<span id="021">21</span> I will go down now, and see whether they have
done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and
if not, I will know.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the men turned their faces from thence, and
went toward [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004.md): but
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) stood yet before the LORD.  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) drew near,
and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?  

<span id="024">24</span> Peradventure there be fifty righteous within
the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty
righteous that are therein?  

<span id="025">25</span> That be far from thee to do after this manner,
to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be
as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the
[Judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) of all the earth do right?  

<span id="026">26</span> And the LORD said, If I find in
[Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004.md) fifty righteous within the city, then I
will spare all the place for their sakes.  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) answered
and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which
am but [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) and
[ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000.md):  

<span id="028">28</span> Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty
righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said,
If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.  

<span id="029">29</span> And he spake unto him yet again, and said,
Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not
do it for forty's sake.  

<span id="030">30</span> And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be
angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there.
And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.  

<span id="031">31</span> And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me
to speak unto the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there.
And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.  

<span id="032">32</span> And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and
I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there.
And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.  

<span id="033">33</span> And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had
left communing with [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md): and
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) returned unto his place.
