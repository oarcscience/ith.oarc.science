### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass after this, that
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) the son of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) had a fair sister, whose name was
[Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003); and [Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md) the
son of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) loved her.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md) was so vexed,
that he fell sick for his sister [Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003.md); for she
was a [virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009.md); and
[Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md) thought it hard for him to do anything to
her.  

<span id="003">3</span> But [Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md) had a friend,
whose name was [Jonadab](../ebd/ebd210.htm#006.md), the son of
[Shimeah](../ebd/ebd338.htm#001.md) David's brother: and
[Jonadab](../ebd/ebd210.htm#006.md) was a very subtil man.  

<span id="004">4</span> And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the
king's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And
[Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md) said unto him, I love
[Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003.md), my brother Absalom's sister.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Jonadab](../ebd/ebd210.htm#006.md) said unto
him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy
father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister
[Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003.md) come, and give me meat, and
[dress](../ebd/ebd107.htm#008.md) the meat in my sight, that I may see it,
and eat it at her hand.  

<span id="006">6</span> So [Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md) lay down, and
made himself sick: and when the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) was come
to see him, [Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md) said unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), I pray thee, let
[Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003.md) my sister come, and make me a couple of
cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) sent home to
[Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003.md), saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's
house, and [dress](../ebd/ebd107.htm#008.md) him meat.  

<span id="008">8</span> So [Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003.md) went to her
brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took
[flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001.md), and kneaded it, and made cakes in his
sight, and did [bake](../ebd/ebd042.htm#001.md) the cakes.  

<span id="009">9</span> And she took a [pan](../ebd/ebd283.htm#009.md), and
poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And
[Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md) said, Have out all men from me. And they
went out every man from him.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md) said unto
[Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003.md), Bring the meat into the
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md), that I may eat of thine hand. And
[Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003.md) took the cakes which she had made, and
brought them into the [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md) to
[Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md) her brother.  

<span id="011">11</span> And when she had brought them unto him to eat,
he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.  

<span id="012">12</span> And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not
force me; for no such thing ought to be done in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): do not thou this folly.  

<span id="013">13</span> And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go?
and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md). Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md); for he will not withhold me from
thee.  

<span id="014">14</span> Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice:
but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then [Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md) hated her
exceedingly; so that the [hatred](../ebd/ebd167.htm#002.md) wherewith he
hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And
[Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md) said unto her, Arise, be gone.  

<span id="016">16</span> And she said unto him, There is no cause: this
evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto
me. But he would not hearken unto her.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then he called his servant that ministered unto
him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after
her.  

<span id="018">18</span> And she had a garment of divers colours upon
her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins
apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after
her.  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003.md) put
[ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000.md) on her head, and
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) her garment of divers colours that was on
her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) her
brother said unto her, Hath [Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md) thy brother
been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother;
regard not this thing. So [Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003.md) remained
desolate in her brother Absalom's house.  

<span id="021">21</span> But when [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) heard of all these things, he was very
wroth.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) spake unto
his brother [Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md) neither good nor bad: for
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008) hated [Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md),
because he had forced his sister [Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And it came to pass after two full years, that
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which
is beside [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md): and
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) invited all the king's sons.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) came to
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and said, Behold now, thy servant
hath sheepshearers; let the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), I beseech
thee, and his servants go with thy servant.  

<span id="025">25</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said to
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md), Nay, my son, let us not all now go,
lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would
not go, but blessed him.  

<span id="026">26</span> Then said [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md), If
not, I pray thee, let my brother [Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md) go with
us. And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said unto him, Why should he
go with thee?  

<span id="027">27</span> But [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) pressed
him, that he let [Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md) and all the king's sons
go with him.  

<span id="028">28</span> Now [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) had
commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry
with [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), and when I say unto you, Smite
[Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md); then kill him, fear not: have not I
commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.  

<span id="029">29</span> And the servants of
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008) did unto [Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md)
as [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) had commanded. Then all the king's
sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his
[mule](../ebd/ebd262.htm#001.md), and fled.  

<span id="030">30</span> And it came to pass, while they were in the
way, that tidings came to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), saying,
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) hath slain all the king's sons, and
there is not one of them left.  

<span id="031">31</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) arose,
and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood
by with their clothes [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> And [Jonadab](../ebd/ebd210.htm#006.md), the son
of [Shimeah](../ebd/ebd338.htm#001.md) David's brother, answered and said,
Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the
king's sons; for [Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md) only is dead: for by the
appointment of [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) this hath been
determined from the day that he forced his sister
[Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> Now therefore let not my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) take the thing to his heart, to think that
all the king's sons are dead: for [Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md) only is
dead.  

<span id="034">34</span> But [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) fled. And
the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and,
behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.  

<span id="035">35</span> And [Jonadab](../ebd/ebd210.htm#006.md) said unto
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), Behold, the king's sons come: as thy
servant said, so it is.  

<span id="036">36</span> And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an
end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their
voice and wept: and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) also and all his
servants wept very sore.  

<span id="037">37</span> But [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) fled, and
went to [Talmai](../ebd/ebd358.htm#001.md), the son of
[Ammihud](../ebd/ebd020.htm#007), [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Geshur](../ebd/ebd147.htm#001). And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
mourned for his son every day.  

<span id="038">38</span> So [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) fled, and
went to [Geshur](../ebd/ebd147.htm#001.md), and was there three years.  

<span id="039">39</span> And the soul of [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) longed to go forth unto
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md): for he was comforted concerning
[Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004.md), seeing he was dead.
