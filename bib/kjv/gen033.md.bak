### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 33

<span id="001">1</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) lifted up his
eyes, and looked, and, behold, [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) came, and
with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto
[Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006), and unto [Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004.md),
and unto the two handmaids.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he put the handmaids and their children
foremost, and [Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006.md) and her children after, and
[Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) and [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md)
hindermost.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he passed over before them, and bowed
himself to the ground [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times, until he
came near to his brother.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) ran to meet
him, and embraced him, and fell on his [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md),
and kissed him: and they wept.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and
the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The
children which God hath graciously given thy servant.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then the handmaidens came near, they and their
children, and they bowed themselves.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006.md) also with her
children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) near and
[Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004.md), and they bowed themselves.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove
which I met? And he said, These are to find
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) in the sight of my lord.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) said, I have
enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) said, Nay, I
pray thee, if now I have found [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) in thy
sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy
face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with
me.  

<span id="011">11</span> Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought
to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have
enough. And he urged him, and he took it.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he said, Let us take our
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md), and let us go, and I will go before
thee.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the
children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me:
and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.  

<span id="014">14</span> Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his
servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) that goeth before me and the children be
able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto
[Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) said, Let me
now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What
needeth it? let me find [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) in the sight of
my lord.  

<span id="016">16</span> So [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) returned that
day on his way unto [Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) journeyed to
[Succoth](../ebd/ebd352.htm#008.md), and built him an house, and made
booths for his [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md): therefore the name of
the place is called [Succoth](../ebd/ebd352.htm#008.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) came to
[Shalem](../ebd/ebd330.htm#004.md), a city of
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md), which is in the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md), when he came from Padanaram; and
pitched his [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) before the city.  

<span id="019">19</span> And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had
spread his [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md), at the hand of the children of
[Hamor](../ebd/ebd161.htm#004.md), Shechem's father, for an hundred
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md) of money.  

<span id="020">20</span> And he erected there an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), and called it EleloheIsrael.
