### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> Better is the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) that
walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a
fool.  

<span id="002">2</span> Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is
not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.  

<span id="003">3</span> The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and
his heart fretteth against the LORD.  

<span id="004">4</span> Wealth maketh many friends; but the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) is separated from his neighbour.  

<span id="005">5</span> A false [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) shall
not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.  

<span id="006">6</span> Many will intreat the favour of the
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md): and every man is a friend to him that
giveth gifts.  

<span id="007">7</span> All the brethren of the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) do hate him: how much more do his friends
go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to
him.  

<span id="008">8</span> He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he
that keepeth understanding shall find good.  

<span id="009">9</span> A false [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) shall
not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.  

<span id="010">10</span> Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for
a servant to have rule over princes.  

<span id="011">11</span> The discretion of a man deferreth his
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md); and it is his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) to pass over a transgression.  

<span id="012">12</span> The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion;
but his favour is as [dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md) upon the
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> A foolish son is the calamity of his father:
and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.  

<span id="014">14</span> House and riches are the inheritance of
fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD.  

<span id="015">15</span> Slothfulness casteth into a
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer
hunger.  

<span id="016">16</span> He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own
soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die.  

<span id="017">17</span> He that hath pity upon the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he
hath given will he pay him again.  

<span id="018">18</span> Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let
not thy soul spare for his crying.  

<span id="019">19</span> A man of great wrath shall suffer
[punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005.md): for if thou deliver him, yet thou
must do it again.  

<span id="020">20</span> Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that
thou mayest be [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) in thy latter end.  

<span id="021">21</span> There are many devices in a man's heart;
nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.  

<span id="022">22</span> The desire of a man is his kindness: and a
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) man is better than a liar.  

<span id="023">23</span> The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he
that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.  

<span id="024">24</span> A slothful man hideth his hand in his
[bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md), and will not so much as bring it to his
mouth again.  

<span id="025">25</span> Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware:
and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand
knowledge.  

<span id="026">26</span> He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away
his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.  

<span id="027">27</span> Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that
causeth to err from the words of knowledge.  

<span id="028">28</span> An ungodly [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md)
scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.  

<span id="029">29</span> Judgments are prepared for scorners, and
[stripes](../ebd/ebd352.htm#005.md) for the back of fools.
