### King James Version: Acts Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) was consenting
unto his death. And at that time there was a great
[persecution](../ebd/ebd290.htm#007.md) against the church which was at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md); and they were all scattered abroad
throughout the regions of Judaea and [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md),
except the apostles.  

<span id="002">2</span> And devout men carried
[Stephen](../ebd/ebd351.htm#002) to his [burial](../ebd/ebd066.htm#008.md),
and made great [lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005.md) over him.  

<span id="003">3</span> As for [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), he made
havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and
women committed them to [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Therefore they that were scattered abroad went
every where preaching the word.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008.md) went down
to the city of [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md), and preached
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) unto them.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the people with one accord gave heed unto
those things which [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008.md) spake, hearing and
seeing the miracles which he did.  

<span id="007">7</span> For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice,
came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with
palsies, and that were lame, were healed.  

<span id="008">8</span> And there was great joy in that city.  

<span id="009">9</span> But there was a certain man, called
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md), which beforetime in the same city used
sorcery, and bewitched the people of [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md),
giving out that himself was some great one:  

<span id="010">10</span> To whom they all gave heed, from the least to
the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.  

<span id="011">11</span> And to him they had regard, because that of
long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.  

<span id="012">12</span> But when they believed
[Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008.md) preaching the things concerning the
kingdom of God, and the name of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), they were baptized, both men and
women.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md) himself
believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with
[Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008.md), and wondered, beholding the miracles
and signs which were done.  

<span id="014">14</span> Now when the apostles which were at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) heard that
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md) had received the word of God, they sent
unto them [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) and John:  

<span id="015">15</span> Who, when they were come down, prayed for them,
that they might receive the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md):  

<span id="016">16</span> (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them:
only they were baptized in the name of the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)..md)  

<span id="017">17</span> Then laid they their hands on them, and they
received the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And when [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md) saw
that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md) was given, he offered them money,  

<span id="019">19</span> Saying, Give me also this power, that on
whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> But [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) said unto
him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005.md) of God may be purchased with money.  

<span id="021">21</span> Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter:
for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.  

<span id="022">22</span> Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and
pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.  

<span id="023">23</span> For I perceive that thou art in the
[gall](../ebd/ebd142.htm#000.md) of bitterness, and in the
[bond](../ebd/ebd062.htm#001.md) of iniquity.  

<span id="024">24</span> Then answered [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md),
and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye
have spoken come upon me.  

<span id="025">25</span> And they, when they had testified and preached
the word of the Lord, returned to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md),
and preached the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) in many
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md) of the
[Samaritans](../ebd/ebd320.htm#005.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
Lord spake unto [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008.md), saying, Arise, and go
toward the south unto the way that goeth down from
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) unto [Gaza](../ebd/ebd144.htm#003.md),
which is [desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of
[Ethiopia](../ebd/ebd126.htm#005), an [eunuch](../ebd/ebd126.htm#008.md) of
great authority under [Candace](../ebd/ebd070.htm#009.md)
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md) of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of
all her treasure, and had come to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) for
to [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md),  

<span id="028">28</span> Was returning, and
[sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009) in his [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md)
read [Esaias](../ebd/ebd124.htm#003.md) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> Then the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) said
unto [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008.md), Go near, and join thyself to this
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008.md) ran thither
to him, and heard him read the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md)
[Esaias](../ebd/ebd124.htm#003.md), and said, Understandest thou what thou
readest?  

<span id="031">31</span> And he said, How can I, except some man should
guide me? And he desired [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008.md) that he would
come up and sit with him.  

<span id="032">32</span> The place of the
[scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005.md) which he read was this, He was led as
a [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) to the slaughter; and like a
[lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003) [dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002.md) before his
shearer, so opened he not his mouth:  

<span id="033">33</span> In his humiliation his judgment was taken away:
and who shall declare his [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md)? for his
life is taken from the earth.  

<span id="034">34</span> And the [eunuch](../ebd/ebd126.htm#008.md)
answered [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008.md), and said, I pray thee, of whom
speaketh the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) this? of himself, or of
some other man?  

<span id="035">35</span> Then [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008.md) opened his
mouth, and began at the same [scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005.md), and
preached unto him [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="036">36</span> And as they went on their way, they came unto a
certain water: and the [eunuch](../ebd/ebd126.htm#008.md) said, See, here
is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?  

<span id="037">37</span> And [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008.md) said, If
thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and
said, I believe that [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) is the Son of God.  

<span id="038">38</span> And he commanded the
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md) to stand still: and they went down both
into the water, both [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008.md) and the
[eunuch](../ebd/ebd126.htm#008.md); and he baptized him.  

<span id="039">39</span> And when they were come up out of the water,
the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the Lord caught away
[Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008.md), that the
[eunuch](../ebd/ebd126.htm#008.md) saw him no more: and he went on his way
rejoicing.  

<span id="040">40</span> But [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008.md) was found
at [Azotus](../ebd/ebd038.htm#001.md): and passing through he preached in
all the cities, till he came to [Caesarea](../ebd/ebd068.htm#003.md).
