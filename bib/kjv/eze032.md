### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 32

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the
twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD
came unto me, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Son of man, take up a
[lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005) for
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and say unto him, Thou art like a young
lion of the nations, and thou art as a [whale](../ebd/ebd380.htm#009) in
the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the
waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers.  

<span id="003">3</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread
out my [net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002) over thee with a company of many
people; and they shall bring thee up in my
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002).  

<span id="004">4</span> Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will
cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) to remain upon thee, and I will fill the
beasts of the whole earth with thee.  

<span id="005">5</span> And I will lay thy
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) upon the mountains, and fill the valleys
with thy height.  

<span id="006">6</span> I will also water with thy
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) the land wherein thou swimmest, even to
the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and make the
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008) thereof dark; I will cover the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) with a [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001), and
the [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004) shall not give her light.  

<span id="008">8</span> All the bright lights of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) will I make dark over thee, and set
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="009">9</span> I will also vex the hearts of many people, when
I shall bring thy [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) among the
nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.  

<span id="010">10</span> Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee,
and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish
my [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) before them; and they shall tremble at
every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.  

<span id="011">11</span> For thus saith the Lord GOD; The
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) shall come upon thee.  

<span id="012">12</span> By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy
multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they
shall spoil the pomp of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and all the
multitude thereof shall be destroyed.  

<span id="013">13</span> I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from
beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any
more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then will I make their waters
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008), and cause their rivers to run like oil,
saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="015">15</span> When I shall make the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) desolate, and the country shall be
destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that
dwell therein, then shall they know that I am the LORD.  

<span id="016">16</span> This is the
[lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005) wherewith they shall lament her:
the daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for
her, even for [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and for all her multitude,
saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="017">17</span> It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in
the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="018">18</span> Son of man, wail for the multitude of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and cast them down, even her, and the
daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth,
with them that go down into the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007).  

<span id="019">19</span> Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be
thou laid with the uncircumcised.  

<span id="020">20</span> They shall fall in the midst of them that are
slain by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003): she is delivered to the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003): draw her and all her multitudes.  

<span id="021">21</span> The strong among the mighty shall speak to him
out of the midst of [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003) with them that help
him: they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="022">22</span> [Asshur](../ebd/ebd035.htm#002) is there and
all her company: his graves are about him: all of them slain, fallen by
the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003):  

<span id="023">23</span> Whose graves are set in the sides of the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007), and her company is round about her
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008): all of them slain, fallen by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), which caused terror in the land of the
living.  

<span id="024">24</span> There is [Elam](../ebd/ebd114.htm#003) and all
her multitude round about her [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008), all of
them slain, fallen by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), which are gone
down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused
their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame
with them that go down to the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007).  

<span id="025">25</span> They have set her a bed in the midst of the
slain with all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of
them uncircumcised, slain by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003): though
their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne
their shame with them that go down to the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007):
he is put in the midst of them that be slain.  

<span id="026">26</span> There is [Meshech](../ebd/ebd250.htm#008),
[Tubal](../ebd/ebd373.htm#005), and all her multitude: her graves are
round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), though they caused their terror in the
land of the living.  

<span id="027">27</span> And they shall not lie with the mighty that are
fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003) with their weapons of war: and they have
laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon
their bones, though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of
the living.  

<span id="028">28</span> Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the
uncircumcised, and shalt lie with them that are slain with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="029">29</span> There is [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001), her
kings, and all her princes, which with their might are laid by them that
were slain by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003): they shall lie with
the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007).  

<span id="030">30</span> There be the princes of the north, all of them,
and all the Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their
terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with
them that be slain by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and bear their
shame with them that go down to the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007).  

<span id="031">31</span> [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) shall see
them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) and all his army slain by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="032">32</span> For I have caused my terror in the land of the
living: and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them
that are slain with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), even
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) and all his multitude, saith the Lord
GOD.
