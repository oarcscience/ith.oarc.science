### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> [Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008.md) was eight years
old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md). And his mother's name was Jedidah,
the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he did that which was right in the sight of
the LORD, and walked in all the way of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.  

<span id="003">3</span> And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008.md), that the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) sent [Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004.md) the
son of Azaliah, the son of [Meshullam](../ebd/ebd251.htm#001.md), the
scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,  

<span id="004">4</span> Go up to [Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006.md) the
high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), that he may sum the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) which is brought into the house of the
LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people:  

<span id="005">5</span> And let them deliver it into the hand of the
doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and
let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the
LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,  

<span id="006">6</span> Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and
to buy timber and hewn [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) to repair the
house.  

<span id="007">7</span> Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of
the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt
faithfully.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006.md) the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) said unto
[Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004.md) the scribe, I have found the book of
the law in the house of the LORD. And [Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006.md)
gave the book to [Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004.md), and he read it.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004.md) the scribe
came to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and brought the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) word again, and said, Thy servants have
gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it
into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the
house of the LORD.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004.md) the scribe
shewed the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), saying,
[Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
hath delivered me a book. And [Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004.md) read it
before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And it came to pass, when the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) had heard the words of the book of the
law, that he [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) his clothes.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) commanded
[Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md),
and [Ahikam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#001.md) the son of
[Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004), and [Achbor](../ebd/ebd006.htm#007.md)
the son of [Michaiah](../ebd/ebd253.htm#000.md), and
[Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004.md) the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of
the king's, saying,  

<span id="013">13</span> Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the
people, and for all [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), concerning the words
of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is
kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the
words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written
concerning us.  

<span id="014">14</span> So [Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006.md) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and [Ahikam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#001.md),
and [Achbor](../ebd/ebd006.htm#007.md), and
[Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004.md), and Asahiah, went unto
[Huldah](../ebd/ebd184.htm#005.md) the prophetess, the wife of
[Shallum](../ebd/ebd330.htm#008.md) the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas,
keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) in the college;.md) and they communed
with her.  

<span id="015">15</span> And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), Tell the man that sent you to me,  

<span id="016">16</span> Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil
upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of
the book which the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) hath read:  

<span id="017">17</span> Because they have forsaken me, and have burned
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) unto other gods, that they might
provoke me to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) with all the works of their
hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall
not be quenched.  

<span id="018">18</span> But to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) which sent you to enquire of the LORD,
thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), As touching the words which thou hast
heard;  

<span id="019">19</span> Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast
humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against
this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become
a desolation and a [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md), and hast
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) thy clothes, and wept before me; I also
have heard thee, saith the LORD.  

<span id="020">20</span> Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy
fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md) in peace; and thine eyes shall not see
all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) word again.
