### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the
land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations
before thee, the [Hittites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#006), and the Girgashites,
and the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006), and the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007), and the
[Perizzites](../ebd/ebd290.htm#006), and the
[Hivites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#007), and the
[Jebusites](../ebd/ebd199.htm#004), [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
nations greater and mightier than thou;  

<span id="002">2</span> And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them
before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt
make no [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with them, nor shew
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) unto them:  

<span id="003">3</span> Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy
daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou
take unto thy son.  

<span id="004">4</span> For they will turn away thy son from following
me, that they may serve other gods: so will the
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) of the LORD be kindled against you, and
destroy thee suddenly.  

<span id="005">5</span> But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall
destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their
groves, and burn their graven images with fire.  

<span id="006">6</span> For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy
God: the LORD thy God hath [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) thee to be a
special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of
the earth.  

<span id="007">7</span> The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor
choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were
the fewest of all people:  

<span id="008">8</span> But because the LORD loved you, and because he
would keep the [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) which he had sworn unto
your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and
redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="009">9</span> Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God,
the [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) God, which keepeth
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) and [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005)
with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand
generations;  

<span id="010">10</span> And repayeth them that hate him to their face,
to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will
repay him to his face.  

<span id="011">11</span> Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and
the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do
them.  

<span id="012">12</span> Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken
to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall
keep unto thee the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) and the
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) which he sware unto thy fathers:  

<span id="013">13</span> And he will love thee, and
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) thee, and multiply thee: he will also
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of thy
womb, and the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of thy land, thy
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006), and thy [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000),
and thine oil, the increase of thy [kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000), and
the flocks of thy [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), in the land which he
sware unto thy fathers to give thee.  

<span id="014">14</span> Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there
shall not be male or female [barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007) among you,
or among your [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002).  

<span id="015">15</span> And the LORD will take away from thee all
sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), which thou knowest, upon thee; but will
lay them upon all them that hate thee.  

<span id="016">16</span> And thou shalt consume all the people which the
LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them:
neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009) unto thee.  

<span id="017">17</span> If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations
are more than I; how can I dispossess them?  

<span id="018">18</span> Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt
well remember what the LORD thy God did unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), and unto all
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009);  

<span id="019">19</span> The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and
the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out
arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy
God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.  

<span id="020">20</span> Moreover the LORD thy God will send the
[hornet](../ebd/ebd182.htm#004) among them, until they that are left,
and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.  

<span id="021">21</span> Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the
LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the LORD thy God will put out those nations
before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once,
lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.  

<span id="023">23</span> But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto
thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004), until they be destroyed.  

<span id="024">24</span> And he shall deliver their kings into thine
hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006): there shall no man be able to stand
before thee, until thou have destroyed them.  

<span id="025">25</span> The graven images of their gods shall ye burn
with fire: thou shalt not desire the [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) or
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) that is on them, nor take it unto thee,
lest thou be snared therin: for it is an
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) to the LORD thy God.  

<span id="026">26</span> Neither shalt thou bring an
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) into thine house, lest thou be a
cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt
utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.
