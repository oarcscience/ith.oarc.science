### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) answered and
said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice:
for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the LORD said unto him, What is that in
thine hand? And he said, A rod.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast
it on the ground, and it became a [serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009.md); and
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) fled from before it.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Put forth thine hand, and take it by the
tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in
his hand:  

<span id="005">5</span> That they may believe that the LORD God of their
fathers, the God of [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), the God of
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md), and the God of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), hath appeared unto thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now
thine hand into thy [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md). And he put his hand
into his [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md): and when he took it out,
behold, his hand was leprous as [snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And he said, Put thine hand into thy
[bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md) again. And he put his hand into his
[bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md) again; and plucked it out of his
[bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md), and, behold, it was turned again as his
other [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And it shall come to pass, if they will not
believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they
will believe the voice of the latter sign.  

<span id="009">9</span> And it shall come to pass, if they will not
believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou
shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and
the water which thou takest out of the river shall become
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) upon the dry land.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said unto
the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since
thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a
slow tongue.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's
mouth? or who maketh the [dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002.md), or deaf, or the
seeing, or the [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md)? have not I the LORD?  

<span id="012">12</span> Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth,
and teach thee what thou shalt say.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by
the hand of him whom thou wilt send.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) of the
LORD was kindled against [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), and he said, Is
not [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) the [Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009.md)
thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh
forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his
heart.  

<span id="015">15</span> And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in
his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will
teach you what ye shall do.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people:
and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou
shalt be to him instead of God.  

<span id="017">17</span> And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand,
wherewith thou shalt do signs.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) went and
returned to [Jethro](../ebd/ebd206.htm#000.md) his father in law, and said
unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are
in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and see whether they be yet alive.
And [Jethro](../ebd/ebd206.htm#000.md) said to
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Go in peace.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) in [Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md), Go,
return into [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): for all the men are dead
which sought thy life.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) took his
wife and his sons, and set them upon an [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md),
and he returned to the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): and
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) took the rod of God in his hand.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), When thou goest to return into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), see that thou do all those wonders
before [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), which I have put in thine hand:
but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.  

<span id="022">22</span> And thou shalt say unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), Thus saith the LORD,
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) is my son, even my firstborn:  

<span id="023">23</span> And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may
serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son,
even thy firstborn.  

<span id="024">24</span> And it came to pass by the way in the
[inn](../ebd/ebd188.htm#004.md), that the LORD met him, and sought to kill
him.  

<span id="025">25</span> Then [Zipporah](../ebd/ebd394.htm#008.md) took a
sharp [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), and cut off the foreskin of her
son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou
to me.  

<span id="026">26</span> So he let him go: then she said, A bloody
husband thou art, because of the
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And the LORD said to
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), Go into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) to meet
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md). And he went, and met him in the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) of God, and kissed him.  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) told
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) all the words of the LORD who had sent
him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) went and gathered together all the elders
of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) spake all
the words which the LORD had spoken unto [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md),
and did the signs in the sight of the people.  

<span id="031">31</span> And the people believed: and when they heard
that the LORD had visited the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and that he had looked upon their
affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.
