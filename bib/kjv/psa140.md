### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 140

<span id="001">1</span> Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve
me from the violent man;  

<span id="002">2</span> Which imagine mischiefs in their heart;
continually are they gathered together for war.  

<span id="003">3</span> They have sharpened their tongues like a
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009.md); adders'
[poison](../ebd/ebd297.htm#009.md) is under their lips.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked;
preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my
goings.  

<span id="005">5</span> The proud have hid a
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009.md) for me, and cords; they have spread a
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002.md) by the wayside; they have set gins for me.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the
voice of my supplications, O LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> O GOD the Lord, the strength of my
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md), thou hast covered my head in the day
of battle.  

<span id="008">8</span> Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked:
further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> As for the head of those that compass me about,
let the mischief of their own lips cover them.  

<span id="010">10</span> Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be
cast into the fire; into [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) pits, that they
rise not up again.  

<span id="011">11</span> Let not an evil speaker be established in the
earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.  

<span id="012">12</span> I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of
the afflicted, and the right of the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy
name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.
