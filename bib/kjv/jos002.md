### King James Version: Joshua Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) the son of
[Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006) sent out of
[Shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) two men to spy secretly, saying, Go
view the land, even [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008). And they went, and
came into an harlot's house, named [Rahab](../ebd/ebd305.htm#006), and
lodged there.  

<span id="002">2</span> And it was told the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008),
saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to search out the country.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008) sent unto
[Rahab](../ebd/ebd305.htm#006), saying, Bring forth the men that are
come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to
search out all the country.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the woman took the two men, and hid them,
and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they
were:  

<span id="005">5</span> And it came to pass about the time of shutting
of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), when it was dark, that the men
went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for
ye shall overtake them.  

<span id="006">6</span> But she had brought them up to the roof of the
house, and hid them with the stalks of [flax](../ebd/ebd135.htm#004),
which she had laid in order upon the roof.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the men pursued after them the way to
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) unto the fords: and as soon as they
which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008).  

<span id="008">8</span> And before they were laid down, she came up unto
them upon the roof;  

<span id="009">9</span> And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD
hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and
that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.  

<span id="010">10</span> For we have heard how the LORD dried up the
water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009); and what ye did unto the two kings of
the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006), that were on the other side
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), [Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002) and
[Og](../ebd/ebd277.htm#002), whom ye utterly destroyed.  

<span id="011">11</span> And as soon as we had heard these things, our
hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man,
because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) above, and in earth beneath.  

<span id="012">12</span> Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the
LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness
unto my father's house, and give me a true token:  

<span id="013">13</span> And that ye will save alive my father, and my
mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and
deliver our lives from death.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the men answered her, Our life for yours,
if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath
given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then she let them down by a
[cord](../ebd/ebd090.htm#000) through the window: for her house was upon
the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.  

<span id="016">16</span> And she said unto them, Get you to the
mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three
days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your
way.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the men said unto her, We will be blameless
of this thine [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) which thou hast made us
swear.  

<span id="018">18</span> Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt
bind this line of [scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005) thread in the window
which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and
thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto
thee.  

<span id="019">19</span> And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of
the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009) of thy house into the street, his
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) shall be upon his head, and we will be
guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) shall be on our head, if any hand be upon
him.  

<span id="020">20</span> And if thou utter this our business, then we
will be quit of thine [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) which thou hast made
us to swear.  

<span id="021">21</span> And she said, According unto your words, so be
it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005) line in the window.  

<span id="022">22</span> And they went, and came unto the mountain, and
abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the
pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.  

<span id="023">23</span> So the two men returned, and descended from the
mountain, and passed over, and came to [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006)
the son of [Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006), and told him all things that
befell them:  

<span id="024">24</span> And they said unto
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006), Truly the LORD hath delivered into our
hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint
because of us.
