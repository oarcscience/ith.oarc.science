### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 27

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and say unto them, When a man shall
make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy
estimation.  

<span id="003">3</span> And thy estimation shall be of the male from
twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be
fifty shekels of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), after the
[shekel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#009) of the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005).  

<span id="004">4</span> And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall
be thirty shekels.  

<span id="005">5</span> And if it be from five years old even unto
twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty
shekels, and for the female ten shekels.  

<span id="006">6</span> And if it be from a month old even unto five
years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and for the female thy estimation shall
be three shekels of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000).  

<span id="007">7</span> And if it be from sixty years old and above; if
it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the
female ten shekels.  

<span id="008">8</span> But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he
shall present himself before the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and
the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall value him; according to his
ability that vowed shall the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) value
him.  

<span id="009">9</span> And if it be a [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001),
whereof men bring an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) unto the LORD,
all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.  

<span id="010">10</span> He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good
for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) for [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), then
it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.  

<span id="011">11</span> And if it be any unclean
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), of which they do not offer a
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) unto the LORD, then he shall present
the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) before the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003):  

<span id="012">12</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, who art the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), so shall it be.  

<span id="013">13</span> But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall
add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when a man shall sanctify his house to be
holy unto the LORD, then the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall estimate it, so shall it stand.  

<span id="015">15</span> And if he that sanctified it will redeem his
house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation
unto it, and it shall be his.  

<span id="016">16</span> And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some
part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be
according to the seed thereof: an [homer](../ebd/ebd181.htm#000) of
[barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003) seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000).  

<span id="017">17</span> If he sanctify his field from the year of
jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand.  

<span id="018">18</span> But if he sanctify his field after the jubile,
then the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall reckon unto him the money
according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile,
and it shall be abated from thy estimation.  

<span id="019">19</span> And if he that sanctified the field will in any
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) redeem it, then he shall add the fifth
part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to
him.  

<span id="020">20</span> And if he will not redeem the field, or if he
have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.  

<span id="021">21</span> But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile,
shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof
shall be the priest's.  

<span id="022">22</span> And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field
which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;  

<span id="023">23</span> Then the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the
jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing
unto the LORD.  

<span id="024">24</span> In the year of the jubile the field shall
return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the
possession of the land did belong.  

<span id="025">25</span> And all thy estimations shall be according to
the [shekel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#009) of the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005): twenty gerahs shall be the
[shekel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#009).  

<span id="026">26</span> Only the firstling of the beasts, which should
be the LORD's firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007), or [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005): it is
the LORD's.  

<span id="027">27</span> And if it be of an unclean
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), then he shall redeem it according to
thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be
not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.  

<span id="028">28</span> Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man
shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), and of the field of his possession,
shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the
LORD.  

<span id="029">29</span> None devoted, which shall be devoted of men,
shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.  

<span id="030">30</span> And all the [tithe](../ebd/ebd368.htm#005) of
the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy
unto the LORD.  

<span id="031">31</span> And if a man will at all redeem ought of his
tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.  

<span id="032">32</span> And concerning the
[tithe](../ebd/ebd368.htm#005) of the [herd](../ebd/ebd174.htm#009), or
of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall
be holy unto the LORD.  

<span id="033">33</span> He shall not search whether it be good or bad,
neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and
the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.  

<span id="034">34</span> These are the commandments, which the LORD
commanded [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) for the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009).
