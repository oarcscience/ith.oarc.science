### King James Version: Micah Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil
upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it
is in the power of their hand.  

<span id="002">2</span> And they covet fields, and take them by
violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his
house, even a man and his heritage.  

<span id="003">3</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against
this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your
necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.  

<span id="004">4</span> In that day shall one take up a
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md) against you, and lament with a doleful
[lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005.md), and say, We be utterly spoiled: he
hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me!
turning away he hath divided our fields.  

<span id="005">5</span> Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a
[cord](../ebd/ebd090.htm#000.md) by lot in the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy:
they shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.  

<span id="007">7</span> O thou that art named the house of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), is the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md)
of the LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to
him that walketh uprightly?  

<span id="008">8</span> Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy:
ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as
men averse from war.  

<span id="009">9</span> The women of my people have ye cast out from
their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) for ever.  

<span id="010">10</span> Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your
rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> If a man walking in the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) and falsehood do lie, saying, I will
prophesy unto thee of [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) and of strong
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md); he shall even be the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) of this people.  

<span id="012">12</span> I will surely assemble, O
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), all of thee; I will surely gather the
remnant of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); I will put them together as
the [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) of [Bozrah](../ebd/ebd063.htm#009.md),
as the flock in the midst of their [fold](../ebd/ebd136.htm#007.md): they
shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.  

<span id="013">13</span> The breaker is come up before them: they have
broken up, and have passed through the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md),
and are gone out by it: and their [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) shall
pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.
