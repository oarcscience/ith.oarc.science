### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 23

<span id="001">1</span> Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter
the [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) of my pasture! saith the LORD.  

<span id="002">2</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) against the pastors that feed my people;
Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited
them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the
LORD.  

<span id="003">3</span> And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of
all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to
their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.  

<span id="004">4</span> And I will set up shepherds over them which
shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither
shall they be lacking, saith the LORD.  

<span id="005">5</span> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I
will raise unto [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) a righteous
[Branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002), and a [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and
[justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007) in the earth.  

<span id="006">6</span> In his days [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) shall
be saved, and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall dwell safely: and
this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR
[RIGHTEOUSNESS](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the
LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD liveth, which brought up the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009);  

<span id="008">8</span> But, The LORD liveth, which brought up and which
led the seed of the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) out of the
north country, and from all countries whither I had driven them; and
they shall dwell in their own land.  

<span id="009">9</span> Mine heart within me is broken because of the
prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man
whom [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) hath overcome, because of the LORD,
and because of the words of his [holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006).  

<span id="010">10</span> For the land is full of adulterers; for because
of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) are dried up, and their course is
evil, and their force is not right.  

<span id="011">11</span> For both [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) and
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) are profane; yea, in my house have I
found their wickedness, saith the LORD.  

<span id="012">12</span> Wherefore their way shall be unto them as
slippery ways in the [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008): they shall be
driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them, even the
year of their visitation, saith the LORD.  

<span id="013">13</span> And I have seen folly in the prophets of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004); they prophesied in
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004), and caused my people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to err.  

<span id="014">14</span> I have seen also in the prophets of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) an horrible thing: they commit
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009), and walk in lies: they strengthen
also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness;
they are all of them unto me as [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004), and the
inhabitants thereof as [Gomorrah](../ebd/ebd152.htm#007).  

<span id="015">15</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts
concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with
[wormwood](../ebd/ebd384.htm#001), and make them
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) the water of
[gall](../ebd/ebd142.htm#000): for from the prophets of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) is profaneness gone forth into all
the land.  

<span id="016">16</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto
the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain:
they speak a [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000) of their own heart, and not
out of the mouth of the LORD.  

<span id="017">17</span> They say still unto them that despise me, The
LORD hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that
walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon
you.  

<span id="018">18</span> For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD,
and hath perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and
heard it?  

<span id="019">19</span> Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth
in [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002), even a grievous whirlwind: it shall
fall grievously upon the head of the wicked.  

<span id="020">20</span> The [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) of the LORD
shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the
thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it
perfectly.  

<span id="021">21</span> I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I
have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.  

<span id="022">22</span> But if they had stood in my counsel, and had
caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them
from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.  

<span id="023">23</span> Am I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a
God afar off?  

<span id="024">24</span> Can any hide himself in secret places that I
shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) and earth? saith the LORD.  

<span id="025">25</span> I have heard what the prophets said, that
prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.  

<span id="026">26</span> How long shall this be in the heart of the
prophets that prophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of
their own heart;  

<span id="027">27</span> Which think to cause my people to forget my
name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as
their fathers have forgotten my name for
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004).  

<span id="028">28</span> The [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) that hath
a [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005), let him tell a
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005); and he that hath my word, let him speak
my word faithfully. What is the [chaff](../ebd/ebd075.htm#007) to the
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000)? saith the LORD.  

<span id="029">29</span> Is not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD;
and like a [hammer](../ebd/ebd161.htm#000) that breaketh the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002)?  

<span id="030">30</span> Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets,
saith the LORD, that steal my words every one from his neighbour.  

<span id="031">31</span> Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the
LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He saith.  

<span id="032">32</span> Behold, I am against them that prophesy false
dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by
their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded
them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the
LORD.  

<span id="033">33</span> And when this people, or the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), or a [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),
shall ask thee, saying, What is the [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) of
the LORD? thou shalt then say unto them, What
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007)? I will even forsake you, saith the
LORD.  

<span id="034">34</span> And as for the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), and the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and the people, that shall say, The
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) of the LORD, I will even punish that man
and his house.  

<span id="035">35</span> Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour,
and every one to his brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What
hath the LORD spoken?  

<span id="036">36</span> And the [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) of the
LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man's word shall be his
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007); for ye have perverted the words of the
living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.  

<span id="037">37</span> Thus shalt thou say to the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), What hath the LORD answered thee? and,
What hath the LORD spoken?  

<span id="038">38</span> But since ye say, The
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) of the LORD; therefore thus saith the
LORD; Because ye say this word, The [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) of
the LORD, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) of the LORD;  

<span id="039">39</span> Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly
forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and
your fathers, and cast you out of my presence:  

<span id="040">40</span> And I will bring an
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) reproach upon you, and a perpetual
shame, which shall not be forgotten.
