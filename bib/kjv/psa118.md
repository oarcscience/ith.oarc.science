### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 118

<span id="001">1</span> O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good:
because his [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) endureth for ever.  

<span id="002">2</span> Let [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) now say,
that his [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) endureth for ever.  

<span id="003">3</span> Let the house of [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001)
now say, that his [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) endureth for ever.  

<span id="004">4</span> Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) endureth for ever.  

<span id="005">5</span> I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD
answered me, and set me in a large place.  

<span id="006">6</span> The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what
can man do unto me?  

<span id="007">7</span> The LORD taketh my part with them that help me:
therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.  

<span id="008">8</span> It is better to trust in the LORD than to put
confidence in man.  

<span id="009">9</span> It is better to trust in the LORD than to put
confidence in princes.  

<span id="010">10</span> All nations compassed me about: but in the name
of the LORD will I destroy them.  

<span id="011">11</span> They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me
about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.  

<span id="012">12</span> They compassed me about like bees: they are
quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will
destroy them.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall:
but the LORD helped me.  

<span id="014">14</span> The LORD is my strength and song, and is become
my [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003).  

<span id="015">15</span> The voice of rejoicing and
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) is in the tabernacles of the
righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.  

<span id="016">16</span> The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the
right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.  

<span id="017">17</span> I shall not die, but live, and declare the
works of the LORD.  

<span id="018">18</span> The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath
not given me over unto death.  

<span id="019">19</span> Open to me the gates of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004): I will go into them, and I will
praise the LORD:  

<span id="020">20</span> This [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the LORD,
into which the righteous shall enter.  

<span id="021">21</span> I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and
art become my [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003).  

<span id="022">22</span> The [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) which the
builders refused is become the head [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) of
the corner.  

<span id="023">23</span> This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in
our eyes.  

<span id="024">24</span> This is the day which the LORD hath made; we
will rejoice and be glad in it.  

<span id="025">25</span> Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I
beseech thee, send now prosperity.  

<span id="026">26</span> Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the
LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.  

<span id="027">27</span> God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light:
bind the [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) with cords, even unto the
horns of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006).  

<span id="028">28</span> Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou
art my God, I will exalt thee.  

<span id="029">29</span> O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good:
for his [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) endureth for ever.
