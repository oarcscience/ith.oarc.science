### King James Version: Nehemiah Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass in the month
[Nisan](../ebd/ebd273.htm#007.md), in the twentieth year of
[Artaxerxes](../ebd/ebd032.htm#006) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),
that [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) was before him: and I took up the
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), and gave it unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md). Now I had not been beforetime sad in his
presence.  

<span id="002">2</span> Wherefore the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said
unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is
nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,  

<span id="003">3</span> And said unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),
Let the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) live for ever: why should not my
countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres,
lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?  

<span id="004">4</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said unto
me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And I said unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), If it please the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and if thy servant have found favour in
thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres,
that I may build it.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said unto
me, (the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md) also
[sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009) by him,.md) For how long shall thy
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md) be? and when wilt thou return? So it
pleased the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) to send me; and I set him a
time.  

<span id="007">7</span> Moreover I said unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), If it please the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), let letters be given me to the governors
beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md);  

<span id="008">8</span> And a letter unto [Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002.md)
the keeper of the king's [forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006.md), that he may
give me timber to make beams for the gates of the
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md) which appertained to the house, and for
the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) granted me, according to the good hand of
my God upon me.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then I came to the governors beyond the river,
and gave them the king's letters. Now the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.  

<span id="010">10</span> When [Sanballat](../ebd/ebd321.htm#003.md) the
[Horonite](../ebd/ebd182.htm#006), and [Tobiah](../ebd/ebd369.htm#001.md)
the servant, the [Ammonite](../ebd/ebd021.htm#003.md), heard of it, it
grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare
of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> So I came to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and was there three days.  

<span id="012">12</span> And I arose in the night, I and some few men
with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): neither was there any
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) with me, save the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) that I rode upon.  

<span id="013">13</span> And I went out by night by the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md),
even before the [dragon](../ebd/ebd107.htm#000.md) well, and to the
[dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003.md) port, and viewed the walls of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), which were broken down, and the
gates thereof were consumed with fire.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then I went on to the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the [fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md),
and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) that was under me to pass.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then went I up in the night by the
[brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006.md), and viewed the wall, and turned back,
and entered by the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) of the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md), and so returned.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what
I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor
to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that
we are in, how [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) lieth waste, and the
gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall
of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), that we be no more a reproach.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then I told them of the hand of my God which
was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me.
And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their
hands for this good work.  

<span id="019">19</span> But when [Sanballat](../ebd/ebd321.htm#003.md) the
[Horonite](../ebd/ebd182.htm#006), and [Tobiah](../ebd/ebd369.htm#001.md)
the servant, the [Ammonite](../ebd/ebd021.htm#003.md), and
[Geshem](../ebd/ebd147.htm#000.md) the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us
to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will
ye rebel against the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)?  

<span id="020">20</span> Then answered I them, and said unto them, The
God of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), he will prosper us; therefore we
his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right,
nor memorial, in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).
