### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> And the word of [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md)
came to all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md). Now
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) went out against the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) to battle, and pitched beside
Ebenezer: and the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) pitched in
Aphek.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) put
themselves in array against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and when
they joined battle, [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) was smitten before
the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md): and they slew of the army in
the field about four thousand men.  

<span id="003">3</span> And when the people were come into the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md), the elders of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us
to day before the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)? Let us fetch the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of
the LORD out of [Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008.md) unto us, that, when it
cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.  

<span id="004">4</span> So the people sent to
[Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008.md), that they might bring from thence the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of
the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two
sons of [Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007), [Hophni](../ebd/ebd181.htm#006.md)
and [Phinehas](../ebd/ebd294.htm#003.md), were there with the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of
God.  

<span id="005">5</span> And when the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of the LORD came into the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002), all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.  

<span id="006">6</span> And when the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) heard the noise of the shout, they
said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) of the [Hebrews](../ebd/ebd171.htm#001.md)?
And they understood that the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD
was come into the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)
were afraid, for they said, God is come into the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md). And they said, Woe unto us! for there
hath not been such a thing heretofore.  

<span id="008">8</span> Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the
hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians
with all the plagues in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), that ye be not servants unto the
[Hebrews](../ebd/ebd171.htm#001.md), as they have been to you: quit
yourselves like men, and fight.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)
fought, and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) was smitten, and they fled
every man into his [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md): and there was a very
great slaughter; for there fell of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
thirty thousand footmen.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God was
taken; and the two sons of [Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007.md),
[Hophni](../ebd/ebd181.htm#006) and [Phinehas](../ebd/ebd294.htm#003.md),
were slain.  

<span id="012">12</span> And there ran a man of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md) out of the army, and came to
[Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008.md) the same day with his clothes
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md), and with earth upon his head.  

<span id="013">13</span> And when he came, lo,
[Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007.md) sat upon a seat by the wayside watching:
for his heart trembled for the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God. And
when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when [Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007.md) heard the
noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And
the man came in hastily, and told [Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> Now [Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007.md) was ninety and
eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the man said unto
[Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007.md), I am he that came out of the army, and I
fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?  

<span id="017">17</span> And the [messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005.md)
answered and said, [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) is fled before the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), and there hath been also a great
slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also,
[Hophni](../ebd/ebd181.htm#006) and [Phinehas](../ebd/ebd294.htm#003.md),
are dead, and the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God is taken.  

<span id="018">18</span> And it came to pass, when he made mention of
the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God, that he fell from off the seat
backward by the side of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md), and his
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md) brake, and he died: for he was an old man,
and heavy. And he had judged [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) forty
years.  

<span id="019">19</span> And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was
with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that
the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God was taken, and that her father
in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for
her pains came upon her.  

<span id="020">20</span> And about the time of her death the women that
stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she
answered not, neither did she regard it.  

<span id="021">21</span> And she named the child
[Ichabod](../ebd/ebd186.htm#002.md), saying, The
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) is departed from
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): because the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God was taken, and because of her father
in law and her husband.  

<span id="022">22</span> And she said, The
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) is departed from
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): for the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of
God is taken.
