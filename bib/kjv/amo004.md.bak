### King James Version: Amos Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Hear this word, ye [kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000.md)
of [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003.md), that are in the mountain of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md), which oppress the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), which crush the needy, which say to their
masters, Bring, and let us [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> The Lord GOD hath sworn by his
[holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md), that, lo, the days shall come upon
you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with
fishhooks.  

<span id="003">3</span> And ye shall go out at the breaches, every
[cow](../ebd/ebd092.htm#001.md) at that which is before her; and ye shall
cast them into the [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md), saith the LORD.  

<span id="004">4</span> Come to [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md), and
transgress; at [Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md) multiply transgression;
and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three
years:  

<span id="005">5</span> And offer a [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md)
of thanksgiving with [leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000.md), and proclaim and
publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in
all your cities, and want of [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) in all your
places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> And also I have withholden the
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) from you, when there were yet three months
to the [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md): and I caused it to
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) upon one city, and caused it not to
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) upon another city: one piece was rained
upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.  

<span id="008">8</span> So two or three cities wandered unto one city,
to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) water; but they were not satisfied:
yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.  

<span id="009">9</span> I have smitten you with blasting and
[mildew](../ebd/ebd254.htm#007.md): when your
[gardens](../ebd/ebd143.htm#001.md) and your vineyards and your
[fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001.md) trees and your
[olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009.md) trees increased, the palmerworm devoured
them: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.  

<span id="010">10</span> I have sent among you the pestilence after the
manner of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): your young men have I slain
with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), and have taken away your
horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your
nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.  

<span id="011">11</span> I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew
[Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004) and [Gomorrah](../ebd/ebd152.htm#007.md),
and ye were as a [firebrand](../ebd/ebd133.htm#007.md) plucked out of the
burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and because I will do this unto thee,
prepare to meet thy God, O [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and
createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that
maketh the morning [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), and treadeth upon
the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.
