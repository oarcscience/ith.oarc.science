### King James Version: Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O
prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of
the hands of a cunning workman.  

<span id="002">2</span> Thy navel is like a round
[goblet](../ebd/ebd151.htm#004.md), which wanteth not liquor: thy
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000) is like an [heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md)
of [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md) set about with lilies.  

<span id="003">3</span> Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are
twins.  

<span id="004">4</span> Thy [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md) is as a tower
of [ivory](../ebd/ebd192.htm#000.md); thine eyes like the fishpools in
[Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009), by the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md)
of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the tower of
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md) which looketh toward
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Thine head upon thee is like
[Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006.md), and the hair of thine head like purple;
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) is held in the galleries.  

<span id="006">6</span> How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for
delights!  

<span id="007">7</span> This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy
breasts to clusters of grapes.  

<span id="008">8</span> I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will
take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as
clusters of the [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md), and the smell of thy nose
like apples;  

<span id="009">9</span> And the roof of thy mouth like the best
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly,
causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.  

<span id="010">10</span> I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward
me.  

<span id="011">11</span> Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the
field; let us [lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002.md) in the
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us
see if the [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md) flourish, whether the tender
[grape](../ebd/ebd154.htm#004.md) appear, and the pomegranates bud forth:
there will I give thee my loves.  

<span id="013">13</span> The [mandrakes](../ebd/ebd240.htm#003.md) give a
smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old,
which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
