### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and prophesy against them,  

<span id="003">3</span> And say, Ye mountains of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus
saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers,
and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I, will bring a
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) upon you, and I will destroy your high
places.  

<span id="004">4</span> And your altars shall be desolate, and your
images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your
idols.  

<span id="005">5</span> And I will lay the dead carcases of the children
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) before their idols; and I will
scatter your bones round about your altars.  

<span id="006">6</span> In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be
laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may
be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease,
and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the slain shall fall in the midst of you,
and ye shall know that I am the LORD.  

<span id="008">8</span> Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have
some that shall escape the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) among the
nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.  

<span id="009">9</span> And they that escape of you shall remember me
among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I am
broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with
their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall lothe
themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their
abominations.  

<span id="010">10</span> And they shall know that I am the LORD, and
that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.  

<span id="011">11</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thine hand,
and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of
the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)! for they shall fall by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), by the [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000),
and by the pestilence.  

<span id="012">12</span> He that is far off shall die of the pestilence;
and he that is near shall fall by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003);
and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000): thus will I accomplish my
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) upon them.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then shall ye know that I am the LORD, when
their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars,
upon every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every
green tree, and under every thick [oak](../ebd/ebd275.htm#009), the
place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols.  

<span id="014">14</span> So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and
make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) toward Diblath, in all their
habitations: and they shall know that I am the LORD.
