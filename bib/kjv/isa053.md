### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 53

<span id="001">1</span> Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the
arm of the LORD revealed?  

<span id="002">2</span> For he shall grow up before him as a tender
plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor
comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should
desire him.  

<span id="003">3</span> He is despised and rejected of men; a man of
sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from
him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.  

<span id="004">4</span> Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our
sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and
afflicted.  

<span id="005">5</span> But he was wounded for our transgressions, he
was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon
him; and with his [stripes](../ebd/ebd352.htm#005.md) we are healed.  

<span id="006">6</span> All we like [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) have
gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath
laid on him the iniquity of us all.  

<span id="007">7</span> He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he
opened not his mouth: he is brought as a [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md)
to the slaughter, and as a [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) before her
shearers is [dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002.md), so he openeth not his
mouth.  

<span id="008">8</span> He was taken from
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md) and from judgment: and who shall declare
his [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md)? for he was cut off out of the
land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he
stricken.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he made his [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md)
with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no
violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.  

<span id="010">10</span> Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath
put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) for [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), he
shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the
LORD shall prosper in his hand.  

<span id="011">11</span> He shall see of the travail of his soul, and
shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify
many; for he shall bear their iniquities.  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore will I divide him a portion with the
great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath
poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the
transgressors; and he bare the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) of many, and
made intercession for the transgressors.
