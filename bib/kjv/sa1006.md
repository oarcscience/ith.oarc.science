### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> And the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD
was in the country of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) months.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)
called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD? tell us wherewith we shall
send it to his place.  

<span id="003">3</span> And they said, If ye send away the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), send it not empty; but in any
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) return him a trespass
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md): then ye shall be healed, and it shall
be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then said they, What shall be the trespass
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) which we shall return to him? They
answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the
number of the lords of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md): for one
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) was on you all, and on your lords.  

<span id="005">5</span> Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods,
and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) unto the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): peradventure he will lighten his hand
from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.  

<span id="006">6</span> Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the
Egyptians and [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) hardened their hearts?
when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people
go, and they departed?  

<span id="007">7</span> Now therefore make a new
[cart](../ebd/ebd073.htm#001.md), and take two milch
[kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000.md), on which there hath come no
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009), and tie the [kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000.md)
to the [cart](../ebd/ebd073.htm#001.md), and bring their calves home from
them:  

<span id="008">8</span> And take the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the
LORD, and lay it upon the [cart](../ebd/ebd073.htm#001.md); and put the
jewels of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), which ye return him for a
trespass [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), in a
[coffer](../ebd/ebd086.htm#000.md) by the side thereof; and send it away,
that it may go.  

<span id="009">9</span> And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own
coast to Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not,
then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a
chance that happened to us.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the men did so; and took two milch
[kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000.md), and tied them to the
[cart](../ebd/ebd073.htm#001.md), and shut up their calves at home:  

<span id="011">11</span> And they laid the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md)
of the LORD upon the [cart](../ebd/ebd073.htm#001.md), and the
[coffer](../ebd/ebd086.htm#000.md) with the mice of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) and the images of their emerods.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the [kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000.md) took the
straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and went along the
[highway](../ebd/ebd178.htm#005.md), lowing as they went, and turned not
aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) went after them unto the border of
Bethshemesh.  

<span id="013">13</span> And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000) [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md) in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md): and they lifted up their eyes, and saw
the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md), and rejoiced to see it.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the [cart](../ebd/ebd073.htm#001.md) came into
the field of [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), a Bethshemite, and stood
there, where there was a great [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md): and they
clave the [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) of the
[cart](../ebd/ebd073.htm#001.md), and offered the
[kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000) a burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md)
unto the LORD.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the Levites took down the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD, and the
[coffer](../ebd/ebd086.htm#000.md) that was with it, wherein the jewels of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) were, and put them on the great
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md): and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt
offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.  

<span id="016">16</span> And when the five lords of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) had seen it, they returned to
[Ekron](../ebd/ebd114.htm#001.md) the same day.  

<span id="017">17</span> And these are the golden emerods which the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) returned for a trespass
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) unto the LORD; for
[Ashdod](../ebd/ebd033.htm#006) one, for [Gaza](../ebd/ebd144.htm#003.md)
one, for Askelon one, for [Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009.md) one, for
[Ekron](../ebd/ebd114.htm#001.md) one;  

<span id="018">18</span> And the golden mice, according to the number of
all the cities of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) belonging to
the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md), even unto the great
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) of [Abel](../ebd/ebd001.htm#004.md), whereon
they set down the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD: which
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) remaineth unto this day in the field of
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), the Bethshemite.  

<span id="019">19</span> And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because
they had looked into the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD, even
he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and
the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people
with a great slaughter.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to
stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?  

<span id="021">21</span> And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of
Kirjathjearim, saying, The [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) have
brought again the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD; come ye
down, and fetch it up to you.
