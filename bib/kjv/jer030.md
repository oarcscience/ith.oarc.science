### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 30

<span id="001">1</span> The word that came to
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) from the LORD, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Thus speaketh the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saying, Write thee all the words that I
have spoken unto thee in a book.  

<span id="003">3</span> For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I
will bring again the [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) of my people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007),
saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave
to their fathers, and they shall possess it.  

<span id="004">4</span> And these are the words that the LORD spake
concerning [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and concerning
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="005">5</span> For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice
of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.  

<span id="006">6</span> Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail
with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as
a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?  

<span id="007">7</span> Alas! for that day is great, so that none is
like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved
out of it.  

<span id="008">8</span> For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the
LORD of hosts, that I will break his [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) from
off thy [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000), and will burst thy bonds, and
strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:  

<span id="009">9</span> But they shall serve the LORD their God, and
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) their [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), whom
I will raise up unto them.  

<span id="010">10</span> Therefore fear thou not, O my servant
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): for, lo, I will save thee from afar,
and thy seed from the land of their [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002);
and [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) shall return, and shall be in rest,
and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.  

<span id="011">11</span> For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save
thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered
thee, yet I will not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in
measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.  

<span id="012">12</span> For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is
incurable, and thy wound is grievous.  

<span id="013">13</span> There is none to plead thy cause, that thou
mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.  

<span id="014">14</span> All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek
thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the
chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity;
because thy sins were increased.  

<span id="015">15</span> Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy
sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy
sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.  

<span id="016">16</span> Therefore all they that devour thee shall be
devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002); and they that spoil thee shall be a
spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.  

<span id="017">17</span> For I will restore health unto thee, and I will
heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an
Outcast, saying, This is [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), whom no man
seeketh after.  

<span id="018">18</span> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again
the [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) of Jacob's tents, and have
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall
be builded upon her own [heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000), and the
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008) shall remain after the manner thereof.  

<span id="019">19</span> And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and
the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they
shall not be few; I will also [glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005) them, and
they shall not be small.  

<span id="020">20</span> Their children also shall be as aforetime, and
their [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) shall be established before
me, and I will punish all that oppress them.  

<span id="021">21</span> And their nobles shall be of themselves, and
their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause
him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that
engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.  

<span id="022">22</span> And ye shall be my people, and I will be your
God.  

<span id="023">23</span> Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth
with [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002), a continuing whirlwind: it shall
fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.  

<span id="024">24</span> The fierce [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) of
the LORD shall not return, until he hath done it, and until he have
performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider
it.
