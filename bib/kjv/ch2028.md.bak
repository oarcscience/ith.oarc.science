### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 28

<span id="001">1</span> [Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005.md) was twenty years
old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): but he did not that which was right
in the sight of the LORD, like [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) his
father:  

<span id="002">2</span> For he walked in the ways of the kings of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and made also molten images for
[Baalim](../ebd/ebd039.htm#007.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> Moreover he burnt
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) in the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md)
of the son of [Hinnom](../ebd/ebd179.htm#002.md), and burnt his children in
the fire, after the abominations of the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md)
whom the LORD had cast out before the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> He sacrificed also and burnt
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) in the high places, and on the hills,
and under every green tree.  

<span id="005">5</span> Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into
the hand of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md); and they smote him, and carried away a
great multitude of them captives, and brought them to
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md). And he was also delivered into the
hand of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), who smote him with a great slaughter.  

<span id="006">6</span> For [Pekah](../ebd/ebd288.htm#002.md) the son of
[Remaliah](../ebd/ebd310.htm#003) slew in [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)
an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men;
because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Zichri](../ebd/ebd392.htm#007.md), a mighty
man of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), slew
[Maaseiah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#007.md) the king's son, and Azrikam the
governor of the house, and [Elkanah](../ebd/ebd118.htm#005.md) that was
next to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) carried away
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001.md) of their brethren two hundred thousand,
women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and
brought the spoil to [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> But a [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) of the
LORD was there, whose name was [Oded](../ebd/ebd276.htm#009.md): and he
went out before the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) that came to
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md), and said unto them, Behold, because
the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), he hath delivered them into your hand,
and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And now ye purpose to keep under the children
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md)
for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even
with you, sins against the LORD your God?  

<span id="011">11</span> Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives
again, which ye have taken [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001.md) of your
brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then certain of the heads of the children of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000), [Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005.md) the
son of [Johanan](../ebd/ebd208.htm#009.md),
[Berechiah](../ebd/ebd053.htm#003.md) the son of
[Meshillemoth](../ebd/ebd251.htm#000.md), and
[Jehizkiah](../ebd/ebd200.htm#004.md) the son of
[Shallum](../ebd/ebd330.htm#008), and [Amasa](../ebd/ebd019.htm#003.md) the
son of [Hadlai](../ebd/ebd158.htm#000.md), stood up against them that came
from the war,  

<span id="013">13</span> And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the
captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD already,
ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass
is great, and there is fierce wrath against
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> So the armed men left the captives and the
spoil before the princes and all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And the men which were expressed by name rose
up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were
[naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003.md) among them, and arrayed them, and shod
them, and gave them to eat and to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), and
anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and
brought them to [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md), the city of palm
trees, to their brethren: then they returned to
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> At that time did [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005.md) send unto the kings of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md) to help him.  

<span id="017">17</span> For again the Edomites had come and smitten
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and carried away captives.  

<span id="018">18</span> The [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) also
had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and had taken Bethshemesh, and
[Ajalon](../ebd/ebd016.htm#002.md), and Gederoth, and
[Shocho](../ebd/ebd340.htm#006.md) with the
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md) thereof, and
[Timnah](../ebd/ebd366.htm#005.md) with the
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md) thereof,
[Gimzo](../ebd/ebd149.htm#003.md) also and the
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md) thereof: and they dwelt there.  

<span id="019">19</span> For the LORD brought
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) low because of
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); for he made
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003.md), and
transgressed sore against the LORD.  

<span id="020">20</span> And Tilgathpilneser
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md) came
unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.  

<span id="021">21</span> For [Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005.md) took away a
portion out of the house of the LORD, and out of the house of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and of the princes, and gave it unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md): but
he helped him not.  

<span id="022">22</span> And in the time of his distress did he trespass
yet more against the LORD: this is that [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> For he sacrificed unto the gods of
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md), which smote him: and he said, Because
the gods of the kings of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md) help them,
therefore will I [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) to them, that they
may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005.md) gathered
together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md) the vessels of the house of God, and
shut up the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) of the house of the LORD, and
he made him altars in every corner of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> And in every several city of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) he made high places to burn
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) unto other gods, and provoked to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) the LORD God of his fathers.  

<span id="026">26</span> Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways,
first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005.md) slept with
his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): but they brought him not into the
sepulchres of the kings of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) his son reigned in his stead.
