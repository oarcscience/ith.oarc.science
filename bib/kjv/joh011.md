### King James Version: John Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> Now a certain man was sick, named
[Lazarus](../ebd/ebd225.htm#003), of [Bethany](../ebd/ebd054.htm#007),
the town of [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009) and her sister
[Martha](../ebd/ebd242.htm#007).  

<span id="002">2</span> (It was that [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009) which
anointed the Lord with [ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007), and wiped his
feet with her hair, whose brother [Lazarus](../ebd/ebd225.htm#003) was
sick.)  

<span id="003">3</span> Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying,
Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.  

<span id="004">4</span> When [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) heard that,
he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of God, that the Son of God might be
glorified thereby.  

<span id="005">5</span> Now [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) loved
[Martha](../ebd/ebd242.htm#007), and her sister, and
[Lazarus](../ebd/ebd225.htm#003).  

<span id="006">6</span> When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he
abode two days still in the same place where he was.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let
us go into Judaea again.  

<span id="008">8</span> His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of
late sought to [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) thee; and goest thou
thither again?  

<span id="009">9</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered, Are
there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he
stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.  

<span id="010">10</span> But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth,
because there is no light in him.  

<span id="011">11</span> These things said he: and after that he saith
unto them, Our friend [Lazarus](../ebd/ebd225.htm#003) sleepeth; but I
go, that I may awake him out of sleep.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he
shall do well.  

<span id="013">13</span> Howbeit [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) spake of
his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in
sleep.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then said [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) unto
them plainly, [Lazarus](../ebd/ebd225.htm#003) is dead.  

<span id="015">15</span> And I am glad for your sakes that I was not
there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.  

<span id="016">16</span> Then said [Thomas](../ebd/ebd364.htm#005),
which is called [Didymus](../ebd/ebd103.htm#006), unto his
fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) came,
he found that he had lain in the [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008) four
days already.  

<span id="018">18</span> Now [Bethany](../ebd/ebd054.htm#007) was nigh
unto [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), about fifteen furlongs off:  

<span id="019">19</span> And many of the Jews came to
[Martha](../ebd/ebd242.htm#007) and [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009), to
comfort them concerning their brother.  

<span id="020">20</span> Then [Martha](../ebd/ebd242.htm#007), as soon
as she heard that [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) was coming, went and
met him: but [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009) sat still in the house.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then said [Martha](../ebd/ebd242.htm#007) unto
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), Lord, if thou hadst been here, my
brother had not died.  

<span id="022">22</span> But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt
ask of God, God will give it thee.  

<span id="023">23</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith unto her,
Thy brother shall rise again.  

<span id="024">24</span> [Martha](../ebd/ebd242.htm#007) saith unto him,
I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.  

<span id="025">25</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto her, I
am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he
were dead, yet shall he live:  

<span id="026">26</span> And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall
never die. Believest thou this?  

<span id="027">27</span> She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that
thou art the [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), the Son of God, which
should come into the world.  

<span id="028">28</span> And when she had so said, she went her way, and
called [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009) her sister secretly, saying, The
Master is come, and calleth for thee.  

<span id="029">29</span> As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly,
and came unto him.  

<span id="030">30</span> Now [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) was not yet
come into the town, but was in that place where
[Martha](../ebd/ebd242.htm#007) met him.  

<span id="031">31</span> The Jews then which were with her in the house,
and comforted her, when they saw [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009), that she
rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008) to weep there.  

<span id="032">32</span> Then when [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009) was
come where [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) was, and saw him, she fell
down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my
brother had not died.  

<span id="033">33</span> When [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) therefore
saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he
groaned in the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), and was troubled.  

<span id="034">34</span> And said, Where have ye laid him? They said
unto him, Lord, come and see.  

<span id="035">35</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) wept.  

<span id="036">36</span> Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!  

<span id="037">37</span> And some of them said, Could not this man,
which opened the eyes of the [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009), have caused
that even this man should not have died?  

<span id="038">38</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) therefore again
groaning in himself cometh to the [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008). It was
a [cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006), and a [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005)
lay upon it.  

<span id="039">39</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said, Take ye
away the [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005).
[Martha](../ebd/ebd242.htm#007), the sister of him that was dead, saith
unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four
days.  

<span id="040">40</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith unto her,
Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see
the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of God?  

<span id="041">41</span> Then they took away the
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) from the place where the dead was laid.
And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) lifted up his eyes, and said, Father,
I thank thee that thou hast heard me.  

<span id="042">42</span> And I knew that thou hearest me always: but
because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe
that thou hast sent me.  

<span id="043">43</span> And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a
loud voice, [Lazarus](../ebd/ebd225.htm#003), come forth.  

<span id="044">44</span> And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and
foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a
[napkin](../ebd/ebd267.htm#000). [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith
unto them, Loose him, and let him go.  

<span id="045">45</span> Then many of the Jews which came to
[Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009), and had seen the things which
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) did, believed on him.  

<span id="046">46</span> But some of them went their ways to the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008), and told them what things
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) had done.  

<span id="047">47</span> Then gathered the chief priests and the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) a [council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004),
and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.  

<span id="048">48</span> If we let him thus alone, all men will believe
on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and
nation.  

<span id="049">49</span> And one of them, named
[Caiaphas](../ebd/ebd068.htm#006), being the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) that same year, said unto them, Ye know
nothing at all,  

<span id="050">50</span> Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that
one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish
not.  

<span id="051">51</span> And this spake he not of himself: but being
high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) that year, he prophesied that
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) should die for that nation;  

<span id="052">52</span> And not for that nation only, but that also he
should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered
abroad.  

<span id="053">53</span> Then from that day forth they took counsel
together for to put him to death.  

<span id="054">54</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) therefore walked
no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to
the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), into a city called
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000), and there continued with his
disciples.  

<span id="055">55</span> And the Jews' [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005)
was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) before the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005), to purify themselves.  

<span id="056">56</span> Then sought they for
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), and spake among themselves, as they
stood in the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), What think ye, that he
will not come to the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000)?  

<span id="057">57</span> Now both the chief priests and the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) had given a commandment, that, if any
man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.
