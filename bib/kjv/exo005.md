### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> And afterward [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) went in, and told
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), Thus saith the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Let my people go, that they may hold a
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) unto me in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) said, Who
is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) go? I know not the LORD, neither will I
let [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) go.  

<span id="003">3</span> And they said, The God of the
[Hebrews](../ebd/ebd171.htm#001) hath met with us: let us go, we pray
thee, three days' [journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001) into the
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000), and [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002)
unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="004">4</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) said unto them, Wherefore do ye,
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), let
the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) said,
Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from
their burdens.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) commanded
the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers,
saying,  

<span id="007">7</span> Ye shall no more give the people
[straw](../ebd/ebd352.htm#000) to make brick, as heretofore: let them go
and gather [straw](../ebd/ebd352.htm#000) for themselves.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the [tale](../ebd/ebd357.htm#008) of the
[bricks](../ebd/ebd065.htm#000), which they did make heretofore, ye
shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be
idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) to our God.  

<span id="009">9</span> Let there more work be laid upon the men, that
they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the taskmasters of the people went out, and
their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), I will not give you
[straw](../ebd/ebd352.htm#000).  

<span id="011">11</span> Go ye, get you [straw](../ebd/ebd352.htm#000)
where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.  

<span id="012">12</span> So the people were scattered abroad throughout
all the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) to gather stubble instead
of [straw](../ebd/ebd352.htm#000).  

<span id="013">13</span> And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil
your works, your daily tasks, as when there was
[straw](../ebd/ebd352.htm#000).  

<span id="014">14</span> And the officers of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set
over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled
your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?  

<span id="015">15</span> Then the officers of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) came and cried unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus
with thy servants?  

<span id="016">16</span> There is no [straw](../ebd/ebd352.htm#000)
given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold,
thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.  

<span id="017">17</span> But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle:
therefore ye say, Let us go and do [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) to
the LORD.  

<span id="018">18</span> Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no
[straw](../ebd/ebd352.htm#000) be given you, yet shall ye deliver the
[tale](../ebd/ebd357.htm#008) of [bricks](../ebd/ebd065.htm#000).  

<span id="019">19</span> And the officers of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) did see that they were in evil case,
after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your
[bricks](../ebd/ebd065.htm#000) of your daily task.  

<span id="020">20</span> And they met [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), who stood in the way, as they came forth
from [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005):  

<span id="021">21</span> And they said unto them, The LORD look upon
you, and [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005); because ye have made our savour
to be abhorred in the eyes of [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), and in
the eyes of his servants, to put a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) in
their hand to slay us.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) returned
unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated
this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?  

<span id="023">23</span> For since I came to
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) to speak in thy name, he hath done evil
to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.
