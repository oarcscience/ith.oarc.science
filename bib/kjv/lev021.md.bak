### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Speak unto the priests the sons of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and say unto them, There shall none be
defiled for the dead among his people:  

<span id="002">2</span> But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is,
for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his
daughter, and for his brother.  

<span id="003">3</span> And for his sister a
[virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009.md), that is nigh unto him, which hath had
no husband; for her may he be defiled.  

<span id="004">4</span> But he shall not defile himself, being a chief
man among his people, to profane himself.  

<span id="005">5</span> They shall not make
[baldness](../ebd/ebd042.htm#008.md) upon their head, neither shall they
shave off the corner of their [beard](../ebd/ebd049.htm#000.md), nor make
any cuttings in their [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> They shall be holy unto their God, and not
profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by
fire, and the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) of their God, they do
offer: therefore they shall be holy.  

<span id="007">7</span> They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or
profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for
he is holy unto his God.  

<span id="008">8</span> Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he
offereth the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) of thy God: he shall be holy
unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, am holy.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the daughter of any
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), if she profane herself by playing the
whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.  

<span id="010">10</span> And he that is the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) among his brethren, upon whose head the
anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the
garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;  

<span id="011">11</span> Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor
defile himself for his father, or for his mother;  

<span id="012">12</span> Neither shall he go out of the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md), nor profane the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md) of his God; for the
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) of the anointing oil of his God is upon
him: I am the LORD.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he shall take a wife in her virginity.  

<span id="014">14</span> A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an
[harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005.md), these shall he not take: but he shall
take a [virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009.md) of his own people to wife.  

<span id="015">15</span> Neither shall he profane his seed among his
people: for I the LORD do sanctify him.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="017">17</span> Speak unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md),
saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md), let him not approach to offer the
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) of his God.  

<span id="018">18</span> For whatsoever man he be that hath a
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md), he shall not approach: a
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md) man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat
nose, or any thing superfluous,  

<span id="019">19</span> Or a man that is brokenfooted, or
brokenhanded,  

<span id="020">20</span> Or crookbackt, or a
[dwarf](../ebd/ebd109.htm#009.md), or that hath a
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md) in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed,
or hath his stones broken;  

<span id="021">21</span> No man that hath a
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md) of the seed of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md); he shall not come nigh to offer the
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) of his God.  

<span id="022">22</span> He shall eat the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md)
of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.  

<span id="023">23</span> Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come
nigh unto the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), because he hath a
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md); that he profane not my sanctuaries:
for I the LORD do sanctify them.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) told it unto
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and to his sons, and unto all the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).
