### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 30

<span id="001">1</span> I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted
me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.  

<span id="002">2</span> O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast
healed me.  

<span id="003">3</span> O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md): thou hast kept me alive, that I should
not go down to the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give
thanks at the remembrance of his [holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> For his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) endureth
but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but
joy cometh in the morning.  

<span id="006">6</span> And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be
moved.  

<span id="007">7</span> LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain
to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.  

<span id="008">8</span> I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I
made supplication.  

<span id="009">9</span> What profit is there in my
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), when I go down to the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007)? Shall the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md)
praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?  

<span id="010">10</span> Hear, O LORD, and have
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.  

<span id="011">11</span> Thou hast turned for me my mourning into
dancing: thou hast put off my [sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001.md), and
girded me with gladness;  

<span id="012">12</span> To the end that my
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) may sing praise to thee, and not be
silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.
