### King James Version: Hosea Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) is an empty
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004), he bringeth forth
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) unto himself: according to the multitude
of his [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) he hath increased the altars;
according to the [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000) of his land they have
made goodly images.  

<span id="002">2</span> Their heart is divided; now shall they be found
faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.  

<span id="003">3</span> For now they shall say, We have no
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), because we feared not the LORD; what then
should a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) do to us?  

<span id="004">4</span> They have spoken words, swearing falsely in
making a [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008): thus judgment springeth up
as [hemlock](../ebd/ebd174.htm#001) in the furrows of the field.  

<span id="005">5</span> The inhabitants of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004) shall fear because of the calves of
Bethaven: for the people thereof shall [mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004)
over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) thereof, because it is departed from
it.  

<span id="006">6</span> It shall be also carried unto
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) for a present to
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) Jareb: [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000)
shall receive shame, and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall be
ashamed of his own counsel.  

<span id="007">7</span> As for [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004), her
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) is cut off as the
[foam](../ebd/ebd136.htm#005) upon the water.  

<span id="008">8</span> The high places also of
[Aven](../ebd/ebd036.htm#009), the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), shall be destroyed: the
[thorn](../ebd/ebd364.htm#006) and the [thistle](../ebd/ebd364.htm#004)
shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains,
Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.  

<span id="009">9</span> O [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), thou hast
sinned from the days of [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008): there they
stood: the battle in [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008) against the
children of iniquity did not overtake them.  

<span id="010">10</span> It is in my desire that I should chastise them;
and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind
themselves in their two furrows.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) is as an
[heifer](../ebd/ebd171.htm#006) that is taught, and loveth to tread out
the [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006); but I passed over upon her fair
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000): I will make
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) to ride; [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)
shall plow, and [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) shall break his clods.  

<span id="012">12</span> Sow to yourselves in
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), reap in
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005); break up your fallow ground: for it is
time to seek the LORD, till he come and [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008)
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) upon you.  

<span id="013">13</span> Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped
iniquity; ye have eaten the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of lies:
because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty
men.  

<span id="014">14</span> Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy
people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as
[Shalman](../ebd/ebd330.htm#009) spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle:
the mother was dashed in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) upon her
children.  

<span id="015">15</span> So shall [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006) do
unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) utterly
be cut off.
