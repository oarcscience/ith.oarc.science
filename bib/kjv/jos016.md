### King James Version: Joshua Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> And the lot of the children of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) fell from
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) by [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008),
unto the water of [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008) on the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000), to the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) that goeth up from
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008) throughout
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006),  

<span id="002">2</span> And goeth out from
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006) to [Luz](../ebd/ebd233.htm#006), and
passeth along unto the borders of [Archi](../ebd/ebd029.htm#004) to
[Ataroth](../ebd/ebd036.htm#000),  

<span id="003">3</span> And goeth down [westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008)
to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast of Bethhoron the nether, and to
[Gezer](../ebd/ebd147.htm#004); and the goings out thereof are at the
sea.  

<span id="004">4</span> So the children of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) and
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000), took their inheritance.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the border of the children of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) according to their families was thus:
even the border of their inheritance on the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) side was Atarothaddar, unto Bethhoron the
upper;  

<span id="006">6</span> And the border went out toward the sea to
[Michmethah](../ebd/ebd253.htm#003) on the north side; and the border
went about eastward unto Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) to Janohah;  

<span id="007">7</span> And it went down from Janohah to
[Ataroth](../ebd/ebd036.htm#000), and to
[Naarath](../ebd/ebd264.htm#004), and came to
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008), and went out at
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004).  

<span id="008">8</span> The border went out from
[Tappuah](../ebd/ebd358.htm#008) [westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008) unto
the river [Kanah](../ebd/ebd215.htm#006); and the goings out thereof
were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of the children of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) by their families.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the separate cities for the children of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) were among the inheritance of the
children of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002), all the cities with their
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003).  

<span id="010">10</span> And they drave not out the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007) that dwelt in
[Gezer](../ebd/ebd147.htm#004): but the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007) dwell among the Ephraimites unto
this day, and serve under [tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006).
