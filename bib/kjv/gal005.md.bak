### King James Version: Galatians Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Stand [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) therefore in
the liberty wherewith [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) hath made us free,
and be not entangled again with the [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md) of
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Behold, I [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) say unto
you, that if ye be circumcised, [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) shall
profit you nothing.  

<span id="003">3</span> For I testify again to every man that is
circumcised, that he is a [debtor](../ebd/ebd100.htm#000.md) to do the
whole law.  

<span id="004">4</span> [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) is become of no
effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are
fallen from [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> For we through the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) wait for the hope of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) by faith.  

<span id="006">6</span> For in [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) neither
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007.md) availeth any thing, nor
uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.  

<span id="007">7</span> Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye
should not obey the truth?  

<span id="008">8</span> This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth
you.  

<span id="009">9</span> A little [leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000.md)
leaveneth the whole lump.  

<span id="010">10</span> I have confidence in you through the Lord, that
ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear
his judgment, whosoever he be.  

<span id="011">11</span> And I, brethren, if I yet preach
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007.md), why do I yet suffer
[persecution](../ebd/ebd290.htm#007.md)? then is the offence of the
[cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000.md) ceased.  

<span id="012">12</span> I would they were even cut off which trouble
you.  

<span id="013">13</span> For, brethren, ye have been called unto
liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), but by love serve one another.  

<span id="014">14</span> For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even
in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  

<span id="015">15</span> But if ye bite and devour one another, take
heed that ye be not consumed one of another.  

<span id="016">16</span> This I say then, Walk in the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), and ye shall not fulfil the
[lust](../ebd/ebd233.htm#005) of the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> For the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) lusteth
against the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), and the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) against the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md): and these are contrary the one to the
other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.  

<span id="018">18</span> But if ye be led of the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), ye are not under the law.  

<span id="019">19</span> Now the works of the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) are manifest, which are these;
[Adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009), [fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008.md),
uncleanness, lasciviousness,  

<span id="020">20</span> [Idolatry](../ebd/ebd186.htm#007.md),
[witchcraft](../ebd/ebd382.htm#007), [hatred](../ebd/ebd167.htm#002.md),
variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,  

<span id="021">21</span> Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and
such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in
time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom
of God.  

<span id="022">22</span> But the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
gentleness, [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md), faith,  

<span id="023">23</span> [Meekness](../ebd/ebd246.htm#003.md), temperance:
against such there is no law.  

<span id="024">24</span> And they that are Christ's have crucified the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) with the affections and lusts.  

<span id="025">25</span> If we live in the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), let us also walk in the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> Let us not be desirous of vain
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), provoking one another, envying one
another.
