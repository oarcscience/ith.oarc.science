### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 26

<span id="001">1</span> And the Ziphites came unto
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) to [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008),
saying, Doth not [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) hide himself in the hill
of [Hachilah](../ebd/ebd156.htm#009), which is before
[Jeshimon](../ebd/ebd205.htm#002)?  

<span id="002">2</span> Then [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) arose, and
went down to the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of
[Ziph](../ebd/ebd394.htm#004), having three thousand
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
with him, to seek [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Ziph](../ebd/ebd394.htm#004).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) pitched in the
hill of [Hachilah](../ebd/ebd156.htm#009), which is before
[Jeshimon](../ebd/ebd205.htm#002), by the way. But
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) abode in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), and he saw that
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) came after him into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005).  

<span id="004">4</span> [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) therefore sent
out [spies](../ebd/ebd349.htm#007), and understood that
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) was come in very deed.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) arose, and
came to the place where [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) had pitched: and
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) beheld the place where
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) lay, and [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002)
the son of [Ner](../ebd/ebd270.htm#007), the captain of his
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007): and [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) lay in
the trench, and the people pitched round about him.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then answered [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) and
said to [Ahimelech](../ebd/ebd014.htm#004) the Hittite, and to
[Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005) the son of
[Zeruiah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#009), brother to
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006), saying, Who will go down with me to
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) to the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002)? And
[Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005) said, I will go down with thee.  

<span id="007">7</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) and
[Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005) came to the people by night: and,
behold, [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) lay sleeping within the trench,
and his spear stuck in the ground at his
[bolster](../ebd/ebd062.htm#000): but [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) and
the people lay round about him.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then said [Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005) to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), God hath delivered thine enemy into
thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with
the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second
time.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said to
[Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005), Destroy him not: for who can stretch
forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?  

<span id="010">10</span> [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said
furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day
shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.  

<span id="011">11</span> The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth
mine hand against the LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now
the spear that is at his [bolster](../ebd/ebd062.htm#000), and the
[cruse](../ebd/ebd093.htm#004) of water, and let us go.  

<span id="012">12</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) took the
spear and the [cruse](../ebd/ebd093.htm#004) of water from Saul's
[bolster](../ebd/ebd062.htm#000); and they gat them away, and no man saw
it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008) sleep from the LORD was fallen upon
them.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) went over
to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great
space being between them:  

<span id="014">14</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) cried to the
people, and to [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) the son of
[Ner](../ebd/ebd270.htm#007), saying, Answerest thou not,
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002)? Then [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002)
answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)?  

<span id="015">15</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said to
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002), Art not thou a valiant man? and who is
like to thee in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)? wherefore then hast
thou not kept thy lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)? for there came
one of the people in to destroy the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) thy
lord.  

<span id="016">16</span> This thing is not good that thou hast done. As
the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your
master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and
the [cruse](../ebd/ebd093.htm#004) of water that was at his
[bolster](../ebd/ebd062.htm#000).  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) knew David's
voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)? And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said,
It is my voice, my lord, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="018">18</span> And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue
after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?  

<span id="019">19</span> Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) hear the words of his servant. If the LORD
have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001): but if they be the children of men,
cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day
from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other
gods.  

<span id="020">20</span> Now therefore, let not my
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) fall to the earth before the face of the
LORD: for the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) is come out to seek a
[flea](../ebd/ebd135.htm#005), as when one doth hunt a
[partridge](../ebd/ebd285.htm#007) in the mountains.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then said [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), I have
sinned: return, my son [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004): for I will no
more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day:
behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) answered and
said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over
and fetch it.  

<span id="023">23</span> The LORD render to every man his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) and his faithfulness; for the
LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth
mine hand against the LORD's anointed.  

<span id="024">24</span> And, behold, as thy life was much set by this
day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD,
and let him deliver me out of all
[tribulation](../ebd/ebd372.htm#005).  

<span id="025">25</span> Then [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) said to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), Blessed be thou, my son
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004): thou shalt both do great things, and
also shalt still prevail. So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) went on his
way, and [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) returned to his place.
