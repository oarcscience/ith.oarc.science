### King James Version: 1 Timothy Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Now the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) speaketh
expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith,
giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;  

<span id="002">2</span> Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their
[conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006.md) seared with a hot
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md);  

<span id="003">3</span> Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain
from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of
them which believe and know the truth.  

<span id="004">4</span> For every [creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004.md) of
God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with
thanksgiving:  

<span id="005">5</span> For it is sanctified by the word of God and
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these
things, thou shalt be a good [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md),
nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou
hast attained.  

<span id="007">7</span> But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and
exercise thyself rather unto [godliness](../ebd/ebd151.htm#007.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> For bodily exercise profiteth little: but
[godliness](../ebd/ebd151.htm#007.md) is profitable unto all things, having
promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.  

<span id="009">9</span> This is a [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md)
saying and worthy of all acceptation.  

<span id="010">10</span> For therefore we both labour and suffer
reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the
[Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003.md) of all men, specially of those that
believe.  

<span id="011">11</span> These things command and teach.  

<span id="012">12</span> Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an
example of the believers, in word, in
[conversation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#001.md), in
[charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009), in [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), in
faith, in purity.  

<span id="013">13</span> Till I come, give attendance to reading, to
exhortation, to doctrine.  

<span id="014">14</span> Neglect not the [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005.md)
that is in thee, which was given thee by
[prophecy](../ebd/ebd300.htm#007.md), with the laying on of the hands of
the presbytery.  

<span id="015">15</span> Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly
to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.  

<span id="016">16</span> Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine;
continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and
them that hear thee.
