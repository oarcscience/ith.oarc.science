<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For unto us was the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For if <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Neither is there any <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</A> that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A> and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Seeing then that we have a great high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, that is passed into the heavens, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> the Son of God, let us hold <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> our profession.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For we have not an high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Let us therefore come boldly unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A>, that we may obtain <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>, and find <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> to help in time of need.<BR>
