in the law of the LORD.

that seek him with the whole heart.  

<span id="003">3</span> They also do no iniquity: they walk in his
ways.

diligently.

statutes!

unto all thy commandments.  

<span id="007">7</span> I will praise thee with uprightness of heart,
when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.  

<span id="008">8</span> I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not
utterly.  

<span id="009">9</span> Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?

<span id="010">10</span> With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let
me not wander from thy commandments.

not [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) against thee.  

<span id="012">12</span> Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy
statutes.  

<span id="013">13</span> With my lips have I declared all the judgments
of thy mouth.  

<span id="014">14</span> I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies,
as much as in all riches.  

<span id="015">15</span> I will meditate in thy precepts, and have
respect unto thy ways.  

<span id="016">16</span> I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will
not forget thy word.  

<span id="017">17</span> Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may
live, and keep thy word.  

<span id="018">18</span> Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous
things out of thy law.  

<span id="019">19</span> I am a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) in the
earth: hide not thy commandments from me.  

<span id="020">20</span> My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath
unto thy judgments at all times.  

<span id="021">21</span> Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed,
which do err from thy commandments.  

<span id="022">22</span> Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I
have kept thy testimonies.  

<span id="023">23</span> Princes also did sit and speak against me: but
thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.  

<span id="024">24</span> Thy testimonies also are my delight and my
counsellors.leth.  

<span id="025">25</span> My soul cleaveth unto the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md): quicken thou me according to thy word.  

<span id="026">26</span> I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me:
teach me thy statutes.  

<span id="027">27</span> Make me to understand the way of thy precepts:
so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.  

<span id="028">28</span> My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou
me according unto thy word.  

<span id="029">29</span> Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me
thy law graciously.  

<span id="030">30</span> I have [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) the way
of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me.  

<span id="031">31</span> I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put
me not to shame.  

<span id="032">32</span> I will run the way of thy commandments, when
thou shalt enlarge my heart.  

<span id="033">33</span> Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and
I shall keep it unto the end.  

<span id="034">34</span> Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy
law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.  

<span id="035">35</span> Make me to go in the path of thy commandments;
for therein do I delight.  

<span id="036">36</span> Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not
to [covetousness](../ebd/ebd092.htm#000.md).  

<span id="037">37</span> Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and
quicken thou me in thy way.  

<span id="038">38</span> Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is
devoted to thy fear.  

<span id="039">39</span> Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy
judgments are good.  

<span id="040">40</span> Behold, I have longed after thy precepts:
quicken me in thy [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md).  

<span id="041">41</span> Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even
thy [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md), according to thy word.  

<span id="042">42</span> So shall I have wherewith to answer him that
reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.  

<span id="043">43</span> And take not the word of truth utterly out of
my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.  

<span id="044">44</span> So shall I keep thy law continually for ever
and ever.  

<span id="045">45</span> And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy
precepts.  

<span id="046">46</span> I will speak of thy testimonies also before
kings, and will not be ashamed.  

<span id="047">47</span> And I will delight myself in thy commandments,
which I have loved.  

<span id="048">48</span> My hands also will I lift up unto thy
commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.  

<span id="049">49</span> Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which
thou hast caused me to hope.  

<span id="050">50</span> This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy
word hath quickened me.  

<span id="051">51</span> The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet
have I not declined from thy law.  

<span id="052">52</span> I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and
have comforted myself.  

<span id="053">53</span> Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the
wicked that forsake thy law.  

<span id="054">54</span> Thy statutes have been my
[songs](../ebd/ebd348.htm#002.md) in the house of my pilgrimage.  

<span id="055">55</span> I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the
night, and have kept thy law.  

<span id="056">56</span> This I had, because I kept thy precepts.  

<span id="057">57</span> Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I
would keep thy words.  

<span id="058">58</span> I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be
merciful unto me according to thy word.  

<span id="059">59</span> I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto
thy testimonies.  

<span id="060">60</span> I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy
commandments.  

<span id="061">61</span> The [bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003.md) of the
wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law.  

<span id="062">62</span> At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto
thee because of thy righteous judgments.  

<span id="063">63</span> I am a companion of all them that fear thee,
and of them that keep thy precepts.  

<span id="064">64</span> The earth, O LORD, is full of thy
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md): teach me thy statutes.  

<span id="065">65</span> Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD,
according unto thy word.  

<span id="066">66</span> Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I
have believed thy commandments.  

<span id="067">67</span> Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now
have I kept thy word.  

<span id="068">68</span> Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy
statutes.  

<span id="069">69</span> The proud have forged a lie against me: but I
will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.  

<span id="070">70</span> Their heart is as [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md)
as grease; but I delight in thy law.  

<span id="071">71</span> It is good for me that I have been afflicted;
that I might learn thy statutes.  

<span id="072">72</span> The law of thy mouth is better unto me than
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) and
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md).  

<span id="073">73</span> Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give
me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.  

<span id="074">74</span> They that fear thee will be glad when they see
me; because I have hoped in thy word.  

<span id="075">75</span> I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right,
and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.  

<span id="076">76</span> Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for
my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.  

<span id="077">77</span> Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may
live: for thy law is my delight.  

<span id="078">78</span> Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt
perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy
precepts.  

<span id="079">79</span> Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and
those that have known thy testimonies.  

<span id="080">80</span> Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I
be not ashamed.  

<span id="081">81</span> My soul fainteth for thy
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md): but I hope in thy word.  

<span id="082">82</span> Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt
thou comfort me?  

<span id="083">83</span> For I am become like a
[bottle](../ebd/ebd063.htm#002.md) in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy
statutes.  

<span id="084">84</span> How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt
thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?  

<span id="085">85</span> The proud have digged pits for me, which are
not after thy law.  

<span id="086">86</span> All thy commandments are
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md): they persecute me wrongfully; help
thou me.  

<span id="087">87</span> They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I
forsook not thy precepts.  

<span id="088">88</span> Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I
keep the [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md) of thy mouth.  

<span id="089">89</span> For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="090">90</span> Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou
hast established the earth, and it abideth.  

<span id="091">91</span> They continue this day according to thine
ordinances: for all are thy servants.  

<span id="092">92</span> Unless thy law had been my delights, I should
then have perished in mine affliction.  

<span id="093">93</span> I will never forget thy precepts: for with them
thou hast quickened me.  

<span id="094">94</span> I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy
precepts.  

<span id="095">95</span> The wicked have waited for me to destroy me:
but I will consider thy testimonies.  

<span id="096">96</span> I have seen an end of all
[perfection](../ebd/ebd290.htm#001.md): but thy commandment is exceeding
broad.  

<span id="097">97</span> O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all
the day.  

<span id="098">98</span> Thou through thy commandments hast made me
wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.  

<span id="099">99</span> I have more understanding than all my teachers:
for thy testimonies are my meditation.  

<span id="100">100</span> I understand more than the ancients, because I
keep thy precepts.  

<span id="101">101</span> I have refrained my feet from every evil way,
that I might keep thy word.  

<span id="102">102</span> I have not departed from thy judgments: for
thou hast taught me.  

<span id="103">103</span> How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea,
sweeter than [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md) to my mouth!  

<span id="104">104</span> Through thy precepts I get understanding:
therefore I hate every false way.  

<span id="105">105</span> Thy word is a [lamp](../ebd/ebd223.htm#007.md)
unto my feet, and a light unto my path.  

<span id="106">106</span> I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I
will keep thy righteous judgments.  

<span id="107">107</span> I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD,
according unto thy word.  

<span id="108">108</span> Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings
of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.  

<span id="109">109</span> My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I
not forget thy law.  

<span id="110">110</span> The wicked have laid a
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009.md) for me: yet I erred not from thy
precepts.  

<span id="111">111</span> Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage
for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.  

<span id="112">112</span> I have inclined mine heart to perform thy
statutes alway, even unto the end.  

<span id="113">113</span> I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.  

<span id="114">114</span> Thou art my hiding place and my
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001.md): I hope in thy word.  

<span id="115">115</span> Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep
the commandments of my God.  

<span id="116">116</span> Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may
live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.  

<span id="117">117</span> Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I
will have respect unto thy statutes continually.  

<span id="118">118</span> Thou hast trodden down all them that err from
thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood.  

<span id="119">119</span> Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth
like [dross](../ebd/ebd108.htm#004.md): therefore I love thy testimonies.  

<span id="120">120</span> My [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) trembleth
for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.  

<span id="121">121</span> I have done judgment and
[justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007.md): leave me not to mine oppressors.  

<span id="122">122</span> Be [surety](../ebd/ebd353.htm#005.md) for thy
servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.  

<span id="123">123</span> Mine eyes fail for thy
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md), and for the word of thy
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md).  

<span id="124">124</span> Deal with thy servant according unto thy
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md), and teach me thy statutes.  

<span id="125">125</span> I am thy servant; give me understanding, that
I may know thy testimonies.  

<span id="126">126</span> It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they
have made void thy law.  

<span id="127">127</span> Therefore I love thy commandments above
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md); yea, above fine
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="128">128</span> Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning
all things to be right; and I hate every false way.  

<span id="129">129</span> Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth
my soul keep them.  

<span id="130">130</span> The entrance of thy words giveth light; it
giveth understanding unto the simple.  

<span id="131">131</span> I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed
for thy commandments.  

<span id="132">132</span> Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as
thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.  

<span id="133">133</span> Order my steps in thy word: and let not any
iniquity have dominion over me.  

<span id="134">134</span> Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will
I keep thy precepts.  

<span id="135">135</span> Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and
teach me thy statutes.  

<span id="136">136</span> Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because
they keep not thy law.  

<span id="137">137</span> Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are
thy judgments.  

<span id="138">138</span> Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are
righteous and very [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md).  

<span id="139">139</span> My [zeal](../ebd/ebd388.htm#003.md) hath consumed
me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.  

<span id="140">140</span> Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant
loveth it.  

<span id="141">141</span> I am small and despised: yet do not I forget
thy precepts.  

<span id="142">142</span> Thy [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) is
an [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md)
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), and thy law is the truth.  

<span id="143">143</span> Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet
thy commandments are my delights.  

<span id="144">144</span> The [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) of
thy testimonies is [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md): give me
understanding, and I shall live.  

<span id="145">145</span> I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD:
I will keep thy statutes.  

<span id="146">146</span> I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep
thy testimonies.  

<span id="147">147</span> I prevented the dawning of the morning, and
cried: I hoped in thy word.  

<span id="148">148</span> Mine eyes prevent the night
[watches](../ebd/ebd379.htm#003.md), that I might meditate in thy word.  

<span id="149">149</span> Hear my voice according unto thy
lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.  

<span id="150">150</span> They draw nigh that follow after mischief:
they are far from thy law.  

<span id="151">151</span> Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy
commandments are truth.  

<span id="152">152</span> Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of
old that thou hast founded them for ever.  

<span id="153">153</span> Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for
I do not forget thy law.  

<span id="154">154</span> Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me
according to thy word.  

<span id="155">155</span> [Salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) is far from
the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.  

<span id="156">156</span> Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken
me according to thy judgments.  

<span id="157">157</span> Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet
do I not decline from thy testimonies.  

<span id="158">158</span> I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved;
because they kept not thy word.  

<span id="159">159</span> Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me,
O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness.  

<span id="160">160</span> Thy word is true from the beginning: and every
one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.  

<span id="161">161</span> Princes have persecuted me without a cause:
but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.  

<span id="162">162</span> I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth
great spoil.  

<span id="163">163</span> I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I
love.  

<span id="164">164</span> [Seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times a day do
I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.  

<span id="165">165</span> Great peace have they which love thy law: and
nothing shall offend them.  

<span id="166">166</span> LORD, I have hoped for thy
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md), and done thy commandments.  

<span id="167">167</span> My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love
them exceedingly.  

<span id="168">168</span> I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies:
for all my ways are before thee.  

<span id="169">169</span> Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give
me understanding according to thy word.  

<span id="170">170</span> Let my supplication come before thee: deliver
me according to thy word.  

<span id="171">171</span> My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast
taught me thy statutes.  

<span id="172">172</span> My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy
commandments are [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md).  

<span id="173">173</span> Let thine hand help me; for I have
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) thy precepts.  

<span id="174">174</span> I have longed for thy
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md), O LORD; and thy law is my delight.  

<span id="175">175</span> Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee;
and let thy judgments help me.  

<span id="176">176</span> I have gone astray like a lost
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md); seek thy servant; for I do not forget
thy commandments.
