### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 115

<span id="001">1</span> Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy
name give [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), for thy
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md), and for thy truth's sake.  

<span id="002">2</span> Wherefore should the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) say, Where is now their God?  

<span id="003">3</span> But our God is in the heavens: he hath done
whatsoever he hath pleased.  

<span id="004">4</span> Their idols are [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md)
and [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), the work of men's hands.  

<span id="005">5</span> They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have
they, but they see not:  

<span id="006">6</span> They have ears, but they hear not: noses have
they, but they smell not:  

<span id="007">7</span> They have hands, but they handle not: feet have
they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.  

<span id="008">8</span> They that make them are like unto them; so is
every one that trusteth in them.  

<span id="009">9</span> O [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), trust thou in
the LORD: he is their help and their [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> O house of [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md),
trust in the LORD: he is their help and their
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is
their help and their [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) us; he will
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); he will [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md)
the house of [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> He will [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) them
that fear the LORD, both small and great.  

<span id="014">14</span> The LORD shall increase you more and more, you
and your children.  

<span id="015">15</span> Ye are blessed of the LORD which made
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) and earth.  

<span id="016">16</span> The [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), even the
heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth hath he given to the children of
men.  

<span id="017">17</span> The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that
go down into silence.  

<span id="018">18</span> But we will [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) the
LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD.
