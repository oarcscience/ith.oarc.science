### King James Version: Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art
fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of
goats, that appear from [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Thy teeth are like a flock of
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) that are even shorn, which came up from
the [washing](../ebd/ebd379.htm#002.md); whereof every one bear twins, and
none is [barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007.md) among them.  

<span id="003">3</span> Thy lips are like a thread of
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md), and thy speech is comely: thy temples
are like a piece of a [pomegranate](../ebd/ebd298.htm#000.md) within thy
locks.  

<span id="004">4</span> Thy [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md) is like the
tower of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) builded for an
[armoury](../ebd/ebd031.htm#008.md), whereon there hang a thousand
bucklers, all shields of mighty men.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are
twins, which feed among the lilies.  

<span id="006">6</span> Until the day break, and the shadows flee away,
I will get me to the mountain of [myrrh](../ebd/ebd263.htm#003.md), and to
the hill of [frankincense](../ebd/ebd138.htm#004.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in
thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> Come with me from
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001), my [spouse](../ebd/ebd350.htm#002.md),
with me from [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md): look from the top of
[Amana](../ebd/ebd019.htm#001.md), from the top of
[Shenir](../ebd/ebd335.htm#002) and [Hermon](../ebd/ebd175.htm#006.md),
from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.  

<span id="009">9</span> Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my
[spouse](../ebd/ebd350.htm#002.md); thou hast ravished my heart with one of
thine eyes, with one [chain](../ebd/ebd075.htm#008.md) of thy
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> How fair is thy love, my sister, my
[spouse](../ebd/ebd350.htm#002.md)! how much better is thy love than
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md)! and the smell of thine ointments than all
[spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005.md)!  

<span id="011">11</span> Thy lips, O my [spouse](../ebd/ebd350.htm#002.md),
drop as the honeycomb: [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md) and
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000.md) are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy
garments is like the smell of [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> A garden inclosed is my sister, my
[spouse](../ebd/ebd350.htm#002.md); a spring shut up, a
[fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md) sealed.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with
pleasant fruits; [camphire](../ebd/ebd070.htm#003.md), with
[spikenard](../ebd/ebd349.htm#008.md),  

<span id="014">14</span> [Spikenard](../ebd/ebd349.htm#008.md) and
[saffron](../ebd/ebd318.htm#005); [calamus](../ebd/ebd069.htm#001.md) and
[cinnamon](../ebd/ebd083.htm#004.md), with all trees of
[frankincense](../ebd/ebd138.htm#004); [myrrh](../ebd/ebd263.htm#003.md)
and [aloes](../ebd/ebd018.htm#004.md), with all the chief
[spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005.md):  

<span id="015">15</span> A [fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md) of
[gardens](../ebd/ebd143.htm#001.md), a well of living waters, and streams
from [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow
upon my garden, that the [spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005.md) thereof may
flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant
fruits.
