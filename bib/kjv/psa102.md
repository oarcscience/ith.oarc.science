### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 102

<span id="001">1</span> Hear my [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md), O LORD,
and let my cry come unto thee.  

<span id="002">2</span> Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am
in trouble; incline thine [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) unto me: in the
day when I call answer me speedily.  

<span id="003">3</span> For my days are consumed like smoke, and my
bones are burned as an [hearth](../ebd/ebd170.htm#002.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> My heart is smitten, and withered like
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md); so that I forget to eat my
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones
cleave to my skin.  

<span id="006">6</span> I am like a pelican of the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md): I am like an
[owl](../ebd/ebd281.htm#006) of the [desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> I watch, and am as a
[sparrow](../ebd/ebd349.htm#003.md) alone upon the house top.  

<span id="008">8</span> Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they
that are mad against me are sworn against me.  

<span id="009">9</span> For I have eaten [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000.md)
like [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), and mingled my
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) with weeping.  

<span id="010">10</span> Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for
thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.  

<span id="011">11</span> My days are like a
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) that declineth; and I am withered like
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and
thy remembrance unto all generations.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou shalt arise, and have
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) upon [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md): for
the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.  

<span id="014">14</span> For thy servants take pleasure in her stones,
and favour the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) thereof.  

<span id="015">15</span> So the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) shall
fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> When the LORD shall build up
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), he shall appear in his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> He will regard the
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) of the destitute, and not despise their
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> This shall be written for the
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) to come: and the people which shall
be created shall praise the LORD.  

<span id="019">19</span> For he hath looked down from the height of his
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005); from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)
did the LORD behold the earth;  

<span id="020">20</span> To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose
those that are appointed to death;  

<span id="021">21</span> To declare the name of the LORD in
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), and his praise in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md);  

<span id="022">22</span> When the people are gathered together, and the
kingdoms, to serve the LORD.  

<span id="023">23</span> He weakened my strength in the way; he
shortened my days.  

<span id="024">24</span> I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst
of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.  

<span id="025">25</span> Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the
earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.  

<span id="026">26</span> They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea,
all of them shall [wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000.md) old like a garment; as a
vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:  

<span id="027">27</span> But thou art the same, and thy years shall have
no end.  

<span id="028">28</span> The children of thy servants shall continue,
and their seed shall be established before thee.
