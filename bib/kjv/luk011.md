### King James Version: Luke Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in
a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him,
Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our
Father which art in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), Hallowed be thy
name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), so in earth.  

<span id="003">3</span> Give us day by day our daily
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive
every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into
[temptation](../ebd/ebd361.htm#008.md); but deliver us from evil.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a
friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend,
lend me three loaves;  

<span id="006">6</span> For a friend of mine in his
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md) is come to me, and I have nothing to
set before him?  

<span id="007">7</span> And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble
me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I
cannot rise and give thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give
him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will
rise and give him as many as he needeth.  

<span id="009">9</span> And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given
you; seek, and ye shall find; [knock](../ebd/ebd221.htm#008.md), and it
shall be opened unto you.  

<span id="010">10</span> For every one that asketh receiveth; and he
that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.  

<span id="011">11</span> If a son shall ask
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) of any of you that is a father, will he
give him a [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md)? or if he ask a
[fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005.md), will he for a
[fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005.md) give him a
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009.md)?  

<span id="012">12</span> Or if he shall ask an
[egg](../ebd/ebd113.htm#005.md), will he offer him a scorpion?  

<span id="013">13</span> If ye then, being evil, know how to give good
gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give
the Holy [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) to them that ask him?  

<span id="014">14</span> And he was casting out a
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md), and it was
[dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002.md). And it came to pass, when the
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md) was gone out, the
[dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002.md) spake; and the people wondered.  

<span id="015">15</span> But some of them said, He casteth out devils
through [Beelzebub](../ebd/ebd050.htm#001.md) the chief of the devils.  

<span id="016">16</span> And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign
from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them,
Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a
house divided against a house falleth.  

<span id="018">18</span> If [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md) also be
divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say
that I cast out devils through [Beelzebub](../ebd/ebd050.htm#001.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And if I by [Beelzebub](../ebd/ebd050.htm#001.md)
cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall
they be your judges.  

<span id="020">20</span> But if I with the finger of God cast out
devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.  

<span id="021">21</span> When a strong man armed keepeth his
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md), his goods are in peace:  

<span id="022">22</span> But when a stronger than he shall come upon
him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his
[armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006.md) wherein he trusted, and divideth his
spoils.  

<span id="023">23</span> He that is not with me is against me: and he
that gathereth not with me scattereth.  

<span id="024">24</span> When the unclean
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) is gone out of a man, he walketh through
dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto
my house whence I came out.  

<span id="025">25</span> And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and
garnished.  

<span id="026">26</span> Then goeth he, and taketh to him
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) other spirits more wicked than himself;
and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is
worse than the first.  

<span id="027">27</span> And it came to pass, as he spake these things,
a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him,
Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast
sucked.  

<span id="028">28</span> But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that
hear the word of God, and keep it.  

<span id="029">29</span> And when the people were gathered thick
together, he began to say, This is an evil
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md): they seek a sign; and there shall
no sign be given it, but the sign of [Jonas](../ebd/ebd210.htm#009.md) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> For as [Jonas](../ebd/ebd210.htm#009.md) was a
sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> The [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md) of the south
shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md), and condemn them: for she came from
the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md); and, behold, a greater than
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) is here.  

<span id="032">32</span> The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment
with this [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md), and shall condemn it: for
they repented at the preaching of [Jonas](../ebd/ebd210.htm#009.md); and,
behold, a greater than [Jonas](../ebd/ebd210.htm#009.md) is here.  

<span id="033">33</span> No man, when he hath lighted a
[candle](../ebd/ebd071.htm#000.md), putteth it in a secret place, neither
under a bushel, but on a [candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md), that they
which come in may see the light.  

<span id="034">34</span> The light of the body is the eye: therefore
when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when
thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md).  

<span id="035">35</span> Take heed therefore that the light which is in
thee be not [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md).  

<span id="036">36</span> If thy whole body therefore be full of light,
having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the
bright shining of a [candle](../ebd/ebd071.htm#000.md) doth give thee
light.  

<span id="037">37</span> And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought
him to [dine](../ebd/ebd103.htm#009.md) with him: and he went in, and sat
down to meat.  

<span id="038">38</span> And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that
he had not first washed before dinner.  

<span id="039">39</span> And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) make [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md)
the outside of the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000.md) and the platter; but
your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.  

<span id="040">40</span> Ye fools, did not he that made that which is
without make that which is within also?  

<span id="041">41</span> But rather give [alms](../ebd/ebd018.htm#002.md)
of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) unto you.  

<span id="042">42</span> But woe unto you,
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md)! for ye
[tithe](../ebd/ebd368.htm#005) [mint](../ebd/ebd256.htm#001.md) and
[rue](../ebd/ebd316.htm#003.md) and all manner of herbs, and pass over
judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to
leave the other undone.  

<span id="043">43</span> Woe unto you,
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md)! for ye love the uppermost seats in
the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.  

<span id="044">44</span> Woe unto you, [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md)
and [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md), hypocrites! for ye are as graves
which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of
them.  

<span id="045">45</span> Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto
him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.  

<span id="046">46</span> And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for
ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch
not the burdens with one of your fingers.  

<span id="047">47</span> Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of
the prophets, and your fathers killed them.  

<span id="048">48</span> Truly ye bear [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md)
that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them,
and ye build their sepulchres.  

<span id="049">49</span> Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will
send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and
persecute:  

<span id="050">50</span> That the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of all
the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be
required of this [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md);  

<span id="051">51</span> From the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of
[Abel](../ebd/ebd001.htm#004) unto the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of
[Zacharias](../ebd/ebd386.htm#006.md) which perished between the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) and the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md):
verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md).  

<span id="052">52</span> Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away
the [key](../ebd/ebd218.htm#002.md) of knowledge: ye entered not in
yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.  

<span id="053">53</span> And as he said these things unto them, the
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md) and the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md) began to urge him vehemently, and to
provoke him to speak of many things:  

<span id="054">54</span> Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch
something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.
