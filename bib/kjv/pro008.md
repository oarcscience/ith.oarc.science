### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth
her voice?  

<span id="002">2</span> She standeth in the top of high places, by the
way in the places of the paths.  

<span id="003">3</span> She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the
city, at the coming in at the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009).  

<span id="004">4</span> Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the
sons of man.  

<span id="005">5</span> O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools,
be ye of an understanding heart.  

<span id="006">6</span> Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and
the opening of my lips shall be right things.  

<span id="007">7</span> For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness
is an [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) to my lips.  

<span id="008">8</span> All the words of my mouth are in
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004); there is nothing froward or
perverse in them.  

<span id="009">9</span> They are all [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) to
him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.  

<span id="010">10</span> Receive my instruction, and not
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000); and knowledge rather than choice
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="011">11</span> For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the
things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.  

<span id="012">12</span> I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out
knowledge of witty inventions.  

<span id="013">13</span> The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride,
and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.  

<span id="014">14</span> Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am
understanding; I have strength.  

<span id="015">15</span> By me kings reign, and princes decree
[justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007).  

<span id="016">16</span> By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the
judges of the earth.  

<span id="017">17</span> I love them that love me; and those that seek
me early shall find me.  

<span id="018">18</span> Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable
riches and [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="019">19</span> My [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) is better
than [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), yea, than fine
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001); and my revenue than choice
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000).  

<span id="020">20</span> I lead in the way of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), in the midst of the paths of
judgment:  

<span id="021">21</span> That I may cause those that love me to inherit
substance; and I will fill their treasures.  

<span id="022">22</span> The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his
way, before his works of old.  

<span id="023">23</span> I was set up from
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007), from the beginning, or ever the
earth was.  

<span id="024">24</span> When there were no depths, I was brought forth;
when there were no fountains abounding with water.  

<span id="025">25</span> Before the mountains were settled, before the
hills was I brought forth:  

<span id="026">26</span> While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the
fields, nor the highest part of the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) of the
world.  

<span id="027">27</span> When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when
he set a compass upon the face of the depth:  

<span id="028">28</span> When he established the clouds above: when he
strengthened the fountains of the [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008):  

<span id="029">29</span> When he gave to the sea his decree, that the
waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the
foundations of the earth:  

<span id="030">30</span> Then I was by him, as one brought up with him:
and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;  

<span id="031">31</span> Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth;
and my delights were with the sons of men.  

<span id="032">32</span> Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children:
for blessed are they that keep my ways.  

<span id="033">33</span> Hear instruction, and be
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), and refuse it not.  

<span id="034">34</span> Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching
daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009).  

<span id="035">35</span> For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall
obtain favour of the LORD.  

<span id="036">36</span> But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own
soul: all they that hate me love death.
