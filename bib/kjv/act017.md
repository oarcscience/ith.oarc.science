### King James Version: Acts Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> Now when they had passed through
[Amphipolis](../ebd/ebd021.htm#009.md) and
[Apollonia](../ebd/ebd026.htm#005.md), they came to
[Thessalonica](../ebd/ebd364.htm#000.md), where was a
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009.md) of the Jews:  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md), as his manner
was, went in unto them, and three [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) days
reasoned with them out of the scriptures,  

<span id="003">3</span> Opening and alleging, that
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) must needs have suffered, and risen
again from the dead; and that this [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), whom
I preach unto you, is [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And some of them believed, and consorted with
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) and [Silas](../ebd/ebd343.htm#004.md); and of
the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.  

<span id="005">5</span> But the Jews which believed not, moved with
envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and
gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the
house of [Jason](../ebd/ebd198.htm#002.md), and sought to bring them out to
the people.  

<span id="006">6</span> And when they found them not, they drew
[Jason](../ebd/ebd198.htm#002.md) and certain brethren unto the rulers of
the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come
hither also;  

<span id="007">7</span> Whom [Jason](../ebd/ebd198.htm#002.md) hath
received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of
[Caesar](../ebd/ebd068.htm#002.md), saying that there is another
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), one [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And they troubled the people and the rulers of
the city, when they heard these things.  

<span id="009">9</span> And when they had taken security of
[Jason](../ebd/ebd198.htm#002.md), and of the other, they let them go.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the brethren immediately sent away
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) and [Silas](../ebd/ebd343.htm#004.md) by
night unto [Berea](../ebd/ebd053.htm#002.md): who coming thither went into
the [synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009.md) of the Jews.  

<span id="011">11</span> These were more noble than those in
[Thessalonica](../ebd/ebd364.htm#000.md), in that they received the word
with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether
those things were so.  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore many of them believed; also of
honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.  

<span id="013">13</span> But when the Jews of
[Thessalonica](../ebd/ebd364.htm#000.md) had knowledge that the word of God
was preached of [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) at
[Berea](../ebd/ebd053.htm#002.md), they came thither also, and stirred up
the people.  

<span id="014">14</span> And then immediately the brethren sent away
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) to go as it were to the sea: but
[Silas](../ebd/ebd343.htm#004) and [Timotheus](../ebd/ebd367.htm#001.md)
abode there still.  

<span id="015">15</span> And they that conducted
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) brought him unto
[Athens](../ebd/ebd036.htm#003.md): and receiving a commandment unto
[Silas](../ebd/ebd343.htm#004) and [Timotheus](../ebd/ebd367.htm#001.md)
for to come to him with all speed, they departed.  

<span id="016">16</span> Now while [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) waited
for them at [Athens](../ebd/ebd036.htm#003.md), his
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) was stirred in him, when he saw the city
wholly given to [idolatry](../ebd/ebd186.htm#007.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Therefore disputed he in the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009.md) with the Jews, and with the devout
persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then certain philosophers of the
[Epicureans](../ebd/ebd123.htm#009.md), and of the Stoicks, encountered
him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth
to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), and the resurrection.  

<span id="019">19</span> And they took him, and brought him unto
[Areopagus](../ebd/ebd030.htm#001.md), saying, May we know what this new
doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?  

<span id="020">20</span> For thou bringest certain strange things to our
ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.  

<span id="021">21</span> (For all the Athenians and strangers which were
there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear
some new thing.)  

<span id="022">22</span> Then [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) stood in the
midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of
[Athens](../ebd/ebd036.htm#003.md), I perceive that in all things ye are
too superstitious.  

<span id="023">23</span> For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions,
I found an [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) with this inscription, TO THE
UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md), him declare I unto you.  

<span id="024">24</span> God that made the world and all things therein,
seeing that he is Lord of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) and earth,
dwelleth not in temples made with hands;  

<span id="025">25</span> Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as
though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath,
and all things;  

<span id="026">26</span> And hath made of one
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) all nations of men for to dwell on all
the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed,
and the bounds of their [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md);  

<span id="027">27</span> That they should seek the Lord, if haply they
might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one
of us:  

<span id="028">28</span> For in him we live, and move, and have our
being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his
offspring.  

<span id="029">29</span> Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God,
we ought not to think that the [Godhead](../ebd/ebd151.htm#006.md) is like
unto [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), or [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md),
or [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), graven by art and man's device.  

<span id="030">30</span> And the times of this ignorance God winked at;
but now commandeth all men every where to repent:  

<span id="031">31</span> Because he hath appointed a day, in the which
he will [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) the world in
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) by that man whom he hath
ordained; whereof he hath given [assurance](../ebd/ebd035.htm#004.md) unto
all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.  

<span id="032">32</span> And when they heard of the resurrection of the
dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this
matter.  

<span id="033">33</span> So [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) departed from
among them.  

<span id="034">34</span> Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and
believed: among the which was [Dionysius](../ebd/ebd104.htm#001.md) the
[Areopagite](../ebd/ebd030.htm#000.md), and a woman named
[Damaris](../ebd/ebd096.htm#006.md), and others with them.
