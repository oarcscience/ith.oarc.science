<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Lamentations Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;How is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> become dim! how is the most fine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> changed! the stones of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A> are poured out in the top of every street.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;The precious sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>, comparable to fine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, and no man breaketh it unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</A> embrace dunghills.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</A> of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</A>, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Her Nazarites were purer than <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</A>, they were whiter than <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</A>, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#002">sapphire</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Their visage is blacker than a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#003">coal</A>; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;They that be slain with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> are better than they that be slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits of the field.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A> of the daughter of my people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;The LORD hath accomplished his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A>; he hath poured out his fierce <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, and hath kindled a fire in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</A> and the enemy should have entered into the gates of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of the just in the midst of her,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;They have wandered as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> men in the streets, they have polluted themselves with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, so that men could not touch their garments.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, They shall no more sojourn there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> we shall live among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</A>, that dwellest in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd375.htm#007">Uz</A>; the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</A> of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>; he will no more carry thee away into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A>: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</A>; he will discover thy sins.<BR>
