### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and say unto them, When either man or
woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a
[Nazarite](../ebd/ebd267.htm#008.md), to separate themselves unto the
LORD:  

<span id="003">3</span> He shall separate himself from
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) and strong [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md),
and shall [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) no
[vinegar](../ebd/ebd377.htm#006) of [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), or
[vinegar](../ebd/ebd377.htm#006.md) of strong
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), neither shall he
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist
grapes, or dried.  

<span id="004">4</span> All the days of his separation shall he eat
nothing that is made of the [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md) tree, from the
kernels even to the [husk](../ebd/ebd185.htm#004.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> All the days of the vow of his separation there
shall no [razor](../ebd/ebd307.htm#009.md) come upon his head: until the
days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth himself unto the LORD, he
shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.  

<span id="006">6</span> All the days that he separateth himself unto the
LORD he shall come at no dead body.  

<span id="007">7</span> He shall not make himself unclean for his
father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they
die: because the [consecration](../ebd/ebd088.htm#007.md) of his God is
upon his head.  

<span id="008">8</span> All the days of his separation he is holy unto
the LORD.  

<span id="009">9</span> And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he
hath defiled the head of his [consecration](../ebd/ebd088.htm#007.md); then
he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day
shall he shave it.  

<span id="010">10</span> And on the eighth day he shall bring two
turtles, or two young pigeons, to the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md),
to the door of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md):  

<span id="011">11</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
offer the one for a [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and the other for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for him, for that he sinned by the
dead, and shall [hallow](../ebd/ebd160.htm#001.md) his head that same
day.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days
of his separation, and shall bring a [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md) of
the first year for a trespass [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md): but the
days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was
defiled.  

<span id="013">13</span> And this is the law of the
[Nazarite](../ebd/ebd267.htm#008.md), when the days of his separation are
fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md):  

<span id="014">14</span> And he shall offer his
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) unto the LORD, one he
[lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md) of the first year without
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md) for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and one ewe
[lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md) of the first year without
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007) for a [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and one [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md)
without [blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md) for peace offerings,  

<span id="015">15</span> And a [basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009.md) of
unleavened [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), cakes of fine
[flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001.md) mingled with oil, and
[wafers](../ebd/ebd378.htm#003.md) of unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) anointed with oil, and their meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and their
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) offerings.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
bring them before the LORD, and shall offer his
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and his
burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md):  

<span id="017">17</span> And he shall offer the
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003) for a [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) of
peace offerings unto the LORD, with the [basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009.md)
of unleavened [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md): the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall offer also his meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and his
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And the [Nazarite](../ebd/ebd267.htm#008.md) shall
shave the head of his separation at the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), and shall take the hair of the
head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) of the peace offerings.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
take the sodden shoulder of the [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md), and one
unleavened [cake](../ebd/ebd068.htm#009.md) out of the
[basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009.md), and one unleavened wafer, and shall put
them upon the hands of the [Nazarite](../ebd/ebd267.htm#008.md), after the
hair of his separation is shaven:  

<span id="020">20</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
wave them for a wave [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) before the LORD:
this is holy for the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), with the wave
breast and heave shoulder: and after that the
[Nazarite](../ebd/ebd267.htm#008) may [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md)
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> This is the law of the
[Nazarite](../ebd/ebd267.htm#008.md) who hath vowed, and of his
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) unto the LORD for his separation,
beside that that his hand shall get: according to the vow which he
vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="023">23</span> Speak unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and
unto his sons, saying, On this [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) ye shall
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), saying unto them,  

<span id="024">24</span> The LORD [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) thee,
and keep thee:  

<span id="025">25</span> The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be
gracious unto thee:  

<span id="026">26</span> The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and
give thee peace.  

<span id="027">27</span> And they shall put my name upon the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and I will
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) them.
