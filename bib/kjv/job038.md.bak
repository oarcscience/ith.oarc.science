### King James Version: Job Chapter 38

<span id="001">1</span> Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind,
and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words
without knowledge?  

<span id="003">3</span> Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will
demand of thee, and answer thou me.  

<span id="004">4</span> Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of
the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.  

<span id="005">5</span> Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou
knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?  

<span id="006">6</span> Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened?
or who laid the corner [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) thereof;  

<span id="007">7</span> When the morning [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md)
sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?  

<span id="008">8</span> Or who shut up the sea with
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md), when it brake forth, as if it had issued
out of the womb?  

<span id="009">9</span> When I made the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md)
the garment thereof, and thick [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) a
swaddlingband for it,  

<span id="010">10</span> And brake up for it my decreed place, and set
bars and [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md),  

<span id="011">11</span> And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no
further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?  

<span id="012">12</span> Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days;
and caused the [dayspring](../ebd/ebd098.htm#009.md) to know his place;  

<span id="013">13</span> That it might take hold of the ends of the
earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?  

<span id="014">14</span> It is turned as [clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004.md)
to the [seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002.md); and they stand as a garment.  

<span id="015">15</span> And from the wicked their light is withholden,
and the high arm shall be broken.  

<span id="016">16</span> Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea?
or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?  

<span id="017">17</span> Have the gates of death been opened unto thee?
or hast thou seen the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) of the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) of death?  

<span id="018">18</span> Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth?
declare if thou knowest it all.  

<span id="019">19</span> Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as
for [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), where is the place thereof,  

<span id="020">20</span> That thou shouldest take it to the bound
thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?  

<span id="021">21</span> Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born?
or because the number of thy days is great?  

<span id="022">22</span> Hast thou entered into the treasures of the
[snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000.md)? or hast thou seen the treasures of the
[hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002.md),  

<span id="023">23</span> Which I have reserved against the time of
trouble, against the day of battle and war?  

<span id="024">24</span> By what way is the light parted, which
scattereth the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) wind upon the earth?  

<span id="025">25</span> Who hath divided a watercourse for the
overflowing of waters, or a way for the
[lightning](../ebd/ebd229.htm#002.md) of
[thunder](../ebd/ebd365.htm#003.md);  

<span id="026">26</span> To cause it to [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) on
the earth, where no man is; on the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md),
wherein there is no man;  

<span id="027">27</span> To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and
to cause the bud of the tender [herb](../ebd/ebd174.htm#008.md) to spring
forth?  

<span id="028">28</span> Hath the [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) a
father? or who hath begotten the drops of
[dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md)?  

<span id="029">29</span> Out of whose womb came the
[ice](../ebd/ebd186.htm#001.md)? and the hoary
[frost](../ebd/ebd138.htm#009) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), who
hath gendered it?  

<span id="030">30</span> The waters are hid as with a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), and the face of the
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) is frozen.  

<span id="031">31</span> Canst thou bind the sweet influences of
[Pleiades](../ebd/ebd297.htm#006.md), or loose the
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003) of [Orion](../ebd/ebd280.htm#005.md)?  

<span id="032">32</span> Canst thou bring forth
[Mazzaroth](../ebd/ebd244.htm#009.md) in his season? or canst thou guide
[Arcturus](../ebd/ebd029.htm#007.md) with his sons?  

<span id="033">33</span> Knowest thou the ordinances of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)? canst thou set the dominion thereof in
the earth?  

<span id="034">34</span> Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds,
that abundance of waters may cover thee?  

<span id="035">35</span> Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go
and say unto thee, Here we are?  

<span id="036">36</span> Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who
hath given understanding to the heart?  

<span id="037">37</span> Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can
stay the bottles of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md),  

<span id="038">38</span> When the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) groweth
into hardness, and the clods cleave [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md)
together?  

<span id="039">39</span> Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill
the appetite of the young [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001.md),  

<span id="040">40</span> When they [couch](../ebd/ebd091.htm#002.md) in
their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?  

<span id="041">41</span> Who provideth for the
[raven](../ebd/ebd307.htm#008.md) his food? when his young ones cry unto
God, they wander for lack of meat.
