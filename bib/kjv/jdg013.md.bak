### King James Version: Judges Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) did evil again in the sight of the LORD;
and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) forty years.  

<span id="002">2</span> And there was a certain man of
[Zorah](../ebd/ebd396.htm#002.md), of the family of the Danites, whose name
was [Manoah](../ebd/ebd240.htm#007.md); and his wife was
[barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007.md), and bare not.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art
[barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007.md), and bearest not: but thou shalt
conceive, and bear a son.  

<span id="004">4</span> Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) not [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) nor
strong [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), and eat not any unclean thing:  

<span id="005">5</span> For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son;
and no [razor](../ebd/ebd307.htm#009.md) shall come on his head: for the
child shall be a [Nazarite](../ebd/ebd267.htm#008.md) unto God from the
womb: and he shall begin to deliver [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) out
of the hand of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Then the woman came and told her husband,
saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the
countenance of an [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of God, very terrible:
but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:  

<span id="007">7</span> But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt
conceive, and bear a son; and now [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) no
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) nor strong [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md),
neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a
[Nazarite](../ebd/ebd267.htm#008.md) to God from the womb to the day of his
death.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then [Manoah](../ebd/ebd240.htm#007.md) intreated
the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send
come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that
shall be born.  

<span id="009">9</span> And God hearkened to the voice of
[Manoah](../ebd/ebd240.htm#007); and the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md)
of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but
[Manoah](../ebd/ebd240.htm#007.md) her husband was not with her.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed
her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me,
that came unto me the other day.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Manoah](../ebd/ebd240.htm#007.md) arose, and
went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou
the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Manoah](../ebd/ebd240.htm#007.md) said, Now
let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall
we do unto him?  

<span id="013">13</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
LORD said unto [Manoah](../ebd/ebd240.htm#007.md), Of all that I said unto
the woman let her beware.  

<span id="014">14</span> She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md), neither let her
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) or strong
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), nor eat any unclean thing: all that I
commanded her let her observe.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Manoah](../ebd/ebd240.htm#007.md) said unto
the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the LORD, I pray thee, let us
detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
LORD said unto [Manoah](../ebd/ebd240.htm#007.md), Though thou detain me, I
will not eat of thy [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md): and if thou wilt
offer a burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), thou must offer it unto
the LORD. For [Manoah](../ebd/ebd240.htm#007.md) knew not that he was an
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the LORD.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Manoah](../ebd/ebd240.htm#007.md) said unto
the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the LORD, What is thy name, that
when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?  

<span id="018">18</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is
secret?  

<span id="019">19</span> So [Manoah](../ebd/ebd240.htm#007.md) took a kid
with a meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and offered it upon a
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md) unto the LORD: and the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) did wonderously; and
[Manoah](../ebd/ebd240.htm#007.md) and his wife looked on.  

<span id="020">20</span> For it came to pass, when the flame went up
toward [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) from off the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), that the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md)
of the LORD ascended in the flame of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md).
And [Manoah](../ebd/ebd240.htm#007.md) and his wife looked on it, and fell
on their faces to the ground.  

<span id="021">21</span> But the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
LORD did no more appear to [Manoah](../ebd/ebd240.htm#007.md) and to his
wife. Then [Manoah](../ebd/ebd240.htm#007.md) knew that he was an
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the LORD.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Manoah](../ebd/ebd240.htm#007.md) said unto
his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.  

<span id="023">23</span> But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were
pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) and a meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) at our hands, neither would he have
shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such
things as these.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the woman bare a son, and called his name
[Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000.md): and the child grew, and the LORD
blessed him.  

<span id="025">25</span> And the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the
LORD began to move him at times in the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md) of
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009) between [Zorah](../ebd/ebd396.htm#002.md) and
[Eshtaol](../ebd/ebd125.htm#002.md).
