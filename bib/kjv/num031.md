### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 31

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Avenge the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou
be gathered unto thy people.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) spake unto
the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go
against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of
[Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Of every [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) a
thousand, throughout all the tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
shall ye send to the war.  

<span id="005">5</span> So there were delivered out of the
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), a
thousand of every [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md), twelve thousand armed
for war.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) sent them to
the war, a thousand of every [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md), them and
[Phinehas](../ebd/ebd294.htm#003.md) the son of
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), to
the war, with the holy instruments, and the
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md) to blow in his hand.  

<span id="007">7</span> And they warred against the Midianites, as the
LORD commanded [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md); and they slew all the
males.  

<span id="008">8</span> And they slew the kings of
[Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md), beside the rest of them that were
slain; namely, Evi, and [Rekem](../ebd/ebd310.htm#002.md), and
[Zur](../ebd/ebd396.htm#005), and [Hur](../ebd/ebd184.htm#009.md), and
[Reba](../ebd/ebd308.htm#000.md), five kings of
[Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007): [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) also
the son of [Beor](../ebd/ebd052.htm#009.md) they slew with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) took all the women of
[Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md) captives, and their little ones, and
took the spoil of all their [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), and all
their flocks, and all their goods.  

<span id="010">10</span> And they burnt all their cities wherein they
dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire.  

<span id="011">11</span> And they took all the spoil, and all the prey,
both of men and of beasts.  

<span id="012">12</span> And they brought the captives, and the prey,
and the spoil, unto [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), and
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md),
and unto the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), unto the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md)
at the plains of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), which are by
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) near [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), and
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md),
and all the princes of the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), went
forth to meet them without the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) was wroth
with the officers of the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md), with the
captains over [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md), and captains over
hundreds, which came from the battle.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said unto
them, Have ye saved all the women alive?  

<span id="016">16</span> Behold, these caused the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), through the counsel of
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md), to commit trespass against the LORD in
the matter of [Peor](../ebd/ebd289.htm#006.md), and there was a
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) among the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the LORD.  

<span id="017">17</span> Now therefore kill every male among the little
ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.  

<span id="018">18</span> But all the women children, that have not known
a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.  

<span id="019">19</span> And do ye abide without the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days:
whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain,
purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the
seventh day.  

<span id="020">20</span> And purify all your raiment, and all that is
made of skins, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000.md) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) said unto the men of war which went to
the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md);  

<span id="022">22</span> Only the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), the [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md), the
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004), the [tin](../ebd/ebd367.htm#005.md), and the
lead,  

<span id="023">23</span> Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall
make it go through the fire, and it shall be
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md): nevertheless it shall be purified with
the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make
go through the water.  

<span id="024">24</span> And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh
day, and ye shall be [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md), and afterward ye
shall come into the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="026">26</span> Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both
of man and of [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md), thou, and
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md),
and the chief fathers of the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md):  

<span id="027">27</span> And divide the prey into two parts; between
them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between
all the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md):  

<span id="028">28</span> And [levy](../ebd/ebd228.htm#001.md) a
[tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006.md) unto the Lord of the men of war which
went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and
of the [beeves](../ebd/ebd051.htm#000.md), and of the asses, and of the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md):  

<span id="029">29</span> Take it of their half, and give it unto
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md),
for an heave [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) of the LORD.  

<span id="030">30</span> And of the children of Israel's half, thou
shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the
[beeves](../ebd/ebd051.htm#000.md), of the asses, and of the flocks, of all
manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge
of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the LORD.  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) and
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) did
as the LORD commanded [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> And the [booty](../ebd/ebd062.htm#006.md), being
the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred
thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md),  

<span id="033">33</span> And threescore and twelve thousand
[beeves](../ebd/ebd051.htm#000.md),  

<span id="034">34</span> And threescore and one thousand asses,  

<span id="035">35</span> And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of
women that had not known man by lying with him.  

<span id="036">36</span> And the half, which was the portion of them
that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) and thirty thousand and five hundred
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md):  

<span id="037">37</span> And the LORD's [tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006.md)
of the [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) was six hundred and threescore and
fifteen.  

<span id="038">38</span> And the [beeves](../ebd/ebd051.htm#000.md) were
thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD's
[tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006.md) was threescore and twelve.  

<span id="039">39</span> And the asses were thirty thousand and five
hundred; of which the LORD's [tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006.md) was
threescore and one.  

<span id="040">40</span> And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which
the LORD's [tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006.md) was thirty and two
persons.  

<span id="041">41</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) gave the
[tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006.md), which was the LORD's heave
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), unto [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000.md)
the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), as the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="042">42</span> And of the children of Israel's half, which
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) divided from the men that warred,  

<span id="043">43</span> (Now the half that pertained unto the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) was three hundred thousand and
thirty thousand and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) thousand and five
hundred [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md),  

<span id="044">44</span> And thirty and six thousand
[beeves](../ebd/ebd051.htm#000.md),  

<span id="045">45</span> And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,  

<span id="046">46</span> And sixteen thousand persons;)  

<span id="047">47</span> Even of the children of Israel's half,
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) took one portion of fifty, both of man
and of [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md), and gave them unto the Levites,
which kept the charge of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
LORD; as the LORD commanded [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="048">48</span> And the officers which were over
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008) of the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md),
the captains of [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md), and captains of
hundreds, came near unto [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md):  

<span id="049">49</span> And they said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Thy servants have taken the sum of the
men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of
us.  

<span id="050">50</span> We have therefore brought an oblation for the
LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), chains, and bracelets, rings,
[earrings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#007.md), and tablets, to make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for our souls before the LORD.  

<span id="051">51</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) and
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
took the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) of them, even all wrought
jewels.  

<span id="052">52</span> And all the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) of
the [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) that they offered up to the LORD,
of the captains of [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md), and of the
captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) hundred and fifty shekels.  

<span id="053">53</span> (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man
for himself.)  

<span id="054">54</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) and
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
took the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) of the captains of
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md) and of hundreds, and brought it into
the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), for a memorial for the children
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) before the LORD.
