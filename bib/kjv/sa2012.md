### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD sent
[Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002) unto [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md). And
he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the
one rich, and the other [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> The rich man had exceeding many flocks and
herds:  

<span id="003">3</span> But the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) man had
nothing, save one little ewe [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md), which he had
bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his
children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000.md), and lay in his
[bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md), and was unto him as a daughter.  

<span id="004">4</span> And there came a traveller unto the rich man,
and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own
[herd](../ebd/ebd174.htm#009), to [dress](../ebd/ebd107.htm#008.md) for the
wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) man's [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md), and
dressed it for the man that was come to him.  

<span id="005">5</span> And David's [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) was
greatly kindled against the man; and he said to
[Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md), As the LORD liveth, the man that hath
done this thing shall surely die:  

<span id="006">6</span> And he shall restore the
[lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md) fourfold, because he did this thing, and
because he had no pity.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md) said to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD
God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), I anointed thee
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and
I delivered thee out of the hand of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md);  

<span id="008">8</span> And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy
master's wives into thy [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md), and gave thee
the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) and of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md); and if that had been too little, I would
moreover have given unto thee such and such things.  

<span id="009">9</span> Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of
the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed
[Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002.md) the Hittite with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), and hast taken his wife to be thy wife,
and hast slain him with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) of the
children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> Now therefore the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) shall never depart from thine house;
because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of
[Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002.md) the Hittite to be thy wife.  

<span id="011">11</span> Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up
evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives
before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie
with thy wives in the sight of this [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this
thing before all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and before the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said unto
[Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md), I have sinned against the LORD. And
[Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md) said unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), The LORD also hath put away thy
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md); thou shalt not die.  

<span id="014">14</span> Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given
great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also
that is born unto thee shall surely die.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md) departed
unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare
unto [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and it was very sick.  

<span id="016">16</span> [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) therefore
besought God for the child; and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) fasted,
and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the elders of his house arose, and went to
him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he
eat [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) with them.  

<span id="018">18</span> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that
the child died. And the servants of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while
the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken
unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the
child is dead?  

<span id="019">19</span> But when [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) saw
that his servants whispered, [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) perceived
that the child was dead: therefore [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said
unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.  

<span id="020">20</span> Then [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) arose from
the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his
[apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000.md), and came into the house of the LORD,
and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required,
they set [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) before him, and he did eat.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then said his servants unto him, What thing is
this that thou hast done? thou didst [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) and
weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead,
thou didst rise and eat [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And he said, While the child was yet alive, I
fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious
to me, that the child may live?  

<span id="023">23</span> But now he is dead, wherefore should I
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md)? can I bring him back again? I shall go to
him, but he shall not return to me.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) comforted
Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare
a son, and he called his name [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md): and the
LORD loved him.  

<span id="025">25</span> And he sent by the hand of
[Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md);
and he called his name [Jedidiah](../ebd/ebd199.htm#008.md), because of the
LORD.  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) fought
against [Rabbah](../ebd/ebd304.htm#005.md) of the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002.md), and took the royal city.  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) sent
messengers to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and said, I have fought
against [Rabbah](../ebd/ebd304.htm#005.md), and have taken the city of
waters.  

<span id="028">28</span> Now therefore gather the rest of the people
together, and [encamp](../ebd/ebd120.htm#003.md) against the city, and take
it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) gathered all
the people together, and went to [Rabbah](../ebd/ebd304.htm#005.md), and
fought against it, and took it.  

<span id="030">30</span> And he took their king's
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) from off his head, the weight whereof was
a [talent](../ebd/ebd357.htm#009) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) with
the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought
forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.  

<span id="031">31</span> And he brought forth the people that were
therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md), and under axes of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md), and made them pass through the
brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002). So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) and
all the people returned unto [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).
