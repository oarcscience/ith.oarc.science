### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 25

<span id="001">1</span> The word that came to
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) concerning all the people of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) in the fourth year of
[Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) the son of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), that was the first year of
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001);  

<span id="002">2</span> The which [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) spake unto all the people of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and to all the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), saying,  

<span id="003">3</span> From the thirteenth year of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) the son of [Amon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#005)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), even
unto this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of the
LORD hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and
speaking; but ye have not hearkened.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants
the prophets, rising early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened,
nor inclined your [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) to hear.  

<span id="005">5</span> They said, Turn ye again now every one from his
evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that
the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever:  

<span id="006">6</span> And go not after other gods to serve them, and
to [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) them, and provoke me not to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) with the works of your hands; and I will
do you no hurt.  

<span id="007">7</span> Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the
LORD; that ye might provoke me to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) with
the works of your hands to your own hurt.  

<span id="008">8</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because
ye have not heard my words,  

<span id="009">9</span> Behold, I will send and take all the families of
the north, saith the LORD, and [Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006)
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001),
my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the
inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will
utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and
perpetual desolations.  

<span id="010">10</span> Moreover I will take from them the voice of
mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the
voice of the [bride](../ebd/ebd065.htm#001), the sound of the
millstones, and the light of the [candle](../ebd/ebd071.htm#000).  

<span id="011">11</span> And this whole land shall be a desolation, and
an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001)
seventy years.  

<span id="012">12</span> And it shall come to pass, when seventy years
are accomplished, that I will punish the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and that nation, saith the LORD,
for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it
perpetual desolations.  

<span id="013">13</span> And I will bring upon that land all my words
which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this
book, which [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) hath prophesied against
all the nations.  

<span id="014">14</span> For many nations and great kings shall serve
themselves of them also: and I will recompense them according to their
deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.  

<span id="015">15</span> For thus saith the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) unto me; Take the
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) of this
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) at my hand, and cause all the nations, to
whom I send thee, to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) it.  

<span id="016">16</span> And they shall [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009),
and be moved, and be mad, because of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003)
that I will send among them.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then took I the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) at
the LORD's hand, and made all the nations to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), unto whom the LORD had sent me:  

<span id="018">18</span> To wit, [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and
the cities of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and the kings thereof, and
the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an
hissing, and a [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003); as it is this day;  

<span id="019">19</span> [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and his
servants, and his princes, and all his people;  

<span id="020">20</span> And all the mingled people, and all the kings
of the land of [Uz](../ebd/ebd375.htm#007), and all the kings of the
land of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), and
[Ashkelon](../ebd/ebd034.htm#001), and Azzah, and
[Ekron](../ebd/ebd114.htm#001), and the remnant of
[Ashdod](../ebd/ebd033.htm#006),  

<span id="021">21</span> [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001), and
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), and the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002),  

<span id="022">22</span> And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings
of [Zidon](../ebd/ebd393.htm#000), and the kings of the isles which are
beyond the sea,  

<span id="023">23</span> [Dedan](../ebd/ebd100.htm#005), and
[Tema](../ebd/ebd361.htm#000), and [Buz](../ebd/ebd067.htm#003), and all
that are in the utmost corners,  

<span id="024">24</span> And all the kings of
[Arabia](../ebd/ebd027.htm#009), and all the kings of the mingled people
that dwell in the [desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000),  

<span id="025">25</span> And all the kings of
[Zimri](../ebd/ebd393.htm#009), and all the kings of
[Elam](../ebd/ebd114.htm#003), and all the kings of the Medes,  

<span id="026">26</span> And all the kings of the north, far and near,
one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the
face of the earth: and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Sheshach](../ebd/ebd336.htm#001) shall [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009)
after them.  

<span id="027">27</span> Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith
the LORD of hosts, the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000);
[Drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall,
and rise no more, because of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) which I
will send among you.  

<span id="028">28</span> And it shall be, if they refuse to take the
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) at thine hand to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), then shalt thou say unto them, Thus
saith the LORD of hosts; Ye shall certainly
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009).  

<span id="029">29</span> For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city
which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye
shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) upon all the inhabitants of the earth,
saith the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="030">30</span> Therefore prophesy thou against them all these
words, and say unto them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter
his voice from his holy [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007); he shall
mightily roar upon his [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007); he shall
give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants
of the earth.  

<span id="031">31</span> A noise shall come even to the ends of the
earth; for the LORD hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead
with all [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007); he will give them that are
wicked to the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), saith the LORD.  

<span id="032">32</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil
shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be
raised up from the coasts of the earth.  

<span id="033">33</span> And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day
from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they
shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be
[dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003) upon the ground.  

<span id="034">34</span> Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow
yourselves in the [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000), ye principal of the
flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are
accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel.  

<span id="035">35</span> And the shepherds shall have no way to flee,
nor the principal of the flock to escape.  

<span id="036">36</span> A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an
howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the LORD hath
spoiled their pasture.  

<span id="037">37</span> And the peaceable habitations are cut down
because of the fierce [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) of the LORD.  

<span id="038">38</span> He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for
their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and
because of his fierce [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002).
