### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 28

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass the same year, in the
beginning of the reign of [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), in the
fourth year, and in the fifth month, that
[Hananiah](../ebd/ebd162.htm#004) the son of
[Azur](../ebd/ebd038.htm#003) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008),
which was of [Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002), spake unto me in the house
of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and of all the people,
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saying, I have broken the
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001).  

<span id="003">3</span> Within two full years will I bring again into
this place all the vessels of the LORD's house, that
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) took away from this place, and carried
them to [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001):  

<span id="004">4</span> And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah
the son of [Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), with
all the captives of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), that went into
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), saith the LORD: for I will break the
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001).  

<span id="005">5</span> Then the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) said unto the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) [Hananiah](../ebd/ebd162.htm#004) in
the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that
stood in the house of the LORD,  

<span id="006">6</span> Even the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) said, [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001):
the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied,
to bring again the vessels of the LORD's house, and all that is carried
away [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001), from
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) into this place.  

<span id="007">7</span> Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I
speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people;  

<span id="008">8</span> The prophets that have been before me and before
thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great
kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.  

<span id="009">9</span> The [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) which
prophesieth of peace, when the word of the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) shall come to pass, then shall the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) be known, that the LORD hath truly sent
him.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then [Hananiah](../ebd/ebd162.htm#004) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) took the [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009)
from off the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) Jeremiah's
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000), and brake it.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Hananiah](../ebd/ebd162.htm#004) spake in
the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so
will I break the [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) of
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) from the [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000)
of all nations within the space of two full years. And the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) went
his way.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then the word of the LORD came unto
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008),
after that [Hananiah](../ebd/ebd162.htm#004) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) had broken the
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) from off the [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000)
of the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006), saying,  

<span id="013">13</span> Go and tell [Hananiah](../ebd/ebd162.htm#004),
saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003); but thou shalt make for them yokes of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004).  

<span id="014">14</span> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); I have put a
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) of [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004) upon the
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000) of all these nations, that they may serve
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001); and they shall serve him: and I have
given him the beasts of the field also.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then said the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) unto [Hananiah](../ebd/ebd162.htm#004)
the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), Hear now,
[Hananiah](../ebd/ebd162.htm#004); The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou
makest this people to trust in a lie.  

<span id="016">16</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will
cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die,
because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD.  

<span id="017">17</span> So [Hananiah](../ebd/ebd162.htm#004) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) died the same year in the seventh
month.
