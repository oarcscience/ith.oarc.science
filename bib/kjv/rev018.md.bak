### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> And after these things I saw another
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) come down from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), having great power; and the earth was
lightened with his [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he cried mightily with a strong voice,
saying, [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md) the great is fallen, is fallen,
and is become the [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md) of devils, and the
hold of every foul [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), and a
[cage](../ebd/ebd068.htm#005.md) of every unclean and hateful
[bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> For all nations have
[drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007) of the [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) of
the wrath of her [fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008.md), and the kings of
the earth have committed [fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008.md) with her,
and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of
her delicacies.  

<span id="004">4</span> And I heard another voice from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), saying, Come out of her, my people,
that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her
plagues.  

<span id="005">5</span> For her sins have reached unto
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and God hath remembered her
iniquities.  

<span id="006">6</span> Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double
unto her double according to her works: in the
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000.md) which she hath filled fill to her double.  

<span id="007">7</span> How much she hath glorified herself, and lived
deliciously, so much [torment](../ebd/ebd370.htm#009.md) and sorrow give
her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md),
and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.  

<span id="008">8</span> Therefore shall her plagues come in one day,
death, and mourning, and [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md); and she shall
be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth
her.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the kings of the earth, who have committed
[fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008.md) and lived deliciously with her,
shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of
her burning,  

<span id="010">10</span> Standing afar off for the fear of her
[torment](../ebd/ebd370.htm#009.md), saying, Alas, alas that great city
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), that mighty city! for in one hour is
thy judgment come.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the merchants of the earth shall weep and
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004.md) over her; for no man buyeth their
merchandise any more:  

<span id="012">12</span> The merchandise of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and
precious stones, and of pearls, and fine [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md),
and purple, and [silk](../ebd/ebd343.htm#005.md), and
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md), and all thyine
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md), and all manner vessels of
[ivory](../ebd/ebd192.htm#000.md), and all manner vessels of most precious
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md),
and [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md), and
[marble](../ebd/ebd241.htm#006.md),  

<span id="013">13</span> And [cinnamon](../ebd/ebd083.htm#004.md), and
odours, and ointments, and [frankincense](../ebd/ebd138.htm#004.md), and
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), and oil, and fine
[flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001), and [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md), and
beasts, and [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), and horses, and chariots,
and slaves, and souls of men.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are
departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are
departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.  

<span id="015">15</span> The merchants of these things, which were made
rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her
[torment](../ebd/ebd370.htm#009.md), weeping and wailing,  

<span id="016">16</span> And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that
was clothed in fine [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md), and purple, and
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md), and decked with
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and precious stones, and pearls!  

<span id="017">17</span> For in one hour so great riches is come to
nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in
[ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003.md), and sailors, and as many as trade by
sea, stood afar off,  

<span id="018">18</span> And cried when they saw the smoke of her
burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!  

<span id="019">19</span> And they cast [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) on
their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas that
great city, wherein were made rich all that had
[ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003.md) in the sea by reason of her costliness!
for in one hour is she made desolate.  

<span id="020">20</span> Rejoice over her, thou
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and ye holy apostles and prophets; for
God hath avenged you on her.  

<span id="021">21</span> And a mighty [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md)
took up a [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) like a great millstone, and
cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md) be thrown down, and shall be found no
more at all.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of
pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no
craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee;
and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;  

<span id="023">23</span> And the light of a
[candle](../ebd/ebd071.htm#000.md) shall shine no more at all in thee; and
the voice of the bridegroom and of the [bride](../ebd/ebd065.htm#001.md)
shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great
men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.  

<span id="024">24</span> And in her was found the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of prophets, and of saints, and of all
that were slain upon the earth.
