### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 46

<span id="001">1</span> God is our refuge and strength, a very present
help in trouble.  

<span id="002">2</span> Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be
removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the
sea;  

<span id="003">3</span> Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled,
though the mountains shake with the [swelling](../ebd/ebd354.htm#001.md)
thereof. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> There is a river, the streams whereof shall make
glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most
High.  

<span id="005">5</span> God is in the midst of her; she shall not be
moved: God shall help her, and that right early.  

<span id="006">6</span> The [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) raged, the
kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.  

<span id="007">7</span> The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) is our refuge.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Come, behold the works of the LORD, what
desolations he hath made in the earth.  

<span id="009">9</span> He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the
earth; he breaketh the [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md), and cutteth the
spear in sunder; he burneth the [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md) in the
fire.  

<span id="010">10</span> Be still, and know that I am God: I will be
exalted among the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), I will be exalted in
the earth.  

<span id="011">11</span> The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) is our refuge.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).
