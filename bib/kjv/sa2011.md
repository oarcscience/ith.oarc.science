### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, after the year was expired,
at the time when kings go forth to battle, that
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) sent [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006), and
his servants with him, and all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and they
destroyed the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002), and besieged
[Rabbah](../ebd/ebd304.htm#005). But [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
tarried still at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="002">2</span> And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) arose from off his bed, and walked upon
the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman
[washing](../ebd/ebd379.htm#002) herself; and the woman was very
beautiful to look upon.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) sent and
enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the
daughter of [Eliam](../ebd/ebd116.htm#001), the wife of
[Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002) the Hittite?  

<span id="004">4</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) sent
messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her;
for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her
house.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the woman conceived, and sent and told
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and said, I am with child.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) sent to
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006), saying, Send me
[Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002) the Hittite. And
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) sent [Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002) to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="007">7</span> And when [Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002) was come
unto him, [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) demanded of him how
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) did, and how the people did, and how the
war prospered.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said to
[Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002), Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet.
And [Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002) departed out of the king's house, and
there followed him a [mess](../ebd/ebd251.htm#004) of meat from the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="009">9</span> But [Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002) slept at the
door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not
down to his house.  

<span id="010">10</span> And when they had told
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), saying, [Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002)
went not down unto his house, [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said unto
[Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002), Camest thou not from thy
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001)? why then didst thou not go down unto
thine house?  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002) said unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), The [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000), and
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007),
abide in tents; and my lord [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006), and the
servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go
into mine house, to eat and to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), and to
lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do
this thing.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said to
[Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002), Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I
will let thee depart. So [Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002) abode in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) that day, and the morrow.  

<span id="013">13</span> And when [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) had
called him, he did eat and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) before him;
and he made him [drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007): and at even he went out
to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to
his house.  

<span id="014">14</span> And it came to pass in the morning, that
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) wrote a letter to
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006), and sent it by the hand of
[Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002).  

<span id="015">15</span> And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye
[Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002) in the forefront of the hottest battle,
and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.  

<span id="016">16</span> And it came to pass, when
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) observed the city, that he assigned
[Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002) unto a place where he knew that valiant
men were.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the men of the city went out, and fought
with [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006): and there fell some of the people of
the servants of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004); and
[Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002) the Hittite died also.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) sent and
told [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) all the things concerning the war;  

<span id="019">19</span> And charged the
[messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005), saying, When thou hast made an end
of telling the matters of the war unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001),  

<span id="020">20</span> And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and
he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye
did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?  

<span id="021">21</span> Who smote [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000)
the son of [Jerubbesheth](../ebd/ebd204.htm#003)? did not a woman cast a
piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in
[Thebez](../ebd/ebd363.htm#005)? why went ye nigh the wall? then say
thou, Thy servant [Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002) the Hittite is dead
also.  

<span id="022">22</span> So the [messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005) went,
and came and shewed [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) all that
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) had sent him for.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the [messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005) said
unto [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), Surely the men prevailed against
us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto
the entering of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008).  

<span id="024">24</span> And the shooters shot from off the wall upon
thy servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant
[Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002) the Hittite is dead also.  

<span id="025">25</span> Then [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said unto
the [messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005), Thus shalt thou say unto
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006), Let not this thing displease thee, for
the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) devoureth one as well as another:
make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and
encourage thou him.  

<span id="026">26</span> And when the wife of
[Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002) heard that [Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002)
her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.  

<span id="027">27</span> And when the mourning was past,
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) sent and fetched her to his house, and
she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) had done displeased the LORD.
