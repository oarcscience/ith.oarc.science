### King James Version: 2 Timothy Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) that is in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the things that thou hast heard of me among
many witnesses, the same commit thou to
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md) men, who shall be able to teach others
also.  

<span id="003">3</span> Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good
soldier of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> No man that warreth entangleth himself with the
affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) him to be a soldier.  

<span id="005">5</span> And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is
he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.  

<span id="006">6</span> The [husbandman](../ebd/ebd185.htm#002.md) that
laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.  

<span id="007">7</span> Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee
understanding in all things.  

<span id="008">8</span> Remember that [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) of the seed of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) was raised from the dead according to my
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md):  

<span id="009">9</span> Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even
unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.  

<span id="010">10</span> Therefore I endure all things for the elect's
sakes, that they may also obtain the [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md)
which is in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) with eternal
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> It is a [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md)
saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:  

<span id="012">12</span> If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if
we deny him, he also will deny us:  

<span id="013">13</span> If we believe not, yet he abideth
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md): he cannot deny himself.  

<span id="014">14</span> Of these things put them in remembrance,
charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no
profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.  

<span id="015">15</span> Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a
workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of
truth.  

<span id="016">16</span> But shun profane and vain babblings: for they
will increase unto more ungodliness.  

<span id="017">17</span> And their word will eat as doth a
[canker](../ebd/ebd071.htm#003.md): of whom is Hymenaeus and
[Philetus](../ebd/ebd293.htm#007.md);  

<span id="018">18</span> Who concerning the truth have erred, saying
that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of
some.  

<span id="019">19</span> Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth
sure, having this [seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002.md), The Lord knoweth them
that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) depart from iniquity.  

<span id="020">20</span> But in a great house there are not only vessels
of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) and of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md),
but also of [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) and of earth; and some to
honour, and some to dishonour.  

<span id="021">21</span> If a man therefore purge himself from these, he
shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's
use, and prepared unto every good work.  

<span id="022">22</span> Flee also youthful lusts: but follow
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), faith,
[charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009.md), peace, with them that call on the Lord
out of a pure heart.  

<span id="023">23</span> But foolish and unlearned questions avoid,
knowing that they do gender strifes.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the servant of the Lord must not strive;
but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,  

<span id="025">25</span> In [meekness](../ebd/ebd246.htm#003.md)
instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give
them [repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008.md) to the acknowledging of the
truth;  

<span id="026">26</span> And that they may recover themselves out of the
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009) of the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md),
who are taken [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001.md) by him at his will.
