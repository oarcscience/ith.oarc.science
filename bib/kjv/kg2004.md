### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of
the sons of the prophets unto [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009), saying,
Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did
fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to
be bondmen.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009) said unto
her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And
she said, Thine [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008) hath not any thing in
the house, save a pot of oil.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then he said, Go,
[borrow](../ebd/ebd062.htm#007) thee vessels abroad of all thy
neighbours, even empty vessels; [borrow](../ebd/ebd062.htm#007) not a
few.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the
door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those
vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.  

<span id="005">5</span> So she went from him, and shut the door upon her
and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.  

<span id="006">6</span> And it came to pass, when the vessels were full,
that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her,
There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then she came and told the man of God. And he
said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy [debt](../ebd/ebd099.htm#009), and
live thou and thy children of the rest.  

<span id="008">8</span> And it fell on a day, that
[Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009) passed to
[Shunem](../ebd/ebd342.htm#001), where was a great woman; and she
constrained him to eat [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006). And so it was,
that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006).  

<span id="009">9</span> And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I
perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us
continually.  

<span id="010">10</span> Let us make a little
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003), I pray thee, on the wall; and let us
set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001): and it shall be, when he cometh to
us, that he shall turn in thither.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and
he turned into the [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003), and lay there.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he said to [Gehazi](../ebd/ebd145.htm#004)
his servant, Call this [Shunammite](../ebd/ebd342.htm#000). And when he
had called her, she stood before him.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold,
thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for
thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001),
or to the captain of the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007)? And she
answered, I dwell among mine own people.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he said, What then is to be done for her?
And [Gehazi](../ebd/ebd145.htm#004) answered, Verily she hath no child,
and her husband is old.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he said, Call her. And when he had called
her, she stood in the door.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he said, About this season, according to
the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord,
thou man of God, do not lie unto thine
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008).  

<span id="017">17</span> And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that
season that [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009) had said unto her, according
to the time of life.  

<span id="018">18</span> And when the child was grown, it fell on a day,
that he went out to his father to the reapers.  

<span id="019">19</span> And he said unto his father, My head, my head.
And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.  

<span id="020">20</span> And when he had taken him, and brought him to
his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.  

<span id="021">21</span> And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the
man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.  

<span id="022">22</span> And she called unto her husband, and said, Send
me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may
run to the man of God, and come again.  

<span id="023">23</span> And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to
day? it is neither new [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004), nor
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003). And she said, It shall be well.  

<span id="024">24</span> Then she saddled an
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001), and said to her servant, Drive, and go
forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.  

<span id="025">25</span> So she went and came unto the man of God to
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006). And it
came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to
[Gehazi](../ebd/ebd145.htm#004) his servant, Behold, yonder is that
[Shunammite](../ebd/ebd342.htm#000):  

<span id="026">26</span> Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto
her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with
the child? And she answered, It is well:  

<span id="027">27</span> And when she came to the man of God to the
hill, she caught him by the feet: but [Gehazi](../ebd/ebd145.htm#004)
came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone;
for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and
hath not told me.  

<span id="028">28</span> Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord?
did I not say, Do not deceive me?  

<span id="029">29</span> Then he said to
[Gehazi](../ebd/ebd145.htm#004), Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in
thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if
any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of
the child.  

<span id="030">30</span> And the mother of the child said, As the LORD
liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and
followed her.  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Gehazi](../ebd/ebd145.htm#004) passed on
before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there
was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and
told him, saying, The child is not awaked.  

<span id="032">32</span> And when [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009) was
come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his
bed.  

<span id="033">33</span> He went in therefore, and shut the door upon
them twain, and prayed unto the LORD.  

<span id="034">34</span> And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put
his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon
his hands: and stretched himself upon the child; and the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) of the child waxed warm.  

<span id="035">35</span> Then he returned, and walked in the house to
and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child
sneezed [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) times, and the child opened his
eyes.  

<span id="036">36</span> And he called [Gehazi](../ebd/ebd145.htm#004),
and said, Call this [Shunammite](../ebd/ebd342.htm#000). So he called
her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.  

<span id="037">37</span> Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and
bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.  

<span id="038">38</span> And [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009) came again
to [Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001): and there was a
[dearth](../ebd/ebd099.htm#005) in the land; and the sons of the
prophets were [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009) before him: and he said
unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and
[seethe](../ebd/ebd326.htm#001) [pottage](../ebd/ebd299.htm#005) for the
sons of the prophets.  

<span id="039">39</span> And one went out into the field to gather
herbs, and found a wild [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004), and gathered
thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot
of [pottage](../ebd/ebd299.htm#005): for they knew them not.  

<span id="040">40</span> So they poured out for the men to eat. And it
came to pass, as they were [eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006) of the
[pottage](../ebd/ebd299.htm#005), that they cried out, and said, O thou
man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.  

<span id="041">41</span> But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it
into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat.
And there was no harm in the pot.  

<span id="042">42</span> And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and
brought the man of God [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) of the
firstfruits, twenty loaves of [barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003), and full
ears of [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) in the
[husk](../ebd/ebd185.htm#004) thereof. And he said, Give unto the
people, that they may eat.  

<span id="043">43</span> And his [servitor](../ebd/ebd329.htm#002) said,
What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the
people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and
shall leave thereof.  

<span id="044">44</span> So he set it before them, and they did eat, and
left thereof, according to the word of the LORD.
