### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 90

<span id="001">1</span> Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all
generations.  

<span id="002">2</span> Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever
thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) to
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007), thou art God.  

<span id="003">3</span> Thou turnest man to
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004); and sayest, Return, ye children of
men.  

<span id="004">4</span> For a thousand years in thy sight are but as
yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thou carriest them away as with a
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000); they are as a sleep: in the morning they
are like [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005) which groweth up.  

<span id="006">6</span> In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up;
in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.  

<span id="007">7</span> For we are consumed by thine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), and by thy wrath are we troubled.  

<span id="008">8</span> Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our
secret sins in the light of thy countenance.  

<span id="009">9</span> For all our days are passed away in thy wrath:
we spend our years as a [tale](../ebd/ebd357.htm#008) that is told.  

<span id="010">10</span> The days of our years are threescore years and
ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their
strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we
[fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004) away.  

<span id="011">11</span> Who knoweth the power of thine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002)? even according to thy fear, so is thy
wrath.  

<span id="012">12</span> So teach us to number our days, that we may
apply our hearts unto wisdom.  

<span id="013">13</span> Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent
thee concerning thy servants.  

<span id="014">14</span> O satisfy us early with thy
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005); that we may rejoice and be glad all our
days.  

<span id="015">15</span> Make us glad according to the days wherein thou
hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.  

<span id="016">16</span> Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) unto their children.  

<span id="017">17</span> And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon
us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of
our hands establish thou it.
