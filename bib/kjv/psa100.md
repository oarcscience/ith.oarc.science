### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 100

<span id="001">1</span> Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye
lands.  

<span id="002">2</span> Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his
presence with singing.  

<span id="003">3</span> Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that
hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) of his pasture.  

<span id="004">4</span> Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into
his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) his name.  

<span id="005">5</span> For the LORD is good; his
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) is [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007);
and his truth endureth to all generations.
