### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> And [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md) his son
reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he placed [forces](../ebd/ebd137.htm#000.md) in
all the fenced cities of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and set
garrisons in the land of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and in the
cities of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), which
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md) his father had taken.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the LORD was with
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md), because he walked in the first
ways of his father [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and sought not unto
[Baalim](../ebd/ebd039.htm#007.md);  

<span id="004">4</span> But sought to the Lord God of his father, and
walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his
hand; and all [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) brought to
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md) presents; and he had riches and
honour in abundance.  

<span id="006">6</span> And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the
LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Also in the third year of his reign he sent to
his princes, even to Benhail, and to [Obadiah](../ebd/ebd276.htm#001.md),
and to [Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006.md), and to
[Nethaneel](../ebd/ebd271.htm#003.md), and to
[Michaiah](../ebd/ebd253.htm#000.md), to teach in the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And with them he sent Levites, even
[Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005.md), and
[Nethaniah](../ebd/ebd271.htm#004.md), and
[Zebadiah](../ebd/ebd388.htm#005), and [Asahel](../ebd/ebd033.htm#001.md),
and [Shemiramoth](../ebd/ebd334.htm#009.md), and
[Jehonathan](../ebd/ebd201.htm#004.md), and
[Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006), and [Tobijah](../ebd/ebd369.htm#002.md),
and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them
[Elishama](../ebd/ebd118.htm#001) and [Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005.md),
priests.  

<span id="009">9</span> And they taught in
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and had the book of the law of the LORD
with them, and went about throughout all the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and taught the people.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the
kingdoms of the lands that were round about
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), so that they made no war against
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Also some of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) brought
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md) presents, and
[tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006) [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md); and
the Arabians brought him flocks, [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) thousand
and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) hundred rams, and
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) thousand and
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) hundred he goats.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md) waxed
great exceedingly; and he built in [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)
castles, and cities of store.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he had much business in the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md): and the men of war, mighty men of
valour, were in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And these are the numbers of them according to
the house of their fathers: Of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), the
captains of [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md);
[Adnah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#004.md) the chief, and with him mighty men of
valour three hundred thousand.  

<span id="015">15</span> And next to him was
[Jehohanan](../ebd/ebd200.htm#008.md) the captain, and with him two hundred
and fourscore thousand.  

<span id="016">16</span> And next him was
[Amasiah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#006.md) the son of
[Zichri](../ebd/ebd392.htm#007.md), who willingly offered himself unto the
LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour.  

<span id="017">17</span> And of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md);
[Eliada](../ebd/ebd115.htm#009.md) a mighty man of valour, and with him
armed men with [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) and
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001.md) two hundred thousand.  

<span id="018">18</span> And next him was
[Jehozabad](../ebd/ebd202.htm#005.md), and with him an hundred and
fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war.  

<span id="019">19</span> These waited on the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), beside those whom the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) put in the fenced cities throughout all
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).
