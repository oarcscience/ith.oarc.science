### King James Version: Micah Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend
thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.  

<span id="002">2</span> Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD's controversy,
and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy
with his people, and he will plead with
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="003">3</span> O my people, what have I done unto thee? and
wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.  

<span id="004">4</span> For I brought thee up out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and redeemed thee out of the house of
servants; and I sent before thee [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003),
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), and [Miriam](../ebd/ebd256.htm#003).  

<span id="005">5</span> O my people, remember now what
[Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005) consulted, and what
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003) the son of [Beor](../ebd/ebd052.htm#009)
answered him from [Shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) unto
[Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001); that ye may know the
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) of the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) myself before the high God? shall I come
before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?  

<span id="007">7</span> Will the LORD be pleased with
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008) of rams, or with ten
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008) of rivers of oil? shall I give my
firstborn for my transgression, the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of my
body for the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) of my soul?  

<span id="008">8</span> He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and
what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005), and to walk humbly with thy God?  

<span id="009">9</span> The LORD's voice crieth unto the city, and the
man of wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath
appointed it.  

<span id="010">10</span> Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in
the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?  

<span id="011">11</span> Shall I count them pure with the wicked
balances, and with the [bag](../ebd/ebd041.htm#008) of deceitful
[weights](../ebd/ebd380.htm#006)?  

<span id="012">12</span> For the rich men thereof are full of violence,
and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is
deceitful in their mouth.  

<span id="013">13</span> Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting
thee, in making thee desolate because of thy sins.  

<span id="014">14</span> Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy
casting down shall be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold,
but shalt not deliver; and that which thou deliverest will I give up to
the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="015">15</span> Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou
shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not
[anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008) thee with oil; and sweet
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), but shalt not
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000).  

<span id="016">16</span> For the statutes of
[Omri](../ebd/ebd278.htm#006) are kept, and all the works of the house
of [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002), and ye walk in their counsels; that I
should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing:
therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.
