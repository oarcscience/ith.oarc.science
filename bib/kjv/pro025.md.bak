### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 25

<span id="001">1</span> These are also proverbs of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), which the men of
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) copied out.  

<span id="002">2</span> It is the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of God
to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.  

<span id="003">3</span> The [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) for height,
and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.  

<span id="004">4</span> Take away the [dross](../ebd/ebd108.htm#004.md)
from the [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and there shall come forth a
vessel for the [finer](../ebd/ebd133.htm#003.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Take away the wicked from before the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and his [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md)
shall be established in [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Put not forth thyself in the presence of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and stand not in the place of great
men:  

<span id="007">7</span> For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come
up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) whom thine eyes have seen.  

<span id="008">8</span> Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know
not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to
shame.  

<span id="009">9</span> Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and
discover not a secret to another:  

<span id="010">10</span> Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and
thine infamy turn not away.  

<span id="011">11</span> A word fitly spoken is like apples of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) in pictures of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> As an earring of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md),
and an ornament of fine [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), so is a
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) reprover upon an obedient
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> As the cold of [snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000.md) in
the time of [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md), so is a
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) [messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005.md) to
them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.  

<span id="014">14</span> Whoso boasteth himself of a false
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005.md) is like clouds and wind without
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> By long forbearing is a
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh
the bone.  

<span id="016">16</span> Hast thou found [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md)?
eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith,
and vomit it.  

<span id="017">17</span> Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house;
lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee.  

<span id="018">18</span> A man that beareth false
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) against his neighbour is a
[maul](../ebd/ebd244.htm#008), and a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), and
a sharp arrow.  

<span id="019">19</span> Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of
trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.  

<span id="020">20</span> As he that taketh away a garment in cold
weather, and as [vinegar](../ebd/ebd377.htm#006.md) upon
[nitre](../ebd/ebd273.htm#009.md), so is he that singeth
[songs](../ebd/ebd348.htm#002.md) to an heavy heart.  

<span id="021">21</span> If thine enemy be hungry, give him
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him
water to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md):  

<span id="022">22</span> For thou shalt [heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md)
coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.  

<span id="023">23</span> The north wind driveth away
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md): so doth an angry countenance a backbiting
tongue.  

<span id="024">24</span> It is better to dwell in the corner of the
housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.  

<span id="025">25</span> As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good
news from a far country.  

<span id="026">26</span> A righteous man falling down before the wicked
is as a troubled [fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md), and a corrupt
spring.  

<span id="027">27</span> It is not good to eat much
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md): so for men to search their own
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) is not [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> He that hath no rule over his own
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) is like a city that is broken down, and
without walls.
