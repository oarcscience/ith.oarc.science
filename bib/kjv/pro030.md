### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 30

<span id="001">1</span> The words of [Agur](../ebd/ebd012.htm#009.md) the
son of [Jakeh](../ebd/ebd196.htm#003.md), even the
[prophecy](../ebd/ebd300.htm#007.md): the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto
Ithiel and [Ucal](../ebd/ebd374.htm#003.md),  

<span id="002">2</span> Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have
not the understanding of a man.  

<span id="003">3</span> I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge
of the holy.  

<span id="004">4</span> Who hath ascended up into
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), or descended? who hath gathered the
wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath
established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his
son's name, if thou canst tell?  

<span id="005">5</span> Every word of God is pure: he is a
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001.md) unto them that put their trust in him.  

<span id="006">6</span> Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove
thee, and thou be found a liar.  

<span id="007">7</span> Two things have I required of thee; deny me them
not before I die:  

<span id="008">8</span> Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me
neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:  

<span id="009">9</span> Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is
the LORD? or lest I be [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), and steal, and
take the name of my God in vain.  

<span id="010">10</span> Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) thee, and thou be found guilty.  

<span id="011">11</span> There is a [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md)
that curseth their father, and doth not [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md)
their mother.  

<span id="012">12</span> There is a [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md)
that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their
filthiness.  

<span id="013">13</span> There is a [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md),
O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.  

<span id="014">14</span> There is a [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md),
whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) from off the earth, and the needy from
among men.  

<span id="015">15</span> The horseleach hath two daughters, crying,
Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four
things say not, It is enough:  

<span id="016">16</span> The [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md); and the
[barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007.md) womb; the earth that is not filled with
water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.  

<span id="017">17</span> The eye that mocketh at his father, and
despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) shall pick it out, and the young eagles
shall eat it.  

<span id="018">18</span> There be three things which are too wonderful
for me, yea, four which I know not:  

<span id="019">19</span> The way of an [eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003.md) in
the air; the way of a [serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009.md) upon a
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md); the way of a ship in the midst of the
sea; and the way of a man with a maid.  

<span id="020">20</span> Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she
eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.  

<span id="021">21</span> For three things the earth is disquieted, and
for four which it cannot bear:  

<span id="022">22</span> For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when
he is filled with meat;  

<span id="023">23</span> For an odious woman when she is married; and an
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008) that is [heir](../ebd/ebd171.htm#007.md)
to her mistress.  

<span id="024">24</span> There be four things which are little upon the
earth, but they are exceeding [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md):  

<span id="025">25</span> The ants are a people not strong, yet they
prepare their meat in the summer;  

<span id="026">26</span> The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they
their houses in the rocks;  

<span id="027">27</span> The locusts have no
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), yet go they forth all of them by
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003.md);  

<span id="028">28</span> The [spider](../ebd/ebd349.htm#006.md) taketh hold
with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.  

<span id="029">29</span> There be three things which go well, yea, four
are comely in going:  

<span id="030">30</span> A lion which is strongest among beasts, and
turneth not away for any;  

<span id="031">31</span> A [greyhound](../ebd/ebd155.htm#005.md); an he
[goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001) also; and a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),
against whom there is no rising up.  

<span id="032">32</span> If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up
thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.  

<span id="033">33</span> Surely the churning of
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000.md) bringeth forth
[butter](../ebd/ebd067.htm#002.md), and the wringing of the nose bringeth
forth [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md): so the forcing of wrath bringeth
forth strife.
