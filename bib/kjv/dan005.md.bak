### King James Version: Daniel Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> [Belshazzar](../ebd/ebd052.htm#001.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) made a great
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) to a thousand of his lords, and drank
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) before the thousand.  

<span id="002">2</span> [Belshazzar](../ebd/ebd052.htm#001.md), whiles he
tasted the [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), commanded to bring the golden
and [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) vessels which his father
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) had taken out of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) which was in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md); that the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and his princes, his wives, and his
concubines, might [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) therein.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then they brought the golden vessels that were
taken out of the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) of the house of God
which was at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md); and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and his princes, his wives, and his
concubines, drank in them.  

<span id="004">4</span> They drank [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), and
praised the gods of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md), of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004), of [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md), and of
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's
hand, and wrote over against the [candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md)
upon the plaister of the wall of the king's
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008): and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
saw the part of the hand that wrote.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then the king's countenance was changed, and his
thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and
his knees smote one against another.  

<span id="007">7</span> The [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) cried aloud to
bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) spake, and said to the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) men of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md),
Whosoever shall read this [writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005.md), and shew me
the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md), and have a
[chain](../ebd/ebd075.htm#008) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) about
his [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md), and shall be the third ruler in the
kingdom.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then came in all the king's
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) men: but they could not read the
[writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005.md), nor make known to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) the interpretation thereof.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then was [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Belshazzar](../ebd/ebd052.htm#001.md) greatly troubled, and his
countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.  

<span id="010">10</span> Now the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md) by
reason of the words of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) and his lords
came into the [banquet](../ebd/ebd043.htm#006.md) house: and the
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md) spake and said, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), live for ever: let not thy thoughts
trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:  

<span id="011">11</span> There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the holy gods; and in the days of thy
father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods,
was found in him; whom the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) thy father, the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), I say, thy father, made master of the
[magicians](../ebd/ebd236.htm#007.md), astrologers, Chaldeans, and
soothsayers;  

<span id="012">12</span> Forasmuch as an excellent
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), and knowledge, and understanding,
interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of
doubts, were found in the same [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md), whom the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) named
[Belteshazzar](../ebd/ebd052.htm#002.md): now let
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) be called, and he will shew the
interpretation.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then was [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md)
brought in before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md). And the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) spake and said unto
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md), Art thou that
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md), which art of the children of the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md),
whom the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) my father brought out of Jewry?  

<span id="014">14</span> I have even heard of thee, that the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the gods is in thee, and that light
and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.  

<span id="015">15</span> And now the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) men,
the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read
this [writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005.md), and make known unto me the
interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of
the thing:  

<span id="016">16</span> And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make
interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the
[writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005.md), and make known to me the
interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md), and have a
[chain](../ebd/ebd075.htm#008) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) about
thy [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md), and shalt be the third ruler in the
kingdom.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) answered
and said before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), Let thy gifts be to
thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the
[writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005) unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),
and make known to him the interpretation.  

<span id="018">18</span> O thou [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), the most
high God gave [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) thy father a
kingdom, and majesty, and [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), and honour:  

<span id="019">19</span> And for the majesty that he gave him, all
people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he
would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set
up; and whom he would he put down.  

<span id="020">20</span> But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind
hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), and they took his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) from him:  

<span id="021">21</span> And he was driven from the sons of men; and his
heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild
asses: they fed him with [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md) like oxen, and
his body was wet with the [dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md); till he knew that the most high God
ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever
he will.  

<span id="022">22</span> And thou his son, O
[Belshazzar](../ebd/ebd052.htm#001.md), hast not humbled thine heart,
though thou knewest all this;  

<span id="023">23</span> But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md); and they have brought the vessels of
his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy
concubines, have [drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007.md)
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) in them; and thou hast praised the gods of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003), [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md),
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), which
see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is,
and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:  

<span id="024">24</span> Then was the part of the hand sent from him;
and this [writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005.md) was written.  

<span id="025">25</span> And this is the
[writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005.md) that was written,
[MENE](../ebd/ebd248.htm#002), [MENE](../ebd/ebd248.htm#002.md),
[TEKEL](../ebd/ebd360.htm#002), [UPHARSIN](../ebd/ebd374.htm#009.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> This is the interpretation of the thing:
[MENE](../ebd/ebd248.htm#002.md); God hath numbered thy kingdom, and
finished it.  

<span id="027">27</span> [TEKEL](../ebd/ebd360.htm#002.md); Thou art
weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.  

<span id="028">28</span> [PERES](../ebd/ebd289.htm#008.md); Thy kingdom is
divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.  

<span id="029">29</span> Then commanded
[Belshazzar](../ebd/ebd052.htm#001.md), and they clothed
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001) with [scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md),
and put a [chain](../ebd/ebd075.htm#008.md) of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) about his [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md),
and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third
ruler in the kingdom.  

<span id="030">30</span> In that night was
[Belshazzar](../ebd/ebd052.htm#001) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
the Chaldeans slain.  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007.md) the Median
took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.
