### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 31

<span id="001">1</span> Now when all this was finished, all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) that were present went out to the cities
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and brake the images in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md), and cut down the groves, and threw down
the high places and the altars out of all [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)
and [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md), in
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) also and
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md), until they had utterly destroyed them
all. Then all the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) returned,
every man to his possession, into their own cities.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) appointed
the [courses](../ebd/ebd091.htm#006.md) of the priests and the Levites
after their [courses](../ebd/ebd091.htm#006.md), every man according to his
service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace
offerings, to [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md), and to give thanks, and
to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.  

<span id="003">3</span> He appointed also the king's portion of his
substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening
burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the
new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the
LORD.  

<span id="004">4</span> Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) to give the portion of the priests
and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.  

<span id="005">5</span> And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) brought in abundance the
firstfruits of [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md),
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), and oil, and
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md), and of all the increase of the field;
and the [tithe](../ebd/ebd368.htm#005.md) of all things brought they in
abundantly.  

<span id="006">6</span> And concerning the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), that
dwelt in the cities of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), they also brought
in the [tithe](../ebd/ebd368.htm#005.md) of oxen and
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), and the [tithe](../ebd/ebd368.htm#005.md)
of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid
them by heaps.  

<span id="007">7</span> In the third month they began to lay the
foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.  

<span id="008">8</span> And when [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) and
the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his
people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Then [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md)
questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005.md) the chief
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) of the house of
[Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008.md) answered him, and said, Since the people
began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had
enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his
people; and that which is left is this great store.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md)
commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they
prepared them,  

<span id="012">12</span> And brought in the offerings and the tithes and
the dedicated things faithfully: over which Cononiah the
[Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009.md) was ruler, and
[Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002.md) his brother was the next.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Jehiel](../ebd/ebd200.htm#003.md), and
[Azaziah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#007), and [Nahath](../ebd/ebd265.htm#004.md),
and [Asahel](../ebd/ebd033.htm#001.md), and
[Jerimoth](../ebd/ebd203.htm#009), and [Jozabad](../ebd/ebd212.htm#002.md),
and [Eliel](../ebd/ebd116.htm#006.md), and Ismachiah, and
[Mahath](../ebd/ebd237.htm#007), and [Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003.md),
were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and
[Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002.md) his brother, at the commandment of
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and
[Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005.md) the ruler of the house of God.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Kore](../ebd/ebd222.htm#005.md) the son of
Imnah the [Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009.md), the
[porter](../ebd/ebd299.htm#000.md) toward the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md), was over the freewill offerings of God,
to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.  

<span id="015">15</span> And next him were
[Eden](../ebd/ebd112.htm#009.md), and Miniamin, and
[Jeshua](../ebd/ebd205.htm#003), and [Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005.md),
[Amariah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#002.md), and
[Shecaniah](../ebd/ebd333.htm#001.md), in the cities of the priests, in
their set office, to give to their brethren by
[courses](../ebd/ebd091.htm#006.md), as well to the great as to the
small:  

<span id="016">16</span> Beside their genealogy of males, from three
years old and upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house
of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges
according to their [courses](../ebd/ebd091.htm#006.md);  

<span id="017">17</span> Both to the genealogy of the priests by the
house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and
upward, in their charges by their [courses](../ebd/ebd091.htm#006.md);  

<span id="018">18</span> And to the genealogy of all their little ones,
their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md): for in their set office they
sanctified themselves in [holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md):  

<span id="019">19</span> Also of the sons of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) the priests, which were in the fields of
the [suburbs](../ebd/ebd352.htm#007.md) of their cities, in every several
city, the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all the
males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies
among the Levites.  

<span id="020">20</span> And thus did [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md)
throughout all [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and wrought that which
was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.  

<span id="021">21</span> And in every work that he began in the service
of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek
his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.
