### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> The word of the LORD came unto me again,
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> What mean ye, that ye use this
[proverb](../ebd/ebd301.htm#002.md) concerning the land of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), saying, The fathers have eaten sour
grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?  

<span id="003">3</span> As I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have
occasion any more to use this [proverb](../ebd/ebd301.htm#002.md) in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the
father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it
shall die.  

<span id="005">5</span> But if a man be just, and do that which is
lawful and right,  

<span id="006">6</span> And hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither
hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), neither hath defiled his neighbour's
wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman,  

<span id="007">7</span> And hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to
the [debtor](../ebd/ebd100.htm#000) his [pledge](../ebd/ebd297.htm#005.md),
hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) to the hungry, and hath covered the
[naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003.md) with a garment;  

<span id="008">8</span> He that hath not given forth upon
[usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006.md), neither hath taken any increase, that
hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment
between man and man,  

<span id="009">9</span> Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my
judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the
Lord GOD.  

<span id="010">10</span> If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder
of [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), and that doeth the like to any one of
these things,  

<span id="011">11</span> And that doeth not any of those duties, but
even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife,  

<span id="012">12</span> Hath oppressed the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath
not restored the [pledge](../ebd/ebd297.htm#005.md), and hath lifted up his
eyes to the idols, hath committed
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md),  

<span id="013">13</span> Hath given forth upon
[usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006.md), and hath taken increase: shall he then
live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall
surely die; his [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) shall be upon him.  

<span id="014">14</span> Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his
father's sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such
like,  

<span id="015">15</span> That hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither
hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), hath not defiled his neighbour's
wife,  

<span id="016">16</span> Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden
the [pledge](../ebd/ebd297.htm#005.md), neither hath spoiled by violence,
but hath given his [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) to the hungry, and
hath covered the [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003.md) with a garment,  

<span id="017">17</span> That hath taken off his hand from the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), that hath not received
[usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006.md) nor increase, hath executed my judgments,
hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his
father, he shall surely live.  

<span id="018">18</span> As for his father, because he cruelly
oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not
good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.  

<span id="019">19</span> Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the
iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and
right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall
surely live.  

<span id="020">20</span> The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son
shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear
the iniquity of the son: the [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) of
the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall
be upon him.  

<span id="021">21</span> But if the wicked will turn from all his sins
that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is
lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.  

<span id="022">22</span> All his transgressions that he hath committed,
they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) that he hath done he shall
live.  

<span id="023">23</span> Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked
should die? saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his
ways, and live?  

<span id="024">24</span> But when the righteous turneth away from his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), and committeth iniquity, and
doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall
he live? All his [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) that he hath
done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed,
and in his [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) that he hath sinned, in them
shall he die.  

<span id="025">25</span> Yet ye say, The way of the LORD is not equal.
Hear now, O house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); Is not my way
equal? are not your ways unequal?  

<span id="026">26</span> When a righteous man turneth away from his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), and committeth iniquity, and
dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die.  

<span id="027">27</span> Again, when the wicked man turneth away from
his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful
and right, he shall save his soul alive.  

<span id="028">28</span> Because he considereth, and turneth away from
all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he
shall not die.  

<span id="029">29</span> Yet saith the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), The way of the LORD is not equal. O
house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), are not my ways equal? are not
your ways unequal?  

<span id="030">30</span> Therefore I will [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md)
you, O house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), every one according to
his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your
transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.  

<span id="031">31</span> Cast away from you all your transgressions,
whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md): for why will ye die, O house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="032">32</span> For I have no pleasure in the death of him that
dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.
