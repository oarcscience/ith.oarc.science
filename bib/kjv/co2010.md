### King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> Now I [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) myself
beseech you by the [meekness](../ebd/ebd246.htm#003.md) and gentleness of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), who in presence am base among you, but
being absent am bold toward you:  

<span id="002">2</span> But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I
am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against
some, which think of us as if we walked according to the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> For though we walk in the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), we do not war after the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md):  

<span id="004">4</span> (For the weapons of our warfare are not
[carnal](../ebd/ebd072.htm#008.md), but mighty through God to the pulling
down of strong holds;)  

<span id="005">5</span> Casting down imaginations, and every high thing
that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md) every thought to the obedience of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md);  

<span id="006">6</span> And having in a readiness to revenge all
disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.  

<span id="007">7</span> Do ye look on things after the outward
appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of
himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we
Christ's.  

<span id="008">8</span> For though I should boast somewhat more of our
authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for
your [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md), I should not be ashamed:  

<span id="009">9</span> That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by
letters.  

<span id="010">10</span> For his letters, say they, are weighty and
powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech
contemptible.  

<span id="011">11</span> Let such an one think this, that, such as we
are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed
when we are present.  

<span id="012">12</span> For we dare not make ourselves of the number,
or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they
measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among
themselves, are not [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> But we will not boast of things without our
measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath
distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.  

<span id="014">14</span> For we stretch not ourselves beyond our
measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to
you also in preaching the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md):  

<span id="015">15</span> Not boasting of things without our measure,
that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is
increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule
abundantly,  

<span id="016">16</span> To preach the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md)
in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of
things made ready to our hand.  

<span id="017">17</span> But he that glorieth, let him
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) in the Lord.  

<span id="018">18</span> For not he that commendeth himself is approved,
but whom the Lord commendeth.
