### King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> Cast thy [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) upon the
waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.  

<span id="002">2</span> Give a portion to
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005), and also to eight; for thou knowest not
what evil shall be upon the earth.  

<span id="003">3</span> If the clouds be full of
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008), they empty themselves upon the earth: and
if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place
where the tree falleth, there it shall be.  

<span id="004">4</span> He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he
that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.  

<span id="005">5</span> As thou knowest not what is the way of the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), nor how the bones do grow in the womb
of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who
maketh all.  

<span id="006">6</span> In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening
withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper,
either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.  

<span id="007">7</span> Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing
it is for the eyes to behold the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001):  

<span id="008">8</span> But if a man live many years, and rejoice in
them all; yet let him remember the days of
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008); for they shall be many. All that
cometh is vanity.  

<span id="009">9</span> Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy
heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine
heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these
things God will bring thee into judgment.  

<span id="010">10</span> Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put
away evil from thy [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007): for childhood and
youth are vanity.
