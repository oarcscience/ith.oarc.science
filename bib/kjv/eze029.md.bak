### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 29

<span id="001">1</span> In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the
twelfth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Son of man, set thy face against
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and prophesy against him, and against
all [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md):  

<span id="003">3</span> Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold,
I am against thee, [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), the
great [dragon](../ebd/ebd107.htm#000.md) that lieth in the midst of his
rivers, which hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for
myself.  

<span id="004">4</span> But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will
cause the [fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005.md) of thy rivers to stick unto thy
scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all
the [fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005.md) of thy rivers shall stick unto thy
scales.  

<span id="005">5</span> And I will leave thee thrown into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), thee and all the
[fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005.md) of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the
open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have
given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And all the inhabitants of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) shall know that I am the LORD, because
they have been a staff of [reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000.md) to the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou
didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon
thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.  

<span id="008">8</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I
will bring a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) upon thee, and cut off man
and [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) out of thee.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md)
shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I am the LORD:
because he hath said, The river is mine, and I have made it.  

<span id="010">10</span> Behold, therefore I am against thee, and
against thy rivers, and I will make the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) utterly waste and desolate, from the
tower of [Syene](../ebd/ebd354.htm#008.md) even unto the border of
[Ethiopia](../ebd/ebd126.htm#005.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot
of [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) shall pass through it, neither shall
it be inhabited forty years.  

<span id="012">12</span> And I will make the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) desolate in the midst of the countries
that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste
shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among
the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.  

<span id="013">13</span> Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of
forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they
were scattered:  

<span id="014">14</span> And I will bring again the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md),
and will cause them to return into the land of
[Pathros](../ebd/ebd286.htm#007.md), into the land of their
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md); and they shall be there a base
kingdom.  

<span id="015">15</span> It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither
shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish
them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.  

<span id="016">16</span> And it shall be no more the confidence of the
house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), which bringeth their iniquity
to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know
that I am the Lord GOD.  

<span id="017">17</span> And it came to pass in the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) and twentieth year, in the first month,
in the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="018">18</span> Son of man,
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md) caused his army to serve a great
service against Tyrus: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was
peeled: yet had he no [wages](../ebd/ebd378.htm#004.md), nor his army, for
Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it:  

<span id="019">19</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I
will give the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) unto
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md); and he shall take her multitude, and
take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the
[wages](../ebd/ebd378.htm#004.md) for his army.  

<span id="020">20</span> I have given him the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) for his labour wherewith he served
against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="021">21</span> In that day will I cause the
[horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003.md) of the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) to bud forth, and I will give thee the
opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am
the LORD.
