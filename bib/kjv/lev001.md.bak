### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD called unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), and spake unto him out of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and say unto them, If any man of you
bring an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) unto the LORD, ye shall bring
your [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) of the
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), even of the
[herd](../ebd/ebd174.htm#009.md), and of the flock.  

<span id="003">3</span> If his [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) be a
burnt [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) of the
[herd](../ebd/ebd174.htm#009.md), let him offer a male without
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md): he shall offer it of his own voluntary
will at the door of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) before the LORD.  

<span id="004">4</span> And he shall put his hand upon the head of the
burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md); and it shall be accepted for
him to make [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for him.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he shall kill the
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md) before the LORD: and the priests,
Aaron's sons, shall bring the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), and
sprinkle the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) round about upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) that is by the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And he shall flay the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and cut it into his
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And the sons of [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md)
the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall put fire upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), and lay the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) in order upon the fire:  

<span id="008">8</span> And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the
parts, the head, and the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md), in order upon the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) that is on the fire which is upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md):  

<span id="009">9</span> But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in
water: and the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall burn all on the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), to be a burnt
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002), an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md)
made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.  

<span id="010">10</span> And if his [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) be
of the flocks, namely, of the [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), or of the
goats, for a burnt [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md); he shall bring it
a male without [blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And he shall kill it on the side of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) [northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002.md) before
the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) round about upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And he shall cut it into his
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md), with his head and his
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005): and the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
shall lay them in order on the [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) that is on
the fire which is upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md):  

<span id="013">13</span> But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with
water: and the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall bring it all, and
burn it upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md): it is a burnt
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002), an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md)
made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.  

<span id="014">14</span> And if the burnt
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) for his
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) to the LORD be of fowls, then he shall
bring his [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) of turtledoves, or of young
pigeons.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
bring it unto the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), and wring off his
head, and burn it on the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md); and the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) thereof shall be wrung out at the side of
the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md):  

<span id="016">16</span> And he shall pluck away his crop with his
feathers, and cast it beside the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) on the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) part, by the place of the
[ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000.md):  

<span id="017">17</span> And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof,
but shall not divide it asunder: and the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
shall burn it upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), upon the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) that is upon the fire: it is a burnt
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002), an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md)
made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
