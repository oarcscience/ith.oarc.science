### King James Version: 2 John Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> The [elder](../ebd/ebd114.htm#008.md) unto the
elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only,
but also all they that have known the truth;  

<span id="002">2</span> For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and
shall be with us for ever.  

<span id="003">3</span> [Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) be with you,
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md), and peace, from God the Father, and from
the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md),
the Son of the Father, in truth and love.  

<span id="004">4</span> I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children
walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.  

<span id="005">5</span> And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I
wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the
beginning, that we love one another.  

<span id="006">6</span> And this is love, that we walk after his
commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the
beginning, ye should walk in it.  

<span id="007">7</span> For many deceivers are entered into the world,
who confess not that [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) is come in the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md). This is a deceiver and an
[antichrist](../ebd/ebd025.htm#000.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Look to yourselves, that we lose not those
things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.  

<span id="009">9</span> Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the
doctrine of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), hath not God. He that
abideth in the doctrine of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), he hath both
the Father and the Son.  

<span id="010">10</span> If there come any unto you, and bring not this
doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:  

<span id="011">11</span> For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker
of his evil deeds.  

<span id="012">12</span> Having many things to write unto you, I would
not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak
face to face, that our joy may be full.  

<span id="013">13</span> The children of thy elect sister greet thee.
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).
