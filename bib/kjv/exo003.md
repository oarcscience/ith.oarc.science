### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Now [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) kept the
flock of [Jethro](../ebd/ebd206.htm#000.md) his father in law, the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) of [Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md): and
he led the flock to the backside of the [desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000.md),
and came to the mountain of God, even to
[Horeb](../ebd/ebd181.htm#009.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a
[bush](../ebd/ebd067.htm#000.md): and he looked, and, behold, the
[bush](../ebd/ebd067.htm#000.md) burned with fire, and the
[bush](../ebd/ebd067.htm#000.md) was not consumed.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said, I will
now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the
[bush](../ebd/ebd067.htm#000.md) is not burnt.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to
see, God called unto him out of the midst of the
[bush](../ebd/ebd067.htm#000), and said, [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md),
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md). And he said, Here am I.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy
shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy
ground.  

<span id="006">6</span> Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father,
the God of [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), the God of
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md), and the God of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007). And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) hid
his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the LORD said, I have surely seen the
affliction of my people which are in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and
have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their
sorrows;  

<span id="008">8</span> And I am come down to deliver them out of the
hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good
land and a large, unto a land flowing with [milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000.md)
and [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md); unto the place of the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007.md), and the
[Hittites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#006.md), and the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md), and the
[Perizzites](../ebd/ebd290.htm#006.md), and the
[Hivites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#007.md), and the
[Jebusites](../ebd/ebd199.htm#004.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) is come unto me: and I have also seen
the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.  

<span id="010">10</span> Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), that thou mayest bring forth my people
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said unto
God, Who am I, that I should go unto [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md),
and that I should bring forth the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md)?  

<span id="012">12</span> And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and
this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast
brought forth the people out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), ye shall
serve God upon this mountain.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said unto
God, Behold, when I come unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and shall say unto them, The God of
your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is
his name? what shall I say unto them?  

<span id="014">14</span> And God said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt
thou say unto the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), I AM hath
sent me unto you.  

<span id="015">15</span> And God said moreover unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Thus shalt thou say unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), the LORD God of your fathers, the God
of [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), the God of
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md), and the God of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), hath sent me unto you: this is my name
for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.  

<span id="016">16</span> Go, and gather the elders of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) together, and say unto them, The LORD
God of your fathers, the God of [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), of
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006), and of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md),
appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which
is done to you in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md):  

<span id="017">17</span> And I have said, I will bring you up out of the
affliction of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) unto the land of the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007.md), and the
[Hittites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#006.md), and the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md), and the
[Perizzites](../ebd/ebd290.htm#006.md), and the
[Hivites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#007.md), and the
[Jebusites](../ebd/ebd199.htm#004.md), unto a land flowing with
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000) and [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou
shalt come, thou and the elders of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), unto
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and
ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the
[Hebrews](../ebd/ebd171.htm#001.md) hath met with us: and now let us go, we
beseech thee, three days' [journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md) into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), that we may
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) to the LORD our God.  

<span id="019">19</span> And I am sure that the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) will not
let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.  

<span id="020">20</span> And I will stretch out my hand, and smite
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) with all my wonders which I will do in
the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.  

<span id="021">21</span> And I will give this people favour in the sight
of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall
not go empty.  

<span id="022">22</span> But every woman shall
[borrow](../ebd/ebd062.htm#007.md) of her neighbour, and of her that
sojourneth in her house, jewels of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and
jewels of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and raiment: and ye shall put
them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the
Egyptians.
