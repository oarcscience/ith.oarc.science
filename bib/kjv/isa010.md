### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees,
and that write grievousness which they have prescribed;  

<span id="002">2</span> To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to
take away the right from the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) of my people,
that [widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003.md) may be their prey, and that they
may rob the fatherless!  

<span id="003">3</span> And what will ye do in the day of visitation,
and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee
for help? and where will ye leave your [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md)?  

<span id="004">4</span> Without me they shall
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) down under the prisoners, and they shall
fall under the slain. For all this his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) is
not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.  

<span id="005">5</span> O Assyrian, the rod of mine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md), and the staff in their hand is mine
indignation.  

<span id="006">6</span> I will send him against an hypocritical nation,
and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the
spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the
streets.  

<span id="007">7</span> Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his
heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations
not a few.  

<span id="008">8</span> For he saith, Are not my princes altogether
kings?  

<span id="009">9</span> Is not Calno as
[Carchemish](../ebd/ebd072.htm#005.md)? is not
[Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005) as [Arpad](../ebd/ebd032.htm#002.md)? is
not [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md) as
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md)?  

<span id="010">10</span> As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the
idols, and whose graven images did excel them of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) and of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md);  

<span id="011">11</span> Shall I not, as I have done unto
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md) and her idols, so do to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) and her idols?  

<span id="012">12</span> Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the
Lord hath performed his whole work upon [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002) and on [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md),
I will punish the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of the stout heart of
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md),
and the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of his high looks.  

<span id="013">13</span> For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have
done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the
bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put
down the inhabitants like a valiant man:  

<span id="014">14</span> And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of
the people: and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all
the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth,
or peeped.  

<span id="015">15</span> Shall the [axe](../ebd/ebd037.htm#003.md) boast
itself against him that heweth therewith? or shall the saw magnify
itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake itself
against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself,
as if it were no [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts,
send among his [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) ones leanness; and under his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) he shall kindle a burning like the
burning of a fire.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the light of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) shall be for a fire, and his Holy One
for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in
one day;  

<span id="018">18</span> And shall consume the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of his [forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006.md),
and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when
a standard-bearer fainteth.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the rest of the trees of his
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006.md) shall be few, that a child may write
them.  

<span id="020">20</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the
remnant of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and such as are escaped of
the house of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), shall no more again stay
upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), in truth.  

<span id="021">21</span> The remnant shall return, even the remnant of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), unto the mighty God.  

<span id="022">22</span> For though thy people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant
of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a
consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land.  

<span id="024">24</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O
my people that dwellest in [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), be not afraid
of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his
staff against thee, after the manner of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> For yet a very little while, and the
indignation shall cease, and mine [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) in
their [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge
for him according to the slaughter of [Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md) at
the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) of [Oreb](../ebd/ebd280.htm#001.md): and
as his rod was upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that his
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md) shall be taken away from off thy
shoulder, and his [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md) from off thy
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000), and the [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md)
shall be destroyed because of the anointing.  

<span id="028">28</span> He is come to Aiath, he is passed to
[Migron](../ebd/ebd254.htm#004); at [Michmash](../ebd/ebd253.htm#002.md) he
hath laid up his carriages:  

<span id="029">29</span> They are gone over the
[passage](../ebd/ebd286.htm#003.md): they have taken up their lodging at
[Geba](../ebd/ebd144.htm#004); [Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005.md) is afraid;
[Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008) of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) is
fled.  

<span id="030">30</span> Lift up thy voice, O daughter of
[Gallim](../ebd/ebd142.htm#003.md): cause it to be heard unto
[Laish](../ebd/ebd223.htm#001), O [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md)
[Anathoth](../ebd/ebd023.htm#004.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> [Madmenah](../ebd/ebd236.htm#001.md) is removed;
the inhabitants of [Gebim](../ebd/ebd144.htm#008.md) gather themselves to
flee.  

<span id="032">32</span> As yet shall he remain at
[Nob](../ebd/ebd274.htm#003.md) that day: he shall shake his hand against
the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) of the daughter of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), the hill of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop
the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down,
and the haughty shall be humbled.  

<span id="034">34</span> And he shall cut down the thickets of the
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006) with [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md), and
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md) shall fall by a mighty one.
