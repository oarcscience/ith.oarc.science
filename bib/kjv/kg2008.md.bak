### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> Then spake [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) unto
the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou
and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the
LORD hath called for a [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md); and it shall
also come upon the land [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) years.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the woman arose, and did after the saying of
the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the
land of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) years.  

<span id="003">3</span> And it came to pass at the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) years' end, that the woman returned out
of the land of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md): and she went
forth to cry unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) for her house and
for her land.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) talked
with [Gehazi](../ebd/ebd145.htm#004.md) the servant of the man of God,
saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that
[Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) hath done.  

<span id="005">5</span> And it came to pass, as he was telling the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) how he had restored a dead body to life,
that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) for her house and for her land. And
[Gehazi](../ebd/ebd145.htm#004.md) said, My lord, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), this is the woman, and this is her son,
whom [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) restored to life.  

<span id="006">6</span> And when the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) asked
the woman, she told him. So the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) appointed
unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all
the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until
now.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) came to
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md); and Benhadad the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md) was
sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said unto
[Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003.md), Take a present in thine hand, and go,
meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I
recover of this disease?  

<span id="009">9</span> So [Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003.md) went to meet
him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md), forty camels'
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md), and came and stood before him, and
said, Thy son Benhadad [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md) hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I
recover of this disease?  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) said unto
him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the LORD
hath shewed me that he shall surely die.  

<span id="011">11</span> And he settled his countenance stedfastly,
until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003.md) said, Why
weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt
do unto the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): their strong
holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), and wilt dash their children, and rip up
their women with child.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003.md) said, But
what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And
[Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) answered, The LORD hath shewed me that
thou shalt be [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> So he departed from
[Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md), and came to his master; who said to
him, What said [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) to thee? And he answered,
He told me that thou shouldest surely recover.  

<span id="015">15</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took
a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so
that he died: and [Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003.md) reigned in his
stead.  

<span id="016">16</span> And in the fifth year of
[Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003) the son of [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md) being then
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md),
[Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005.md) the son of Je hoshaphat
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) began to
reign.  

<span id="017">17</span> Thirty and two years old was he when he began
to reign; and he reigned eight years in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And he walked in the way of the kings of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), as did the house of
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md): for the daughter of
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md) was his wife: and he did evil in the sight
of the LORD.  

<span id="019">19</span> Yet the LORD would not destroy
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) for [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) his
servant's sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his
children.  

<span id="020">20</span> In his days [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md)
revolted from under the hand of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and made
a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over themselves.  

<span id="021">21</span> So [Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003.md) went over to
[Zair](../ebd/ebd386.htm#009.md), and all the chariots with him: and he
rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the
captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.  

<span id="022">22</span> Yet [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md) revolted from
under the hand of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) unto this day. Then
[Libnah](../ebd/ebd228.htm#004.md) revolted at the same time.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the rest of the acts of
[Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003.md), and all that he did, are they not
written in the book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003.md) of the
kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)?  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003.md) slept with
his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004): and [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006.md) his
son reigned in his stead.  

<span id="025">25</span> In the twelfth year of
[Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003) the son of [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) did
[Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006.md) the son of
[Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) begin to reign.  

<span id="026">26</span> Two and twenty years old was
[Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006.md) when he began to reign; and he reigned
one year in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md). And his mother's name
was [Athaliah](../ebd/ebd036.htm#002.md), the daughter of
[Omri](../ebd/ebd278.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And he walked in the way of the house of
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md), and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as
did the house of [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md): for he was the son in
law of the house of [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> And he went with [Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003.md)
the son of [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md) to the war against
[Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md) in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded
[Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003.md) went back to be healed in
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008.md) of the wounds which the Syrians had
given him at [Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005.md), when he fought against
[Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002). And [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006.md) the
son of [Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) went down to see
[Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003) the son of [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md)
in [Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008.md), because he was sick.
