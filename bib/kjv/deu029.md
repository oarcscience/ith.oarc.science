### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 29

<span id="001">1</span> These are the words of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), which the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) to make with the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in the land of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), beside the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) which he made with them in
[Horeb](../ebd/ebd181.htm#009).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) called unto
all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and said unto them, Ye have seen
all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) unto [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005),
and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;  

<span id="003">3</span> The great temptations which thine eyes have
seen, the signs, and those great miracles:  

<span id="004">4</span> Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to
perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.  

<span id="005">5</span> And I have led you forty years in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005): your clothes are not waxen old upon
you, and thy [shoe](../ebd/ebd340.htm#009) is not waxen old upon thy
foot.  

<span id="006">6</span> Ye have not eaten
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), neither have ye
[drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007) [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) or strong
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009): that ye might know that I am the LORD
your God.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when ye came unto this place,
[Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009), and [Og](../ebd/ebd277.htm#002) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003), came
out against us unto battle, and we smote them:  

<span id="008">8</span> And we took their land, and gave it for an
inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002).  

<span id="009">9</span> Keep therefore the words of this
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), and do them, that ye may prosper in
all that ye do.  

<span id="010">10</span> Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD
your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers,
with all the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),  

<span id="011">11</span> Your little ones, your wives, and thy
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) that is in thy
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002), from the hewer of thy
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) unto the drawer of thy water:  

<span id="012">12</span> That thou shouldest enter into
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with the LORD thy God, and into his
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000), which the LORD thy God maketh with thee
this day:  

<span id="013">13</span> That he may establish thee to day for a people
unto himself, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto
thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), to [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006), and
to [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007).  

<span id="014">14</span> Neither with you only do I make this
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) and this
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000);  

<span id="015">15</span> But with him that standeth here with us this
day before the LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us
this day:  

<span id="016">16</span> (For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009); and how we came through the nations
which ye passed by;  

<span id="017">17</span> And ye have seen their abominations, and their
idols, [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) and [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005),
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), which
were among them:)  

<span id="018">18</span> Lest there should be among you man, or woman,
or family, or [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004), whose heart turneth away
this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these
nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth
[gall](../ebd/ebd142.htm#000) and [wormwood](../ebd/ebd384.htm#001);  

<span id="019">19</span> And it come to pass, when he heareth the words
of this [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003), that he
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) himself in his heart, saying, I shall
have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add
drunkenness to thirst:  

<span id="020">20</span> The LORD will not spare him, but then the
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) of the LORD and his
[jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008) shall smoke against that man, and all
the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the
LORD shall [blot](../ebd/ebd061.htm#002) out his name from under
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="021">21</span> And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out
of all the tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), according to all
the curses of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) that are written in
this book of the law:  

<span id="022">22</span> So that the [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008)
to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) that shall come from a far land, shall
say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which
the LORD hath laid upon it;  

<span id="023">23</span> And that the whole land thereof is
[brimstone](../ebd/ebd065.htm#005), and [salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008),
and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005) groweth therein, like the overthrow of
[Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004), and [Gomorrah](../ebd/ebd152.htm#007),
[Admah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#003), and [Zeboim](../ebd/ebd388.htm#009),
which the LORD overthrew in his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), and in
his wrath:  

<span id="024">24</span> Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the
LORD done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002)?  

<span id="025">25</span> Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken
the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of the LORD God of their fathers,
which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009):  

<span id="026">26</span> For they went and served other gods, and
worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto
them:  

<span id="027">27</span> And the [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) of the
LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that
are written in this book:  

<span id="028">28</span> And the LORD rooted them out of their land in
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), and in wrath, and in great indignation,
and cast them into another land, as it is this day.  

<span id="029">29</span> The secret things belong unto the LORD our God:
but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children
for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.
