### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> The fool hath said in his heart, There is no
God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none
that doeth good.  

<span id="002">2</span> The LORD looked down from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) upon the children of men, to see if
there were any that did understand, and seek God.  

<span id="003">3</span> They are all gone aside, they are all together
become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.  

<span id="004">4</span> Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge?
who eat up my people as they eat [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and
call not upon the LORD.  

<span id="005">5</span> There were they in great fear: for God is in the
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) of the righteous.  

<span id="006">6</span> Ye have shamed the counsel of the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006), because the LORD is his refuge.  

<span id="007">7</span> Oh that the [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003)
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) were come out of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002)! when the LORD bringeth back the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) of his people,
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) shall rejoice, and
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall be glad.
