[shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md): five
cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; it
was foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he made the horns thereof on the four
corners of it; the horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it
with [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And he made all the vessels of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), the pots, and the shovels, and the
basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the vessels thereof
made he of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And he made for the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) a brasen [grate](../ebd/ebd154.htm#007.md)
of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he cast four rings for the four ends of the

overlaid them with [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And he put the staves into the rings on the
sides of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), to bear it withal; he made
the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) hollow with boards.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he made the [laver](../ebd/ebd224.htm#009.md)

assembling, which assembled at the door of the
