### King James Version: Job Chapter 42

<span id="001">1</span> Then Job answered the LORD, and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> I know that thou canst do every thing, and that
no thought can be withholden from thee.  

<span id="003">3</span> Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge?
therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for
me, which I knew not.  

<span id="004">4</span> Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will
demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.  

<span id="005">5</span> I have heard of thee by the hearing of the
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md): but now mine eye seeth thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) and [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken
these words unto Job, the LORD said to [Eliphaz](../ebd/ebd117.htm#005.md)
the [Temanite](../ebd/ebd361.htm#002.md), My wrath is kindled against thee,
and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that
is right, as my servant Job hath.  

<span id="008">8</span> Therefore take unto you now
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) bullocks and
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer
up for yourselves a burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md); and my
servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with
you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which
is right, like my servant Job.  

<span id="009">9</span> So [Eliphaz](../ebd/ebd117.htm#005.md) the
[Temanite](../ebd/ebd361.htm#002) and [Bildad](../ebd/ebd058.htm#006.md)
the [Shuhite](../ebd/ebd341.htm#008) and [Zophar](../ebd/ebd396.htm#000.md)
the [Naamathite](../ebd/ebd264.htm#000.md) went, and did according as the
LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the LORD turned the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md) of Job, when he prayed for his
friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then came there unto him all his brethren, and
all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before,
and did eat [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) with him in his house: and
they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had
brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every
one an earring of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more
than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), and six thousand camels, and a thousand
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md) of oxen, and a thousand she asses.  

<span id="013">13</span> He had also [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) sons
and three daughters.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he called the name of the first,
[Jemima](../ebd/ebd203.htm#001.md); and the name of the second,
[Kezia](../ebd/ebd218.htm#003.md); and the name of the third,
Kerenhappuch.  

<span id="015">15</span> And in all the land were no women found so fair
as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among
their brethren.  

<span id="016">16</span> After this lived Job an hundred and forty
years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.  

<span id="017">17</span> So Job died, being old and full of days.
