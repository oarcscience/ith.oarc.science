### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 77

<span id="001">1</span> I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God
with my voice; and he gave [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) unto me.  

<span id="002">2</span> In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my
sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be
comforted.  

<span id="003">3</span> I remembered God, and was troubled: I
complained, and my [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) was overwhelmed.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="004">4</span> Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled
that I cannot speak.  

<span id="005">5</span> I have considered the days of old, the years of
ancient times.  

<span id="006">6</span> I call to remembrance my song in the night: I
commune with mine own heart: and my [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) made
diligent search.  

<span id="007">7</span> Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be
favourable no more?  

<span id="008">8</span> Is his [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005)
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) gone for ever? doth his promise fail for
evermore?  

<span id="009">9</span> Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) shut up his tender mercies?
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="010">10</span> And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will
remember the years of the right hand of the most High.  

<span id="011">11</span> I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I
will remember thy wonders of old.  

<span id="012">12</span> I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk
of thy doings.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thy way, O God, is in the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005): who is so great a God as our God?  

<span id="014">14</span> Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast
declared thy strength among the people.  

<span id="015">15</span> Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people,
the sons of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) and
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005). [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="016">16</span> The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw
thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.  

<span id="017">17</span> The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out
a sound: thine [arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005) also went abroad.  

<span id="018">18</span> The voice of thy
[thunder](../ebd/ebd365.htm#003) was in the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006): the lightnings lightened the world: the
earth trembled and shook.  

<span id="019">19</span> Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the
great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.  

<span id="020">20</span> Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the
hand of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001).
