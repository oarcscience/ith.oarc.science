### King James Version: Daniel Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> In the third year of
[Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009.md) a thing was revealed unto
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md), whose name was called
[Belteshazzar](../ebd/ebd052.htm#002.md); and the thing was true, but the
time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had
understanding of the [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> In those days I [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md)
was mourning three full weeks.  

<span id="003">3</span> I ate no pleasant
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), neither came
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) nor [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) in my
mouth, neither did I [anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008.md) myself at all, till
three whole weeks were fulfilled.  

<span id="004">4</span> And in the four and twentieth day of the first
month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is
[Hiddekel](../ebd/ebd177.htm#009.md);  

<span id="005">5</span> Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and
behold a certain man clothed in [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md), whose
loins were girded with fine [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) of
[Uphaz](../ebd/ebd375.htm#000.md):  

<span id="006">6</span> His body also was like the
[beryl](../ebd/ebd053.htm#008.md), and his face as the appearance of
[lightning](../ebd/ebd229.htm#002.md), and his eyes as lamps of fire, and
his arms and his feet like in [colour](../ebd/ebd086.htm#008.md) to
polished [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md), and the voice of his words like
the voice of a multitude.  

<span id="007">7</span> And I [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) alone saw
the [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md): for the men that were with me saw
not the [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md); but a great quaking fell upon
them, so that they fled to hide themselves.  

<span id="008">8</span> Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md), and there remained no strength in me:
for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no
strength.  

<span id="009">9</span> Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I
heard the voice of his words, then was I in a
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) sleep on my face, and my face toward the
ground.  

<span id="010">10</span> And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me
upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.  

<span id="011">11</span> And he said unto me, O
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md), a man greatly beloved, understand the
words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now
sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then said he unto me, Fear not,
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md): for from the first day that thou didst
set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God,
thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.  

<span id="013">13</span> But the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) of the
kingdom of [Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009.md) withstood me one and twenty
days: but, lo, [Michael](../ebd/ebd252.htm#009.md), one of the chief
princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of
[Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> Now I am come to make thee understand what
shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md) is for many days.  

<span id="015">15</span> And when he had spoken such words unto me, I
set my face toward the ground, and I became
[dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And, behold, one like the similitude of the
sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said
unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md) my sorrows are turned upon me, and I
have retained no strength.  

<span id="017">17</span> For how can the servant of this my lord talk
with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength
in me, neither is there breath left in me.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then there came again and touched me one like
the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,  

<span id="019">19</span> And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not:
peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken
unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast
strengthened me.  

<span id="020">20</span> Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come
unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) of [Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009.md): and
when I am gone forth, lo, the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) of Grecia
shall come.  

<span id="021">21</span> But I will shew thee that which is noted in the
[scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005.md) of truth: and there is none that
holdeth with me in these things, but [Michael](../ebd/ebd252.htm#009.md)
your [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md).
