### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 53

<span id="001">1</span> The fool hath said in his heart, There is no
God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none
that doeth good.  

<span id="002">2</span> God looked down from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) upon the children of men, to see if
there were any that did understand, that did seek God.  

<span id="003">3</span> Every one of them is gone back: they are
altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.  

<span id="004">4</span> Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who
eat up my people as they eat [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006): they have
not called upon God.  

<span id="005">5</span> There were they in great fear, where no fear
was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against
thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.  

<span id="006">6</span> Oh that the [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003)
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) were come out of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002)! When God bringeth back the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) of his people,
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) shall rejoice, and
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall be glad.
