### King James Version: Philippians Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) and
[Timotheus](../ebd/ebd367.htm#001), the servants of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), to all
the saints in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) which are at
[Philippi](../ebd/ebd293.htm#009), with the bishops and deacons:  

<span id="002">2</span> [Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) be unto you, and
peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="003">3</span> I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,  

<span id="004">4</span> Always in every [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000)
of mine for you all making request with joy,  

<span id="005">5</span> For your [fellowship](../ebd/ebd132.htm#002) in
the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) from the first day until now;  

<span id="006">6</span> Being confident of this very thing, that he
which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000):  

<span id="007">7</span> Even as it is meet for me to think this of you
all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and
in the defence and confirmation of the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003),
ye all are partakers of my [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000).  

<span id="008">8</span> For God is my record, how greatly I long after
you all in the [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004) of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="009">9</span> And this I pray, that your love may abound yet
more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;  

<span id="010">10</span> That ye may approve things that are excellent;
that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="011">11</span> Being filled with the fruits of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), which are by
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), unto the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) and praise of God.  

<span id="012">12</span> But I would ye should understand, brethren,
that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the
furtherance of the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003);  

<span id="013">13</span> So that my bonds in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) are manifest in all the
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008), and in all other places;  

<span id="014">14</span> And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing
confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without
fear.  

<span id="015">15</span> Some indeed preach
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) even of envy and strife; and some also
of good will:  

<span id="016">16</span> The one preach [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)
of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:  

<span id="017">17</span> But the other of love, knowing that I am set
for the defence of the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003).  

<span id="018">18</span> What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether
in pretence, or in truth, [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) is preached;
and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.  

<span id="019">19</span> For I know that this shall turn to my
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) through your
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000), and the supply of the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000),  

<span id="020">20</span> According to my
[earnest](../ebd/ebd110.htm#006) expectation and my hope, that in
nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so
now also [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) shall be magnified in my body,
whether it be by life, or by death.  

<span id="021">21</span> For to me to live is
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), and to die is gain.  

<span id="022">22</span> But if I live in the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), this is the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of my labour: yet what I shall choose I
wot not.  

<span id="023">23</span> For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a
desire to depart, and to be with [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000); which
is far better:  

<span id="024">24</span> Nevertheless to abide in the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) is more needful for you.  

<span id="025">25</span> And having this confidence, I know that I shall
abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;  

<span id="026">26</span> That your rejoicing may be more abundant in
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) for me by
my coming to you again.  

<span id="027">27</span> Only let your
[conversation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#001) be as it becometh the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000): that
whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your
affairs, that ye stand [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) in one
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), with one mind striving together for the
faith of the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003);  

<span id="028">28</span> And in nothing terrified by your adversaries:
which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003), and that of God.  

<span id="029">29</span> For unto you it is given in the behalf of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), not only to believe on him, but also to
suffer for his sake;  

<span id="030">30</span> Having the same conflict which ye saw in me,
and now hear to be in me.
