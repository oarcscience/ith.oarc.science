### King James Version: Zechariah Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy
spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.  

<span id="002">2</span> For I will gather all nations against
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) to battle; and the city shall be
taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the
city shall go forth into [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md), and the
residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against
those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.  

<span id="004">4</span> And his feet shall stand in that day upon the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) of Olives, which is before
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) on the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md),
and the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) of Olives shall cleave in the
midst thereof toward the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) and toward the
west, and there shall be a very great [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md);
and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it
toward the south.  

<span id="005">5</span> And ye shall flee to the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) of the mountains; for the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) of the mountains shall reach unto
[Azal](../ebd/ebd037.htm#004.md): yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from
before the [earthquake](../ebd/ebd110.htm#009.md) in the days of
[Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md): and the LORD my God shall come, and all
the saints with thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the
light shall not be clear, nor dark:  

<span id="007">7</span> But it shall be one day which shall be known to
the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening
time it shall be light.  

<span id="008">8</span> And it shall be in that day, that living waters
shall go out from [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md); half of them
toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer
and in winter shall it be.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the LORD shall be
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over all the earth: in that day shall
there be one LORD, and his name one.  

<span id="010">10</span> All the land shall be turned as a
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) from [Geba](../ebd/ebd144.htm#004.md) to
[Rimmon](../ebd/ebd313.htm#005.md) south of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): and it shall be lifted up, and
inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md)
unto the place of the first [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md), unto the
corner [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md), and from the tower of
[Hananeel](../ebd/ebd162.htm#002.md) unto the king's winepresses.  

<span id="011">11</span> And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be
no more utter [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md); but
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) shall be safely inhabited.  

<span id="012">12</span> And this shall be the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) wherewith the LORD will smite all the
people that have fought against [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md);
Their [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) shall consume away while they stand
upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and
their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.  

<span id="013">13</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that a
great tumult from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold
every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up
against the hand of his neighbour.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) also shall
fight at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md); and the wealth of all the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) round about shall be gathered together,
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and
[apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000.md), in great abundance.  

<span id="015">15</span> And so shall be the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) of the horse, of the
[mule](../ebd/ebd262.htm#001), of the [camel](../ebd/ebd070.htm#000.md),
and of the [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md), and of all the beasts that
shall be in these tents, as this [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And it shall come to pass, that every one that
is left of all the nations which came against
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) shall even go up from year to year to
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) the [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), the
LORD of hosts, and to keep the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) of
tabernacles.  

<span id="017">17</span> And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of
all the families of the earth unto [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) to
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) the [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), the
LORD of hosts, even upon them shall be no
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And if the family of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) go not up, and come not, that have no
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md); there shall be the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md), wherewith the LORD will smite the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) that come not up to keep the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) of tabernacles.  

<span id="019">19</span> This shall be the
[punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md),
and the [punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005.md) of all nations that come not
up to keep the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) of tabernacles.  

<span id="020">20</span> In that day shall there be upon the bells of
the horses, [HOLINESS](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md) UNTO THE LORD; and the
pots in the LORD's house shall be like the bowls before the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> Yea, every pot in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) and in [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)
shall be [holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md) unto the LORD of hosts: and
all they that [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) shall come and take of
them, and [seethe](../ebd/ebd326.htm#001.md) therein: and in that day there
shall be no more the [Canaanite](../ebd/ebd070.htm#008.md) in the house of
the LORD of hosts.
