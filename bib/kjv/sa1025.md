### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 25

<span id="001">1</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) died; and
all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried
him in his house at [Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005.md). And
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) arose, and went down to the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Paran](../ebd/ebd284.htm#006.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And there was a man in
[Maon](../ebd/ebd241.htm#001.md), whose possessions were in
[Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006.md); and the man was very great, and he had
three thousand [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), and a thousand goats: and
he was shearing his [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) in
[Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> Now the name of the man was
[Nabal](../ebd/ebd264.htm#005.md); and the name of his wife
[Abigail](../ebd/ebd003.htm#002.md): and she was a woman of good
understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish
and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of
[Caleb](../ebd/ebd069.htm#003.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) heard in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) that [Nabal](../ebd/ebd264.htm#005.md)
did shear his [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) sent out ten
young men, and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said unto the young men,
Get you up to [Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006.md), and go to
[Nabal](../ebd/ebd264.htm#005.md), and greet him in my name:  

<span id="006">6</span> And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in
prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and
peace be unto all that thou hast.  

<span id="007">7</span> And now I have heard that thou hast shearers:
now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was
there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in
[Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee.
Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a
good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy
servants, and to thy son [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And when David's young men came, they spake to
[Nabal](../ebd/ebd264.htm#005.md) according to all those words in the name
of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and ceased.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Nabal](../ebd/ebd264.htm#005.md) answered
David's servants, and said, Who is [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)? and
who is the son of [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005.md)? there be many servants
now a days that break away every man from his master.  

<span id="011">11</span> Shall I then take my
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), and my water, and my
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) that I have killed for my shearers, and
give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?  

<span id="012">12</span> So David's young men turned their way, and went
again, and came and told him all those sayings.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said unto
his men, Gird ye on every man his [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md). And
they girded on every man his [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md); and
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) also girded on his
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md): and there went up after
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) about four hundred men; and two hundred
abode by the stuff.  

<span id="014">14</span> But one of the young men told
[Abigail](../ebd/ebd003.htm#002.md), Nabal's wife, saying, Behold,
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) sent messengers out of the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) to salute our master; and he railed
on them.  

<span id="015">15</span> But the men were very good unto us, and we were
not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant
with them, when we were in the fields:  

<span id="016">16</span> They were a wall unto us both by night and day,
all the while we were with them keeping the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt
do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his
household: for he is such a son of [Belial](../ebd/ebd051.htm#007.md), that
a man cannot speak to him.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then [Abigail](../ebd/ebd003.htm#002.md) made
haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), and five [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md)
ready dressed, and five measures of parched
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md), and an hundred clusters of
[raisins](../ebd/ebd306.htm#000.md), and two hundred cakes of figs, and
laid them on asses.  

<span id="019">19</span> And she said unto her servants, Go on before
me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband
[Nabal](../ebd/ebd264.htm#005.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And it was so, as she rode on the
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md), that she came down by the covert on the
hill, and, behold, [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) and his men came down
against her; and she met them.  

<span id="021">21</span> Now [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) had said,
Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), so that nothing was missed of all
that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.  

<span id="022">22</span> So and more also do God unto the enemies of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), if I leave of all that pertain to him by
the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.  

<span id="023">23</span> And when [Abigail](../ebd/ebd003.htm#002.md) saw
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), she hasted, and lighted off the
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md), and fell before
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) on her face, and bowed herself to the
ground,  

<span id="024">24</span> And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my
lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md), I pray thee, speak in thine audience,
and hear the words of thine [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man
of [Belial](../ebd/ebd051.htm#007), even [Nabal](../ebd/ebd264.htm#005.md):
for as his name is, so is he; [Nabal](../ebd/ebd264.htm#005.md) is his
name, and folly is with him: but I thine
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md) saw not the young men of my lord, whom
thou didst send.  

<span id="026">26</span> Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and
as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to
shed [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), and from avenging thyself with
thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my
lord, be as [Nabal](../ebd/ebd264.htm#005.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And now this blessing which thine
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md) hath brought unto my lord, let it even
be given unto the young men that follow my lord.  

<span id="028">28</span> I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md): for the LORD will certainly make my
lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and
evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.  

<span id="029">29</span> Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek
thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life
with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he
[sling](../ebd/ebd346.htm#005.md) out, as out of the middle of a
[sling](../ebd/ebd346.htm#005.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall
have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken
concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md);  

<span id="031">31</span> That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor
offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) causeless, or that my lord hath avenged
himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then
remember thine [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said to
[Abigail](../ebd/ebd003.htm#002.md), Blessed be the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), which sent thee this day to meet me:  

<span id="033">33</span> And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou,
which hast kept me this day from coming to shed
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), and from avenging myself with mine own
hand.  

<span id="034">34</span> For in very deed, as the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) liveth, which hath kept me back from
hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there
had not been left unto [Nabal](../ebd/ebd264.htm#005.md) by the morning
light any that pisseth against the wall.  

<span id="035">35</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) received of
her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in
peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have
accepted thy person.  

<span id="036">36</span> And [Abigail](../ebd/ebd003.htm#002.md) came to
[Nabal](../ebd/ebd264.htm#005.md); and, behold, he held a
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) in his house, like the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md); and
Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore
she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.  

<span id="037">37</span> But it came to pass in the morning, when the
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) was gone out of
[Nabal](../ebd/ebd264.htm#005.md), and his wife had told him these things,
that his heart died within him, and he became as a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md).  

<span id="038">38</span> And it came to pass about ten days after, that
the LORD smote [Nabal](../ebd/ebd264.htm#005.md), that he died.  

<span id="039">39</span> And when [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) heard
that [Nabal](../ebd/ebd264.htm#005.md) was dead, he said, Blessed be the
LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of
[Nabal](../ebd/ebd264.htm#005.md), and hath kept his servant from evil: for
the LORD hath returned the wickedness of [Nabal](../ebd/ebd264.htm#005.md)
upon his own head. And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) sent and communed
with [Abigail](../ebd/ebd003.htm#002.md), to take her to him to wife.  

<span id="040">40</span> And when the servants of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) were come to
[Abigail](../ebd/ebd003.htm#002) to [Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006.md),
they spake unto her, saying, [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) sent us unto
thee, to take thee to him to wife.  

<span id="041">41</span> And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to
the earth, and said, Behold, let thine [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md)
be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.  

<span id="042">42</span> And [Abigail](../ebd/ebd003.htm#002.md) hasted,
and arose and rode upon an [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md), with five
damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers
of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and became his wife.  

<span id="043">43</span> [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) also took
[Ahinoam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#006) of [Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008.md);
and they were also both of them his wives.  

<span id="044">44</span> But [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) had given
[Michal](../ebd/ebd253.htm#001.md) his daughter, David's wife, to
[Phalti](../ebd/ebd292.htm#002.md) the son of
[Laish](../ebd/ebd223.htm#001.md), which was of
[Gallim](../ebd/ebd142.htm#003.md).
