### King James Version: Ruth Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Then [Naomi](../ebd/ebd266.htm#004) her mother
in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that
it may be well with thee?  

<span id="002">2</span> And now is not [Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006) of
our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth
[barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003) to night in the threshingfloor.  

<span id="003">3</span> Wash thyself therefore, and
[anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008) thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and
get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man,
until he shall have done [eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006) and drinking.  

<span id="004">4</span> And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou
shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and
uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou
shalt do.  

<span id="005">5</span> And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto
me I will do.  

<span id="006">6</span> And she went down unto the floor, and did
according to all that her mother in law bade her.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when [Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006) had eaten
and [drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007), and his heart was merry, he went to
lie down at the end of the [heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000) of
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006): and she came softly, and uncovered his
feet, and laid her down.  

<span id="008">8</span> And it came to pass at midnight, that the man
was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I
am [Ruth](../ebd/ebd316.htm#008) thine
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008): spread therefore thy skirt over thine
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008); for thou art a near
[kinsman](../ebd/ebd219.htm#006).  

<span id="010">10</span> And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my
daughter: for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at
the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) or rich.  

<span id="011">11</span> And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to
thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know
that thou art a virtuous woman.  

<span id="012">12</span> And now it is true that I am thy near
[kinsman](../ebd/ebd219.htm#006): howbeit there is a
[kinsman](../ebd/ebd219.htm#006) nearer than I.  

<span id="013">13</span> Tarry this night, and it shall be in the
morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a
[kinsman](../ebd/ebd219.htm#006), well; let him do the kinsman's part:
but if he will not do the part of a [kinsman](../ebd/ebd219.htm#006) to
thee, then will I do the part of a [kinsman](../ebd/ebd219.htm#006) to
thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.  

<span id="014">14</span> And she lay at his feet until the morning: and
she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be
known that a woman came into the floor.  

<span id="015">15</span> Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast
upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures
of [barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003), and laid it on her: and she went
into the city.  

<span id="016">16</span> And when she came to her mother in law, she
said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had
done to her.  

<span id="017">17</span> And she said, These six measures of
[barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003) gave he me; for he said to me, Go not
empty unto thy mother in law.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until
thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest,
until he have finished the thing this day.
