### King James Version: Luke Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> Now when he had ended all his sayings in the
audience of the people, he entered into
[Capernaum](../ebd/ebd071.htm#007.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear
unto him, was sick, and ready to die.  

<span id="003">3</span> And when he heard of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), he sent unto him the elders of the Jews,
beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when they came to
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), they besought him instantly, saying,
That he was worthy for whom he should do this:  

<span id="005">5</span> For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Then [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) went with
them. And when he was now not far from the house, the
[centurion](../ebd/ebd075.htm#004.md) sent friends to him, saying unto him,
Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter
under my roof:  

<span id="007">7</span> Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to
come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.  

<span id="008">8</span> For I also am a man set under authority, having
under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another,
Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.  

<span id="009">9</span> When [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) heard these
things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the
people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great
faith, no, not in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And they that were sent, returning to the
house, found the servant whole that had been sick.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it came to pass the day after, that he went
into a city called [Nain](../ebd/ebd266.htm#001.md); and many of his
disciples went with him, and much people.  

<span id="012">12</span> Now when he came nigh to the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) of the city, behold, there was a dead man
carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much
people of the city was with her.  

<span id="013">13</span> And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on
her, and said unto her, Weep not.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he came and touched the
[bier](../ebd/ebd058.htm#003.md): and they that bare him stood still. And
he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he that was dead sat up, and began to
speak. And he delivered him to his mother.  

<span id="016">16</span> And there came a fear on all: and they
glorified God, saying, That a great [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) is
risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.  

<span id="017">17</span> And this rumour of him went forth throughout
all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the disciples of John shewed him of all
these things.  

<span id="019">19</span> And John [calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007.md) unto
him two of his disciples sent them to [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md),
saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?  

<span id="020">20</span> When the men were come unto him, they said,
John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should
come? or look we for another?  

<span id="021">21</span> And in that same hour he cured many of their
infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md) he gave sight.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answering
said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and
heard; how that the [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md) see, the lame walk,
the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) is
preached.  

<span id="023">23</span> And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be
offended in me.  

<span id="024">24</span> And when the messengers of John were departed,
he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into
the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) for to see? A
[reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000.md) shaken with the wind?  

<span id="025">25</span> But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed
in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live
delicately, are in kings' courts.  

<span id="026">26</span> But what went ye out for to see? A
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md)? Yea, I say unto you, and much more
than a [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I
send my [messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005.md) before thy face, which shall
prepare thy way before thee.  

<span id="028">28</span> For I say unto you, Among those that are born
of women there is not a greater [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) than
John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater
than he.  

<span id="029">29</span> And all the people that heard him, and the
publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.  

<span id="030">30</span> But the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md) and
lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not
baptized of him.  

<span id="031">31</span> And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken
the men of this [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md)? and to what are
they like?  

<span id="032">32</span> They are like unto children
[sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md) in the marketplace, and
[calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007.md) one to another, and saying, We have
piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye
have not wept.  

<span id="033">33</span> For John the Baptist came neither
[eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006) [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) nor
drinking [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md); and ye say, He hath a
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md).  

<span id="034">34</span> The Son of man is come
[eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006.md) and drinking; and ye say, Behold a
gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!  

<span id="035">35</span> But wisdom is justified of all her children.  

<span id="036">36</span> And one of the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md) desired him that he would eat with
him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.  

<span id="037">37</span> And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a
sinner, when she knew that [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) sat at meat in
the Pharisee's house, brought an [alabaster](../ebd/ebd016.htm#005.md)
[box](../ebd/ebd063.htm#007) of [ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007.md),  

<span id="038">38</span> And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and
began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of
her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the
[ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007.md).  

<span id="039">39</span> Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw
it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md), would have known who and what manner
of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.  

<span id="040">40</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answering
said unto him, [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md), I have somewhat to say
unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.  

<span id="041">41</span> There was a certain creditor which had two
debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.  

<span id="042">42</span> And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly
forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him
most?  

<span id="043">43</span> [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md) answered and
said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him,
Thou hast rightly judged.  

<span id="044">44</span> And he turned to the woman, and said unto
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md), Seest thou this woman? I entered into
thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my
feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.  

<span id="045">45</span> Thou gavest me no
[kiss](../ebd/ebd221.htm#000.md): but this woman since the time I came in
hath not ceased to [kiss](../ebd/ebd221.htm#000.md) my feet.  

<span id="046">46</span> My head with oil thou didst not
[anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008.md): but this woman hath anointed my feet
with [ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007.md).  

<span id="047">47</span> Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are
many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven,
the same loveth little.  

<span id="048">48</span> And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.  

<span id="049">49</span> And they that sat at meat with him began to say
within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?  

<span id="050">50</span> And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved
thee; go in peace.
