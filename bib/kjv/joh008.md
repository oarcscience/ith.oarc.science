### King James Version: John Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) went unto the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) of Olives.  

<span id="002">2</span> And early in the morning he came again into the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), and all the people came unto him; and
he sat down, and taught them.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md) and
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md) brought unto him a woman taken in
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009.md); and when they had set her in the
midst,  

<span id="004">4</span> They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken
in [adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009.md), in the very act.  

<span id="005">5</span> Now [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) in the law
commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?  

<span id="006">6</span> This they said, tempting him, that they might
have to accuse him. But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) stooped down, and
with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.  

<span id="007">7</span> So when they continued asking him, he lifted up
himself, and said unto them, He that is without
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) among you, let him first cast a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) at her.  

<span id="008">8</span> And again he stooped down, and wrote on the
ground.  

<span id="009">9</span> And they which heard it, being convicted by
their own [conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006.md), went out one by one,
beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) was left alone, and the woman standing in
the midst.  

<span id="010">10</span> When [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) had lifted
up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where
are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?  

<span id="011">11</span> She said, No man, Lord. And
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee:
go, and [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) no more.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then spake [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) again
unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me
shall not walk in [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), but shall have the
light of life.  

<span id="013">13</span> The [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md)
therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is
not true.  

<span id="014">14</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered and
said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true:
for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I
come, and whither I go.  

<span id="015">15</span> Ye [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) after the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007); I [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) no
man.  

<span id="016">16</span> And yet if I [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md), my
judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent
me.  

<span id="017">17</span> It is also written in your law, that the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md) of two men is true.  

<span id="018">18</span> I am one that bear
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) of myself, and the Father that sent me
beareth [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) of me.  

<span id="019">19</span> Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father?
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered, Ye neither know me, nor my
Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.  

<span id="020">20</span> These words spake
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) in the [treasury](../ebd/ebd372.htm#000.md),
as he taught in the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md): and no man laid
hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then said [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) again
unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your
sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself?
because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.  

<span id="023">23</span> And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I
am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.  

<span id="024">24</span> I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in
your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your
sins.  

<span id="025">25</span> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saith unto them, Even the same that I
said unto you from the beginning.  

<span id="026">26</span> I have many things to say and to
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) of you: but he that sent me is true; and
I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.  

<span id="027">27</span> They understood not that he spake to them of
the Father.  

<span id="028">28</span> Then said [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) unto
them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I
am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me,
I speak these things.  

<span id="029">29</span> And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath
not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.  

<span id="030">30</span> As he spake these words, many believed on
him.  

<span id="031">31</span> Then said [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) to
those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye
my disciples indeed;  

<span id="032">32</span> And ye shall know the truth, and the truth
shall make you free.  

<span id="033">33</span> They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and
were never in [bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md) to any man: how sayest
thou, Ye shall be made free?  

<span id="034">34</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered them,
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) is the servant of
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).  

<span id="035">35</span> And the servant abideth not in the house for
ever: but the Son abideth ever.  

<span id="036">36</span> If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye
shall be free indeed.  

<span id="037">37</span> I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek
to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.  

<span id="038">38</span> I speak that which I have seen with my Father:
and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.  

<span id="039">39</span> They answered and said unto him,
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) is our father.
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's
children, ye would do the works of [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md).  

<span id="040">40</span> But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath
told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md).  

<span id="041">41</span> Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they
to him, We be not born of [fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008.md); we have
one Father, even God.  

<span id="042">42</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto them,
If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and
came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.  

<span id="043">43</span> Why do ye not understand my speech? even
because ye cannot hear my word.  

<span id="044">44</span> Ye are of your father the
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md), and the lusts of your father ye will do.
He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth,
because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of
his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.  

<span id="045">45</span> And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me
not.  

<span id="046">46</span> Which of you convinceth me of
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)? And if I say the truth, why do ye not
believe me?  

<span id="047">47</span> He that is of God heareth God's words: ye
therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.  

<span id="048">48</span> Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say
we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md)?  

<span id="049">49</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered, I have
not a [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md); but I honour my Father, and ye do
dishonour me.  

<span id="050">50</span> And I seek not mine own
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md): there is one that seeketh and judgeth.  

<span id="051">51</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep
my saying, he shall never see death.  

<span id="052">52</span> Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that
thou hast a [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md).
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) is dead, and the prophets; and thou
sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.  

<span id="053">53</span> Art thou greater than our father
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), which is dead? and the prophets are
dead: whom makest thou thyself?  

<span id="054">54</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered, If I
honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me;
of whom ye say, that he is your God:  

<span id="055">55</span> Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and
if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I
know him, and keep his saying.  

<span id="056">56</span> Your father [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md)
rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.  

<span id="057">57</span> Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet
fifty years old, and hast thou seen [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md)?  

<span id="058">58</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto them,
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md)
was, I am.  

<span id="059">59</span> Then took they up stones to cast at him: but
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) hid himself, and went out of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), going through the midst of them, and so
passed by.
