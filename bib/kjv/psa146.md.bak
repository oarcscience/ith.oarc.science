### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 146

<span id="001">1</span> Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my
soul.  

<span id="002">2</span> While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing
praises unto my God while I have any being.  

<span id="003">3</span> Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of
man, in whom there is no help.  

<span id="004">4</span> His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his
earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.  

<span id="005">5</span> Happy is he that hath the God of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) for his help, whose hope is in the LORD
his God:  

<span id="006">6</span> Which made [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and
earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever:  

<span id="007">7</span> Which executeth judgment for the oppressed:
which giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:  

<span id="008">8</span> The LORD openeth the eyes of the
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md): the LORD raiseth them that are bowed
down: the LORD loveth the righteous:  

<span id="009">9</span> The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth
the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside
down.  

<span id="010">10</span> The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), unto all generations. Praise ye the
LORD.
