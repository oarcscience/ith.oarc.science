### King James Version: Joshua Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) gathered all
the tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) to
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md), and called for the elders of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and for their heads, and for their
judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before
God.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) said unto
all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), Your fathers dwelt on the other side of
the [flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000.md) in old time, even
[Terah](../ebd/ebd362.htm#001.md), the father of
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), and the father of Nachor: and they
served other gods.  

<span id="003">3</span> And I took your father
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) from the other side of the
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000.md), and led him throughout all the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md), and multiplied his seed, and gave him
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And I gave unto [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md)
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) and [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md): and I
gave unto [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005) [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004.md), to possess it; but
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) and his children went down into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> I sent [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) also and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and I plagued
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), according to that which I did among
them: and afterward I brought you out.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I brought your fathers out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): and ye came unto the sea; and the
Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the
Red sea.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when they cried unto the LORD, he put
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) between you and the Egyptians, and
brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen
what I have done in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): and ye dwelt in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) a long season.  

<span id="008">8</span> And I brought you into the land of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md), which dwelt on the other side
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md); and they fought with you: and I gave
them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed
them from before you.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md) the son of
[Zippor](../ebd/ebd394.htm#007), [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), arose and warred against
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and sent and called
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003) the son of [Beor](../ebd/ebd052.htm#009.md)
to [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) you:  

<span id="010">10</span> But I would not hearken unto
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md); therefore he blessed you still: so I
delivered you out of his hand.  

<span id="011">11</span> And you went over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), and came unto
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md): and the men of
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md) fought against you, the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md), and the
[Perizzites](../ebd/ebd290.htm#006.md), and the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007.md), and the
[Hittites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#006.md), and the Girgashites, the
[Hivites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#007.md), and the
[Jebusites](../ebd/ebd199.htm#004.md); and I delivered them into your
hand.  

<span id="012">12</span> And I sent the [hornet](../ebd/ebd182.htm#004.md)
before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two kings of
the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md); but not with thy
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), nor with thy
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And I have given you a land for which ye did
not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the
vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.  

<span id="014">14</span> Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in
sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served
on the other side of the [flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000.md), and in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md); and serve ye the LORD.  

<span id="015">15</span> And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD,
choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your
fathers served that were on the other side of the
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000.md), or the gods of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md), in whose land ye dwell: but as for me
and my house, we will serve the LORD.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the people answered and said, God forbid
that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;  

<span id="017">17</span> For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us
up and our fathers out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md),
from the house of [bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md), and which did those
great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we
went, and among all the people through whom we passed:  

<span id="018">18</span> And the LORD drave out from before us all the
people, even the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md) which dwelt in the
land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) said unto
the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a
jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.  

<span id="020">20</span> If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods,
then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath
done you good.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the people said unto
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), Nay; but we will serve the LORD.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) said unto
the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) you the LORD, to serve him. And they
said, We are witnesses.  

<span id="023">23</span> Now therefore put away, said he, the strange
gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And the people said unto
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), The LORD our God will we serve, and his
voice will we obey.  

<span id="025">25</span> So [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) made a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with the people that day, and set them
a statute and an ordinance in [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) wrote these
words in the book of the law of God, and took a great
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), and set it up there under an
[oak](../ebd/ebd275.htm#009.md), that was by the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md) of the LORD.  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) said unto
all the people, Behold, this [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) shall be a
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) unto us; for it hath heard all the
words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) unto you, lest ye deny your God.  

<span id="028">28</span> So [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) let the
people depart, every man unto his inheritance.  

<span id="029">29</span> And it came to pass after these things, that
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) the son of [Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006.md),
the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.  

<span id="030">30</span> And they buried him in the border of his
inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), on the north side of the hill of
[Gaash](../ebd/ebd140.htm#004.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) served the
LORD all the days of [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), and all the days
of the elders that overlived [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), and which
had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> And the bones of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), which the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) brought up out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), buried they in
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md), in a parcel of ground which
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) bought of the sons of
[Hamor](../ebd/ebd161.htm#004.md) the father of
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md) for an hundred
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md): and
it became the inheritance of the children of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> And [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000.md) the son of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) died; and they buried him in a hill that
pertained to [Phinehas](../ebd/ebd294.htm#003.md) his son, which was given
him in [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md).
