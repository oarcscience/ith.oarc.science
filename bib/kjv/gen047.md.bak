### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 47

<span id="001">1</span> Then [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) came and
told [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), and said, My father and my
brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are
come out of the land of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md); and, behold,
they are in the land of [Goshen](../ebd/ebd153.htm#002.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he took some of his brethren, even five men,
and presented them unto [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) said unto
his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), Thy servants are shepherds, both we,
and also our fathers.  

<span id="004">4</span> They said morever unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), For to sojourn in the land are we
come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md) is sore in the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md): now therefore, we pray thee, let thy
servants dwell in the land of [Goshen](../ebd/ebd153.htm#002.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) spake unto
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), saying, Thy father and thy brethren are
come unto thee:  

<span id="006">6</span> The land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) is
before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to
dwell; in the land of [Goshen](../ebd/ebd153.htm#002.md) let them dwell:
and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them
rulers over my [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) brought in
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) his father, and set him before
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005): and [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md)
blessed [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) said unto
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), How old art thou?  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) said unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), The days of the years of my pilgrimage
are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years
of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the
life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) blessed
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), and went out from before
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) placed his
father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), in the best of the land, in the land of
[Rameses](../ebd/ebd307.htm#001), as [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md)
had commanded.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) nourished
his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), according to their families.  

<span id="013">13</span> And there was no [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md)
in all the land; for the [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md) was very sore,
so that the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) and all the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md) fainted by reason of the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) gathered up
all the money that was found in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and in the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005), for the [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md)
which they bought: and [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) brought the money
into Pharaoh's house.  

<span id="015">15</span> And when money failed in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and in the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md), all the Egyptians came unto
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), and said, Give us
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md): for why should we die in thy presence?
for the money faileth.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) said, Give
your [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md); and I will give you for your
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), if money fail.  

<span id="017">17</span> And they brought their
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) unto [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md):
and [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) gave them
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) in exchange for horses, and for the
flocks, and for the [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) of the herds, and
for the asses: and he fed them with [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) for
all their [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) for that year.  

<span id="018">18</span> When that year was ended, they came unto him
the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord,
how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md); there is not ought left in the sight of
my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:  

<span id="019">19</span> Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both
we and our land? buy us and our land for [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md),
and we and our land will be servants unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md): and give us seed, that we may live,
and not die, that the land be not desolate.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) bought all
the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) for
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md); for the Egyptians sold every man his
field, because the [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md) prevailed over them:
so the land became Pharaoh's.  

<span id="021">21</span> And as for the people, he removed them to
cities from one end of the borders of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md)
even to the other end thereof.  

<span id="022">22</span> Only the land of the priests bought he not; for
the priests had a portion assigned them of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), and did eat their portion which
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) gave them: wherefore they sold not
their lands.  

<span id="023">23</span> Then [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) said unto
the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md): lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall
sow the land.  

<span id="024">24</span> And it shall come to pass in the increase, that
ye shall give the fifth part unto [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), and
four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food,
and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.  

<span id="025">25</span> And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let
us find [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) in the sight of my lord, and we
will be Pharaoh's servants.  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) made it a
law over the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) unto this day, that
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) should have the fifth part, except the
land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) dwelt in
the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), in the country of
[Goshen](../ebd/ebd153.htm#002.md); and they had possessions therein, and
grew, and multiplied exceedingly.  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) lived in the
land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) seventeen years: so the whole age
of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) was an hundred forty and
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) years.  

<span id="029">29</span> And the time drew nigh that
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) must die: and he called his son
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), and said unto him, If now I have found
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand
under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray
thee, in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md):  

<span id="030">30</span> But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt
carry me out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and bury me in their
buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.  

<span id="031">31</span> And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto
him. And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) bowed himself upon the bed's
head.
