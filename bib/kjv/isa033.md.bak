### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 33

<span id="001">1</span> Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not
spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously
with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and
when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal
treacherously with thee.  

<span id="002">2</span> O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for
thee: be thou their arm every morning, our
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) also in the time of trouble.  

<span id="003">3</span> At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at
the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.  

<span id="004">4</span> And your spoil shall be gathered like the
gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall
he run upon them.  

<span id="005">5</span> The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he
hath filled [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md) with judgment and
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability
of thy times, and strength of [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md): the
fear of the LORD is his treasure.  

<span id="007">7</span> Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without:
the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.  

<span id="008">8</span> The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man
ceaseth: he hath broken the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md), he hath
despised the cities, he regardeth no man.  

<span id="009">9</span> The earth mourneth and languisheth:
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md) is ashamed and hewn down:
[Sharon](../ebd/ebd331.htm#009.md) is like a
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005); and [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003.md)
and [Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006.md) shake off their fruits.  

<span id="010">10</span> Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be
exalted; now will I lift up myself.  

<span id="011">11</span> Ye shall conceive
[chaff](../ebd/ebd075.htm#007.md), ye shall bring forth stubble: your
breath, as fire, shall devour you.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the people shall be as the burnings of
[lime](../ebd/ebd229.htm#006.md): as thorns cut up shall they be burned in
the fire.  

<span id="013">13</span> Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done;
and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.  

<span id="014">14</span> The sinners in [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md)
are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us
shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) burnings?  

<span id="015">15</span> He that walketh righteously, and speaketh
uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his
hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), and shutteth his eyes from seeing
evil;  

<span id="016">16</span> He shall dwell on high: his place of defence
shall be the munitions of rocks: [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) shall be
given him; his waters shall be sure.  

<span id="017">17</span> Thine eyes shall see the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) in his beauty: they shall behold the land
that is very far off.  

<span id="018">18</span> Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the
scribe? where is the receiver? where is he that counted the
[towers](../ebd/ebd371.htm#002.md)?  

<span id="019">19</span> Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of
a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that
thou canst not understand.  

<span id="020">20</span> Look upon [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), the
city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) a quiet
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md), a
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) that shall not be taken down; not
one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of
the cords thereof be broken.  

<span id="021">21</span> But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a
place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars,
neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.  

<span id="022">22</span> For the LORD is our
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md), the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is
our [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md); he will save us.  

<span id="023">23</span> Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well
strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey
of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick:
the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.
