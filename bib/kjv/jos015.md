### King James Version: Joshua Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> This then was the lot of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) by their families; even to the border of
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001) the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) of
[Zin](../ebd/ebd394.htm#000.md) southward was the uttermost part of the
south coast.  

<span id="002">2</span> And their south border was from the shore of the
[salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008) sea, from the [bay](../ebd/ebd048.htm#001.md)
that looketh southward:  

<span id="003">3</span> And it went out to the south side to
Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to [Zin](../ebd/ebd394.htm#000.md), and
ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to
[Hezron](../ebd/ebd177.htm#007.md), and went up to
[Adar](../ebd/ebd008.htm#002.md), and fetched a compass to
[Karkaa](../ebd/ebd215.htm#008.md):  

<span id="004">4</span> From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out
unto the river of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md); and the goings out of
that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) border was
the [salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008.md) sea, even unto the end of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md). And their border in the north quarter
was from the [bay](../ebd/ebd048.htm#001.md) of the sea at the uttermost
part of [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md):  

<span id="006">6</span> And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed
along by the north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) of Bohan the son of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009.md):  

<span id="007">7</span> And the border went up toward
[Debir](../ebd/ebd099.htm#007) from the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md)
of [Achor](../ebd/ebd007.htm#000.md), and so
[northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002.md), looking toward
[Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md), that is before the going up to
[Adummim](../ebd/ebd011.htm#000.md), which is on the south side of the
river: and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the
goings out thereof were at Enrogel:  

<span id="008">8</span> And the border went up by the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) of the son of
[Hinnom](../ebd/ebd179.htm#002.md) unto the south side of the Jebusite; the
same is [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): and the border went up to
the top of the mountain that lieth before the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [Hinnom](../ebd/ebd179.htm#002.md)
[westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008.md), which is at the end of the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of the [giants](../ebd/ebd147.htm#006.md)
[northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002.md):  

<span id="009">9</span> And the border was drawn from the top of the
hill unto the [fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md) of the water of
[Nephtoah](../ebd/ebd270.htm#006.md), and went out to the cities of
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Ephron](../ebd/ebd123.htm#008.md); and the
border was drawn to [Baalah](../ebd/ebd038.htm#005.md), which is
Kirjathjearim:  

<span id="010">10</span> And the border compassed from
[Baalah](../ebd/ebd038.htm#005) [westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008.md) unto
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004.md), and passed
along unto the side of [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Jearim](../ebd/ebd199.htm#002.md), which is
[Chesalon](../ebd/ebd079.htm#004.md), on the north side, and went down to
Bethshemesh, and passed on to [Timnah](../ebd/ebd366.htm#005.md):  

<span id="011">11</span> And the border went out unto the side of
[Ekron](../ebd/ebd114.htm#001) [northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002.md): and
the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Baalah](../ebd/ebd038.htm#005.md), and went
out unto [Jabneel](../ebd/ebd194.htm#001.md); and the goings out of the
border were at the sea.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the west border was to the great sea, and
the coast thereof. This is the coast of the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) round about according to their
families.  

<span id="013">13</span> And unto [Caleb](../ebd/ebd069.htm#003.md) the son
of [Jephunneh](../ebd/ebd203.htm#004.md) he gave a part among the children
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), according to the commandment of the
LORD to [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), even the city of
[Arba](../ebd/ebd028.htm#007.md) the father of
[Anak](../ebd/ebd022.htm#005.md), which city is
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Caleb](../ebd/ebd069.htm#003.md) drove thence
the three sons of [Anak](../ebd/ebd022.htm#005.md),
[Sheshai](../ebd/ebd336.htm#002), and [Ahiman](../ebd/ebd014.htm#003.md),
and [Talmai](../ebd/ebd358.htm#001.md), the children of
[Anak](../ebd/ebd022.htm#005.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And he went up thence to the inhabitants of
[Debir](../ebd/ebd099.htm#007.md): and the name of
[Debir](../ebd/ebd099.htm#007.md) before was Kirjathsepher.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Caleb](../ebd/ebd069.htm#003.md) said, He
that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give
[Achsah](../ebd/ebd007.htm#001.md) my daughter to wife.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Othniel](../ebd/ebd281.htm#003.md) the son of
[Kenaz](../ebd/ebd217.htm#003.md), the brother of
[Caleb](../ebd/ebd069.htm#003.md), took it: and he gave him
[Achsah](../ebd/ebd007.htm#001.md) his daughter to wife.  

<span id="018">18</span> And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that
she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001); and [Caleb](../ebd/ebd069.htm#003.md) said
unto her, What wouldest thou?  

<span id="019">19</span> Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast
given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her
the upper springs, and the nether springs.  

<span id="020">20</span> This is the inheritance of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) according to their families.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the uttermost cities of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) toward the coast of
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md) southward were
