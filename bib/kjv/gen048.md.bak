### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 48

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass after these things, that one
told [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), Behold, thy father is sick: and he
took with him his two sons, [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) and
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And one told [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and
said, Behold, thy son [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) cometh unto thee:
and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) strengthened himself, and sat upon
the bed.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) said unto
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), God Almighty appeared unto me at
[Luz](../ebd/ebd233.htm#006.md) in the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md), and blessed me,  

<span id="004">4</span> And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee
fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of
people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) possession.  

<span id="005">5</span> And now thy two sons,
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) and [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md),
which were born unto thee in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md)
before I came unto thee into [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), are mine;
as [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009) and [Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002.md),
they shall be mine.  

<span id="006">6</span> And thy issue, which thou begettest after them,
shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in
their inheritance.  

<span id="007">7</span> And as for me, when I came from
[Padan](../ebd/ebd282.htm#003), [Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004.md) died by
me in the land of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md) in the way, when yet
there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there
in the way of Ephrath; the same is [Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) beheld
Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) said unto
his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And
he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) them.  

<span id="010">10</span> Now the eyes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near
unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) said unto
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), I had not thought to see thy face: and,
lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) brought
them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to
the earth.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) took them
both, [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) in his right hand toward Israel's
left hand, and [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) in his left hand toward
Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) stretched
out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the
younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands
wittingly; for [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) was the firstborn.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he blessed [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md),
and said, God, before whom my fathers [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md)
and [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) did walk, the God which fed me all my
life long unto this day,  

<span id="016">16</span> The [Angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) which
redeemed me from all evil, [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) the lads; and
let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) and [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md); and
let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.  

<span id="017">17</span> And when [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) saw
that his father laid his right hand upon the head of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), it displeased him: and he held up his
father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) said unto
his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right
hand upon his head.  

<span id="019">19</span> And his father refused, and said, I know it, my
son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be
great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his
seed shall become a multitude of nations.  

<span id="020">20</span> And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee
shall [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md),
saying, God make thee as [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) and as
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md): and he set
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) before
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) said unto
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), Behold, I die: but God shall be with
you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.  

<span id="022">22</span> Moreover I have given to thee one portion above
thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) and with my
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md).
