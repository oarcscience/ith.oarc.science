### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 39

<span id="001">1</span> And of the [blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003.md), and
purple, and [scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md), they made cloths of
service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md); as the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he made the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md)
of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), [blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003.md), and
purple, and [scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md), and fine twined
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And they did beat the
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) into thin plates, and cut it into wires,
to work it in the [blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003.md), and in the purple, and
in the [scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md), and in the fine
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md), with cunning work.  

<span id="004">4</span> They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it
together: by the two edges was it coupled together.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the curious [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md)
of his [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md), that was upon it, was of the
same, according to the work thereof; of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md),
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003.md), and purple, and
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md), and fine twined
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md); as the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And they wrought [onyx](../ebd/ebd279.htm#004.md)
stones inclosed in [ouches](../ebd/ebd281.htm#004.md) of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), graven, as signets are graven, with the
names of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And he put them on the shoulders of the
[ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md), that they should be stones for a
memorial to the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); as the LORD
commanded [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And he made the
[breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007.md) of cunning work, like the work of
the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008); of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md),
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003.md), and purple, and
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md), and fine twined
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> It was foursquare; they made the
[breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007.md) double: a span was the length
thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.  

<span id="010">10</span> And they set in it four rows of stones: the
first row was a sardius, a [topaz](../ebd/ebd370.htm#005.md), and a
[carbuncle](../ebd/ebd072.htm#003.md): this was the first row.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the second row, an
[emerald](../ebd/ebd119.htm#007), a [sapphire](../ebd/ebd322.htm#002.md),
and a [diamond](../ebd/ebd103.htm#001.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And the third row, a
[ligure](../ebd/ebd229.htm#004), an [agate](../ebd/ebd012.htm#000.md), and
an [amethyst](../ebd/ebd020.htm#002.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And the fourth row, a
[beryl](../ebd/ebd053.htm#008), an [onyx](../ebd/ebd279.htm#004.md), and a
[jasper](../ebd/ebd198.htm#003.md): they were inclosed in
[ouches](../ebd/ebd281.htm#004) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) in
their inclosings.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the stones were according to the names of
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), twelve, according to
their names, like the engravings of a [signet](../ebd/ebd343.htm#001.md),
every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.  

<span id="015">15</span> And they made upon the
[breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007.md) chains at the ends, of wreathen
work of pure [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And they made two
[ouches](../ebd/ebd281.htm#004) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and
two [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) rings; and put the two rings in the
two ends of the [breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And they put the two wreathen chains of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) in the two rings on the ends of the
[breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And the two ends of the two wreathen chains
they fastened in the two [ouches](../ebd/ebd281.htm#004.md), and put them
on the shoulderpieces of the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md), before
it.  

<span id="019">19</span> And they made two rings of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and put them on the two ends of the
[breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007.md), upon the border of it, which was
on the side of the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md) inward.  

<span id="020">20</span> And they made two other golden rings, and put
them on the two sides of the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md) underneath,
toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof,
above the curious [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md) of the
[ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And they did bind the
[breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007.md) by his rings unto the rings of the
[ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md) with a lace of
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003.md), that it might be above the curious
[girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005) of the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md),
and that the [breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007.md) might not be loosed
from the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md); as the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And he made the robe of the
[ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md) of woven work, all of
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And there was an hole in the midst of the robe,
as the hole of an [habergeon](../ebd/ebd156.htm#006.md), with a band round
about the hole, that it should not rend.  

<span id="024">24</span> And they made upon the hems of the robe
pomegranates of [blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003.md), and purple, and
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md), and twined
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> And they made bells of pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and put the bells between the
pomegranates upon the [hem](../ebd/ebd173.htm#008.md) of the robe, round
about between the pomegranates;  

<span id="026">26</span> A [bell](../ebd/ebd051.htm#008.md) and a
[pomegranate](../ebd/ebd298.htm#000), a [bell](../ebd/ebd051.htm#008.md)
and a [pomegranate](../ebd/ebd298.htm#000.md), round about the
[hem](../ebd/ebd173.htm#008.md) of the robe to
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) in; as the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And they made coats of fine
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md) of woven work for
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and for his sons,  

<span id="028">28</span> And a [mitre](../ebd/ebd257.htm#006.md) of fine
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md), and goodly bonnets of fine
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), and [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md)
[breeches](../ebd/ebd064.htm#008.md) of fine twined
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md),  

<span id="029">29</span> And a [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md) of fine
twined [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md), and
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003.md), and purple, and
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md), of needlework; as the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> And they made the plate of the holy
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of pure [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md),
and wrote upon it a [writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005.md), like to the
engravings of a [signet](../ebd/ebd343.htm#001.md),
[HOLINESS](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md) TO THE LORD.  

<span id="031">31</span> And they tied unto it a lace of
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003.md), to fasten it on high upon the
[mitre](../ebd/ebd257.htm#006.md); as the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> Thus was all the work of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md)
of the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) finished: and the children
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) did according to all that the LORD
commanded [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), so did they.  

<span id="033">33</span> And they brought the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) unto [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md),
the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md), and all his furniture, his
[taches](../ebd/ebd357.htm#001.md), his boards, his bars, and his pillars,
and his sockets,  

<span id="034">34</span> And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and
the covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering,

[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md), and the staves thereof, and the
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) seat,  

<span id="036">36</span> The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the
[shewbread](../ebd/ebd336.htm#008.md),  

<span id="037">37</span> The pure [candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md),
with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to be set in order, and all
the vessels thereof, and the oil for light,  

<span id="038">38</span> And the golden [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md),

and the [hanging](../ebd/ebd163.htm#001.md) for the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) door,  

<span id="039">39</span> The brasen [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), and
his [grate](../ebd/ebd154.htm#007) of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md),
his staves, and all his vessels, the [laver](../ebd/ebd224.htm#009.md) and
his foot,

[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md), his cords, and his pins, and all the
vessels of the service of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), for

[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) in the priest's office.  

<span id="042">42</span> According to all that the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), so the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) made all the work.  

<span id="043">43</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) did look
upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had
commanded, even so had they done it: and [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md)
blessed them.
