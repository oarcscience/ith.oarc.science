### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 23

<span id="001">1</span> When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider
diligently what is before thee:  

<span id="002">2</span> And put a [knife](../ebd/ebd221.htm#007) to thy
throat, if thou be a man given to appetite.  

<span id="003">3</span> Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are
deceitful meat.  

<span id="004">4</span> Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own
wisdom.  

<span id="005">5</span> Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not?
for riches certainly make themselves wings; they
[fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004) away as an [eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003)
toward [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="006">6</span> Eat thou not the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006)
of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:  

<span id="007">7</span> For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat
and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), saith he to thee; but his heart is
not with thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou
vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.  

<span id="009">9</span> Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will
despise the wisdom of thy words.  

<span id="010">10</span> Remove not the old
[landmark](../ebd/ebd223.htm#008); and enter not into the fields of the
fatherless:  

<span id="011">11</span> For their [redeemer](../ebd/ebd308.htm#008) is
mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.  

<span id="012">12</span> Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine
ears to the words of knowledge.  

<span id="013">13</span> Withhold not correction from the child: for if
thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.  

<span id="014">14</span> Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt
deliver his soul from [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003).  

<span id="015">15</span> My son, if thine heart be
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), my heart shall rejoice, even mine.  

<span id="016">16</span> Yea, my [reins](../ebd/ebd310.htm#001) shall
rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.  

<span id="017">17</span> Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou
in the fear of the LORD all the day long.  

<span id="018">18</span> For surely there is an end; and thine
expectation shall not be cut off.  

<span id="019">19</span> Hear thou, my son, and be
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), and guide thine heart in the way.  

<span id="020">20</span> Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters
of [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007):  

<span id="021">21</span> For the drunkard and the
[glutton](../ebd/ebd150.htm#007) shall come to poverty: and drowsiness
shall clothe a man with rags.  

<span id="022">22</span> Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and
despise not thy mother when she is old.  

<span id="023">23</span> Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom,
and instruction, and understanding.  

<span id="024">24</span> The father of the righteous shall greatly
rejoice: and he that begetteth a [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) child
shall have joy of him.  

<span id="025">25</span> Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and
she that bare thee shall rejoice.  

<span id="026">26</span> My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes
observe my ways.  

<span id="027">27</span> For a whore is a [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008)
ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007).  

<span id="028">28</span> She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and
increaseth the transgressors among men.  

<span id="029">29</span> Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath
contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath
redness of eyes?  

<span id="030">30</span> They that tarry long at the
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000); they that go to seek mixed
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000).  

<span id="031">31</span> Look not thou upon the
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) when it is red, when it giveth his
[colour](../ebd/ebd086.htm#008) in the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000),
when it moveth itself aright.  

<span id="032">32</span> At the last it biteth like a
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009), and stingeth like an
[adder](../ebd/ebd008.htm#005).  

<span id="033">33</span> Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and
thine heart shall utter perverse things.  

<span id="034">34</span> Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the
midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.  

<span id="035">35</span> They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I
was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I
awake? I will seek it yet again.
