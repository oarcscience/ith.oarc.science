### King James Version: Joshua Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> Now after the death of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) the servant of the LORD it came to pass,
that the LORD spake unto [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) the son of
[Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006), Moses' [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007),
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) my servant is
dead; now therefore arise, go over this [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004),
thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even
to the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="003">3</span> Every place that the sole of your foot shall
tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003).  

<span id="004">4</span> From the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) and
this [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001) even unto the great river, the
river [Euphrates](../ebd/ebd127.htm#001), all the land of the
[Hittites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#006), and unto the great sea toward the
going down of the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), shall be your coast.  

<span id="005">5</span> There shall not any man be able to stand before
thee all the days of thy life: as I was with
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), so I will be with thee: I will not fail
thee, nor forsake thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this
people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto
their fathers to give them.  

<span id="007">7</span> Only be thou strong and very courageous, that
thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) my servant commanded thee: turn not from
it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper
withersoever thou goest.  

<span id="008">8</span> This book of the law shall not depart out of thy
mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest
observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou
shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.  

<span id="009">9</span> Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a
good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy
God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) commanded
the officers of the people, saying,  

<span id="011">11</span> Pass through the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007),
and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three
days ye shall pass over this [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), to go in
to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.  

<span id="012">12</span> And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and
to half the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002), spake
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006), saying,  

<span id="013">13</span> Remember the word which
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) the servant of the LORD commanded you,
saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this
land.  

<span id="014">14</span> Your wives, your little ones, and your
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002), shall remain in the land which
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) gave you on this side
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004); but ye shall pass before your brethren
armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;  

<span id="015">15</span> Until the LORD have given your brethren rest,
as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the
LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your
possession, and enjoy it, which [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) the
LORD's servant gave you on this side [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004)
toward the sunrising.  

<span id="016">16</span> And they answered
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006), saying, All that thou commandest us we
will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.  

<span id="017">17</span> According as we hearkened unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) in all things, so will we hearken unto
thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003).  

<span id="018">18</span> Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy
commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou
commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good
courage.
