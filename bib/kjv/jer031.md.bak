### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 31

<span id="001">1</span> At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the
God of all the families of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and they
shall be my people.  

<span id="002">2</span> Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left
of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) found
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md); even
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), when I went to cause him to rest.  

<span id="003">3</span> The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying,
Yea, I have loved thee with an [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md)
love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be
built, O [virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): thou shalt again be adorned with thy
tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md): the planters shall plant, and shall
eat them as common things.  

<span id="006">6</span> For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon
the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md)
shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md)
unto the LORD our God.  

<span id="007">7</span> For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and shout among the chief of the
nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy people, the
remnant of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Behold, I will bring them from the north
country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md) and the lame, the woman with child and
her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall return
thither.  

<span id="009">9</span> They shall come with weeping, and with
supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers
of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a
father to [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) is my firstborn.  

<span id="010">10</span> Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and
declare it in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) will gather him, and keep him, as a
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006.md) doth his flock.  

<span id="011">11</span> For the LORD hath redeemed
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and ransomed him from the hand of him
that was stronger than he.  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore they shall come and sing in the
height of [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), and shall flow together to the
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md) of the LORD, for
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000), and for [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md),
and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the
[herd](../ebd/ebd174.htm#009.md): and their soul shall be as a watered
garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then shall the [virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009.md)
rejoice in the [dance](../ebd/ebd097.htm#000.md), both young men and old
together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort
them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.  

<span id="014">14</span> And I will satiate the soul of the priests with
fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md), saith the LORD.  

<span id="015">15</span> Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in
[Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005), [lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005.md),
and [bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009.md) weeping; Rahel weeping for her
children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were
not.  

<span id="016">16</span> Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from
weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded,
saith the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.  

<span id="017">17</span> And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD,
that thy children shall come again to their own border.  

<span id="018">18</span> I have surely heard
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast
chastised me, and I was chastised, as a [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md)
unaccustomed to the [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md): turn thou me, and I
shall be turned; for thou art the LORD my God.  

<span id="019">19</span> Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and
after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea,
even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.  

<span id="020">20</span> Is [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) my dear
son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spake against him, I do
earnestly remember him still: therefore my
[bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004.md) are troubled for him; I will surely have
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) upon him, saith the LORD.  

<span id="021">21</span> Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set
thine heart toward the [highway](../ebd/ebd178.htm#005.md), even the way
which thou wentest: turn again, O [virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), turn again to these thy cities.  

<span id="022">22</span> How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding
daughter? for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman
shall compass a man.  

<span id="023">23</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); As yet they shall use this speech in
the land of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and in the cities thereof,
when I shall bring again their [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md); The
LORD [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) thee, O
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007) of [justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007.md),
and mountain of [holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And there shall dwell in
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) itself, and in all the cities thereof
together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks.  

<span id="025">25</span> For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have
replenished every sorrowful soul.  

<span id="026">26</span> Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep
was sweet unto me.  

<span id="027">27</span> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I
will sow the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) and the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) with the seed of man, and with the seed
of [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> And it shall come to pass, that like as I have
watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down,
and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and
to plant, saith the LORD.  

<span id="029">29</span> In those days they shall say no more, The
fathers have eaten a sour [grape](../ebd/ebd154.htm#004.md), and the
children's teeth are set on edge.  

<span id="030">30</span> But every one shall die for his own iniquity:
every man that eateth the sour [grape](../ebd/ebd154.htm#004.md), his teeth
shall be set on edge.  

<span id="031">31</span> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I
will make a new [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and with the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md):  

<span id="032">32</span> Not according to the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) that I made with their fathers in the
day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md); which my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) they brake, although I was an husband
unto them, saith the LORD:  

<span id="033">33</span> But this shall be the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) that I will make with the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); After those days, saith the LORD, I
will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and
will be their God, and they shall be my people.  

<span id="034">34</span> And they shall teach no more every man his
neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they
shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them,
saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember
their [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) no more.  

<span id="035">35</span> Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) for a light by day, and the ordinances of
the [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004.md) and of the
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md) for a light by night, which divideth the
sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts is his name:  

<span id="036">36</span> If those ordinances depart from before me,
saith the LORD, then the seed of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) also
shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.  

<span id="037">37</span> Thus saith the LORD; If
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) above can be measured, and the
foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all
the seed of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) for all that they have done,
saith the LORD.  

<span id="038">38</span> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the
city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of
[Hananeel](../ebd/ebd162.htm#002) unto the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md)
of the corner.  

<span id="039">39</span> And the measuring line shall yet go forth over
against it upon the hill [Gareb](../ebd/ebd143.htm#002.md), and shall
compass about to [Goath](../ebd/ebd151.htm#002.md).  

<span id="040">40</span> And the whole [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md)
of the dead bodies, and of the [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000.md), and all
the fields unto the [brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006.md) of
[Kidron](../ebd/ebd218.htm#008.md), unto the corner of the horse
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) toward the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md),
shall be holy unto the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down
any more for ever.
