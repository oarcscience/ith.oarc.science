### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 105

<span id="001">1</span> O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name:
make known his deeds among the people.  

<span id="002">2</span> Sing unto him, sing
[psalms](../ebd/ebd301.htm#005.md) unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous
works.  

<span id="003">3</span> [Glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) ye in his holy
name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.  

<span id="004">4</span> Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face
evermore.  

<span id="005">5</span> Remember his marvellous works that he hath done;
his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;  

<span id="006">6</span> O ye seed of [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md)
his servant, ye children of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) his
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all
the earth.  

<span id="008">8</span> He hath remembered his
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) for ever, the word which he commanded
to a thousand generations.  

<span id="009">9</span> Which [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) he made
with [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), and his
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) unto [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md);  

<span id="010">10</span> And confirmed the same unto
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) for a law, and to
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) for an
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md)
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md):  

<span id="011">11</span> Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md), the lot of your inheritance:  

<span id="012">12</span> When they were but a few men in number; yea,
very few, and strangers in it.  

<span id="013">13</span> When they went from one nation to another, from
one kingdom to another people;  

<span id="014">14</span> He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he
reproved kings for their sakes;  

<span id="015">15</span> Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my
prophets no harm.  

<span id="016">16</span> Moreover he called for a
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md) upon the land: he brake the whole staff
of [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> He sent a man before them, even
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), who was sold for a servant:  

<span id="018">18</span> Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid
in [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md):  

<span id="019">19</span> Until the time that his word came: the word of
the LORD tried him.  

<span id="020">20</span> The [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) sent and
loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.  

<span id="021">21</span> He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all
his substance:  

<span id="022">22</span> To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach
his senators wisdom.  

<span id="023">23</span> [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) also came into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009); and [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md)
sojourned in the land of [Ham](../ebd/ebd160.htm#003.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And he increased his people greatly; and made
them stronger than their enemies.  

<span id="025">25</span> He turned their heart to hate his people, to
deal subtilly with his servants.  

<span id="026">26</span> He sent [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) his
servant; and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) whom he had
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> They shewed his signs among them, and wonders
in the land of [Ham](../ebd/ebd160.htm#003.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> He sent [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), and
made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.  

<span id="029">29</span> He turned their waters into
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), and slew their
[fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in
the chambers of their kings.  

<span id="031">31</span> He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies,
and [lice](../ebd/ebd228.htm#007.md) in all their coasts.  

<span id="032">32</span> He gave them [hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002.md) for
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md), and flaming fire in their land.  

<span id="033">33</span> He smote their vines also and their
[fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001.md) trees; and brake the trees of their
coasts.  

<span id="034">34</span> He spake, and the locusts came, and
caterpillers, and that without number,  

<span id="035">35</span> And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and
devoured the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of their ground.  

<span id="036">36</span> He smote also all the firstborn in their land,
the chief of all their strength.  

<span id="037">37</span> He brought them forth also with
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md): and
there was not one feeble person among their tribes.  

<span id="038">38</span> [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) was glad when
they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.  

<span id="039">39</span> He spread a [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md) for
a covering; and fire to give light in the night.  

<span id="040">40</span> The people asked, and he brought
[quails](../ebd/ebd303.htm#002.md), and satisfied them with the
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="041">41</span> He opened the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md),
and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.  

<span id="042">42</span> For he remembered his holy promise, and
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) his servant.  

<span id="043">43</span> And he brought forth his people with joy, and
his [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) with gladness:  

<span id="044">44</span> And gave them the lands of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md): and they inherited the labour of the
people;  

<span id="045">45</span> That they might observe his statutes, and keep
his laws. Praise ye the LORD.
