### King James Version: Job Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my
complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.  

<span id="002">2</span> I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me
wherefore thou contendest with me.  

<span id="003">3</span> Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest
oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine
upon the counsel of the wicked?  

<span id="004">4</span> Hast thou eyes of
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007)? or seest thou as man seeth?  

<span id="005">5</span> Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years
as man's days,  

<span id="006">6</span> That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and
searchest after my [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)?  

<span id="007">7</span> Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is
none that can deliver out of thine hand.  

<span id="008">8</span> Thine hands have made me and fashioned me
together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.  

<span id="009">9</span> Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me
as the [clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004); and wilt thou bring me into
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) again?  

<span id="010">10</span> Hast thou not poured me out as
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000), and curdled me like
[cheese](../ebd/ebd078.htm#005)?  

<span id="011">11</span> Thou hast clothed me with skin and
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), and hast fenced me with bones and
sinews.  

<span id="012">12</span> Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy
visitation hath preserved my [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009).  

<span id="013">13</span> And these things hast thou hid in thine heart:
I know that this is with thee.  

<span id="014">14</span> If I [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), then thou
markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.  

<span id="015">15</span> If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be
righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion;
therefore see thou mine affliction;  

<span id="016">16</span> For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce
lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.  

<span id="017">17</span> Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and
increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.  

<span id="018">18</span> Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out
of the womb? Oh that I had given up the [ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005),
and no eye had seen me!  

<span id="019">19</span> I should have been as though I had not been; I
should have been carried from the womb to the
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008).  

<span id="020">20</span> Are not my days few? cease then, and let me
alone, that I may take comfort a little,  

<span id="021">21</span> Before I go whence I shall not return, even to
the land of [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) and the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) of death;  

<span id="022">22</span> A land of [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008), as
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) itself; and of the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) of death, without any order, and where
the light is as [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008).
