### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> A GOOD name is rather to be
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) than great riches, and loving favour
rather than [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) and
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> The rich and [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) meet
together: the LORD is the maker of them all.  

<span id="003">3</span> A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth
himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.  

<span id="004">4</span> By [humility](../ebd/ebd184.htm#007.md) and the
fear of the LORD are riches, and honour, and life.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward:
he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.  

<span id="006">6</span> Train up a child in the way he should go: and
when he is old, he will not depart from it.  

<span id="007">7</span> The rich ruleth over the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), and the borrower is servant to the
lender.  

<span id="008">8</span> He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and
the rod of his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) shall fail.  

<span id="009">9</span> He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed;
for he giveth of his [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) to the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go
out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease.  

<span id="011">11</span> He that loveth pureness of heart, for the
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of his lips the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) shall be his friend.  

<span id="012">12</span> The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he
overthroweth the words of the transgressor.  

<span id="013">13</span> The slothful man saith, There is a lion
without, I shall be slain in the streets.  

<span id="014">14</span> The mouth of strange women is a
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008) [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md): he that is
abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.  

<span id="015">15</span> Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child;
but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.  

<span id="016">16</span> He that oppresseth the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) to increase his riches, and he that giveth
to the rich, shall surely come to want.  

<span id="017">17</span> [Bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) down thine
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md), and hear the words of the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md), and apply thine heart unto my
knowledge.  

<span id="018">18</span> For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them
within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips.  

<span id="019">19</span> That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made
known to thee this day, even to thee.  

<span id="020">20</span> Have not I written to thee excellent things in
counsels and knowledge,  

<span id="021">21</span> That I might make thee know the certainty of
the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them
that send unto thee?  

<span id="022">22</span> Rob not the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md),
because he is [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md): neither oppress the
afflicted in the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md):  

<span id="023">23</span> For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil
the soul of those that spoiled them.  

<span id="024">24</span> Make no friendship with an angry man; and with
a furious man thou shalt not go:  

<span id="025">25</span> Lest thou learn his ways, and get a
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009.md) to thy soul.  

<span id="026">26</span> Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or
of them that are sureties for debts.  

<span id="027">27</span> If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take
away thy bed from under thee?  

<span id="028">28</span> Remove not the ancient
[landmark](../ebd/ebd223.htm#008.md), which thy fathers have set.  

<span id="029">29</span> Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he
shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.
