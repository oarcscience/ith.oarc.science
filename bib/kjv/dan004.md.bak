### King James Version: Daniel Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), unto all people, nations, and languages,
that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.  

<span id="002">2</span> I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders
that the high God hath wrought toward me.  

<span id="003">3</span> How great are his signs! and how mighty are his
wonders! his kingdom is an [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) kingdom,
and his dominion is from [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) to
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> I [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) was at
rest in mine house, and flourishing in my
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md):  

<span id="005">5</span> I saw a [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md) which
made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head
troubled me.  

<span id="006">6</span> Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) men of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md)
before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Then came in the
[magicians](../ebd/ebd236.htm#007.md), the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and
the soothsayers: and I told the [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md) before
them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.  

<span id="008">8</span> But at the last [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md)
came in before me, whose name was [Belteshazzar](../ebd/ebd052.htm#002.md),
according to the name of my God, and in whom is the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the holy gods: and before him I told
the [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md), saying,  

<span id="009">9</span> O [Belteshazzar](../ebd/ebd052.htm#002.md), master
of the [magicians](../ebd/ebd236.htm#007.md), because I know that the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the holy gods is in thee, and no
secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md) that I have seen, and the interpretation
thereof.  

<span id="010">10</span> Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I
saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof
was great.  

<span id="011">11</span> The tree grew, and was strong, and the height
thereof reached unto [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and the sight
thereof to the end of all the earth:  

<span id="012">12</span> The leaves thereof were fair, and the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) thereof much, and in it was meat for all:
the beasts of the field had [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) under it,
and the fowls of the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) dwelt in the boughs
thereof, and all [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) was fed of it.  

<span id="013">13</span> I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed,
and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md);  

<span id="014">14</span> He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the
tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md): let the beasts get away from under it,
and the fowls from his branches:  

<span id="015">15</span> Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in
the earth, even with a band of [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md) and
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md), in the tender
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md) of the field; and let it be wet with the
[dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and let
his portion be with the beasts in the [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md) of
the earth:  

<span id="016">16</span> Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a
beast's heart be given unto him; and let [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
times pass over him.  

<span id="017">17</span> This matter is by the decree of the watchers,
and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the
living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and
giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of
men.  

<span id="018">18</span> This [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md) I
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md)
have seen. Now thou, O [Belteshazzar](../ebd/ebd052.htm#002.md), declare
the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) men of my kingdom are not able to make
known unto me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the holy gods is in thee.  

<span id="019">19</span> Then [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md), whose
name was [Belteshazzar](../ebd/ebd052.htm#002.md), was astonied for one
hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
spake, and said, [Belteshazzar](../ebd/ebd052.htm#002.md), let not the
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md), or the interpretation thereof, trouble
thee. [Belteshazzar](../ebd/ebd052.htm#002.md) answered and said, My lord,
the [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md) be to them that hate thee, and the
interpretation thereof to thine enemies.  

<span id="020">20</span> The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was
strong, whose height reached unto the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md),
and the sight thereof to all the earth;  

<span id="021">21</span> Whose leaves were fair, and the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) thereof much, and in it was meat for all;
under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the
fowls of the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) had their
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md):  

<span id="022">22</span> It is thou, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),
that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and
reacheth unto [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and thy dominion to the
end of the earth.  

<span id="023">23</span> And whereas the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and saying, Hew the tree down, and
destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even
with a band of [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md) and
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md), in the tender
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md) of the field; and let it be wet with the
[dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and let
his portion be with the beasts of the field, till
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times pass over him;  

<span id="024">24</span> This is the interpretation, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and this is the decree of the most High,
which is come upon my lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md):  

<span id="025">25</span> That they shall drive thee from men, and thy
dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee
to eat [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md) as oxen, and they shall wet thee
with the [dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in
the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.  

<span id="026">26</span> And whereas they commanded to leave the stump
of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou
shalt have known that the heavens do rule.  

<span id="027">27</span> Wherefore, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), let
my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), and thine iniquities by shewing
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) to the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md); if
it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.  

<span id="028">28</span> All this came upon the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> At the end of twelve months he walked in the
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md) of the kingdom of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> The [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) spake, and
said, Is not this great [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), that I have
built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the
honour of my majesty?  

<span id="031">31</span> While the word was in the king's mouth, there
fell a voice from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), saying, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md),
to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.  

<span id="032">32</span> And they shall drive thee from men, and thy
dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to
eat [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md) as oxen, and
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times shall pass over thee, until thou
know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to
whomsoever he will.  

<span id="033">33</span> The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md): and he was driven from men, and
did eat [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md) as oxen, and his body was wet
with the [dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), till his hairs were grown like eagles'
feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.  

<span id="034">34</span> And at the end of the days I
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) lifted up mine eyes unto
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and mine understanding returned unto
me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that
liveth for ever, whose dominion is an
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) dominion, and his kingdom is from
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) to
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md):  

<span id="035">35</span> And all the inhabitants of the earth are
reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and among the inhabitants of the earth:
and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?  

<span id="036">36</span> At the same time my reason returned unto me;
and for the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of my kingdom, mine honour
and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought
unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was
added unto me.  

<span id="037">37</span> Now I [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md)
praise and extol and honour the [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), all whose works are truth, and his ways
judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.
