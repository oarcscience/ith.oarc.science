### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 50

<span id="001">1</span> The word that the LORD spake against
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) and against the land of the Chaldeans
by [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008).  

<span id="002">2</span> Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and
set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say,
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) is taken, [Bel](../ebd/ebd051.htm#005)
is confounded, [Merodach](../ebd/ebd250.htm#001) is broken in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002); her idols are confounded, her images
are broken in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002).  

<span id="003">3</span> For out of the north there cometh up a nation
against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell
therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001).  

<span id="004">4</span> In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD,
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall come, they and the
children of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) together, going and weeping:
they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.  

<span id="005">5</span> They shall ask the way to
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002) with their faces thitherward, saying,
Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) that shall not be forgotten.  

<span id="006">6</span> My people hath been lost
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005): their shepherds have caused them to go
astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from
mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.  

<span id="007">7</span> All that found them have devoured them: and
their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against
the LORD, the [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007) of
[justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007), even the LORD, the hope of their
fathers.  

<span id="008">8</span> Remove out of the midst of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and go forth out of the land of the
Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.  

<span id="009">9</span> For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up
against [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) an assembly of great nations
from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against
her; from thence she shall be taken: their
[arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005) shall be as of a mighty expert man; none
shall return in vain.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Chaldea](../ebd/ebd076.htm#000) shall be a
spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD.  

<span id="011">11</span> Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye
destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) as the [heifer](../ebd/ebd171.htm#006) at
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005), and bellow as bulls;  

<span id="012">12</span> Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that
bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall
be a [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), a dry land, and a
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000).  

<span id="013">13</span> Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not
be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) shall be astonished, and
[hiss](../ebd/ebd179.htm#005) at all her plagues.  

<span id="014">14</span> Put yourselves in array against
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) round about: all ye that bend the
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003), shoot at her, spare no
[arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005): for she hath sinned against the LORD.  

<span id="015">15</span> Shout against her round about: she hath given
her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it
is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done,
do unto her.  

<span id="016">16</span> Cut off the sower from
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and him that handleth the
[sickle](../ebd/ebd342.htm#008) in the time of
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008): for fear of the oppressing
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) they shall turn every one to his people,
and they shall flee every one to his own land.  

<span id="017">17</span> [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) is a scattered
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005); the [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001) have
driven him away: first the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) hath devoured him; and last this
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) hath broken his bones.  

<span id="018">18</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); Behold, I will punish the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) and
his land, as I have punished the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005).  

<span id="019">19</span> And I will bring
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) again to his
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007), and he shall feed on
[Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006) and [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003), and
his soul shall be satisfied upon [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) and [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009).  

<span id="020">20</span> In those days, and in that time, saith the
LORD, the iniquity of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall be sought
for, and there shall be none; and the sins of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and they shall not be found: for I will
[pardon](../ebd/ebd285.htm#001) them whom I reserve.  

<span id="021">21</span> Go up against the land of
[Merathaim](../ebd/ebd249.htm#002), even against it, and against the
inhabitants of [Pekod](../ebd/ebd288.htm#004): waste and utterly destroy
after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have
commanded thee.  

<span id="022">22</span> A sound of battle is in the land, and of great
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004).  

<span id="023">23</span> How is the [hammer](../ebd/ebd161.htm#000) of
the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) become a desolation among the
nations!  

<span id="024">24</span> I have laid a [snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009)
for thee, and thou art also taken, O [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001),
and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou
hast striven against the LORD.  

<span id="025">25</span> The LORD hath opened his
[armoury](../ebd/ebd031.htm#008), and hath brought forth the weapons of
his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the
land of the Chaldeans.  

<span id="026">26</span> Come against her from the utmost border, open
her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let
nothing of her be left.  

<span id="027">27</span> Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the
slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their
visitation.  

<span id="028">28</span> The voice of them that flee and escape out of
the land of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), to declare in
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002) the vengeance of the LORD our God, the
vengeance of his [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004).  

<span id="029">29</span> Call together the archers against
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001): all ye that bend the
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003), [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) against it
round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her
work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath
been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="030">30</span> Therefore shall her young men fall in the
streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the
LORD.  

<span id="031">31</span> Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud,
saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will
visit thee.  

<span id="032">32</span> And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and
none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it
shall devour all round about him.  

<span id="033">33</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) were oppressed together: and all that
took them captives held them [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004); they refused
to let them go.  

<span id="034">34</span> Their [Redeemer](../ebd/ebd308.htm#008) is
strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall throughly plead their
cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants
of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001).  

<span id="035">35</span> A [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) is upon the
Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and upon her princes, and upon her
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) men.  

<span id="036">36</span> A [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) is upon the
liars; and they shall dote: a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) is upon her
mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.  

<span id="037">37</span> A [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) is upon their
horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that
are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) is upon her treasures; and they shall be
robbed.  

<span id="038">38</span> A [drought](../ebd/ebd108.htm#005) is upon her
waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images,
and they are mad upon their idols.  

<span id="039">39</span> Therefore the wild beasts of the
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000) with the wild beasts of the islands
shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no
more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) to
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008).  

<span id="040">40</span> As God overthrew [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004)
and [Gomorrah](../ebd/ebd152.htm#007) and the neighbour cities thereof,
saith the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of
man dwell therein.  

<span id="041">41</span> Behold, a people shall come from the north, and
a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the
earth.  

<span id="042">42</span> They shall hold the
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) and the lance: they are cruel, and will not
shew [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005): their voice shall roar like the
sea, and they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a man
to the battle, against thee, O daughter of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001).  

<span id="043">43</span> The [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) hath heard the report of them, and his
hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in
travail.  

<span id="044">44</span> Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the
[swelling](../ebd/ebd354.htm#001) of [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004)
unto the [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007) of the strong: but I will
make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) man, that I may appoint over her? for
who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006) that will stand before me?  

<span id="045">45</span> Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that
he hath taken against [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001); and his
purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans:
Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make
their [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007) desolate with them.  

<span id="046">46</span> At the noise of the taking of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) the earth is moved, and the cry is
heard among the nations.
