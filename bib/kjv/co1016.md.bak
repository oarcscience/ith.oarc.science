### King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> Now concerning the
[collection](../ebd/ebd086.htm#005.md) for the saints, as I have given
order to the churches of [Galatia](../ebd/ebd141.htm#004.md), even so do
ye.  

<span id="002">2</span> Upon the first day of the week let every one of
you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no
gatherings when I come.  

<span id="003">3</span> And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by
your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go
with me.  

<span id="005">5</span> Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass
through [Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003.md): for I do pass through
[Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter
with you, that ye may bring me on my [journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md)
whithersoever I go.  

<span id="007">7</span> For I will not see you now by the way; but I
trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.  

<span id="008">8</span> But I will tarry at
[Ephesus](../ebd/ebd122.htm#007.md) until
[Pentecost](../ebd/ebd289.htm#004.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> For a great door and effectual is opened unto
me, and there are many adversaries.  

<span id="010">10</span> Now if [Timotheus](../ebd/ebd367.htm#001.md) come,
see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the
Lord, as I also do.  

<span id="011">11</span> Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct
him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with
the brethren.  

<span id="012">12</span> As touching our brother
[Apollos](../ebd/ebd026.htm#006.md), I greatly desired him to come unto you
with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but
he will come when he shall have convenient time.  

<span id="013">13</span> Watch ye, stand [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md)
in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.  

<span id="014">14</span> Let all your things be done with
[charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of
[Stephanas](../ebd/ebd351.htm#001.md), that it is the firstfruits of
[Achaia](../ebd/ebd006.htm#004.md), and that they have addicted themselves
to the ministry of the saints,)  

<span id="016">16</span> That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to
every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth.  

<span id="017">17</span> I am glad of the coming of
[Stephanas](../ebd/ebd351.htm#001.md) and
[Fortunatus](../ebd/ebd137.htm#009.md) and Achaicus: for that which was
lacking on your part they have supplied.  

<span id="018">18</span> For they have refreshed my
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) and your's: therefore acknowledge ye
them that are such.  

<span id="019">19</span> The churches of [Asia](../ebd/ebd034.htm#008.md)
salute you. [Aquila](../ebd/ebd027.htm#006.md) and
[Priscilla](../ebd/ebd300.htm#005.md) salute you much in the Lord, with the
church that is in their house.  

<span id="020">20</span> All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one
another with an holy [kiss](../ebd/ebd221.htm#000.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> The [salutation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#002.md) of me
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) with mine own hand.  

<span id="022">22</span> If any man love not the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), let him
be [Anathema](../ebd/ebd023.htm#003.md)
[Maranatha](../ebd/ebd241.htm#005.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> The [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) be with
you.  

<span id="024">24</span> My love be with you all in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).
