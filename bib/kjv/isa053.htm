<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 53</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#005">stripes</A> we are healed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;All we like <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</A> to the slaughter, and as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> before her shearers is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</A>, so he openeth not his mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;He was taken from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A> and from judgment: and who shall declare his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And he made his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A> with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.<BR>
