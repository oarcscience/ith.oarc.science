### King James Version: Hosea Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> O [israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), return unto
the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.  

<span id="002">2</span> Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say
unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we
render the calves of our lips.  

<span id="003">3</span> [Asshur](../ebd/ebd035.htm#002) shall not save
us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the
work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005).  

<span id="004">4</span> I will heal their backsliding, I will love them
freely: for mine [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) is turned away from
him.  

<span id="005">5</span> I will be as the [dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008)
unto [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): he shall grow as the
[lily](../ebd/ebd229.htm#005), and cast forth his roots as
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001).  

<span id="006">6</span> His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall
be as the [olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009) tree, and his smell as
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001).  

<span id="007">7</span> They that dwell under his
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) shall return; they shall revive as the
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006), and grow as the
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004): the scent thereof shall be as the
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) of [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001).  

<span id="008">8</span> [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) shall say, What
have I to do any more with idols? I have heard him, and observed him: I
am like a green [fir](../ebd/ebd133.htm#005) tree. From me is thy
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) found.  

<span id="009">9</span> Who is [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), and he
shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the
ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the
transgressors shall fall therein.
