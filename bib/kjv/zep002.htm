</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#001">Ashkelon</A> shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A>.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#005">hiss</A>, and wag his hand.<BR>
