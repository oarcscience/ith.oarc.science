### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 92

<span id="001">1</span> IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD,
AND TO SING PRAISES UNTO THY NAME, O MOST HIGH:  

<span id="002">2</span> To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning,
and thy faithfulness every night,  

<span id="003">3</span> Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the
[psaltery](../ebd/ebd301.htm#006); upon the
[harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001) with a solemn sound.  

<span id="004">4</span> For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy
work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.  

<span id="005">5</span> O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy
thoughts are very [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008).  

<span id="006">6</span> A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool
understand this.  

<span id="007">7</span> When the wicked spring as the
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005), and when all the workers of iniquity do
flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:  

<span id="008">8</span> But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.  

<span id="009">9</span> For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine
enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.  

<span id="010">10</span> But my [horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003) shalt thou
exalt like the [horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003) of an
[unicorn](../ebd/ebd374.htm#007): I shall be anointed with fresh oil.  

<span id="011">11</span> Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine
enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up
against me.  

<span id="012">12</span> The righteous shall flourish like the palm
tree: he shall grow like a [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007) in
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001).  

<span id="013">13</span> Those that be planted in the house of the LORD
shall flourish in the courts of our God.  

<span id="014">14</span> They shall still bring forth
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) in old age; they shall be
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) and flourishing;  

<span id="015">15</span> To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001), and there is no unrighteousness in him.
