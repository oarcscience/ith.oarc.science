### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> If there arise among you a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md), or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth
thee a sign or a wonder,  

<span id="002">2</span> And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof
he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast
not known, and let us serve them;  

<span id="003">3</span> Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md), or that dreamer of dreams: for the
LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God
with all your heart and with all your soul.  

<span id="004">4</span> Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear
him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve
him, and cleave unto him.  

<span id="005">5</span> And that [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md), or
that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to
turn you away from the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land
of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and redeemed you out of the house of
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md), to thrust thee out of the way which
the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil
away from the midst of thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy
son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md),
or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying,
Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy
fathers;  

<span id="007">7</span> Namely, of the gods of the people which are
round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end
of the earth even unto the other end of the earth;  

<span id="008">8</span> Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken
unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare,
neither shalt thou conceal him:  

<span id="009">9</span> But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall
be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all
the people.  

<span id="010">10</span> And thou shalt [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md)
him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away
from the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), from the house of
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) shall
hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is
among you.  

<span id="012">12</span> If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities,
which the LORD thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying,  

<span id="013">13</span> Certain men, the children of
[Belial](../ebd/ebd051.htm#007.md), are gone out from among you, and have
withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve
other gods, which ye have not known;  

<span id="014">14</span> Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and
ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that
such [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md) is wrought among you;  

<span id="015">15</span> Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that
city with the edge of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), destroying it
utterly, and all that is therein, and the
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) thereof, with the edge of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into
the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and
all the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be
an [heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md) for ever; it shall not be built
again.  

<span id="017">17</span> And there shall cleave nought of the cursed
thing to thine hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md), and shew thee
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md), and have compassion upon thee, and
multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;  

<span id="018">18</span> When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the
LORD thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this
day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.
