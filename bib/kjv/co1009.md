### King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> Am I not an [apostle](../ebd/ebd026.htm#008.md)? am
I not free? have I not seen [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) our Lord? are not ye my work in the
Lord?  

<span id="002">2</span> If I be not an [apostle](../ebd/ebd026.htm#008.md)
unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the
[seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002.md) of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.  

<span id="003">3</span> Mine answer to them that do examine me is
this,  

<span id="004">4</span> Have we not power to eat and to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md)?  

<span id="005">5</span> Have we not power to lead about a sister, a
wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and
[Cephas](../ebd/ebd075.htm#005.md)?  

<span id="006">6</span> Or I only and [Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005.md),
have not we power to forbear working?  

<span id="007">7</span> Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges?
who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and
eateth not of the [milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000.md) of the flock?  

<span id="008">8</span> Say I these things as a man? or saith not the
law the same also?  

<span id="009">9</span> For it is written in the law of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Thou shalt not
[muzzle](../ebd/ebd263.htm#001.md) the mouth of the
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007.md) that treadeth out the
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md). Doth God take care for oxen?  

<span id="010">10</span> Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For
our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow
in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his
hope.  

<span id="011">11</span> If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is
it a great thing if we shall reap your [carnal](../ebd/ebd072.htm#008.md)
things?  

<span id="012">12</span> If others be partakers of this power over you,
are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer
all things, lest we should hinder the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> Do ye not know that they which
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) about holy things live of the things
of the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md)? and they which wait at the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) are partakers with the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md)?  

<span id="014">14</span> Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which
preach the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) should live of the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> But I have used none of these things: neither
have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it
were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying
void.  

<span id="016">16</span> For though I preach the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md), I have nothing to
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea,
woe is unto me, if I preach not the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md)!  

<span id="017">17</span> For if I do this thing willingly, I have a
reward: but if against my will, a [dispensation](../ebd/ebd104.htm#006.md)
of the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) is committed unto me.  

<span id="018">18</span> What is my reward then? Verily that, when I
preach the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md), I may make the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
without charge, that I abuse not my power in the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> For though I be free from all men, yet have I
made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.  

<span id="020">20</span> And unto the Jews I became as a
[Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004.md), that I might gain the Jews; to them that
are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are
under the law;  

<span id="021">21</span> To them that are without law, as without law,
(being not without law to God, but under the law to
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000),.md) that I might gain them that are
without law.  

<span id="022">22</span> To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain
the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means
save some.  

<span id="023">23</span> And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I
might be partaker thereof with you.  

<span id="024">24</span> Know ye not that they which run in a race run
all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.  

<span id="025">25</span> And every man that striveth for the mastery is
temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md); but we an incorruptible.  

<span id="026">26</span> I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so
fight I, not as one that beateth the air:  

<span id="027">27</span> But I keep under my body, and bring it into
subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I
myself should be a [castaway](../ebd/ebd073.htm#007.md).
