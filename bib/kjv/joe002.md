### King James Version: Joel Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> Blow ye the trumpet in
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), and sound an
[alarm](../ebd/ebd016.htm#007.md) in my holy mountain: let all the
inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD cometh, for it
is nigh at hand;  

<span id="002">2</span> A day of [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) and
of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), as the morning spread upon the
mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the
like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many
generations.  

<span id="003">3</span> A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a
flame burneth: the land is as the garden of
[Eden](../ebd/ebd112.htm#009.md) before them, and behind them a desolate
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md); yea, and nothing shall escape
them.  

<span id="004">4</span> The appearance of them is as the appearance of
horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run.  

<span id="005">5</span> Like the noise of chariots on the tops of
mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that
devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.  

<span id="006">6</span> Before their face the people shall be much
pained: all faces shall gather blackness.  

<span id="007">7</span> They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb
the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways,
and they shall not break their ranks:  

<span id="008">8</span> Neither shall one thrust another; they shall
walk every one in his path: and when they fall upon the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), they shall not be wounded.  

<span id="009">9</span> They shall run to and fro in the city; they
shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall
enter in at the windows like a thief.  

<span id="010">10</span> The earth shall quake before them; the heavens
shall tremble: the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) and the
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004.md) shall be dark, and the
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md) shall withdraw their shining:  

<span id="011">11</span> And the LORD shall utter his voice before his
army: for his [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md) is very great: for he is
strong that executeth his word: for the day of the LORD is great and
very terrible; and who can abide it?  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye
even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and
with mourning:  

<span id="013">13</span> And rend your heart, and not your garments, and
turn unto the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md), and of great kindness, and repenteth him
of the evil.  

<span id="014">14</span> Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and
leave a blessing behind him; even a meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) and a [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) unto the LORD your God?  

<span id="015">15</span> Blow the trumpet in
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), sanctify a [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md),
call a solemn assembly:  

<span id="016">16</span> Gather the people, sanctify the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), assemble the elders, gather the
children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth
of his [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md), and the
[bride](../ebd/ebd065.htm#001.md) out of her
[closet](../ebd/ebd085.htm#000.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD,
weep between the porch and the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), and let
them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine heritage to
reproach, that the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) should rule over
them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?  

<span id="018">18</span> Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and
pity his people.  

<span id="019">19</span> Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his
people, Behold, I will send you [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md), and
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), and oil, and ye shall be satisfied
therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md):  

<span id="020">20</span> But I will remove far off from you the northern
army, and will drive him into a land [barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007.md) and
desolate, with his face toward the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) sea,
and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come up,
and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great things.  

<span id="021">21</span> Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the
LORD will do great things.  

<span id="022">22</span> Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the
pastures of the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) do spring, for the
tree beareth her [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md), the
[fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001) tree and the [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md)
do yield their strength.  

<span id="023">23</span> Be glad then, ye children of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he
hath given you the former [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) moderately, and
he will cause to come down for you the [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md),
the former [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md), and the latter
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) in the first month.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the floors shall be full of
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md), and the vats shall overflow with
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) and oil.  

<span id="025">25</span> And I will restore to you the years that the
[locust](../ebd/ebd231.htm#000.md) hath eaten, the
[cankerworm](../ebd/ebd071.htm#004.md), and the caterpiller, and the
palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.  

<span id="026">26</span> And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied,
and praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously
with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.  

<span id="027">27</span> And ye shall know that I am in the midst of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and that I am the LORD your God, and
none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.  

<span id="028">28</span> And it shall come to pass afterward, that I
will pour out my [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) upon all
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md); and your sons and your daughters shall
prophesy, your old men shall [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md) dreams, your
young men shall see visions:  

<span id="029">29</span> And also upon the servants and upon the
handmaids in those days will I pour out my
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in
the earth, [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), and fire, and pillars of
smoke.  

<span id="031">31</span> The [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) shall be
turned into [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), and the
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004) into [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md),
before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.  

<span id="032">32</span> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall
call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md) and in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) shall be deliverance, as the LORD
hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call.
