### King James Version: Romans Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> Let every soul be subject unto the higher
powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are
ordained of God.  

<span id="002">2</span> Whosoever therefore resisteth the power,
resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to
themselves [damnation](../ebd/ebd096.htm#008.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> For rulers are not a terror to good works, but
to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is
good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:  

<span id="004">4</span> For he is the [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md)
of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid;
for he beareth not the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) in vain: for he is
the [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) of God, a revenger to execute
wrath upon him that doeth evil.  

<span id="005">5</span> Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for
wrath, but also for [conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006.md) sake.  

<span id="006">6</span> For for this cause pay ye
[tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006.md) also: for they are God's ministers,
attending continually upon this very thing.  

<span id="007">7</span> Render therefore to all their dues:
[tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006.md) to whom
[tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006) is due; [custom](../ebd/ebd094.htm#008.md)
to whom [custom](../ebd/ebd094.htm#008.md); fear to whom fear; honour to
whom honour.  

<span id="008">8</span> Owe no man any thing, but to love one another:
for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.  

<span id="009">9</span> For this, Thou shalt not commit
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009.md), Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not
steal, Thou shalt not bear false [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md), Thou
shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly
comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself.  

<span id="010">10</span> Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore
love is the fulfilling of the law.  

<span id="011">11</span> And that, knowing the time, that now it is high
time to awake out of sleep: for now is our
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) nearer than when we believed.  

<span id="012">12</span> The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let
us therefore cast off the works of [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md),
and let us put on the [armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006.md) of light.  

<span id="013">13</span> Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in
rioting and drunkenness, not in [chambering](../ebd/ebd076.htm#004.md) and
wantonness, not in strife and envying.  

<span id="014">14</span> But put ye on the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), and make
not provision for the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), to fulfil the
lusts thereof.
