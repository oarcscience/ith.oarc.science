### King James Version: Zechariah Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) that
talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of
his sleep.  

<span id="002">2</span> And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I
have looked, and behold a [candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md) all of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), with a [bowl](../ebd/ebd063.htm#006.md) upon
the top of it, and his [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) lamps thereon, and
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) pipes to the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) lamps, which are upon the top thereof:  

<span id="003">3</span> And two [olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009.md) trees by
it, one upon the right side of the [bowl](../ebd/ebd063.htm#006.md), and
the other upon the left side thereof.  

<span id="004">4</span> So I answered and spake to the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) that talked with me, saying, What are
these, my lord?  

<span id="005">5</span> Then the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) that
talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these
be? And I said, No, my lord.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This
is the word of the LORD unto [Zerubbabel](../ebd/ebd391.htm#008.md),
saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), saith the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="007">7</span> Who art thou, O great mountain? before
[Zerubbabel](../ebd/ebd391.htm#008.md) thou shalt become a
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md): and he shall bring forth the headstone
thereof with shoutings, crying, [Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md),
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) unto it.  

<span id="008">8</span> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="009">9</span> The hands of [Zerubbabel](../ebd/ebd391.htm#008.md)
have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it;
and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.  

<span id="010">10</span> For who hath despised the day of small things?
for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of
[Zerubbabel](../ebd/ebd391.htm#008.md) with those
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md); they are the eyes of the LORD, which run
to and fro through the whole earth.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then answered I, and said unto him, What are
these two [olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009.md) trees upon the right side of
the [candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md) and upon the left side
thereof?  

<span id="012">12</span> And I answered again, and said unto him, What
be these two [olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009.md) branches which through the
two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?  

<span id="013">13</span> And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not
what these be? And I said, No, my lord.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then said he, These are the two anointed ones,
that stand by the LORD of the whole earth.
