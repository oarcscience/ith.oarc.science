### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 43

<span id="001">1</span> And the [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md) was sore
in the land.  

<span id="002">2</span> And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md) which they had brought out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), their father said unto them, Go again,
buy us a little food.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) spake unto
him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not
see my face, except your brother be with you.  

<span id="004">4</span> If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will
go down and buy thee food:  

<span id="005">5</span> But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go
down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your
brother be with you.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) said,
Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet
a brother?  

<span id="007">7</span> And they said, The man asked us straitly of our
state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye
another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words:
could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) said unto
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) his father, Send the lad with me, and we
will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and
also our little ones.  

<span id="009">9</span> I will be [surety](../ebd/ebd353.htm#005.md) for
him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee,
and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:  

<span id="010">10</span> For except we had lingered, surely now we had
returned this second time.  

<span id="011">11</span> And their father
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) said unto them, If it must be so now, do
this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry
down the man a present, a little [balm](../ebd/ebd042.htm#009.md), and a
little [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001), [spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005.md),
and [myrrh](../ebd/ebd263.htm#003), [nuts](../ebd/ebd275.htm#007.md), and
almonds:  

<span id="012">12</span> And take double money in your hand; and the
money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again
in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:  

<span id="013">13</span> Take also your brother, and arise, go again
unto the man:  

<span id="014">14</span> And God Almighty give you
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) before the man, that he may send away
your other brother, and [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md). If I be
bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the men took that present, and they took
double money in their hand and [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md); and
rose up, and went down to [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and stood
before [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And when [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) saw
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md) with them, he said to the ruler of his
house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men
shall [dine](../ebd/ebd103.htm#009.md) with me at noon.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the man did as
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) bade; and the man brought the men into
Joseph's house.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the men were afraid, because they were
brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that
was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he
may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen,
and our asses.  

<span id="019">19</span> And they came near to the steward of Joseph's
house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,  

<span id="020">20</span> And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the
first time to buy food:  

<span id="021">21</span> And it came to pass, when we came to the
[inn](../ebd/ebd188.htm#004.md), that we opened our sacks, and, behold,
every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full
weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.  

<span id="022">22</span> And other money have we brought down in our
hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.  

<span id="023">23</span> And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your
God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks:
I had your money. And he brought [Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002.md) out
unto them.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the man brought the men into Joseph's
house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave
their asses provender.  

<span id="025">25</span> And they made ready the present against
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) came at noon: for they heard that they
should eat [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) there.  

<span id="026">26</span> And when [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) came
home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the
house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.  

<span id="027">27</span> And he asked them of their welfare, and said,
Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?  

<span id="028">28</span> And they answered, Thy servant our father is in
good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made
[obeisance](../ebd/ebd276.htm#006.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md), his mother's son, and said, Is this
your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be
gracious unto thee, my son.  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) made haste;
for his [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004.md) did yearn upon his brother: and
he sought where to weep; and he entered into his
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md), and wept there.  

<span id="031">31</span> And he washed his face, and went out, and
refrained himself, and said, Set on [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> And they set on for him by himself, and for
them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by
themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) with the
[Hebrews](../ebd/ebd171.htm#001.md); for that is an
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md) unto the Egyptians.  

<span id="033">33</span> And they sat before him, the firstborn
according to his [birthright](../ebd/ebd059.htm#004.md), and the youngest
according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.  

<span id="034">34</span> And he took and sent messes unto them from
before him: but Benjamin's [mess](../ebd/ebd251.htm#004.md) was five times
so much as any of their's. And they drank, and were merry with him.
