<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 24</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And after five days <A HREF="../ebd/ebd023.htm#001">Ananias</A> the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#006">Tertullus</A>, who informed the governor against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And when he was called forth, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#006">Tertullus</A> began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#004">providence</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;We accept it always, and in all places, most noble <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#001">Felix</A>, with all thankfulness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#008">sect</A> of the Nazarenes:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Who also hath gone about to profane the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> for to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And they neither found me in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call <A HREF="../ebd/ebd175.htm#002">heresy</A>, so <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</A> void to offence toward God, and toward men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Now after many years I came to bring <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</A> to my nation, and offerings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Whereupon certain Jews from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</A> found me purified in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#001">Felix</A> heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And he commanded a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</A> to keep <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A> or come unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And after certain days, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#001">Felix</A> came with his wife <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#008">Drusilla</A>, which was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#005">Jewess</A>, he sent for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>, and heard him concerning the faith in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And as he reasoned of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, temperance, and judgment to come, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#001">Felix</A> trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;He hoped also that money should have been given him of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#001">Felix</A>, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> bound.<BR>
