### King James Version: Judges Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> And an [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the
LORD came up from [Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001) to
[Bochim](../ebd/ebd061.htm#007), and said, I made you to go up out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and have brought you unto the land which
I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with you.  

<span id="002">2</span> And ye shall make no
[league](../ebd/ebd225.htm#005) with the inhabitants of this land; ye
shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have
ye done this?  

<span id="003">3</span> Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out
from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their
gods shall be a [snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009) unto you.  

<span id="004">4</span> And it came to pass, when the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the LORD spake these words unto all
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that the people lifted
up their voice, and wept.  

<span id="005">5</span> And they called the name of that place
[Bochim](../ebd/ebd061.htm#007): and they sacrificed there unto the
LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> And when [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) had let
the people go, the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) went
every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the people served the LORD all the days of
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006), and all the days of the elders that
outlived [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006), who had seen all the great
works of the LORD, that he did for [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) the son of
[Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006), the servant of the LORD, died, being an
hundred and ten years old.  

<span id="009">9</span> And they buried him in the border of his
inheritance in Timnathheres, in the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000), on the north side of the hill
[Gaash](../ebd/ebd140.htm#004).  

<span id="010">10</span> And also all that
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) were gathered unto their fathers:
and there arose another [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) after them,
which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="011">11</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) did evil in the sight of the LORD, and
served [Baalim](../ebd/ebd039.htm#007):  

<span id="012">12</span> And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers,
which brought them out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009),
and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about
them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002).  

<span id="013">13</span> And they forsook the LORD, and served
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004) and [Ashtaroth](../ebd/ebd034.htm#004).  

<span id="014">14</span> And the [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) of the
LORD was hot against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and he delivered
them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into
the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any
longer stand before their enemies.  

<span id="015">15</span> Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the
LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD
had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.  

<span id="016">16</span> Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which
delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.  

<span id="017">17</span> And yet they would not hearken unto their
judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves
unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked
in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.  

<span id="018">18</span> And when the LORD raised them up judges, then
the LORD was with the [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005), and delivered them
out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005): for it repented the LORD because of
their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.  

<span id="019">19</span> And it came to pass, when the
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) was dead, that they returned, and
corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to
serve them, and to [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) down unto them; they
ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) of the
LORD was hot against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and he said,
Because that this people hath transgressed my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) which I commanded their fathers, and
have not hearkened unto my voice;  

<span id="021">21</span> I also will not henceforth drive out any from
before them of the nations which [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) left
when he died:  

<span id="022">22</span> That through them I may prove
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), whether they will keep the way of the
LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.  

<span id="023">23</span> Therefore the LORD left those nations, without
driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006).
