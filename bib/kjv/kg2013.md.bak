### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> In the three and twentieth year of
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md) the son of
[Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) [Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006.md) the son
of [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md) began to reign over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md), and
reigned seventeen years.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of
the LORD, and followed the sins of [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) the
son of [Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003.md), which made
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md); he
departed not therefrom.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) of the
LORD was kindled against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and he
delivered them into the hand of [Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md), and
into the hand of Benhadad the son of [Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003.md),
all their days.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006.md) besought
the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him: for he saw the oppression of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), because the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md)
oppressed them.  

<span id="005">5</span> (And the LORD gave
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) a [saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003.md), so
that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) dwelt in their tents, as
beforetime.  

<span id="006">6</span> Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of
the house of [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md), who made
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), but walked
therein: and there remained the [grove](../ebd/ebd155.htm#008.md) also in
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004)..md)  

<span id="007">7</span> Neither did he leave of the people to
[Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006.md) but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots,
and ten thousand footmen; for the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md) had destroyed them, and had made them
like the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) by
[threshing](../ebd/ebd364.htm#009.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006.md), and all that he did, and his might,
are they not written in the book of the
[chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003.md) of the kings of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006.md) slept with
his fathers; and they buried him in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md):
and [Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md) his son reigned in his stead.  

<span id="010">10</span> In the thirty and seventh year of
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) began [Jehoash](../ebd/ebd200.htm#007.md)
the son of [Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006.md) to reign over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md), and
reigned sixteen years.  

<span id="011">11</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of
the LORD; he departed not from all the sins of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) the son of
[Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003), who made [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md): but he walked therein.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the rest of the acts of
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md), and all that he did, and his might
wherewith he fought against [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), are
they not written in the book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003.md)
of the kings of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md) slept with
his fathers; and [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) sat upon his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001): and [Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md) was
buried in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md) with the kings of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> Now [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) was fallen
sick of his sickness whereof he died. And [Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md)
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my
father, the [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and the horsemen thereof.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) said unto
him, Take [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) and
[arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005.md). And he took unto him
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) and [arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And he said to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), Put
thine hand upon the [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md). And he put his hand
upon it: and [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) put his hands upon the
king's hands.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he said, Open the window eastward. And he
opened it. Then [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) said, Shoot. And he
shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD's deliverance, and the arrow of
deliverance from [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md): for thou shalt smite
the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.  

<span id="018">18</span> And he said, Take the
[arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005.md). And he took them. And he said unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), Smite
upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the man of God was wroth with him, and
said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou
smitten [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md) till thou hadst consumed it:
whereas now thou shalt smite [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md) but
thrice.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) died, and
they buried him. And the [bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003.md) of the Moabites
invaded the land at the coming in of the year.  

<span id="021">21</span> And it came to pass, as they were burying a
man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into
the [sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md) of
[Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md): and when the man was let down, and
touched the bones of [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md), he revived, and
stood up on his feet.  

<span id="022">22</span> But [Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md)
oppressed [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) all the days of
[Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had
compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md),
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006), and [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and
would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.  

<span id="024">24</span> So [Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md) died;
and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Jehoash](../ebd/ebd200.htm#007.md) the son of
[Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006.md) took again out of the hand of Benhadad
the son of [Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003.md) the cities, which he had
taken out of the hand of [Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006.md) his father by
war. Three times did [Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md) beat him, and
recovered the cities of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).
