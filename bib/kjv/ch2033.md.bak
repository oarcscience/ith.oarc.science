### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 33

<span id="001">1</span> [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) was twelve
years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md):  

<span id="002">2</span> But did that which was evil in the sight of the
LORD, like unto the abominations of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), whom the LORD had cast out before the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> For he built again the high places which
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) his father had broken down, and he
reared up altars for [Baalim](../ebd/ebd039.htm#007.md), and made groves,
and worshipped all the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and served them.  

<span id="004">4</span> Also he built altars in the house of the LORD,
whereof the LORD had said, In [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) shall
my name be for ever.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he built altars for all the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) in the
two courts of the house of the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he caused his children to pass through the
fire in the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) of the son of
[Hinnom](../ebd/ebd179.htm#002.md): also he observed times, and used
[enchantments](../ebd/ebd120.htm#004.md), and used
[witchcraft](../ebd/ebd382.htm#007.md), and dealt with a familiar
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), and with wizards: he wrought much evil
in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And he set a carved image, the
[idol](../ebd/ebd186.htm#006.md) which he had made, in the house of God, of
which God had said to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) and to
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) his son, In this house, and in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), which I have
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) before all the tribes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), will I put my name for ever:  

<span id="008">8</span> Neither will I any more remove the foot of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) from out of the land which I have
appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I
have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the
ordinances by the hand of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> So [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) made
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) to err, and to do worse than the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), whom the LORD had destroyed before the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And the LORD spake to
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md), and to his people: but they would not
hearken.  

<span id="011">11</span> Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the
captains of the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md), which
took [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) among the thorns, and bound him
with fetters, and carried him to [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And when he was in affliction, he besought the
LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his
fathers,  

<span id="013">13</span> And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of
him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) into his kingdom. Then
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) knew that the LORD he was God.  

<span id="014">14</span> Now after this he built a wall without the city
of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), on the west side of
[Gihon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#007), in the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md),
even to the entering in at the [fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005.md)
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md), and compassed about
[Ophel](../ebd/ebd279.htm#006.md), and raised it up a very great height,
and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And he took away the strange gods, and the
[idol](../ebd/ebd186.htm#006.md) out of the house of the LORD, and all the
altars that he had built in the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) of the
house of the LORD, and in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and cast
them out of the city.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he repaired the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace
offerings and thank offerings, and commanded
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) to serve the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Nevertheless the people did
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) still in the high places, yet unto
the LORD their God only.  

<span id="018">18</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md), and his
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) unto his God, and the words of the seers
that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), behold, they are written in the book of
the kings of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> His [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) also, and
how God was intreated of him, and all his sins, and his trespass, and
the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven
images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the
sayings of the seers.  

<span id="020">20</span> So [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) slept with
his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and
[Amon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#005.md) his son reigned in his stead.  

<span id="021">21</span> [Amon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#005.md) was two and
twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> But he did that which was evil in the sight of
the LORD, as did [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) his father: for
[Amon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#005.md) sacrificed unto all the carved images
which [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) his father had made, and served
them;  

<span id="023">23</span> And humbled not himself before the LORD, as
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) his father had humbled himself; but
[Amon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#005.md) trespassed more and more.  

<span id="024">24</span> And his servants conspired against him, and
slew him in his own house.  

<span id="025">25</span> But the people of the land slew all them that
had conspired against [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Amon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#005.md); and the people of the land made
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) his son [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) in
his stead.
