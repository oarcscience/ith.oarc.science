### King James Version: Judges Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass in those days, when there
was no [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
that there was a certain [Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009.md) sojourning on
the side of [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), who took to him a
[concubine](../ebd/ebd087.htm#007.md) out of Bethlehemjudah.  

<span id="002">2</span> And his [concubine](../ebd/ebd087.htm#007.md)
played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father's
house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months.  

<span id="003">3</span> And her husband arose, and went after her, to
speak friendly unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with
him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house:
and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.  

<span id="004">4</span> And his father in law, the damsel's father,
retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), and lodged there.  

<span id="005">5</span> And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they
arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's
father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), and afterward go your way.  

<span id="006">6</span> And they sat down, and did eat and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) both of them together: for the damsel's
father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all
night, and let thine heart be merry.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when the man rose up to depart, his father
in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he arose early in the morning on the fifth
day to depart; and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray
thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.  

<span id="009">9</span> And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his
[concubine](../ebd/ebd087.htm#007.md), and his servant, his father in law,
the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward
evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end,
[lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002.md) here, that thine heart may be merry; and
to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.  

<span id="010">10</span> But the man would not tarry that night, but he
rose up and departed, and came over against
[Jebus](../ebd/ebd199.htm#003.md), which is
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md); and there were with him two asses
saddled, his [concubine](../ebd/ebd087.htm#007.md) also was with him.  

<span id="011">11</span> And when they were by
[Jebus](../ebd/ebd199.htm#003.md), the day was far spent; and the servant
said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this
city of the [Jebusites](../ebd/ebd199.htm#004.md), and
[lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002.md) in it.  

<span id="012">12</span> And his master said unto him, We will not turn
aside hither into the city of a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md), that
is not of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); we will pass
over to [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us
draw near to one of these places to [lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002.md) all
night, in [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008.md), or in
[Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And they passed on and went their way; and the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) went down upon them when they were by
[Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008.md), which belongeth to
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And they turned aside thither, to go in and to
[lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002) in [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008.md): and
when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there was
no man that took them into his house to lodging.  

<span id="016">16</span> And, behold, there came an old man from his
work out of the field at even, which was also of
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md); and he
sojourned in [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008.md): but the men of the place
were Benjamites.  

<span id="017">17</span> And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a
wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither
goest thou? and whence comest thou?  

<span id="018">18</span> And he said unto him, We are passing from
Bethlehemjudah toward the side of [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md); from thence am I: and I went to
Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there
is no man that receiveth me to house.  

<span id="019">19</span> Yet there is both
[straw](../ebd/ebd352.htm#000.md) and provender for our asses; and there is
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) and [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) also
for me, and for thy [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md), and for the young
man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the old man said, Peace be with thee;
howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only
[lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002.md) not in the street.  

<span id="021">21</span> So he brought him into his house, and gave
provender unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> Now as they were making their hearts merry,
behold, the men of the city, certain sons of
[Belial](../ebd/ebd051.htm#007.md), beset the house round about, and beat
at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying,
Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the man, the master of the house, went out
unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not
so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this
folly.  

<span id="024">24</span> Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his
[concubine](../ebd/ebd087.htm#007.md); them I will bring out now, and
humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto
this man do not so vile a thing.  

<span id="025">25</span> But the men would not hearken to him: so the
man took his [concubine](../ebd/ebd087.htm#007.md), and brought her forth
unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the
morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.  

<span id="026">26</span> Then came the woman in the dawning of the day,
and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it
was light.  

<span id="027">27</span> And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened
the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) of the house, and went out to go his
way: and, behold, the woman his [concubine](../ebd/ebd087.htm#007.md) was
fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the
[threshold](../ebd/ebd365.htm#000.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going.
But none answered. Then the man took her up upon an
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md), and the man rose up, and gat him unto his
place.  

<span id="029">29</span> And when he was come into his house, he took a
[knife](../ebd/ebd221.htm#007.md), and laid hold on his
[concubine](../ebd/ebd087.htm#007.md), and divided her, together with her
bones, into twelve [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md), and sent her into
all the coasts of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> And it was so, that all that saw it said, There
was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) came up out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) unto this day: consider of it, take
advice, and speak your minds.
