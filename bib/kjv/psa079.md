### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 79

<span id="001">1</span> O God, the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005) are
come into thine inheritance; thy holy [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004)
have they defiled; they have laid [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) on
heaps.  

<span id="002">2</span> The dead bodies of thy servants have they given
to be meat unto the fowls of the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) of thy saints unto the beasts of the
earth.  

<span id="003">3</span> Their [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) have they
shed like water round about [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005); and
there was none to bury them.  

<span id="004">4</span> We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a
scorn and derision to them that are round about us.  

<span id="005">5</span> How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever?
shall thy [jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008) burn like fire?  

<span id="006">6</span> Pour out thy wrath upon the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005) that have not known thee, and upon the
kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.  

<span id="007">7</span> For they have devoured
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), and laid waste his dwelling place.  

<span id="008">8</span> O remember not against us former iniquities: let
thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.  

<span id="009">9</span> Help us, O God of our
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003), for the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of thy name: and deliver us, and purge
away our sins, for thy name's sake.  

<span id="010">10</span> Wherefore should the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005) say, Where is their God? let him be
known among the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005) in our sight by the
revenging of the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of thy servants which is
shed.  

<span id="011">11</span> Let the sighing of the prisoner come before
thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that
are appointed to die;  

<span id="012">12</span> And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into
their [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008) their reproach, wherewith they have
reproached thee, O Lord.  

<span id="013">13</span> So we thy people and
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) of thy pasture will give thee thanks for
ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.
