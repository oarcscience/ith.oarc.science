### King James Version: Nahum Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> The [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) of
[Nineveh](../ebd/ebd273.htm#006). The book of the
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000) of [Nahum](../ebd/ebd265.htm#008) the
Elkoshite.  

<span id="002">2</span> God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD
revengeth, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his
adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.  

<span id="003">3</span> The LORD is slow to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), and great in power, and will not at all
acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the
storm, and the clouds are the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) of his
feet.  

<span id="004">4</span> He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and
drieth up all the rivers: [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003) languisheth,
and [Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006), and the flower of
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001) languisheth.  

<span id="005">5</span> The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt,
and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that
dwell therein.  

<span id="006">6</span> Who can stand before his indignation? and who
can abide in the fierceness of his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002)? his
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) is poured out like fire, and the rocks are
thrown down by him.  

<span id="007">7</span> The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of
trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.  

<span id="008">8</span> But with an overrunning
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000) he will make an utter end of the place
thereof, and [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) shall pursue his
enemies.  

<span id="009">9</span> What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will
make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.  

<span id="010">10</span> For while they be folden together as thorns,
and while they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as
stubble fully dry.  

<span id="011">11</span> There is one come out of thee, that imagineth
evil against the LORD, a wicked [counsellor](../ebd/ebd091.htm#005).  

<span id="012">12</span> Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and
likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass
through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.  

<span id="013">13</span> For now will I break his
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in
sunder.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the LORD hath given a commandment
concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of
thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will
make thy [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008); for thou art vile.  

<span id="015">15</span> Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that
bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! O
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy
[vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001): for the wicked shall no more pass through
thee; he is utterly cut off.
