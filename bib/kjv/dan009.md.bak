### King James Version: Daniel Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> In the first year of
[Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007.md) the son of
[Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md), of the seed of the Medes, which was
made [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over the realm of the Chaldeans;  

<span id="002">2</span> In the first year of his reign I
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) understood by books the number of the
years, whereof the word of the LORD came to
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md),
that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) and supplications, with fasting, and
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001.md), and
[ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000.md):  

<span id="004">4</span> And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my
[confession](../ebd/ebd088.htm#003.md), and said, O Lord, the great and
dreadful God, keeping the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) and
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) to them that love him, and to them that
keep his commandments;  

<span id="005">5</span> We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and
have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy
precepts and from thy judgments:  

<span id="006">6</span> Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the
prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our
fathers, and to all the people of the land.  

<span id="007">7</span> O LORD, [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md)
belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to
the men of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and to the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and unto all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), that are near, and that are far off,
through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of
their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to
our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned
against thee.  

<span id="009">9</span> To the Lord our God belong mercies and
forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;  

<span id="010">10</span> Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD
our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the
prophets.  

<span id="011">11</span> Yea, all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) have
transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy
voice; therefore the [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) is poured upon us,
and the [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md) that is written in the law of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) the servant of God, because we have
sinned against him.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake
against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a
great evil: for under the whole [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) hath not
been done as hath been done upon [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> As it is written in the law of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), all this evil is come upon us: yet made
we not our [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) before the LORD our God, that
we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.  

<span id="014">14</span> Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil,
and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his
works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice.  

<span id="015">15</span> And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy
people forth out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) with a
mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have
sinned, we have done wickedly.  

<span id="016">16</span> O LORD, according to all thy
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), I beseech thee, let thine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) and thy [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md) be
turned away from thy city [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), thy holy
mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers,
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) and thy people are become a reproach
to all that are about us.  

<span id="017">17</span> Now therefore, O our God, hear the
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) of thy servant, and his supplications,
and cause thy face to shine upon thy [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md)
that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.  

<span id="018">18</span> O my God, incline thine
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md), and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our
desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not
present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for
thy great mercies.  

<span id="019">19</span> O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken
and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy
people are called by thy name.  

<span id="020">20</span> And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and
confessing my [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) and the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) of my people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and presenting my supplication before
the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;  

<span id="021">21</span> Yea, whiles I was speaking in
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md), even the man
[Gabriel](../ebd/ebd140.htm#006.md), whom I had seen in the
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md) at the beginning, being caused to
[fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004.md) swiftly, touched me about the time of the
evening oblation.  

<span id="022">22</span> And he informed me, and talked with me, and
said, O [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md), I am now come forth to give
thee skill and understanding.  

<span id="023">23</span> At the beginning of thy supplications the
commandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly
beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people
and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end
of sins, and to make [reconciliation](../ebd/ebd308.htm#004.md) for
iniquity, and to bring in [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md)
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), and to
[seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002) up the [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md) and
[prophecy](../ebd/ebd300.htm#007.md), and to
[anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008.md) the most Holy.  

<span id="025">25</span> Know therefore and understand, that from the
going forth of the commandment to restore and to build
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) unto the
[Messiah](../ebd/ebd251.htm#006) the [Prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md)
shall be [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) weeks, and threescore and two
weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous
times.  

<span id="026">26</span> And after threescore and two weeks shall
[Messiah](../ebd/ebd251.htm#006.md) be cut off, but not for himself: and
the people of the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) that shall come shall
destroy the city and the [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md); and the end
thereof shall be with a [flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000.md), and unto the end
of the war desolations are determined.  

<span id="027">27</span> And he shall confirm the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with many for one week: and in the
midst of the week he shall cause the [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md)
and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he
shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined
shall be poured upon the desolate.
