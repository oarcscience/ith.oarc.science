<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 11</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A> saith of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</A>? how he maketh intercession to God against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And if by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A>, then is it no more of works: otherwise <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> is no more <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A>. But if it be of works, then it is no more <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A>: otherwise work is no more work.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;What then? <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;(According as it is written, God hath given them the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> saith, Let their table be made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</A>, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> down their back alway.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> is come unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, for to provoke them to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>; how much more their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For I speak to you <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, inasmuch as I am the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd026.htm#008">apostle</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, I magnify mine office:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, and might save some of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</A> tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</A> tree;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Behold therefore the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A> and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A>, if thou continue in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A>: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;For if thou wert cut out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</A> tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</A> tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</A> tree?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#006">mystery</A>, lest ye should be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, until the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> be come in.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And so all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#003">Sion</A> the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For this is my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> unto them, when I shall take away their sins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;As concerning the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A>, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;For the gifts and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">calling</A> of God are without <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> through their unbelief:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Even so have these also now not believed, that through your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> they also may obtain <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> upon all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!  how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#005">counsellor</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> for ever. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</A>.<BR>
