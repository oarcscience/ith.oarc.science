### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> In the second year of
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000) son of [Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) reigned
[Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007.md) the son of
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> He was twenty and five years old when he began
to reign, and reigned twenty and nine years in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md). And his mother's name was
[Jehoaddan](../ebd/ebd200.htm#005.md) of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And he did that which was right in the sight of
the LORD, yet not like [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) his father: he did
according to all things as [Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md) his father
did.  

<span id="004">4</span> Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as
yet the people did [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) and burnt
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) on the high places.  

<span id="005">5</span> And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was
confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) his father.  

<span id="006">6</span> But the children of the murderers he slew not:
according unto that which is written in the book of the law of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), wherein the LORD commanded, saying, The
fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be
put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for
his own [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> He slew of [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md) in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008.md) ten
thousand, and took [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md) by war, and called the
name of it [Joktheel](../ebd/ebd210.htm#005.md) unto this day.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007.md) sent
messengers to [Jehoash](../ebd/ebd200.htm#007.md), the son of
[Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006) son of [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md),
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Jehoash](../ebd/ebd200.htm#007.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) sent to
[Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), saying, The
[thistle](../ebd/ebd364.htm#004.md) that was in
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md) sent to the
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md) that was in
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md), saying, Give thy daughter to my son to
wife: and there passed by a wild [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) that was
in [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md), and trode down the
[thistle](../ebd/ebd364.htm#004.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> Thou hast indeed smitten
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md), and thine heart hath lifted thee up:
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of this, and tarry at home: for why
shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou,
and [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) with thee?  

<span id="011">11</span> But [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007.md) would not
hear. Therefore [Jehoash](../ebd/ebd200.htm#007.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) went
up; and he and [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) looked
one another in the face at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) was put to
the worse before [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); and they fled every
man to their tents.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Jehoash](../ebd/ebd200.htm#007.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) took
[Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), the son of
[Jehoash](../ebd/ebd200.htm#007.md) the son of
[Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006.md), at Bethshemesh, and came to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and brake down the wall of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) from the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) unto
the corner [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md), four hundred cubits.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he took all the
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) and [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and
all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD, and in the
treasures of the king's house, and hostages, and returned to
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Jehoash](../ebd/ebd200.htm#007.md) which he did, and his might, and how he
fought with [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), are
they not written in the book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003.md)
of the kings of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Jehoash](../ebd/ebd200.htm#007.md) slept with
his fathers, and was buried in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md) with the
kings of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); and
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) his son reigned in his stead.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007.md) the son of
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) lived after the death of
[Jehoash](../ebd/ebd200.htm#007.md) son of
[Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) fifteen years.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the rest of the acts of
[Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007.md), are they not written in the book of
the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003.md) of the kings of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)?  

<span id="019">19</span> Now they made a conspiracy against him in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): and he fled to
[Lachish](../ebd/ebd222.htm#009.md); but they sent after him to
[Lachish](../ebd/ebd222.htm#009.md), and slew him there.  

<span id="020">20</span> And they brought him on horses: and he was
buried at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) with his fathers in the
city of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And all the people of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) took [Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005.md),
which was sixteen years old, and made him [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
instead of his father [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> He built [Elath](../ebd/ebd114.htm#005.md), and
restored it to [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), after that the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) slept with his fathers.  

<span id="023">23</span> In the fifteenth year of
[Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007.md) the son of
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) the son
of [Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) began to reign in
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md), and reigned forty and one years.  

<span id="024">24</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of
the LORD: he departed not from all the sins of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) the son of
[Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003), who made [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> He restored the coast of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) from the entering of
[Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005.md) unto the sea of the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md), according to the word of the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), which he spake by the hand of his
servant [Jonah](../ebd/ebd210.htm#007.md), the son of
[Amittai](../ebd/ebd020.htm#003), the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md),
which was of Gathhepher.  

<span id="026">26</span> For the LORD saw the affliction of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), that it was very
[bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009.md): for there was not any shut up, nor any
left, nor any helper for [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And the LORD said not that he would
[blot](../ebd/ebd061.htm#002.md) out the name of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) from under
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md): but he saved them by the hand of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) the son of
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md), and all that he did, and his might,
how he warred, and how he recovered [Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md),
and [Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005.md), which belonged to
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), for [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), are
they not written in the book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003.md)
of the kings of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) slept
with his fathers, even with the kings of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and [Zachariah](../ebd/ebd386.htm#005.md)
his son reigned in his stead.
