### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) in the
land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> This month shall be unto you the beginning of
months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.  

<span id="003">3</span> Speak ye unto all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saying, In the tenth day of this month
they shall take to them every man a [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003),
according to the house of their fathers, a [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003)
for an house:  

<span id="004">4</span> And if the household be too little for the
[lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003), let him and his neighbour next unto his
house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according
to his [eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006) shall make your count for the
[lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003).  

<span id="005">5</span> Your [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003) shall be
without [blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007), a male of the first year: ye
shall take it out from the [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), or from the
goats:  

<span id="006">6</span> And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day
of the same month: and the whole assembly of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
shall kill it in the evening.  

<span id="007">7</span> And they shall take of the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and strike it on the two side posts and
on the upper door [post](../ebd/ebd299.htm#001) of the houses, wherein
they shall eat it.  

<span id="008">8</span> And they shall eat the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) in that night, roast with fire, and
unleavened [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006); and with
[bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009) herbs they shall eat it.  

<span id="009">9</span> Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water,
but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance
thereof.  

<span id="010">10</span> And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the
morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn
with fire.  

<span id="011">11</span> And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins
girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye
shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD's
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005).  

<span id="012">12</span> For I will pass through the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) this night, and will smite all the
firstborn in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), both man and
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001); and against all the gods of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) shall be
to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), I will pass over you, and the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) shall not be upon you to destroy you,
when I smite the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="014">14</span> And this day shall be unto you for a memorial;
and ye shall keep it a [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) to the LORD
throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) by an ordinance for ever.  

<span id="015">15</span> [Seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days shall ye
eat unleavened [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006); even the first day ye
shall put away [leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000) out of your houses: for
whosoever eateth leavened [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) from the first
day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="016">16</span> And in the first day there shall be an holy
[convocation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#003), and in the seventh day there shall
be an holy [convocation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#003) to you; no manner of
work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that
only may be done of you.  

<span id="017">17</span> And ye shall observe the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006); for in this selfsame day have I brought
your armies out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009): therefore
shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for
ever.  

<span id="018">18</span> In the first month, on the fourteenth day of
the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), until the one and twentieth day of the
month at even.  

<span id="019">19</span> [Seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days shall there
be no [leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000) found in your houses: for
whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off
from the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), whether he be a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), or born in the land.  

<span id="020">20</span> Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your
habitations shall ye eat unleavened [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006).  

<span id="021">21</span> Then [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) called for
all the elders of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and said unto them,
Draw out and take you a [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003) according to your
families, and kill the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005).  

<span id="022">22</span> And ye shall take a
[bunch](../ebd/ebd066.htm#006) of [hyssop](../ebd/ebd185.htm#007), and
dip it in the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) that is in the bason, and
strike the [lintel](../ebd/ebd230.htm#000) and the two side posts with
the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) that is in the bason; and none of you
shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.  

<span id="023">23</span> For the LORD will pass through to smite the
Egyptians; and when he seeth the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) upon the
[lintel](../ebd/ebd230.htm#000), and on the two side posts, the LORD
will pass over the door, and will not suffer the
[destroyer](../ebd/ebd102.htm#003) to come in unto your houses to smite
you.  

<span id="024">24</span> And ye shall observe this thing for an
ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.  

<span id="025">25</span> And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to
the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised,
that ye shall keep this service.  

<span id="026">26</span> And it shall come to pass, when your children
shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?  

<span id="027">27</span> That ye shall say, It is the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of the LORD's
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005), who passed over the houses of the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), when he smote the Egyptians, and
delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.  

<span id="028">28</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) went away, and did as the LORD had
commanded [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), so did they.  

<span id="029">29</span> And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD
smote all the firstborn in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009),
from the firstborn of [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) that sat on his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) unto the firstborn of the
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) that was in the
[dungeon](../ebd/ebd109.htm#006); and all the firstborn of
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002).  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) rose up in
the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there
was a great cry in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009); for there was not a
house where there was not one dead.  

<span id="031">31</span> And he called for
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) by
night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both
ye and the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and go, serve
the LORD, as ye have said.  

<span id="032">32</span> Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye
have said, and be gone; and [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) me also.  

<span id="033">33</span> And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people,
that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be
all dead men.  

<span id="034">34</span> And the people took their
[dough](../ebd/ebd106.htm#006) before it was leavened, their
kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.  

<span id="035">35</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) did according to the word of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003); and they borrowed of the Egyptians
jewels of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and jewels of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and raiment:  

<span id="036">36</span> And the LORD gave the people favour in the
sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they
required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.  

<span id="037">37</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) journeyed from
[Rameses](../ebd/ebd307.htm#001) to [Succoth](../ebd/ebd352.htm#008),
about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.  

<span id="038">38</span> And a mixed multitude went up also with them;
and flocks, and herds, even very much [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002).  

<span id="039">39</span> And they baked unleavened cakes of the
[dough](../ebd/ebd106.htm#006) which they brought forth out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), for it was not leavened; because they
were thrust out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and could not tarry,
neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.  

<span id="040">40</span> Now the sojourning of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), who dwelt in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), was four hundred and thirty years.  

<span id="041">41</span> And it came to pass at the end of the four
hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that
all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="042">42</span> It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD
for bringing them out from the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009):
this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in their generations.  

<span id="043">43</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), This
is the ordinance of the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005): There shall
no [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) eat thereof:  

<span id="044">44</span> But every man's servant that is bought for
money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.  

<span id="045">45</span> A [foreigner](../ebd/ebd137.htm#003) and an
hired servant shall not eat thereof.  

<span id="046">46</span> In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not
carry forth ought of the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) abroad out of
the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.  

<span id="047">47</span> All the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004)
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall keep it.  

<span id="048">48</span> And when a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009)
shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005) to the LORD, let all his males be
circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as
one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat
thereof.  

<span id="049">49</span> One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and
unto the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) that sojourneth among you.  

<span id="050">50</span> Thus did all the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); as the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), so
did they.  

<span id="051">51</span> And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the
LORD did bring the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) out of
the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) by their armies.
