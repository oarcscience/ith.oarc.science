### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> For the LORD will have
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) on [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and
will yet choose [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and set them in their
own land: and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall
cleave to the house of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the people shall take them, and bring them
to their place: and the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) shall
possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and handmaids: and
they shall take them captives, whose captives they were; and they shall
rule over their oppressors.  

<span id="003">3</span> And it shall come to pass in the day that the
LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from
the hard [bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md) wherein thou wast made to
serve,  

<span id="004">4</span> That thou shalt take up this
[proverb](../ebd/ebd301.htm#002.md) against the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), and
say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!  

<span id="005">5</span> The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked,
and the [sceptre](../ebd/ebd323.htm#006.md) of the rulers.  

<span id="006">6</span> He who smote the people in wrath with a
continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md), is persecuted, and none hindereth.  

<span id="007">7</span> The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they
break forth into singing.  

<span id="008">8</span> Yea, the [fir](../ebd/ebd133.htm#005.md) trees
rejoice at thee, and the cedars of [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md),
saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.  

<span id="009">9</span> [Hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md) from beneath is
moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for
thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their
thrones all the kings of the nations.  

<span id="010">10</span> All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art
thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?  

<span id="011">11</span> Thy pomp is brought down to the
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md), and the noise of thy viols: the
[worm](../ebd/ebd384.htm#000.md) is spread under thee, and the worms cover
thee.  

<span id="012">12</span> How art thou fallen from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), O [Lucifer](../ebd/ebd232.htm#006.md), son
of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken
the nations!  

<span id="013">13</span> For thou hast said in thine heart, I will
ascend into [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), I will exalt my
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) above the [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md)
of God: I will sit also upon the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), in the sides of the north:  

<span id="014">14</span> I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;
I will be like the most High.  

<span id="015">15</span> Yet thou shalt be brought down to
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md), to the sides of the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> They that see thee shall narrowly look upon
thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to
tremble, that did shake kingdoms;  

<span id="017">17</span> That made the world as a
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), and destroyed the cities thereof;
that opened not the house of his prisoners?  

<span id="018">18</span> All the kings of the nations, even all of them,
lie in [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), every one in his own house.  

<span id="019">19</span> But thou art cast out of thy
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md) like an abominable
[branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002.md), and as the raiment of those that are
slain, thrust through with a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), that go
down to the stones of the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md); as a
[carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md) trodden under feet.  

<span id="020">20</span> Thou shalt not be joined with them in
[burial](../ebd/ebd066.htm#008.md), because thou hast destroyed thy land,
and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.  

<span id="021">21</span> Prepare slaughter for his children for the
iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land,
nor fill the face of the world with cities.  

<span id="022">22</span> For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD
of hosts, and cut off from [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md) the name,
and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD.  

<span id="023">23</span> I will also make it a possession for the
[bittern](../ebd/ebd060.htm#000.md), and pools of water: and I will sweep
it with the [besom](../ebd/ebd053.htm#009.md) of
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md), saith the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="024">24</span> The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as
I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so
shall it stand:  

<span id="025">25</span> That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and
upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md) depart from off them, and his
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md) depart from off their shoulders.  

<span id="026">26</span> This is the purpose that is purposed upon the
whole earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the
nations.  

<span id="027">27</span> For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who
shall disannul it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it
back?  

<span id="028">28</span> In the year that [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005.md) died was this
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the
rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root
shall come forth a [cockatrice](../ebd/ebd085.htm#007.md), and his
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) shall be a fiery flying
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> And the firstborn of the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) shall feed, and the needy shall lie down
in safety: and I will kill thy root with
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md), and he shall slay thy remnant.  

<span id="031">31</span> Howl, O [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md); cry, O
city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved: for there shall come from
the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his appointed times.  

<span id="032">32</span> What shall one then answer the messengers of
the nation? That the LORD hath founded [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md),
and the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) of his people shall trust in it.
