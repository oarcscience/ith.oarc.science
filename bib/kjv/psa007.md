### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save
me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:  

<span id="002">2</span> Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md), while there is none to deliver.  

<span id="003">3</span> O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be
iniquity in my hands;  

<span id="004">4</span> If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at
peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine
enemy:)  

<span id="005">5</span> Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it;
yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in
the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008). [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Arise, O LORD, in thine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md), lift up thyself because of the rage of
mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast
commanded.  

<span id="007">7</span> So shall the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the people compass thee about:
for their sakes therefore return thou on high.  

<span id="008">8</span> The LORD shall [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md)
the people: [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) me, O LORD, according to my
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), and according to mine integrity
that is in me.  

<span id="009">9</span> Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an
end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and
[reins](../ebd/ebd310.htm#001.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> My defence is of God, which saveth the upright
in heart.  

<span id="011">11</span> God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry
with the wicked every day.  

<span id="012">12</span> If he turn not, he will whet his
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md); he hath bent his
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md), and made it ready.  

<span id="013">13</span> He hath also prepared for him the instruments
of death; he ordaineth his [arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005.md) against the
persecutors.  

<span id="014">14</span> Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath
conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.  

<span id="015">15</span> He made a [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md), and
digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.  

<span id="016">16</span> His mischief shall return upon his own head,
and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.  

<span id="017">17</span> I will praise the LORD according to his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md): and will sing praise to the name
of the LORD most high.
