### King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> Then the word of the LORD came to
[Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007) the son of [Hanani](../ebd/ebd162.htm#003.md)
against [Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md), and made thee
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) over my people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); and thou hast walked in the way of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md), and hast made my people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), to
provoke me to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) with their sins;  

<span id="003">3</span> Behold, I will take away the posterity of
[Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md), and the posterity of his house; and
will make thy house like the house of [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md)
the son of [Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Him that dieth of
[Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md) in the city shall the dogs eat; and him
that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.  

<span id="005">5</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md), and what he did, and his might, are
they not written in the book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003.md)
of the kings of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="006">6</span> So [Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md) slept with
his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and [Elah](../ebd/ebd114.htm#002.md)
his son reigned in his stead.  

<span id="007">7</span> And also by the hand of the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md) the son
of [Hanani](../ebd/ebd162.htm#003.md) came the word of the LORD against
[Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md), and against his house, even for all the
evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) with the work of his hands, in being like
the house of [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md); and because he killed
him.  

<span id="008">8</span> In the twenty and sixth year of
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) began [Elah](../ebd/ebd114.htm#002.md) the
son of [Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md) to reign over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) in Tirzah, two years.  

<span id="009">9</span> And his servant [Zimri](../ebd/ebd393.htm#009.md),
captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in
Tirzah, drinking himself [drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007.md) in the house of
Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Zimri](../ebd/ebd393.htm#009.md) went in and
smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and reigned in his stead.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as
soon as he sat on his [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), that he slew all
the house of [Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md): he left him not one that
pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.  

<span id="012">12</span> Thus did [Zimri](../ebd/ebd393.htm#009.md) destroy
all the house of [Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md), according to the word
of the LORD, which he spake against [Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md) by
[Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> For all the sins of
[Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md), and the sins of
[Elah](../ebd/ebd114.htm#002.md) his son, by which they sinned, and by
which they made [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) to
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), in provoking the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) with
their vanities.  

<span id="014">14</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Elah](../ebd/ebd114.htm#002.md), and all that he did, are they not written
in the book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003.md) of the kings of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="015">15</span> In the twenty and seventh year of
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) did [Zimri](../ebd/ebd393.htm#009.md) reign
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days in Tirzah. And the people were
encamped against [Gibbethon](../ebd/ebd147.htm#007.md), which belonged to
the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And the people that were encamped heard say,
[Zimri](../ebd/ebd393.htm#009.md) hath conspired, and hath also slain the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md): wherefore all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) made [Omri](../ebd/ebd278.htm#006.md), the
captain of the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md),
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) that
day in the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Omri](../ebd/ebd278.htm#006.md) went up from
[Gibbethon](../ebd/ebd147.htm#007.md), and all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) with him, and they besieged Tirzah.  

<span id="018">18</span> And it came to pass, when
[Zimri](../ebd/ebd393.htm#009.md) saw that the city was taken, that he went
into the [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md) of the king's house, and burnt
the king's house over him with fire, and died.  

<span id="019">19</span> For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in
the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md), and in his
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) which he did, to make
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Zimri](../ebd/ebd393.htm#009.md), and his treason that he wrought, are
they not written in the book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003.md)
of the kings of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="021">21</span> Then were the people of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) divided into two parts: half of the
people followed [Tibni](../ebd/ebd365.htm#009.md) the son of Ginath, to
make him [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md); and half followed
[Omri](../ebd/ebd278.htm#006.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> But the people that followed
[Omri](../ebd/ebd278.htm#006.md) prevailed against the people that followed
[Tibni](../ebd/ebd365.htm#009.md) the son of Ginath: so
[Tibni](../ebd/ebd365.htm#009) died, and [Omri](../ebd/ebd278.htm#006.md)
reigned.  

<span id="023">23</span> In the thirty and first year of
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) began [Omri](../ebd/ebd278.htm#006.md) to
reign over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), twelve years: six years
reigned he in Tirzah.  

<span id="024">24</span> And he bought the hill
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md) of Shemer for two talents of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and built on the hill, and called the
name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the
hill, [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> But [Omri](../ebd/ebd278.htm#006.md) wrought evil
in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that were before him.  

<span id="026">26</span> For he walked in all the way of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) the son of
[Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003), and in his [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
wherewith he made [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) to
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), to provoke the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) with
their vanities.  

<span id="027">27</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Omri](../ebd/ebd278.htm#006.md) which he did, and his might that he
shewed, are they not written in the book of the
[chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003.md) of the kings of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="028">28</span> So [Omri](../ebd/ebd278.htm#006.md) slept with his
fathers, and was buried in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md): and
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md) his son reigned in his stead.  

<span id="029">29</span> And in the thirty and eighth year of
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) began [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md) the
son of [Omri](../ebd/ebd278.htm#006.md) to reign over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md) the
son of [Omri](../ebd/ebd278.htm#006.md) reigned over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md)
twenty and two years.  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md) the son of
[Omri](../ebd/ebd278.htm#006.md) did evil in the sight of the LORD above
all that were before him.  

<span id="031">31</span> And it came to pass, as if it had been a light
thing for him to walk in the sins of [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md)
the son of [Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003.md), that he took to wife
[Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006.md) the daughter of Ethbaal
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of the Zidonians, and went and served
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md), and worshipped him.  

<span id="032">32</span> And he reared up an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) for [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md) in the
house of [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md), which he had built in
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> And [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md) made a
[grove](../ebd/ebd155.htm#008); and [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md) did
more to provoke the LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) than all the kings of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) that were before him.  

<span id="034">34</span> In his days did [Hiel](../ebd/ebd178.htm#000.md)
the [Bethelite](../ebd/ebd055.htm#007.md) build
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md): he laid the foundation thereof in
[Abiram](../ebd/ebd004.htm#003.md) his firstborn, and set up the gates
thereof in his youngest son [Segub](../ebd/ebd326.htm#003.md), according to
the word of the LORD, which he spake by [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md)
the son of [Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006.md).
