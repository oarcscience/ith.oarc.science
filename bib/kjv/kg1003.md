### King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) made
[affinity](../ebd/ebd011.htm#005) with [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and
took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), until he had made an end of building his
own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) round about.  

<span id="002">2</span> Only the people sacrificed in high places,
because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those
days.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) loved the
LORD, walking in the statutes of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) his
father: only he sacrificed and burnt [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) in
high places.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) went to
[Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002) to [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md)
there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) offer upon that
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> In [Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002.md) the LORD
appeared to [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) in a
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md) by night: and God said, Ask what I shall
give thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) said, Thou
hast shewed unto thy servant [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) my father
great [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md), according as he walked before thee
in truth, and in [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), and in
uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great
kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), as it is this day.  

<span id="007">7</span> And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy
servant [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) instead of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) my father: and I am but a little child: I
know not how to go out or come in.  

<span id="008">8</span> And thy servant is in the midst of thy people
which thou hast [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md), a great people, that
cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.  

<span id="009">9</span> Give therefore thy servant an understanding
heart to [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) thy people, that I may discern
between good and bad: for who is able to [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md)
this thy so great a people?  

<span id="010">10</span> And the speech pleased the LORD, that
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) had asked this thing.  

<span id="011">11</span> And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked
this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked
riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast
asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;  

<span id="012">12</span> Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo,
I have given thee a [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) and an understanding
heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee
shall any arise like unto thee.  

<span id="013">13</span> And I have also given thee that which thou hast
not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among
the kings like unto thee all thy days.  

<span id="014">14</span> And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my
statutes and my commandments, as thy father
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) did walk, then I will lengthen thy
days.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) awoke;
and, behold, it was a [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md). And he came to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and stood before the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of
the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings,
and made a [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) to all his servants.  

<span id="016">16</span> Then came there two women, that were harlots,
unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and stood before him.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this
woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the
house.  

<span id="018">18</span> And it came to pass the third day after that I
was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together;
there was no [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) with us in the house,
save we two in the house.  

<span id="019">19</span> And this woman's child died in the night;
because she overlaid it.  

<span id="020">20</span> And she arose at midnight, and took my son from
beside me, while thine [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md) slept, and laid
it in her [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md), and laid her dead child in my
[bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And when I rose in the morning to give my child
suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning,
behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the other woman said, Nay; but the living
is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is
thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> Then said the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),
The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and
the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the
living.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said,
Bring me a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md). And they brought a
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) before the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said,
Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to
the other.  

<span id="026">26</span> Then spake the woman whose the living child was
unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), for her
[bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004.md) yearned upon her son, and she said, O my
lord, give her the living child, and in no [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md)
slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but
divide it.  

<span id="027">27</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) answered
and said, Give her the living child, and in no
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) slay it: she is the mother thereof.  

<span id="028">28</span> And all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) heard
of the judgment which the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) had judged; and
they feared the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md): for they saw that the
wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.
