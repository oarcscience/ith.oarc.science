### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 80

<span id="001">1</span> Give [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md), O
[Shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
thou that leadest [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) like a flock; thou
that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.  

<span id="002">2</span> Before [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) and
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) and [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md)
stir up thy strength, and come and save us.  

<span id="003">3</span> Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to
shine; and we shall be saved.  

<span id="004">4</span> O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry
against the [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) of thy people?  

<span id="005">5</span> Thou feedest them with the
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) of tears; and givest them tears to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) in great measure.  

<span id="006">6</span> Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and
our enemies laugh among themselves.  

<span id="007">7</span> Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy
face to shine; and we shall be saved.  

<span id="008">8</span> Thou hast brought a
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004) out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md):
thou hast cast out the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), and planted
it.  

<span id="009">9</span> Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause
it to take [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) root, and it filled the land.  

<span id="010">10</span> The hills were covered with the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) of it, and the boughs thereof were like
the goodly cedars.  

<span id="011">11</span> She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her
branches unto the river.  

<span id="012">12</span> Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so
that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?  

<span id="013">13</span> The [boar](../ebd/ebd061.htm#005.md) out of the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) doth waste it, and the wild
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) of the field doth devour it.  

<span id="014">14</span> Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look
down from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and behold, and visit this
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md);  

<span id="015">15</span> And the vineyard which thy right hand hath
planted, and the [branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002.md) that thou madest strong
for thyself.  

<span id="016">16</span> It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they
perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.  

<span id="017">17</span> Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand,
upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.  

<span id="018">18</span> So will not we go back from thee: quicken us,
and we will call upon thy name.  

<span id="019">19</span> Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy
face to shine; and we shall be saved.
