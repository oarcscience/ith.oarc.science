### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 37

<span id="001">1</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) dwelt in the
land wherein his father was a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md), in the
land of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> These are the generations of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007). [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), being
seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the
lad was with the sons of [Bilhah](../ebd/ebd058.htm#008.md), and with the
sons of [Zilpah](../ebd/ebd393.htm#005.md), his father's wives: and
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) brought unto his father their evil
report.  

<span id="003">3</span> Now [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) loved
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) more than all his children, because he
was the son of his old age: and he made him a
[coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004.md) of many colours.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when his brethren saw that their father
loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not
speak peaceably unto him.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) dreamed a
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md), and he told it his brethren: and they
hated him yet the more.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md) which I have dreamed:  

<span id="007">7</span> For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the
field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold,
your sheaves stood round about, and made
[obeisance](../ebd/ebd276.htm#006.md) to my sheaf.  

<span id="008">8</span> And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed
reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they
hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he dreamed yet another
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md), and told it his brethren, and said,
Behold, I have dreamed a [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md) more; and,
behold, the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) and the
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004.md) and the eleven
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008) made [obeisance](../ebd/ebd276.htm#006.md)
to me.  

<span id="010">10</span> And he told it to his father, and to his
brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md) that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy
mother and thy brethren indeed come to [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) down
ourselves to thee to the earth?  

<span id="011">11</span> And his brethren envied him; but his father
observed the saying.  

<span id="012">12</span> And his brethren went to feed their father's
flock in [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) said unto
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), Do not thy brethren feed the flock in
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md)? come, and I will send thee unto them.
And he said to him, Here am I.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see
whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and
bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004.md), and he came to
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And a certain man found him, and, behold, he
was [wandering](../ebd/ebd378.htm#008.md) in the field: and the man asked
him, saying, What seekest thou?  

<span id="016">16</span> And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I
pray thee, where they feed their flocks.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the man said, They are departed hence; for
I heard them say, Let us go to [Dothan](../ebd/ebd106.htm#005.md). And
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) went after his brethren, and found them
in [Dothan](../ebd/ebd106.htm#005.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And when they saw him afar off, even before he
came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.  

<span id="019">19</span> And they said one to another, Behold, this
dreamer cometh.  

<span id="020">20</span> Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and
cast him into some [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md), and we will say, Some
evil [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) hath devoured him: and we shall see
what will become of his dreams.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009.md) heard it,
and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill
him.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009.md) said unto
them, Shed no [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), but cast him into this
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md) that is in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), and lay no hand upon him; that he
might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.  

<span id="023">23</span> And it came to pass, when
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) was come unto his brethren, that they
stript [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) out of his
[coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004), his [coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004.md) of many
colours that was on him;  

<span id="024">24</span> And they took him, and cast him into a
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007): and the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md) was
empty, there was no water in it.  

<span id="025">25</span> And they sat down to eat
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md): and they lifted up their eyes and
looked, and, behold, a company of [Ishmeelites](../ebd/ebd190.htm#007.md)
came from [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md) with their camels bearing
[spicery](../ebd/ebd349.htm#004) and [balm](../ebd/ebd042.htm#009.md) and
[myrrh](../ebd/ebd263.htm#003.md), going to carry it down to
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) said unto
his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="027">27</span> Come, and let us sell him to the
[Ishmeelites](../ebd/ebd190.htm#007.md), and let not our hand be upon him;
for he is our brother and our [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md). And his
brethren were content.  

<span id="028">28</span> Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen;
and they drew and lifted up [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) out of the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007), and sold [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md)
to the [Ishmeelites](../ebd/ebd190.htm#007.md) for twenty
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md): and
they brought [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009.md) returned
unto the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md); and, behold,
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) was not in the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007); and he [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) his
clothes.  

<span id="030">30</span> And he returned unto his brethren, and said,
The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?  

<span id="031">31</span> And they took Joseph's
[coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004.md), and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped
the [coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004.md) in the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md);  

<span id="032">32</span> And they sent the [coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004.md)
of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This
have we found: know now whether it be thy son's
[coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004.md) or no.  

<span id="033">33</span> And he knew it, and said, It is my son's
[coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004); an evil [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md)
hath devoured him; [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) is without doubt
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007) in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md).  

<span id="034">34</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md)
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) his clothes, and put
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001.md) upon his loins, and mourned for his
son many days.  

<span id="035">35</span> And all his sons and all his daughters rose up
to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will
go down into the [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md) unto my son mourning.
Thus his father wept for him.  

<span id="036">36</span> And the Midianites sold him into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) unto [Potiphar](../ebd/ebd299.htm#002.md),
an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md).
