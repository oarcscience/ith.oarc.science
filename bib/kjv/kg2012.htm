<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 12</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;In the seventh year of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#007">Jehoash</A> began to reign; and forty years reigned he in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>. And his mother's name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd392.htm#006">Zibiah</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#007">Jehoash</A> did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> instructed him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> in the high places.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#007">Jehoash</A> said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD, even the money of every one that passeth the account, the money that every man is set at, and all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Let the priests take it to them, every man of his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</A> shall be found.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#007">Jehoash</A> the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#007">Jehoash</A> called for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, and the other priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> took a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd079.htm#007">chest</A>, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd079.htm#007">chest</A>, that the king's scribe and the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> came up, and they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house of the LORD,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And to masons, and hewers of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, and to buy timber and hewed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, snuffers, basons, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</A>, any vessels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, or vessels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the house of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;The trespass money and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priests'.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A> went up, and fought against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</A>, and took it: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</A> set his face to go up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#007">Jehoash</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> took all the hallowed things that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</A>, his fathers, kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's house, and sent it to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A>: and he went away from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the rest of the acts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</A>, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</A> of the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</A> in the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#004">Millo</A>, which goeth down to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#006">Silla</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#003">Jozachar</A> the son of Shimeath, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#005">Jehozabad</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd341.htm#000">Shomer</A>, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</A> his son reigned in his stead.<BR>
