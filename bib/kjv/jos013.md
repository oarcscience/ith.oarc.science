### King James Version: Joshua Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> Now [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) was old and
stricken in years; and the LORD said unto him, Thou art old and stricken
in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.  

<span id="002">2</span> This is the land that yet remaineth: all the
borders of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), and all Geshuri,  

<span id="003">3</span> From [Sihor](../ebd/ebd343.htm#003.md), which is
before [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), even unto the borders of
[Ekron](../ebd/ebd114.htm#001) [northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002.md), which
is counted to the [Canaanite](../ebd/ebd070.htm#008.md): five lords of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md); the Gazathites, and the
Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the
Avites:  

<span id="004">4</span> From the south, all the land of the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007), and [Mearah](../ebd/ebd245.htm#003.md)
that is beside the Sidonians unto Aphek, to the borders of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md):  

<span id="005">5</span> And the land of the Giblites, and all
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md), toward the sunrising, from Baalgad
under [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Hermon](../ebd/ebd175.htm#006.md)
unto the entering into [Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> All the inhabitants of the hill country from
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md) unto Misrephothmaim, and all the
Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): only divide thou it by lot unto the
Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.  

<span id="007">7</span> Now therefore divide this land for an
inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md),  

<span id="008">8</span> With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have
received their inheritance, which [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) gave
them, beyond [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) eastward, even as
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) the servant of the LORD gave them;  

<span id="009">9</span> From [Aroer](../ebd/ebd032.htm#001.md), that is
upon the bank of the river [Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000.md), and the city
that is in the midst of the river, and all the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) of [Medeba](../ebd/ebd246.htm#000.md) unto
[Dibon](../ebd/ebd103.htm#005.md);  

<span id="010">10</span> And all the cities of
[Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md), which reigned in
[Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009.md), unto the border of the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002.md);  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md), and the
border of the [Geshurites](../ebd/ebd147.htm#002.md) and Maachathites, and
all [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Hermon](../ebd/ebd175.htm#006.md), and
all [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003.md) unto
[Salcah](../ebd/ebd319.htm#000.md);  

<span id="012">12</span> All the kingdom of [Og](../ebd/ebd277.htm#002.md)
in [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003.md), which reigned in
[Ashtaroth](../ebd/ebd034.htm#004.md) and in
[Edrei](../ebd/ebd113.htm#002.md), who remained of the remnant of the
[giants](../ebd/ebd147.htm#006.md): for these did
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) smite, and cast them out.  

<span id="013">13</span> Nevertheless the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) expelled not the
[Geshurites](../ebd/ebd147.htm#002.md), nor the Maachathites: but the
[Geshurites](../ebd/ebd147.htm#002.md) and the Maachathites dwell among the
Israelites until this day.  

<span id="014">14</span> Only unto the tribes of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006.md) he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices
of the LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) made by fire are
their inheritance, as he said unto them.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) gave unto
the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009.md) inheritance according to their
families.  

<span id="016">16</span> And their coast was from
[Aroer](../ebd/ebd032.htm#001.md), that is on the bank of the river
[Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000.md), and the city that is in the midst of the
river, and all the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md) by
[Medeba](../ebd/ebd246.htm#000.md);  

<span id="017">17</span> [Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009.md), and all her
cities that are in the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md);
[Dibon](../ebd/ebd103.htm#005.md), and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,  

<span id="018">18</span> And Jahaza, and
[Kedemoth](../ebd/ebd216.htm#005.md), and
[Mephaath](../ebd/ebd248.htm#005.md),  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Kirjathaim](../ebd/ebd220.htm#001.md), and
[Sibmah](../ebd/ebd342.htm#006.md), and Zarethshahar in the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) of the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md),  

<span id="020">20</span> And Bethpeor, and Ashdothpisgah, and
Bethjeshimoth,  

<span id="021">21</span> And all the cities of the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md), and all the kingdom of
[Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md), which reigned in
[Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009), whom [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md)
smote with the princes of [Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md), Evi, and
[Rekem](../ebd/ebd310.htm#002), and [Zur](../ebd/ebd396.htm#005.md), and
[Hur](../ebd/ebd184.htm#009), and [Reba](../ebd/ebd308.htm#000.md), which
were dukes of [Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002.md), dwelling in the country.  

<span id="022">22</span> [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) also the son of
[Beor](../ebd/ebd052.htm#009), the [soothsayer](../ebd/ebd348.htm#003.md),
did the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) slay with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) among them that were slain by them.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the border of the children of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009) was [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), and
the border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009.md) after their families, the cities and the
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md) thereof.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) gave
inheritance unto the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md), even unto the children of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md) according to their families.  

<span id="025">25</span> And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities
of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md), and half the land of the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002), unto [Aroer](../ebd/ebd032.htm#001.md) that
is before [Rabbah](../ebd/ebd304.htm#005.md);  

<span id="026">26</span> And from [Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009.md) unto
Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from [Mahanaim](../ebd/ebd237.htm#005.md)
unto the border of [Debir](../ebd/ebd099.htm#007.md);  

<span id="027">27</span> And in the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md),
Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and [Succoth](../ebd/ebd352.htm#008.md), and
Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of [Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009.md),
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) and his border, even unto the edge of
the sea of [Chinnereth](../ebd/ebd081.htm#000.md) on the other side
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) eastward.  

<span id="028">28</span> This is the inheritance of the children of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md) after their families, the cities, and their
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) gave
inheritance unto the half [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md): and this was the possession of the
half [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) by their families.  

<span id="030">30</span> And their coast was from
[Mahanaim](../ebd/ebd237.htm#005), all [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003.md),
all the kingdom of [Og](../ebd/ebd277.htm#002.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003.md), and
all the towns of [Jair](../ebd/ebd196.htm#001.md), which are in
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003.md), threescore cities:  

<span id="031">31</span> And half [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md), and
[Ashtaroth](../ebd/ebd034.htm#004), and [Edrei](../ebd/ebd113.htm#002.md),
cities of the kingdom of [Og](../ebd/ebd277.htm#002.md) in
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003.md), were pertaining unto the children of
[Machir](../ebd/ebd235.htm#006.md) the son of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md), even to the one half of the children

any inheritance: the LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) was
their inheritance, as he said unto them.
