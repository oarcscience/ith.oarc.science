### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> Hear, O [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): Thou
art to pass over [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) this day, to go in to
possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and
fenced up to [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md),  

<span id="002">2</span> A people great and tall, the children of the
Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can
stand before the children of [Anak](../ebd/ebd022.htm#005.md)!  

<span id="003">3</span> Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy
God is he which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall
destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt
thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said
unto thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the
LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) the LORD hath brought me in to
possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth
drive them out from before thee.  

<span id="005">5</span> Not for thy
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), or for the uprightness of thine
heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of
these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and
that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers,
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md), and
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God
giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md); for thou art a stiffnecked
people.  

<span id="007">7</span> Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst
the LORD thy God to wrath in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md):
from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), until ye came unto this place, ye have
been rebellious against the LORD.  

<span id="008">8</span> Also in [Horeb](../ebd/ebd181.htm#009.md) ye
provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have
destroyed you.  

<span id="009">9</span> When I was gone up into the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) to receive the
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) of [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), even
the [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006.md) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) which the LORD made with you, then I
abode in the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) forty days and forty nights,
I neither did eat [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) nor
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) water:  

<span id="010">10</span> And the LORD delivered unto me two
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) of [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md)
written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all
the words, which the LORD spake with you in the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) out of the midst of the fire in the day
of the assembly.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it came to pass at the end of forty days
and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) of [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), even
the [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006.md) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down
quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) have corrupted themselves; they are
quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have
made them a molten image.  

<span id="013">13</span> Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I
have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:  

<span id="014">14</span> Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and
[blot](../ebd/ebd061.htm#002.md) out their name from under
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md): and I will make of thee a nation
mightier and greater than they.  

<span id="015">15</span> So I turned and came down from the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007), and the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
burned with fire: and the two [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006.md) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) were in my two hands.  

<span id="016">16</span> And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned
against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten
[calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004.md): ye had turned aside quickly out of the
way which the LORD had commanded you.  

<span id="017">17</span> And I took the two
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006.md), and cast them out of my two hands, and
brake them before your eyes.  

<span id="018">18</span> And I fell down before the LORD, as at the
first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), nor [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md)
water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in
the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> For I was afraid of the
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD
was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at
that time also.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the LORD was very angry with
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) to have destroyed him: and I prayed for
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) also the same time.  

<span id="021">21</span> And I took your [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md),
the [calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004.md) which ye had made, and burnt it with
fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as
small as [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md): and I cast the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) thereof into the
[brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006.md) that descended out of the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And at [Taberah](../ebd/ebd356.htm#001.md), and at
[Massah](../ebd/ebd243.htm#006.md), and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked
the LORD to wrath.  

<span id="023">23</span> Likewise when the LORD sent you from
Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you;
then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye
believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.  

<span id="024">24</span> Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from
the day that I knew you.  

<span id="025">25</span> Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and
forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he
would destroy you.  

<span id="026">26</span> I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O
Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast
redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) with a mighty hand.  

<span id="027">27</span> Remember thy servants,
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md), and
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md); look not unto the stubbornness of this
people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md):  

<span id="028">28</span> Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out
say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he
promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to
slay them in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance,
which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out
arm.
