### King James Version: Jonah Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> But it displeased [Jonah](../ebd/ebd210.htm#007.md)
exceedingly, and he was very angry.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray
thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country?
Therefore I fled before unto [Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002.md): for I
knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md), and of great kindness, and repentest
thee of the evil.  

<span id="003">3</span> Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my
life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be
angry?  

<span id="005">5</span> So [Jonah](../ebd/ebd210.htm#007.md) went out of
the city, and sat on the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) side of the city,
and there made him a [booth](../ebd/ebd062.htm#005.md), and sat under it in
the [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md), till he might see what would become
of the city.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the LORD God prepared a
[gourd](../ebd/ebd153.htm#005.md), and made it to come up over
[Jonah](../ebd/ebd210.htm#007.md), that it might be a
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) over his head, to deliver him from his
grief. So [Jonah](../ebd/ebd210.htm#007.md) was exceeding glad of the
[gourd](../ebd/ebd153.htm#005.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> But God prepared a [worm](../ebd/ebd384.htm#000.md)
when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the
[gourd](../ebd/ebd153.htm#005.md) that it withered.  

<span id="008">8</span> And it came to pass, when the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) did arise, that God prepared a vehement
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) wind; and the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md)
beat upon the head of [Jonah](../ebd/ebd210.htm#007.md), that he fainted,
and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than
to live.  

<span id="009">9</span> And God said to [Jonah](../ebd/ebd210.htm#007.md),
Doest thou well to be angry for the [gourd](../ebd/ebd153.htm#005.md)? And
he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the
[gourd](../ebd/ebd153.htm#005.md), for the which thou hast not laboured,
neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a
night:  

<span id="011">11</span> And should not I spare
[Nineveh](../ebd/ebd273.htm#006.md), that great city, wherein are more then
sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand
and their left hand; and also much [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md)?
