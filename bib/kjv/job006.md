### King James Version: Job Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> But Job answered and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my
calamity laid in the balances together!  

<span id="003">3</span> For now it would be heavier than the sand of the
sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.  

<span id="004">4</span> For the [arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005.md) of the
Almighty are within me, the [poison](../ebd/ebd297.htm#009.md) whereof
drinketh up my [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md): the terrors of God do
set themselves in array against me.  

<span id="005">5</span> Doth the wild [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md) bray
when he hath [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md)? or loweth the
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) over his [fodder](../ebd/ebd136.htm#006.md)?  

<span id="006">6</span> Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without
[salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008.md)? or is there any taste in the white of an
[egg](../ebd/ebd113.htm#005.md)?  

<span id="007">7</span> The things that my soul refused to touch are as
my sorrowful meat.  

<span id="008">8</span> Oh that I might have my request; and that God
would grant me the thing that I long for!  

<span id="009">9</span> Even that it would please God to destroy me;
that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!  

<span id="010">10</span> Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would
harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the
words of the Holy One.  

<span id="011">11</span> What is my strength, that I should hope? and
what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?  

<span id="012">12</span> Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md)?  

<span id="013">13</span> Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven
quite from me?  

<span id="014">14</span> To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed
from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.  

<span id="015">15</span> My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a
[brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006.md), and as the stream of brooks they pass
away;  

<span id="016">16</span> Which are blackish by reason of the
[ice](../ebd/ebd186.htm#001.md), and wherein the
[snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000.md) is hid:  

<span id="017">17</span> What time they [wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000.md)
warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their
place.  

<span id="018">18</span> The paths of their way are turned aside; they
go to nothing, and perish.  

<span id="019">19</span> The troops of [Tema](../ebd/ebd361.htm#000.md)
looked, the companies of [Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006.md) waited for
them.  

<span id="020">20</span> They were confounded because they had hoped;
they came thither, and were ashamed.  

<span id="021">21</span> For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down,
and are afraid.  

<span id="022">22</span> Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for
me of your substance?  

<span id="023">23</span> Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or,
Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?  

<span id="024">24</span> Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause
me to understand wherein I have erred.  

<span id="025">25</span> How forcible are right words! but what doth
your arguing reprove?  

<span id="026">26</span> Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the
speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?  

<span id="027">27</span> Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md) for your friend.  

<span id="028">28</span> Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it
is evident unto you if I lie.  

<span id="029">29</span> Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity;
yea, return again, my [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) is in it.  

<span id="030">30</span> Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste
discern perverse things?
