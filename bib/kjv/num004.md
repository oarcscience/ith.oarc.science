### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001),
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Take the sum of the sons of
[Kohath](../ebd/ebd222.htm#001) from among the sons of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006), after their families, by the house of
their fathers,  

<span id="003">3</span> From thirty years old and upward even until
fifty years old, all that enter into the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007),
to do the work in the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004).  

<span id="004">4</span> This shall be the service of the sons of
[Kohath](../ebd/ebd222.htm#001) in the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), about the most holy things:  

<span id="005">5</span> And when the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002)
setteth forward, [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) shall come, and his
sons, and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) with
it:  

<span id="006">6</span> And shall put thereon the covering of badgers'
skins, and shall spread over it a cloth wholly of
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003), and shall put in the staves thereof.  

<span id="007">7</span> And upon the table of
[shewbread](../ebd/ebd336.htm#008) they shall spread a cloth of
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003), and put thereon the dishes, and the
spoons, and the bowls, and covers to cover withal: and the continual
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) shall be thereon:  

<span id="008">8</span> And they shall spread upon them a cloth of
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005), and cover the same with a covering of
badgers' skins, and shall put in the staves thereof.  

<span id="009">9</span> And they shall take a cloth of
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003), and cover the
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001) of the light, and his lamps, and
his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof,
wherewith they [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) unto it:  

<span id="010">10</span> And they shall put it and all the vessels
thereof within a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put it upon a
bar.  

<span id="011">11</span> And upon the golden
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) they shall spread a cloth of
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003), and cover it with a covering of badgers'
skins, and shall put to the staves thereof:  

<span id="012">12</span> And they shall take all the instruments of
ministry, wherewith they [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) in the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005), and put them in a cloth of
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003), and cover them with a covering of
badgers' skins, and shall put them on a bar:  

<span id="013">13</span> And they shall take away the
[ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000) from the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006),
and spread a purple cloth thereon:  

<span id="014">14</span> And they shall put upon it all the vessels
thereof, wherewith they [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) about it, even
the censers, the fleshhooks, and the shovels, and the basons, all the
vessels of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006); and they shall spread
upon it a covering of badgers' skins, and put to the staves of it.  

<span id="015">15</span> And when [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) and his
sons have made an end of covering the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005), and all the vessels of the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005), as the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002)
is to set forward; after that, the sons of
[Kohath](../ebd/ebd222.htm#001) shall come to bear it: but they shall
not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are the
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) of the sons of
[Kohath](../ebd/ebd222.htm#001) in the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004).  

<span id="016">16</span> And to the office of
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the son of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003)
pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002), and the daily meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and the anointing oil, and the
oversight of all the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003), and of all
that therein is, in the [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005), and in the
vessels thereof.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001)
saying,  

<span id="018">18</span> Cut ye not off the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of the families of the
[Kohathites](../ebd/ebd222.htm#002) from among the Levites:  

<span id="019">19</span> But thus do unto them, that they may live, and
not die, when they approach unto the most holy things:
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) and his sons shall go in, and appoint
them every one to his service and to his
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007):  

<span id="020">20</span> But they shall not go in to see when the holy
things are covered, lest they die.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="022">22</span> Take also the sum of the sons of
[Gershon](../ebd/ebd146.htm#009), throughout the houses of their
fathers, by their families;  

<span id="023">23</span> From thirty years old and upward until fifty
years old shalt thou number them; all that enter in to perform the
service, to do the work in the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of
the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004).  

<span id="024">24</span> This is the service of the families of the
Gershonites, to serve, and for burdens:  

<span id="025">25</span> And they shall bear the curtains of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003), and the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), his covering, and the covering of
the badgers' skins that is above upon it, and the
[hanging](../ebd/ebd163.htm#001) for the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the

instruments of their service, and all that is made for them: so shall
they serve.  

<span id="027">27</span> At the appointment of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) and his sons shall be all the service of
the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all their
service: and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens.  

<span id="028">28</span> This is the service of the families of the sons
