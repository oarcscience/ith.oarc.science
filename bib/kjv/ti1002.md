### King James Version: 1 Timothy Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> I exhort therefore, that, first of all,
supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for
all men;  

<span id="002">2</span> For kings, and for all that are in authority;
that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all
[godliness](../ebd/ebd151.htm#007) and honesty.  

<span id="003">3</span> For this is good and acceptable in the sight of
God our [Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003);  

<span id="004">4</span> Who will have all men to be saved, and to come
unto the knowledge of the truth.  

<span id="005">5</span> For there is one God, and one
[mediator](../ebd/ebd246.htm#002) between God and men, the man
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006);  

<span id="006">6</span> Who gave himself a
[ransom](../ebd/ebd307.htm#005) for all, to be testified in due time.  

<span id="007">7</span> Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an
[apostle](../ebd/ebd026.htm#008), (I speak the truth in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), and lie not;) a teacher of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) in faith and verity.  

<span id="008">8</span> I will therefore that men pray every where,
lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.  

<span id="009">9</span> In like manner also, that women adorn themselves
in modest [apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000), with shamefacedness and
sobriety; not with broided hair, or [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), or
pearls, or costly array;  

<span id="010">10</span> But (which becometh women professing
[godliness](../ebd/ebd151.htm#007)) with good works.  

<span id="011">11</span> Let the woman learn in silence with all
subjection.  

<span id="012">12</span> But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp
authority over the man, but to be in silence.  

<span id="013">13</span> For [Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007) was first
formed, then [Eve](../ebd/ebd127.htm#005).  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007) was not
deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.  

<span id="015">15</span> Notwithstanding she shall be saved in
childbearing, if they continue in faith and
[charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009) and [holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006)
with sobriety.
