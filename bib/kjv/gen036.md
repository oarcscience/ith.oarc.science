<span id="001">1</span> Now these are the generations of
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005), who is [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) took his wives of
the daughters of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md);
[Adah](../ebd/ebd007.htm#006.md) the daughter of
[Elon](../ebd/ebd119.htm#000.md) the Hittite, and
[Aholibamah](../ebd/ebd015.htm#008.md) the daughter of
[Anah](../ebd/ebd022.htm#004.md) the daughter of
[Zibeon](../ebd/ebd392.htm#004.md) the Hivite;  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Bashemath](../ebd/ebd046.htm#006.md) Ishmael's
daughter, sister of Nebajoth.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Adah](../ebd/ebd007.htm#006.md) bare to
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005) [Eliphaz](../ebd/ebd117.htm#005.md); and

[Reuel](../ebd/ebd312.htm#001.md);  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Aholibamah](../ebd/ebd015.htm#008.md) bare
[Jeush](../ebd/ebd206.htm#003), and [Jaalam](../ebd/ebd192.htm#006.md), and
[Korah](../ebd/ebd222.htm#003.md): these are the sons of
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md), which were born unto him in the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) took his
wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his
house, and his [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), and all his beasts, and
all his substance, which he had got in the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md); and went into the country from the face
of his brother [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> For their riches were more than that they might
dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear
them because of their [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Thus dwelt [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) in
