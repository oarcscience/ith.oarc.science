### King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="002">2</span> Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me
in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.  

<span id="003">3</span> But I would have you know, that the head of
every man is [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000); and the head of the woman
is the man; and the head of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) is God.  

<span id="004">4</span> Every man praying or prophesying, having his
head covered, dishonoureth his head.  

<span id="005">5</span> But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with
her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if
she were shaven.  

<span id="006">6</span> For if the woman be not covered, let her also be
shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her
be covered.  

<span id="007">7</span> For a man indeed ought not to cover his head,
forasmuch as he is the image and [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of God:
but the woman is the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the man.  

<span id="008">8</span> For the man is not of the woman: but the woman
of the man.  

<span id="009">9</span> Neither was the man created for the woman; but
the woman for the man.  

<span id="010">10</span> For this cause ought the woman to have power on
her head because of the angels.  

<span id="011">11</span> Nevertheless neither is the man without the
woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.  

<span id="012">12</span> For as the woman is of the man, even so is the
man also by the woman; but all things of God.  

<span id="013">13</span> [Judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) in yourselves:
is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?  

<span id="014">14</span> Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if
a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?  

<span id="015">15</span> But if a woman have long hair, it is a
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) to her: for her hair is given her for a
covering.  

<span id="016">16</span> But if any man seem to be contentious, we have
no such [custom](../ebd/ebd094.htm#008), neither the churches of God.  

<span id="017">17</span> Now in this that I declare unto you I praise
you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.  

<span id="018">18</span> For first of all, when ye come together in the
church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe
it.  

<span id="019">19</span> For there must be also heresies among you, that
they which are approved may be made manifest among you.  

<span id="020">20</span> When ye come together therefore into one place,
this is not to eat the Lord's [supper](../ebd/ebd353.htm#004).  

<span id="021">21</span> For in [eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006) every
one taketh before other his own [supper](../ebd/ebd353.htm#004): and one
is hungry, and another is drunken.  

<span id="022">22</span> What? have ye not houses to eat and to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) in? or despise ye the church of God, and
shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in
this? I praise you not.  

<span id="023">23</span> For I have received of the Lord that which also
I delivered unto you, That the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) the
same night in which he was betrayed took
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006):  

<span id="024">24</span> And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and
said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in
remembrance of me.  

<span id="025">25</span> After the same manner also he took the
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000), when he had supped, saying, This
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) is the new
[testament](../ebd/ebd362.htm#007) in my [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000):
this do ye, as oft as ye [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) it, in
remembrance of me.  

<span id="026">26</span> For as often as ye eat this
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) this
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000), ye do shew the Lord's death till he
come.  

<span id="027">27</span> Wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) this
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of
the body and [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the Lord.  

<span id="028">28</span> But let a man examine himself, and so let him
eat of that [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of that [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000).  

<span id="029">29</span> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily,
eateth and drinketh [damnation](../ebd/ebd096.htm#008) to himself, not
discerning the Lord's body.  

<span id="030">30</span> For this cause many are weak and sickly among
you, and many sleep.  

<span id="031">31</span> For if we would [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005)
ourselves, we should not be judged.  

<span id="032">32</span> But when we are judged, we are chastened of the
Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.  

<span id="033">33</span> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together
to eat, tarry one for another.  

<span id="034">34</span> And if any man hunger, let him eat at home;
that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in
order when I come.
