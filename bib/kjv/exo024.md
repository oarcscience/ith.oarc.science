### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> And he said unto [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003),
Come up unto the LORD, thou, and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001),
[Nadab](../ebd/ebd264.htm#008), and [Abihu](../ebd/ebd003.htm#004), and
seventy of the elders of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) ye afar off.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) alone shall
come near the LORD: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the
people go up with him.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) came and told
the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the
people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD
hath said will we do.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) wrote all the
words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) under the hill, and twelve pillars,
according to the twelve tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="005">5</span> And he sent young men of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which offered burnt offerings, and
sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) took half of
the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and put it in basons; and half of
the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) he sprinkled on the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006).  

<span id="007">7</span> And he took the book of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), and read in the audience of the
people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be
obedient.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) took the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and sprinkled it on the people, and
said, Behold the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), which the LORD hath made with you
concerning all these words.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then went up [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), [Nadab](../ebd/ebd264.htm#008), and
[Abihu](../ebd/ebd003.htm#004), and seventy of the elders of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000):  

<span id="010">10</span> And they saw the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and there was under his feet as it were
a paved work of a [sapphire](../ebd/ebd322.htm#002)
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), and as it were the body of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) in his clearness.  

<span id="011">11</span> And upon the nobles of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) he laid not his hand: also they saw God,
and did eat and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009).  

<span id="012">12</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Come up to me into the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007), and be there: and I will give thee
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) of [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), and a
law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach
them.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) rose up, and
his [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006):
and [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) went up into the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) of God.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for
us, until we come again unto you: and, behold,
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) and [Hur](../ebd/ebd184.htm#009) are with
you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) went up into
the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007), and a [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001)
covered the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007).  

<span id="016">16</span> And the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the
LORD abode upon [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009), and the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001)
covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) out of the midst of the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001).  

<span id="017">17</span> And the sight of the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the LORD was like devouring fire on
the top of the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) in the eyes of the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) went into
the midst of the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001), and gat him up into the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007): and [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) was
in the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) forty days and forty nights.
