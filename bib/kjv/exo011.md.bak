### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Yet will I bring one
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) more upon
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), and upon
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md); afterwards he will let you go hence:
when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence
altogether.  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak now in the ears of the people, and let
every man [borrow](../ebd/ebd062.htm#007.md) of his neighbour, and every
woman of her neighbour, jewels of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) and
jewels of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight
of the Egyptians. Moreover the man [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) was
very great in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), in the sight
of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said, Thus
saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md):  

<span id="005">5</span> And all the firstborn in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) shall die, from the first born of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) that sitteth upon his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), even unto the firstborn of the
maidservant that is behind the [mill](../ebd/ebd255.htm#001.md); and all
the firstborn of beasts.  

<span id="006">6</span> And there shall be a great cry throughout all
the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), such as there was none like
it, nor shall be like it any more.  

<span id="007">7</span> But against any of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) shall not a dog move his tongue, against
man or [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md): that ye may know how that the
LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And all these thy servants shall come down unto
me, and [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) down themselves unto me, saying,
Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will
go out. And he went out from [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) in a great
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) shall
not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) did all these wonders before
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md): and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart,
so that he would not let the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
go out of his land.
