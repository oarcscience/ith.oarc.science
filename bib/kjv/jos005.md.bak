### King James Version: Joshua Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, when all the kings of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md), which were on the side of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) [westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008.md), and
all the kings of the [Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007.md), which were by
the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) from before the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), until we were passed over, that their
heart melted, neither was there [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) in them
any more, because of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> At that time the LORD said unto
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise
again the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) the second time.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) made him
sharp knives, and circumcised the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) at the hill of the foreskins.  

<span id="004">4</span> And this is the cause why
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) did circumcise: All the people that came
out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), that were males, even all the men
of war, died in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) by the way,
after they came out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Now all the people that came out were
circumcised: but all the people that were born in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) by the way as they came forth out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), them they had not circumcised.  

<span id="006">6</span> For the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) walked forty years in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), till all the people that were men
of war, which came out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), were consumed,
because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware
that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their
fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000) and [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And their children, whom he raised up in their
stead, them [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) circumcised: for they were
uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.  

<span id="008">8</span> And it came to pass, when they had done
circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md), till they were whole.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the LORD said unto
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), This day have I rolled away the
reproach of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) from off you. Wherefore the
name of the place is called [Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md) unto this
day.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) encamped in
[Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md), and kept the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md) on the fourteenth day of the month at
even in the plains of [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And they did eat of the old
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md) of the land on the morrow after the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md), unleavened cakes, and parched
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md) in the selfsame day.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the [manna](../ebd/ebd240.htm#006.md) ceased
on the morrow after they had eaten of the old
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md) of the land; neither had the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) [manna](../ebd/ebd240.htm#006.md) any more;
but they did eat of the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md) that year.  

<span id="013">13</span> And it came to pass, when
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) was by [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md),
that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man
over against him with his [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) drawn in his
hand: and [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) went unto him, and said unto
him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?  

<span id="014">14</span> And he said, Nay; but as captain of the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of the LORD am I now come. And
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) fell on his face to the earth, and did
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md), and said unto him, What saith my Lord
unto his servant?  

<span id="015">15</span> And the captain of the LORD's
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) said unto [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md),
Loose thy [shoe](../ebd/ebd340.htm#009.md) from off thy foot; for the place
whereon thou standest is holy. And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) did
so.
