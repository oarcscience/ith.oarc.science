### King James Version: 1 Timothy Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Rebuke not an [elder](../ebd/ebd114.htm#008),
but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;  

<span id="002">2</span> The [elder](../ebd/ebd114.htm#008) women as
mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.  

<span id="003">3</span> Honour [widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003) that are
[widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003) indeed.  

<span id="004">4</span> But if any widow have children or nephews, let
them learn first to shew [piety](../ebd/ebd295.htm#003) at home, and to
requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.  

<span id="005">5</span> Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate,
trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and
day.  

<span id="006">6</span> But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while
she liveth.  

<span id="007">7</span> And these things give in charge, that they may
be blameless.  

<span id="008">8</span> But if any provide not for his own, and
specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is
worse than an infidel.  

<span id="009">9</span> Let not a widow be taken into the number under
threescore years old, having been the wife of one man.  

<span id="010">10</span> Well reported of for good works; if she have
brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed
the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have
diligently followed every good work.  

<span id="011">11</span> But the younger [widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003)
refuse: for when they have begun to [wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000) wanton
against [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), they will marry;  

<span id="012">12</span> Having [damnation](../ebd/ebd096.htm#008),
because they have cast off their first faith.  

<span id="013">13</span> And withal they learn to be idle,
[wandering](../ebd/ebd378.htm#008) about from house to house; and not
only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they
ought not.  

<span id="014">14</span> I will therefore that the younger women marry,
bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the
[adversary](../ebd/ebd011.htm#001) to speak reproachfully.  

<span id="015">15</span> For some are already turned aside after
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000).  

<span id="016">16</span> If any man or woman that believeth have
[widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003), let them relieve them, and let not the
church be charged; that it may relieve them that are
[widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003) indeed.  

<span id="017">17</span> Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy
of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.  

<span id="018">18</span> For the [scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005)
saith, Thou shalt not [muzzle](../ebd/ebd263.htm#001) the
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) that treadeth out the
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006). And, The labourer is worthy of his
reward.  

<span id="019">19</span> Against an [elder](../ebd/ebd114.htm#008)
receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.  

<span id="020">20</span> Them that [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) rebuke
before all, that others also may fear.  

<span id="021">21</span> I charge thee before God, and the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), and the
elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one
before another, doing nothing by partiality.  

<span id="022">22</span> Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be
partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure.  

<span id="023">23</span> [Drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) no longer water,
but use a little [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) for thy stomach's sake
and thine often infirmities.  

<span id="024">24</span> Some men's sins are open beforehand, going
before to judgment; and some men they follow after.  

<span id="025">25</span> Likewise also the good works of some are
manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.
