### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 34

<span id="001">1</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) went up from
the plains of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) unto the mountain of
[Nebo](../ebd/ebd268.htm#004.md), to the top of
[Pisgah](../ebd/ebd296.htm#004.md), that is over against
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md). And the LORD shewed him all the land
of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009), unto [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md),  

<span id="002">2</span> And all [Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006.md), and
the land of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), and
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md), and all the land of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), unto the utmost sea,  

<span id="003">3</span> And the south, and the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) of the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) of
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md), the city of palm trees, unto
[Zoar](../ebd/ebd395.htm#004.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And the LORD said unto him, This is the land
which I sware unto [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), unto
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006), and unto [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md),
saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with
thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.  

<span id="005">5</span> So [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) the servant of
the LORD died there in the land of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md),
according to the word of the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he buried him in a
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) in the land of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth
of his [sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md) unto this day.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) was an
hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his
natural force abated.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) wept for [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md)
in the plains of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) thirty days: so the days
of weeping and mourning for [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) were ended.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) the son of
[Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006.md) was full of the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of wisdom; for
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) had laid his hands upon him: and the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) hearkened unto him, and did
as the LORD commanded [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And there arose not a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) since in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) like unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), whom the LORD knew face to face,  

<span id="011">11</span> In all the signs and the wonders, which the
LORD sent him to do in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) to
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), and to all his servants, and to all
his land,  

<span id="012">12</span> And in all that mighty hand, and in all the
great terror which [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) shewed in the sight of
all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).
