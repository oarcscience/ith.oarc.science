### King James Version: Mark Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> After two days was the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005),
and of unleavened [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006): and the chief priests
and the [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) sought how they might take him
by craft, and put him to death.  

<span id="002">2</span> But they said, Not on the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) day, lest there be an uproar of the
people.  

<span id="003">3</span> And being in [Bethany](../ebd/ebd054.htm#007) in
the house of [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004) the leper, as he sat at
meat, there came a woman having an [alabaster](../ebd/ebd016.htm#005)
[box](../ebd/ebd063.htm#007) of [ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007) of
[spikenard](../ebd/ebd349.htm#008) very precious; and she brake the
[box](../ebd/ebd063.htm#007), and poured it on his head.  

<span id="004">4</span> And there were some that had indignation within
themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the
[ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007) made?  

<span id="005">5</span> For it might have been sold for more than three
hundred pence, and have been given to the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006).
And they murmured against her.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said, Let her
alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.  

<span id="007">7</span> For ye have the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006)
with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye
have not always.  

<span id="008">8</span> She hath done what she could: she is come
aforehand to [anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008) my body to the burying.  

<span id="009">9</span> Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) shall be preached throughout the whole
world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of
her.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001)
[Iscariot](../ebd/ebd190.htm#000), one of the twelve, went unto the
chief priests, to betray him unto them.  

<span id="011">11</span> And when they heard it, they were glad, and
promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently
betray him.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the first day of unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), when they killed the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005), his disciples said unto him, Where
wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005)?  

<span id="013">13</span> And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and
saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man
bearing a [pitcher](../ebd/ebd296.htm#009) of water: follow him.  

<span id="014">14</span> And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the
goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where
I shall eat the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005) with my disciples?  

<span id="015">15</span> And he will shew you a large upper room
furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.  

<span id="016">16</span> And his disciples went forth, and came into the
city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005).  

<span id="017">17</span> And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.  

<span id="018">18</span> And as they sat and did eat,
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said, Verily I say unto you, One of you
which eateth with me shall betray me.  

<span id="019">19</span> And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto
him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?  

<span id="020">20</span> And he answered and said unto them, It is one
of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the
[dish](../ebd/ebd104.htm#004).  

<span id="021">21</span> The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written
of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good
were it for that man if he had never been born.  

<span id="022">22</span> And as they did eat,
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) took [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and
blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my
body.  

<span id="023">23</span> And he took the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000),
and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of
it.  

<span id="024">24</span> And he said unto them, This is my
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the new
[testament](../ebd/ebd362.htm#007), which is shed for many.  

<span id="025">25</span> Verily I say unto you, I will
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) no more of the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of the [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004),
until that day that I [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) it new in the
kingdom of God.  

<span id="026">26</span> And when they had sung an
[hymn](../ebd/ebd185.htm#005), they went out into the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) of Olives.  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith unto
them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is
written, I will smite the [shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006), and the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) shall be scattered.  

<span id="028">28</span> But after that I am risen, I will go before you
into [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008).  

<span id="029">29</span> But [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) said unto
him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith unto
him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before
the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.  

<span id="031">31</span> But he spake the more vehemently, If I should
die with thee, I will not deny thee in any
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004). Likewise also said they all.  

<span id="032">32</span> And they came to a place which was named
[Gethsemane](../ebd/ebd147.htm#003): and he saith to his disciples, Sit
ye here, while I shall pray.  

<span id="033">33</span> And he taketh with him
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) and [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007) and
John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;  

<span id="034">34</span> And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding
sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.  

<span id="035">35</span> And he went forward a little, and fell on the
ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from
him.  

<span id="036">36</span> And he said, [Abba](../ebd/ebd000.htm#007),
Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) from me: nevertheless not what I will, but
what thou wilt.  

<span id="037">37</span> And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and
saith unto [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002),
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004), sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch
one hour?  

<span id="038">38</span> Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into
[temptation](../ebd/ebd361.htm#008). The [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009)
truly is ready, but the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) is weak.  

<span id="039">39</span> And again he went away, and prayed, and spake
the same words.  

<span id="040">40</span> And when he returned, he found them asleep
again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer
him.  

<span id="041">41</span> And he cometh the third time, and saith unto
them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come;
behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.  

<span id="042">42</span> Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is
at hand.  

<span id="043">43</span> And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh
[Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001), one of the twelve, and with him a great
multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) and the elders.  

<span id="044">44</span> And he that betrayed him had given them a
token, saying, Whomsoever I shall [kiss](../ebd/ebd221.htm#000), that
same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.  

<span id="045">45</span> And as soon as he was come, he goeth
straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.  

<span id="046">46</span> And they laid their hands on him, and took
him.  

<span id="047">47</span> And one of them that stood by drew a
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and smote a servant of the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and cut off his
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004).  

<span id="048">48</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered and
said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and
with staves to take me?  

<span id="049">49</span> I was daily with you in the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) teaching, and ye took me not: but the
scriptures must be fulfilled.  

<span id="050">50</span> And they all forsook him, and fled.  

<span id="051">51</span> And there followed him a certain young man,
having a [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008) cloth cast about his
[naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003) body; and the young men laid hold on
him:  

<span id="052">52</span> And he left the [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008)
cloth, and fled from them [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003).  

<span id="053">53</span> And they led [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
away to the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003): and with him were
assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003).  

<span id="054">54</span> And [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) followed him
afar off, even into the [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008) of the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003): and he sat with the servants, and
warmed himself at the fire.  

<span id="055">55</span> And the chief priests and all the
[council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004) sought for
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) against [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
to put him to death; and found none.  

<span id="056">56</span> For many bare false
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) against him, but their
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) agreed not together.  

<span id="057">57</span> And there arose certain, and bare false
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) against him, saying,  

<span id="058">58</span> We heard him say, I will destroy this
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) that is made with hands, and within
three days I will build another made without hands.  

<span id="059">59</span> But neither so did their
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) agree together.  

<span id="060">60</span> And the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003)
stood up in the midst, and asked [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), saying,
Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) against thee?  

<span id="061">61</span> But he held his peace, and answered nothing.
Again the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) asked him, and said unto
him, Art thou the [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), the Son of the
Blessed?  

<span id="062">62</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said, I am:
and ye shall see the Son of man [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009) on the
right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="063">63</span> Then the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003)
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007) his clothes, and saith, What need we any
further witnesses?  

<span id="064">64</span> Ye have heard the
[blasphemy](../ebd/ebd060.htm#005): what think ye? And they all
condemned him to be guilty of death.  

<span id="065">65</span> And some began to spit on him, and to cover his
face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants
did strike him with the palms of their hands.  

<span id="066">66</span> And as [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) was
beneath in the [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008), there cometh one of the
maids of the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003):  

<span id="067">67</span> And when she saw [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002)
warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) of [Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007).  

<span id="068">68</span> But he denied, saying, I know not, neither
understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the
cock crew.  

<span id="069">69</span> And a maid saw him again, and began to say to
them that stood by, This is one of them.  

<span id="070">70</span> And he denied it again. And a little after,
they that stood by said again to [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002), Surely
thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth
thereto.  

<span id="071">71</span> But he began to [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003)
and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.  

<span id="072">72</span> And the second time the cock crew. And
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) called to mind the word that
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto him, Before the cock crow
twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he
wept.
