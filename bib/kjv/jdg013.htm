<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Judges Chapter 13</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> forty years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And there was a certain man of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd396.htm#002">Zorah</A>, of the family of the Danites, whose name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</A>; and his wife was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</A>, and bare not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</A>, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> nor strong <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, and eat not any unclean thing:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd307.htm#009">razor</A> shall come on his head: for the child shall be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#008">Nazarite</A> unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> out of the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> nor strong <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#008">Nazarite</A> to God from the womb to the day of his death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</A> intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And God hearkened to the voice of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</A>; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</A> her husband was not with her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the other day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</A> arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</A> said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</A>, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A>, neither let her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> or strong <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</A> said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</A>, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>: and if thou wilt offer a burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A>, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</A> knew not that he was an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</A> said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</A> took a kid with a meat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A>, and offered it upon a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> unto the LORD: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> did wonderously; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</A> and his wife looked on.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> from off the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD ascended in the flame of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</A> and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;But the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD did no more appear to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</A> and to his wife. Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</A> knew that he was an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</A> said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> and a meat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the woman bare a son, and called his name <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</A>: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of the LORD began to move him at times in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</A> between <A HREF="../ebd/ebd396.htm#002">Zorah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#002">Eshtaol</A>.<BR>
