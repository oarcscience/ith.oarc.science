### King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about
with so great a [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md) of witnesses, let us lay
aside every weight, and the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) which doth so
easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set
before us,  

<span id="002">2</span> Looking unto [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) the
author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before
him endured the [cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000.md), despising the shame, and
is set down at the right hand of the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of
God.  

<span id="003">3</span> For consider him that endured such contradiction
of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your
minds.  

<span id="004">4</span> Ye have not yet resisted unto
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), striving against
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And ye have forgotten the exhortation which
speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the
chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:  

<span id="006">6</span> For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and
scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.  

<span id="007">7</span> If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as
with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?  

<span id="008">8</span> But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all
are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.  

<span id="009">9</span> Furthermore we have had fathers of our
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) which corrected us, and we gave them
reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of
spirits, and live?  

<span id="010">10</span> For they verily for a few days chastened us
after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be
partakers of his [holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be
joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md)
unto them which are exercised thereby.  

<span id="012">12</span> Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down,
and the feeble knees;  

<span id="013">13</span> And make straight paths for your feet, lest
that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be
healed.  

<span id="014">14</span> Follow peace with all men, and
[holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md), without which no man shall see the
Lord:  

<span id="015">15</span> Looking diligently lest any man fail of the
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of God; lest any root of bitterness
springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;  

<span id="016">16</span> Lest there be any fornicator, or profane
person, as [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md), who for one morsel of meat
sold his [birthright](../ebd/ebd059.htm#004.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> For ye know how that afterward, when he would
have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of
[repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008.md), though he sought it carefully with
tears.  

<span id="018">18</span> For ye are not come unto the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) that might be touched, and that burned
with fire, nor unto blackness, and [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md),
and tempest,  

<span id="019">19</span> And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of
words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be
spoken to them any more:  

<span id="020">20</span> (For they could not endure that which was
commanded, And if so much as a [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) touch the
mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a
[dart](../ebd/ebd097.htm#009.md):  

<span id="021">21</span> And so terrible was the sight, that
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said, I exceedingly fear and quake:.md)  

<span id="022">22</span> But ye are come unto
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Sion](../ebd/ebd345.htm#003.md), and unto
the city of the living God, the heavenly
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and to an innumerable company of
angels,  

<span id="023">23</span> To the general assembly and church of the
firstborn, which are written in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and to
God the [Judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) of all, and to the spirits of
just men made perfect,  

<span id="024">24</span> And to [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) the
[mediator](../ebd/ebd246.htm#002.md) of the new
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md), and to the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of sprinkling, that speaketh better
things than that of [Abel](../ebd/ebd001.htm#004.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For
if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall
not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md):  

<span id="026">26</span> Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he
hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but
also [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the
removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made,
that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.  

<span id="028">28</span> Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot
be moved, let us have [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md), whereby we may
serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:  

<span id="029">29</span> For our God is a consuming fire.
