### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> Send ye the [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003) to the
ruler of the land from [Sela](../ebd/ebd326.htm#006) to the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), unto the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) of the daughter of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002).  

<span id="002">2</span> For it shall be, that, as a
[wandering](../ebd/ebd378.htm#008) [bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000) cast
out of the nest, so the daughters of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005) shall
be at the fords of [Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000).  

<span id="003">3</span> Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) as the night in the midst of the
noonday; hide the outcasts; [bewray](../ebd/ebd057.htm#007) not him that
wandereth.  

<span id="004">4</span> Let mine outcasts dwell with thee,
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005); be thou a covert to them from the face of
the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the
oppressors are consumed out of the land.  

<span id="005">5</span> And in [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) shall the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) be established: and he shall sit upon it
in truth in the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), judging, and seeking judgment, and
hasting [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="006">6</span> We have heard of the pride of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005); he is very proud: even of his
haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies shall not be
so.  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore shall [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005)
howl for [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), every one shall howl: for the
foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye [mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004);
surely they are stricken.  

<span id="008">8</span> For the fields of
[Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009) languish, and the
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004) of [Sibmah](../ebd/ebd342.htm#006): the
lords of the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005) have broken down the
principal plants thereof, they are come even unto Jazer, they wandered
through the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005): her branches are
stretched out, they are gone over the sea.  

<span id="009">9</span> Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of
Jazer the [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004) of
[Sibmah](../ebd/ebd342.htm#006): I will water thee with my tears, O
[Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009), and [Elealeh](../ebd/ebd114.htm#009):
for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008) is fallen.  

<span id="010">10</span> And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the
plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither
shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) in their presses; I have made their
vintage shouting to cease.  

<span id="011">11</span> Wherefore my [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004)
shall sound like an [harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001) for
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), and mine inward parts for Kirharesh.  

<span id="012">12</span> And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005) is weary on the high place, that he shall
come to his [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005) to pray; but he shall not
prevail.  

<span id="013">13</span> This is the word that the LORD hath spoken
concerning [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005) since that time.  

<span id="014">14</span> But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within
three years, as the years of an [hireling](../ebd/ebd179.htm#004), and
the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005)
shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant shall
be very small and feeble.
