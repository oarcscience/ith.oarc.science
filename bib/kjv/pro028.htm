<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 28</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;A <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> man that oppresseth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> is like a sweeping <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> which leaveth no food.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Better is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Whoso keepeth the law is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;He that by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd375.htm#006">usury</A> and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;He that turneth away his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> from hearing the law, even his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> shall be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>: but the upright shall have good things in possession.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;The rich man is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> in his own conceit; but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> that hath understanding searcheth him out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;When righteous men do rejoice, there is great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#000">covetousness</A> shall prolong his days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;A man that doeth violence to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of any person shall flee to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>; let no man stay him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>: but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;A <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> that man will transgress.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#003">destroyer</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;He that giveth unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.<BR>
