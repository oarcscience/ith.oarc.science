### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 43

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, that when
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) had made an end of speaking unto all
the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their
God had sent him to them, even all these words,  

<span id="002">2</span> Then spake [Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005.md) the
son of Hoshaiah, and [Johanan](../ebd/ebd208.htm#009.md) the son of
[Kareah](../ebd/ebd215.htm#007.md), and all the proud men, saying unto
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md), Thou speakest falsely: the LORD our
God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) to sojourn there:  

<span id="003">3</span> But [Baruch](../ebd/ebd046.htm#001.md) the son of
Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of
the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away
captives into [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> So [Johanan](../ebd/ebd208.htm#009.md) the son of
[Kareah](../ebd/ebd215.htm#007.md), and all the captains of the
[forces](../ebd/ebd137.htm#000.md), and all the people, obeyed not the
voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> But [Johanan](../ebd/ebd208.htm#009.md) the son of
[Kareah](../ebd/ebd215.htm#007.md), and all the captains of the
[forces](../ebd/ebd137.htm#000.md), took all the remnant of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), that were returned from all nations,
whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md);  

<span id="006">6</span> Even men, and women, and children, and the
king's daughters, and every person that
[Nebuzaradan](../ebd/ebd268.htm#008.md) the captain of the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md) had left with
[Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009.md) the son of
[Ahikam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#001.md) the son of
[Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004), and [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md)
the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md), and
[Baruch](../ebd/ebd046.htm#001.md) the son of Neriah.  

<span id="007">7</span> So they came into the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): for they obeyed not the voice of the
LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then came the word of the LORD unto
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) in Tahpanhes, saying,  

<span id="009">9</span> Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them
in the [clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004.md) in the brickkiln, which is at the
entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md);  

<span id="010">10</span> And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of
hosts, the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); Behold, I will send
and take [Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), my
servant, and will set his [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) upon these
stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal
[pavilion](../ebd/ebd287.htm#004.md) over them.  

<span id="011">11</span> And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and deliver such as are for death to
death; and such as are for [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md) to
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md); and such as are for the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) to the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the
gods of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md); and he shall burn them, and
carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), as a [shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006.md)
putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.  

<span id="013">13</span> He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh,
that is in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md); and the houses of
the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.
