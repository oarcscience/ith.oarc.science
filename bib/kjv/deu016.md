### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> Observe the month of
[Abib](../ebd/ebd002.htm#006), and keep the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005) unto the LORD thy God: for in the
month of [Abib](../ebd/ebd002.htm#006) the LORD thy God brought thee
forth out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) by night.  

<span id="002">2</span> Thou shalt therefore
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005)
unto the LORD thy God, of the flock and the
[herd](../ebd/ebd174.htm#009), in the place which the LORD shall choose
to place his name there.  

<span id="003">3</span> Thou shalt eat no leavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) with it; [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
days shalt thou eat unleavened [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) therewith,
even the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) of affliction; for thou camest
forth out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) in haste: that
thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) all the days of thy life.  

<span id="004">4</span> And there shall be no leavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) seen with thee in all thy coast
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days; neither shall there any thing of
the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), which thou sacrificedst the first
day at even, remain all night until the morning.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thou mayest not
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005)
within any of thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee:  

<span id="006">6</span> But at the place which the LORD thy God shall
choose to place his name in, there thou shalt
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005)
at even, at the going down of the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), at the
season that thou camest forth out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="007">7</span> And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place
which the LORD thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning,
and go unto thy tents.  

<span id="008">8</span> Six days thou shalt eat unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006): and on the seventh day shall be a solemn
assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work therein.  

<span id="009">9</span> [Seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) weeks shalt thou
number unto thee: begin to number the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the
[sickle](../ebd/ebd342.htm#008) to the [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006).  

<span id="010">10</span> And thou shalt keep the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a
[tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006) of a freewill
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of thine hand, which thou shalt give
unto the LORD thy God, according as the LORD thy God hath blessed
thee:  

<span id="011">11</span> And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God,
thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy
maidservant, and the [Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009) that is within thy
gates, and the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), and the fatherless,
and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD thy God
hath [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) to place his name there.  

<span id="012">12</span> And thou shalt remember that thou wast a
bondman in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009): and thou shalt observe and do
these statutes.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou shalt observe the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of tabernacles
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days, after that thou hast gathered in
thy [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) and thy
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000):  

<span id="014">14</span> And thou shalt rejoice in thy
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000), thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and
thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the
[Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009), the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009),
and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates.  

<span id="015">15</span> [Seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days shalt thou
keep a solemn [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) unto the LORD thy God in
the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God shall
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) thee in all thine increase, and in all
the works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.  

<span id="016">16</span> Three times in a year shall all thy males
appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose; in
the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and in the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of weeks, and in the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of tabernacles: and they shall not appear
before the LORD empty:  

<span id="017">17</span> Every man shall give as he is able, according
to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee.  

<span id="018">18</span> Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all
thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes:
and they shall [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) the people with just
judgment.  

<span id="019">19</span> Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not
respect persons, neither take a [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005): for a
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005) doth [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009) the
eyes of the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), and pervert the words of the
righteous.  

<span id="020">20</span> That which is altogether just shalt thou
follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy
God giveth thee.  

<span id="021">21</span> Thou shalt not plant thee a
[grove](../ebd/ebd155.htm#008) of any trees near unto the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt
make thee.  

<span id="022">22</span> Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which
the LORD thy God hateth.
