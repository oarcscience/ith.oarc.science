### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> And [Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007.md) knew
[Eve](../ebd/ebd127.htm#005.md) his wife; and she conceived, and bare
[Cain](../ebd/ebd068.htm#007.md), and said, I have gotten a man from the
LORD.  

<span id="002">2</span> And she again bare his brother
[Abel](../ebd/ebd001.htm#004). And [Abel](../ebd/ebd001.htm#004.md) was a
keeper of [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), but
[Cain](../ebd/ebd068.htm#007.md) was a tiller of the ground.  

<span id="003">3</span> And in process of time it came to pass, that
[Cain](../ebd/ebd068.htm#007.md) brought of the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of the ground an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) unto the LORD.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Abel](../ebd/ebd001.htm#004.md), he also
brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) thereof. And the LORD had respect unto
[Abel](../ebd/ebd001.htm#004.md) and to his
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md):  

<span id="005">5</span> But unto [Cain](../ebd/ebd068.htm#007.md) and to
his [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) he had not respect. And
[Cain](../ebd/ebd068.htm#007.md) was very wroth, and his countenance
fell.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the LORD said unto
[Cain](../ebd/ebd068.htm#007.md), Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
countenance fallen?  

<span id="007">7</span> If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?
and if thou doest not well, [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) lieth at the
door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Cain](../ebd/ebd068.htm#007.md) talked with
[Abel](../ebd/ebd001.htm#004.md) his brother: and it came to pass, when
they were in the field, that [Cain](../ebd/ebd068.htm#007.md) rose up
against [Abel](../ebd/ebd001.htm#004.md) his brother, and slew him.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the LORD said unto
[Cain](../ebd/ebd068.htm#007), Where is [Abel](../ebd/ebd001.htm#004.md)
thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?  

<span id="010">10</span> And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of
thy brother's [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) crieth unto me from the
ground.  

<span id="011">11</span> And now art thou cursed from the earth, which
hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) from thy hand;  

<span id="012">12</span> When thou tillest the ground, it shall not
henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a
[fugitive](../ebd/ebd139.htm#003.md) and a
[vagabond](../ebd/ebd376.htm#006.md) shalt thou be in the earth.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Cain](../ebd/ebd068.htm#007.md) said unto the
LORD, My [punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005.md) is greater than I can
bear.  

<span id="014">14</span> Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from
the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be
a [fugitive](../ebd/ebd139.htm#003.md) and a
[vagabond](../ebd/ebd376.htm#006.md) in the earth; and it shall come to
pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever
slayeth [Cain](../ebd/ebd068.htm#007.md), vengeance shall be taken on him
sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon [Cain](../ebd/ebd068.htm#007.md),
lest any finding him should kill him.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Cain](../ebd/ebd068.htm#007.md) went out from
the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of
[Nod](../ebd/ebd274.htm#006), on the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) of
[Eden](../ebd/ebd112.htm#009.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Cain](../ebd/ebd068.htm#007.md) knew his
wife; and she conceived, and bare [Enoch](../ebd/ebd121.htm#004.md): and he
builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his
son, [Enoch](../ebd/ebd121.htm#004.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And unto [Enoch](../ebd/ebd121.htm#004.md) was
born [Irad](../ebd/ebd189.htm#001): and [Irad](../ebd/ebd189.htm#001.md)
begat [Mehujael](../ebd/ebd246.htm#007.md): and
[Mehujael](../ebd/ebd246.htm#007.md) begat
[Methusael](../ebd/ebd251.htm#008.md): and
[Methusael](../ebd/ebd251.htm#008.md) begat
[Lamech](../ebd/ebd223.htm#004.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Lamech](../ebd/ebd223.htm#004.md) took unto
him two wives: the name of the one was [Adah](../ebd/ebd007.htm#006.md),
and the name of the other [Zillah](../ebd/ebd393.htm#004.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Adah](../ebd/ebd007.htm#006.md) bare
[Jabal](../ebd/ebd193.htm#005.md): he was the father of such as dwell in
tents, and of such as have [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And his brother's name was
[Jubal](../ebd/ebd212.htm#004.md): he was the father of all such as handle
the [harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001) and [organ](../ebd/ebd280.htm#004.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Zillah](../ebd/ebd393.htm#004.md), she also
bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every
[artificer](../ebd/ebd032.htm#007) in [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md) and
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md): and the sister of Tubalcain was
[Naamah](../ebd/ebd263.htm#008.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Lamech](../ebd/ebd223.htm#004.md) said unto
his wives, [Adah](../ebd/ebd007.htm#006.md) and
[Zillah](../ebd/ebd393.htm#004.md), Hear my voice; ye wives of
[Lamech](../ebd/ebd223.htm#004.md), hearken unto my speech: for I have
slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.  

<span id="024">24</span> If [Cain](../ebd/ebd068.htm#007.md) shall be
avenged sevenfold, truly [Lamech](../ebd/ebd223.htm#004.md) seventy and
sevenfold.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007.md) knew his wife
again; and she bare a son, and called his name
[Seth](../ebd/ebd329.htm#003.md): For God, said she, hath appointed me
another seed instead of [Abel](../ebd/ebd001.htm#004.md), whom
[Cain](../ebd/ebd068.htm#007.md) slew.  

<span id="026">26</span> And to [Seth](../ebd/ebd329.htm#003.md), to him
also there was born a son; and he called his name
[Enos](../ebd/ebd121.htm#005.md): then began men to call upon the name of
the LORD.
