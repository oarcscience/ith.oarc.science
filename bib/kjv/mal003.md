### King James Version: Malachi Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Behold, I will send my
[messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005.md), and he shall prepare the way before
me: and the LORD, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), even the
[messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005.md) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md), whom ye delight in: behold, he shall
come, saith the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="002">2</span> But who may abide the day of his coming? and who
shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like
fullers' [soap](../ebd/ebd347.htm#002.md):  

<span id="003">3</span> And he shall sit as a
[refiner](../ebd/ebd309.htm#001.md) and purifier of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md): and he shall purify the sons of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006.md), and purge them as
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) and [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), that
they may offer unto the LORD an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) in
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Then shall the [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md)
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md)
be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former
years.  

<span id="005">5</span> And I will come near to you to judgment; and I
will be a swift [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) against the sorcerers,
and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against
those that oppress the [hireling](../ebd/ebd179.htm#004.md) in his
[wages](../ebd/ebd378.htm#004.md), the widow, and the fatherless, and that
turn aside the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) from his right, and
fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="006">6</span> For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye
sons of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) are not consumed.  

<span id="007">7</span> Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone
away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I
will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein
shall we return?  

<span id="008">8</span> Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But
ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.  

<span id="009">9</span> Ye are cursed with a
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md): for ye have robbed me, even this whole
nation.  

<span id="010">10</span> Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse,
that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith
the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and pour you out a blessing, that there
shall not be room enough to receive it.  

<span id="011">11</span> And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes,
and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004) cast her [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md)
before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="012">12</span> And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye
shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="013">13</span> Your words have been stout against me, saith
the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against thee?  

<span id="014">14</span> Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what
profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked
mournfully before the LORD of hosts?  

<span id="015">15</span> And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that
work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even
delivered.  

<span id="016">16</span> Then they that feared the LORD spake often one
to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of
remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and
that thought upon his name.  

<span id="017">17</span> And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of
hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a
man spareth his own son that serveth him.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then shall ye return, and discern between the
righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that
serveth him not.
