### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 57

<span id="001">1</span> The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to
heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the
righteous is taken away from the evil to come.  

<span id="002">2</span> He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in
their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.  

<span id="003">3</span> But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress,
the seed of the adulterer and the whore.  

<span id="004">4</span> Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against
whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children
of transgression, a seed of falsehood.  

<span id="005">5</span> Enflaming yourselves with idols under every
green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the
rocks?  

<span id="006">6</span> Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy
portion; they, they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), thou
hast offered a meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md). Should I receive
comfort in these?  

<span id="007">7</span> Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy
bed: even thither wentest thou up to offer
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Behind the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) also
and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered
thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed,
and made thee a [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with them; thou
lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.  

<span id="009">9</span> And thou wentest to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) with [ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007.md),
and didst increase thy [perfumes](../ebd/ebd290.htm#002.md), and didst send
thy messengers far off, and didst debase thyself even unto
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way;
yet saidst thou not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine
hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.  

<span id="011">11</span> And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared,
that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy
heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?  

<span id="012">12</span> I will declare thy
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), and thy works; for they shall
not profit thee.  

<span id="013">13</span> When thou criest, let thy companies deliver
thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them:
but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall
inherit my holy mountain;  

<span id="014">14</span> And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare
the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.  

<span id="015">15</span> For thus saith the high and lofty One that
inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy
place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), to revive the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the humble, and to revive the heart
of the contrite ones.  

<span id="016">16</span> For I will not contend for ever, neither will I
be always wroth: for the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) should fail
before me, and the souls which I have made.  

<span id="017">17</span> For the iniquity of his
[covetousness](../ebd/ebd092.htm#000.md) was I wroth, and smote him: I hid
me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.  

<span id="018">18</span> I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will
lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.  

<span id="019">19</span> I create the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of
the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near,
saith the LORD; and I will heal him.  

<span id="020">20</span> But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when
it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.  

<span id="021">21</span> There is no peace, saith my God, to the
wicked.
