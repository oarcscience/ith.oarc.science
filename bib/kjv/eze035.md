### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 35

<span id="001">1</span> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Son of man, set thy face against
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004), and
prophesy against it,  

<span id="003">3</span> And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
Behold, O [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004),
I am against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I
will make thee most desolate.  

<span id="004">4</span> I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be
desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.  

<span id="005">5</span> Because thou hast had a perpetual
[hatred](../ebd/ebd167.htm#002), and hast shed the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) by the force of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) in the time of their calamity, in the
time that their iniquity had an end:  

<span id="006">6</span> Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will
prepare thee unto [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not
hated [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), even
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) shall pursue thee.  

<span id="007">7</span> Thus will I make [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004) most desolate, and cut off from it him
that passeth out and him that returneth.  

<span id="008">8</span> And I will fill his mountains with his slain
men: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they
fall that are slain with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="009">9</span> I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy
cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.  

<span id="010">10</span> Because thou hast said, These two nations and
these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the
LORD was there:  

<span id="011">11</span> Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I
will even do according to thine [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), and
according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy
[hatred](../ebd/ebd167.htm#002) against them; and I will make myself
known among them, when I have judged thee.  

<span id="012">12</span> And thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and
that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the
mountains of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saying, They are laid
desolate, they are given us to consume.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against
me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard them.  

<span id="014">14</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth
rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.  

<span id="015">15</span> As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the
house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), because it was desolate, so
will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004), and all
Idumea, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the LORD.
