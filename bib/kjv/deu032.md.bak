### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 32

<span id="001">1</span> Give [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md), O ye heavens,
and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.  

<span id="002">2</span> My doctrine shall drop as the
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md), my speech shall distil as the
[dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008), as the small [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md)
upon the tender [herb](../ebd/ebd174.htm#008.md), and as the showers upon
the [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md):  

<span id="003">3</span> Because I will publish the name of the LORD:
ascribe ye greatness unto our God.  

<span id="004">4</span> He is the [Rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md), his
work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and
without iniquity, just and right is he.  

<span id="005">5</span> They have corrupted themselves, their spot is
not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people
and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made
thee, and established thee?  

<span id="007">7</span> Remember the days of old, consider the years of
many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and
they will tell thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> When the Most High divided to the nations their
inheritance, when he separated the sons of
[Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007.md), he set the bounds of the people according
to the number of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> For the LORD's portion is his people;
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) is the lot of his inheritance.  

<span id="010">10</span> He found him in a
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000.md) land, and in the waste howling
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md); he led him about, he instructed
him, he kept him as the [apple](../ebd/ebd027.htm#004.md) of his eye.  

<span id="011">11</span> As an [eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003.md) stirreth
up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings,
taketh them, beareth them on her wings:  

<span id="012">12</span> So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was
no strange god with him.  

<span id="013">13</span> He made him ride on the high places of the
earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to
suck [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md) out of the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md), and oil out of the flinty
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md);  

<span id="014">14</span> [Butter](../ebd/ebd067.htm#002.md) of
[kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000), and [milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000.md) of
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), with [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) of
lambs, and rams of the breed of [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003.md), and
goats, with the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) of kidneys of
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md); and thou didst
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) the pure [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md)
of the [grape](../ebd/ebd154.htm#004.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> But [Jeshurun](../ebd/ebd205.htm#004.md) waxed
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md), and kicked: thou art waxen
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md), thou art grown thick, thou art covered
with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed
the [Rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md) of his
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> They provoked him to
[jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008.md) with strange gods, with abominations
provoked they him to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to
gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your
fathers feared not.  

<span id="018">18</span> Of the [Rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md) that begat
thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.  

<span id="019">19</span> And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them,
because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.  

<span id="020">20</span> And he said, I will hide my face from them, I
will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md), children in whom is no faith.  

<span id="021">21</span> They have moved me to
[jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008.md) with that which is not God; they have
provoked me to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) with their vanities: and I
will move them to [jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008.md) with those which are
not a people; I will provoke them to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) with
a foolish nation.  

<span id="022">22</span> For a fire is kindled in mine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md), and shall burn unto the lowest
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md), and shall consume the earth with her
increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  

<span id="023">23</span> I will [heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md) mischiefs
upon them; I will spend mine [arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005.md) upon
them.  

<span id="024">24</span> They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured
with burning heat, and with [bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009.md)
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md): I will also send the teeth of
beasts upon them, with the [poison](../ebd/ebd297.htm#009.md) of serpents
of the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> The [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) without, and
terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the
[virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009.md), the suckling also with the man of gray
hairs.  

<span id="026">26</span> I said, I would scatter them into corners, I
would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:  

<span id="027">27</span> Were it not that I feared the wrath of the
enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and
lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all
this.  

<span id="028">28</span> For they are a nation void of counsel, neither
is there any understanding in them.  

<span id="029">29</span> O that they were [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md),
that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!  

<span id="030">30</span> How should one chase a thousand, and two put
ten thousand to flight, except their [Rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md) had
sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?  

<span id="031">31</span> For their [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md) is not
as our [Rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md), even our enemies themselves being
judges.  

<span id="032">32</span> For their [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md) is of
the [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004) of [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004.md), and
of the fields of [Gomorrah](../ebd/ebd152.htm#007.md): their grapes are
grapes of [gall](../ebd/ebd142.htm#000.md), their clusters are
[bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009.md):  

<span id="033">33</span> Their [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) is the
[poison](../ebd/ebd297.htm#009.md) of dragons, and the cruel venom of
asps.  

<span id="034">34</span> Is not this laid up in store with me, and
sealed up among my treasures?  

<span id="035">35</span> To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their
foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand,
and the things that shall come upon them make haste.  

<span id="036">36</span> For the LORD shall
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) his people, and repent himself for his
servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut
up, or left.  

<span id="037">37</span> And he shall say, Where are their gods, their
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md) in whom they trusted,  

<span id="038">38</span> Which did eat the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md)
of their sacrifices, and drank the [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) of
their [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) offerings? let them rise up and
help you, and be your protection.  

<span id="039">39</span> See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no
god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is
there any that can deliver out of my hand.  

<span id="040">40</span> For I lift up my hand to
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and say, I live for ever.  

<span id="041">41</span> If I whet my glittering
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), and mine hand take hold on judgment; I
will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate
me.  

<span id="042">42</span> I will make mine
[arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005) [drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007.md) with
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and my [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md)
shall devour [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md); and that with the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of the slain and of the captives, from
the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.  

<span id="043">43</span> Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he
will avenge the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of his servants, and will
render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land,
and to his people.  

<span id="044">44</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) came and
spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and
[Hoshea](../ebd/ebd183.htm#006.md) the son of
[Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006.md).  

<span id="045">45</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) made an end
of speaking all these words to all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):  

<span id="046">46</span> And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all
the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command
your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.  

<span id="047">47</span> For it is not a vain thing for you; because it
is your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the
land, whither ye go over [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) to possess
it.  

<span id="048">48</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) that selfsame day, saying,  

<span id="049">49</span> Get thee up into this mountain
[Abarim](../ebd/ebd000.htm#006), unto [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Nebo](../ebd/ebd268.htm#004.md), which is in the land of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), that is over against
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md); and behold the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md), which I give unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) for a possession:  

<span id="050">50</span> And die in the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) thy brother died in
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Hor](../ebd/ebd181.htm#008.md), and was
gathered unto his people:  

<span id="051">51</span> Because ye trespassed against me among the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) at the waters of
MeribahKadesh, in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) of
[Zin](../ebd/ebd394.htm#000.md); because ye sanctified me not in the midst
of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="052">52</span> Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but
thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).
