### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> Then came the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), even the whole
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), into the
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000) of [Zin](../ebd/ebd394.htm#000.md) in the
first month: and the people abode in [Kadesh](../ebd/ebd215.htm#003.md);
and [Miriam](../ebd/ebd256.htm#003.md) died there, and was buried there.  

<span id="002">2</span> And there was no water for the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md): and they gathered themselves
together against [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) and against
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And the people chode with
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), and spake, saying, Would God that we had
died when our brethren died before the LORD!  

<span id="004">4</span> And why have ye brought up the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the LORD into this
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), that we and our
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) should die there?  

<span id="005">5</span> And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), to bring us in unto this evil place? it
is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates;
neither is there any water to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) went from the presence of the assembly
unto the door of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), and they fell upon their faces:
and the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the LORD appeared unto them.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="008">8</span> Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly
together, thou, and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) thy brother, and
speak ye unto the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md) before their eyes; and
it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water
out of the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md): so thou shalt give the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) and their beasts
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) took the rod
from before the LORD, as he commanded him.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) gathered the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) together before the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md), and he said unto them, Hear now, ye
rebels; must we fetch you water out of this
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md)?  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) lifted up
his hand, and with his rod he smote the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md)
twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) drank, and their beasts also.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md),
Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), therefore ye shall not bring this
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) into the land which I have given
them.  

<span id="013">13</span> This is the water of
[Meribah](../ebd/ebd249.htm#009.md); because the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) strove with the LORD, and he was
sanctified in them.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) sent
messengers from [Kadesh](../ebd/ebd215.htm#003.md) unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md), Thus
saith thy brother [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), Thou knowest all the
travail that hath befallen us:  

<span id="015">15</span> How our fathers went down into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and we have dwelt in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us,
and our fathers:  

<span id="016">16</span> And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our
voice, and sent an [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md), and hath brought us
forth out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): and, behold, we are in
[Kadesh](../ebd/ebd215.htm#003.md), a city in the uttermost of thy
border:  

<span id="017">17</span> Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country:
we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither
will we [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) of the water of the wells: we
will go by the king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor
to the left, until we have passed thy borders.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md) said unto
him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) said unto him, We will go by the high
way: and if I and my [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md)
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) of thy water, then I will pay for it: I
will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.  

<span id="020">20</span> And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md) came out against him with much people, and
with a strong hand.  

<span id="021">21</span> Thus [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md) refused to
give [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) [passage](../ebd/ebd286.htm#003.md)
through his border: wherefore [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) turned
away from him.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), even the whole
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), journeyed from
[Kadesh](../ebd/ebd215.htm#003.md), and came unto
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Hor](../ebd/ebd181.htm#008.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) in
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Hor](../ebd/ebd181.htm#008.md), by the
coast of the land of [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md), saying,  

<span id="024">24</span> [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) shall be
gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I
have given unto the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), because
ye rebelled against my word at the water of
[Meribah](../ebd/ebd249.htm#009.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> Take [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000.md) his son, and bring them up unto
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Hor](../ebd/ebd181.htm#008.md):  

<span id="026">26</span> And strip [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) of his
garments, and put them upon [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000.md) his son:
and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) shall be gathered unto his people,
and shall die there.  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) did as the
LORD commanded: and they went up into [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Hor](../ebd/ebd181.htm#008.md) in the sight of all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) stripped
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) of his garments, and put them upon
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000.md) his son; and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) died there in the top of the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007): and [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) and
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000.md) came down from the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> And when all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) saw that
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) was dead, they mourned for
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) thirty days, even all the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).
