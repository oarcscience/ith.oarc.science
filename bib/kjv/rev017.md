### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> And there came one of the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) angels which had the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) vials, and talked with me, saying unto
me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore
that sitteth upon many waters:  

<span id="002">2</span> With whom the kings of the earth have committed
[fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008), and the inhabitants of the earth
have been made [drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007) with the
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) of her
[fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008).  

<span id="003">3</span> So he carried me away in the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005): and I saw a woman sit upon a
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005) coloured
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), full of names of
[blasphemy](../ebd/ebd060.htm#005), having
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) heads and ten horns.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the woman was arrayed in purple and
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005) [colour](../ebd/ebd086.htm#008), and
decked with [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) and precious stones and
pearls, having a golden [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) in her hand full of
abominations and filthiness of her
[fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008):  

<span id="005">5</span> And upon her [forehead](../ebd/ebd137.htm#002)
was a name written, [MYSTERY](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006),
[BABYLON](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND
ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I saw the woman drunken with the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the saints, and with the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the martyrs of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006): and when I saw her, I wondered with
great admiration.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) said unto
me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the
[mystery](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006) of the woman, and of the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) that carrieth her, which hath the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) heads and ten horns.  

<span id="008">8</span> The [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) that thou
sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007), and go into perdition: and they that dwell
on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of
life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) that was, and is not, and yet is.  

<span id="009">9</span> And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) heads are [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
mountains, on which the woman sitteth.  

<span id="010">10</span> And there are [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and
when he cometh, he must continue a short space.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) that
was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005), and goeth into perdition.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten
kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings
one hour with the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001).  

<span id="013">13</span> These have one mind, and shall give their power
and strength unto the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001).  

<span id="014">14</span> These shall make war with the
[Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003), and the [Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003)
shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of kings: and they that are with him are
called, and [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008), and
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005).  

<span id="015">15</span> And he saith unto me, The waters which thou
sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and
nations, and tongues.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), these shall hate the whore, and shall
make her desolate and [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003), and shall eat her
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), and burn her with fire.  

<span id="017">17</span> For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his
will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), until the words of God shall be
fulfilled.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the woman which thou sawest is that great
city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.
