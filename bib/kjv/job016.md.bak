### King James Version: Job Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> Then Job answered and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> I have heard many such things: miserable
comforters are ye all.  

<span id="003">3</span> Shall vain words have an end? or what
emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?  

<span id="004">4</span> I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were
in my soul's stead, I could [heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md) up words
against you, and shake mine head at you.  

<span id="005">5</span> But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and
the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.  

<span id="006">6</span> Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and
though I forbear, what am I eased?  

<span id="007">7</span> But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made
desolate all my company.  

<span id="008">8</span> And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is
a [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) against me: and my leanness rising up
in me beareth [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) to my face.  

<span id="009">9</span> He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he
gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon
me.  

<span id="010">10</span> They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they
have smitten me upon the [cheek](../ebd/ebd078.htm#004.md) reproachfully;
they have gathered themselves together against me.  

<span id="011">11</span> God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and
turned me over into the hands of the wicked.  

<span id="012">12</span> I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder:
he hath also taken me by my [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md), and shaken me
to [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md), and set me up for his mark.  

<span id="013">13</span> His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth
my [reins](../ebd/ebd310.htm#001.md) asunder, and doth not spare; he
poureth out my [gall](../ebd/ebd142.htm#000.md) upon the ground.  

<span id="014">14</span> He breaketh me with
[breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005) upon [breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005.md), he
runneth upon me like a giant.  

<span id="015">15</span> I have sewed [sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001.md)
upon my skin, and defiled my [horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003.md) in the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids
is the [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) of death;  

<span id="017">17</span> Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) is pure.  

<span id="018">18</span> O earth, cover not thou my
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), and let my cry have no place.  

<span id="019">19</span> Also now, behold, my
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) is in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md),
and my record is on high.  

<span id="020">20</span> My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out
tears unto God.  

<span id="021">21</span> O that one might plead for a man with God, as a
man pleadeth for his neighbour!  

<span id="022">22</span> When a few years are come, then I shall go the
way whence I shall not return.
