### King James Version: 1 John Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Behold, what manner of love the Father hath
bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore
the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.  

<span id="002">2</span> Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth
not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear,
we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.  

<span id="003">3</span> And every man that hath this hope in him
purifieth himself, even as he is pure.  

<span id="004">4</span> Whosoever committeth
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) transgresseth also the law: for
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) is the transgression of the law.  

<span id="005">5</span> And ye know that he was manifested to take away
our sins; and in him is no [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever
sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.  

<span id="007">7</span> Little children, let no man deceive you: he that
doeth [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) is righteous, even as he is
righteous.  

<span id="008">8</span> He that committeth [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
is of the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md); for the
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md) sinneth from the beginning. For this
purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works
of the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Whosoever is born of God doth not commit
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md); for his seed remaineth in him: and he
cannot [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), because he is born of God.  

<span id="010">10</span> In this the children of God are manifest, and
the children of the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md): whosoever doeth not
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) is not of God, neither he that
loveth not his brother.  

<span id="011">11</span> For this is the message that ye heard from the
beginning, that we should love one another.  

<span id="012">12</span> Not as [Cain](../ebd/ebd068.htm#007.md), who was
of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him?
Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.  

<span id="013">13</span> Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate
you.  

<span id="014">14</span> We know that we have passed from death unto
life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother
abideth in death.  

<span id="015">15</span> Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and
ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.  

<span id="016">16</span> Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he
laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the
brethren.  

<span id="017">17</span> But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his
brother have need, and shutteth up his [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004.md)
of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?  

<span id="018">18</span> My little children, let us not love in word,
neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.  

<span id="019">19</span> And hereby we know that we are of the truth,
and shall assure our hearts before him.  

<span id="020">20</span> For if our heart condemn us, God is greater
than our heart, and knoweth all things.  

<span id="021">21</span> Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have
we confidence toward God.  

<span id="022">22</span> And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him,
because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing
in his sight.  

<span id="023">23</span> And this is his commandment, That we should
believe on the name of his Son [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), and love one another, as he gave us
commandment.  

<span id="024">24</span> And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth
in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) which he hath given us.
