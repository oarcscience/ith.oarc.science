<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> to hear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever:<BR>
