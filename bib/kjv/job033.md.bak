### King James Version: Job Chapter 33

<span id="001">1</span> Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches,
and hearken to all my words.  

<span id="002">2</span> Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue
hath spoken in my mouth.  

<span id="003">3</span> My words shall be of the uprightness of my
heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.  

<span id="004">4</span> The [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of God hath
made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.  

<span id="005">5</span> If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order
before me, stand up.  

<span id="006">6</span> Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's
stead: I also am formed out of the [clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid,
neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I
have heard the voice of thy words, saying,  

<span id="009">9</span> I am [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) without
transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.  

<span id="010">10</span> Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he
counteth me for his enemy,  

<span id="011">11</span> He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh
all my paths.  

<span id="012">12</span> Behold, in this thou art not just: I will
answer thee, that God is greater than man.  

<span id="013">13</span> Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth
not account of any of his matters.  

<span id="014">14</span> For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man
perceiveth it not.  

<span id="015">15</span> In a [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md), in a
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md) of the night, when
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings
upon the bed;  

<span id="016">16</span> Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth
their instruction,  

<span id="017">17</span> That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and
hide pride from man.  

<span id="018">18</span> He keepeth back his soul from the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md), and his life from perishing by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> He is chastened also with pain upon his bed,
and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:  

<span id="020">20</span> So that his life abhorreth
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), and his soul dainty meat.  

<span id="021">21</span> His [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) is consumed
away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick
out.  

<span id="022">22</span> Yea, his soul draweth near unto the
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md), and his life to the destroyers.  

<span id="023">23</span> If there be a
[messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005.md) with him, an interpreter, one among a
thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:  

<span id="024">24</span> Then he is gracious unto him, and saith,
Deliver him from going down to the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md): I have
found a [ransom](../ebd/ebd307.htm#005.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> His [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) shall be
fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:  

<span id="026">26</span> He shall pray unto God, and he will be
favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will
render unto man his [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have
sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;  

<span id="028">28</span> He will deliver his soul from going into the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md), and his life shall see the light.  

<span id="029">29</span> Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes
with man,  

<span id="030">30</span> To bring back his soul from the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md), to be enlightened with the light of the
living.  

<span id="031">31</span> Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy
peace, and I will speak.  

<span id="032">32</span> If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak,
for I desire to justify thee.  

<span id="033">33</span> If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I
shall teach thee wisdom.
