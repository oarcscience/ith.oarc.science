### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass after this, that the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) died, and [Hanun](../ebd/ebd163.htm#004)
his son reigned in his stead.  

<span id="002">2</span> Then said [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), I will
shew kindness unto [Hanun](../ebd/ebd163.htm#004) the son of
[Nahash](../ebd/ebd265.htm#003), as his father shewed kindness unto me.
And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) sent to comfort him by the hand of
his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of
the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002).  

<span id="003">3</span> And the princes of the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) said unto [Hanun](../ebd/ebd163.htm#004)
their lord, Thinkest thou that [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) doth
honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) rather sent his servants unto thee, to
search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?  

<span id="004">4</span> Wherefore [Hanun](../ebd/ebd163.htm#004) took
David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut
off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them
away.  

<span id="005">5</span> When they told it unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), he sent to meet them, because the men
were greatly ashamed: and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said, Tarry
at [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008) until your beards be grown, and then
return.  

<span id="006">6</span> And when the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) saw that they stank before
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob
and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) Maacah a thousand men, and of
[Ishtob](../ebd/ebd190.htm#008) twelve thousand men.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) heard of
it, he sent [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006), and all the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of the mighty men.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) came out, and put the battle in array at
the entering in of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008): and the Syrians of
Zoba, and of [Rehob](../ebd/ebd309.htm#006), and
[Ishtob](../ebd/ebd190.htm#008), and Maacah, were by themselves in the
field.  

<span id="009">9</span> When [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) saw that the
front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all
the choice men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and put them in array
against the Syrians:  

<span id="010">10</span> And the rest of the people he delivered into
the hand of [Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005) his brother, that he might
put them in array against the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002).  

<span id="011">11</span> And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for
me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) be too strong for thee, then I will come
and help thee.  

<span id="012">12</span> Be of good courage, and let us play the men for
our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which
seemeth him good.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) drew nigh,
and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians:
and they fled before him.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled
they also before [Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005), and entered into the
city. So [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) returned from the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002), and came to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="015">15</span> And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten
before [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), they gathered themselves
together.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Hadarezer](../ebd/ebd157.htm#004) sent,
and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to
[Helam](../ebd/ebd171.htm#009); and [Shobach](../ebd/ebd340.htm#002) the
captain of the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of
[Hadarezer](../ebd/ebd157.htm#004) went before them.  

<span id="017">17</span> And when it was told
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), he gathered all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) together, and passed over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), and came to
[Helam](../ebd/ebd171.htm#009). And the Syrians set themselves in array
against [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and fought with him.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the Syrians fled before
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) slew
the men of [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) hundred chariots of the
Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote
[Shobach](../ebd/ebd340.htm#002) the captain of their
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007), who died there.  

<span id="019">19</span> And when all the kings that were servants to
[Hadarezer](../ebd/ebd157.htm#004) saw that they were smitten before
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), they made peace with
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and served them. So the Syrians feared
to help the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) any more.
