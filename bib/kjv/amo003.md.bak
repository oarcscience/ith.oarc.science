### King James Version: Amos Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against
you, O children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), against the whole
family which I brought up from the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> You only have I known of all the families of the
earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.  

<span id="003">3</span> Can two walk together, except they be agreed?  

<span id="004">4</span> Will a lion roar in the
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006.md), when he hath no prey? will a young lion
cry out of his [den](../ebd/ebd101.htm#007.md), if he have taken nothing?  

<span id="005">5</span> Can a [bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000.md) fall in a
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009.md) upon the earth, where no
[gin](../ebd/ebd149.htm#004.md) is for him? shall one take up a
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009.md) from the earth, and have taken nothing at
all?  

<span id="006">6</span> Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the
people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath
not done it?  

<span id="007">7</span> Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he
revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.  

<span id="008">8</span> The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the
Lord GOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy?  

<span id="009">9</span> Publish in the palaces at
[Ashdod](../ebd/ebd033.htm#006.md), and in the palaces in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and say, Assemble yourselves upon the
mountains of [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md), and behold the great
tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof.  

<span id="010">10</span> For they know not to do right, saith the LORD,
who store up violence and [robbery](../ebd/ebd315.htm#000.md) in their
palaces.  

<span id="011">11</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An
[adversary](../ebd/ebd011.htm#001.md) there shall be even round about the
land; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces
shall be spoiled.  

<span id="012">12</span> Thus saith the LORD; As the
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006.md) taketh out of the mouth of the lion
two legs, or a piece of an [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md); so shall the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) be taken out that dwell in
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md) in the corner of a bed, and in
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007) in a [couch](../ebd/ebd091.htm#002.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> Hear ye, and testify in the house of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), saith the Lord GOD, the God of hosts,  

<span id="014">14</span> That in the day that I shall visit the
transgressions of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) upon him I will also
visit the altars of [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md): and the horns of
the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) shall be cut off, and fall to the
ground.  

<span id="015">15</span> And I will smite the winter house with the
summer house; and the houses of [ivory](../ebd/ebd192.htm#000.md) shall
perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith the LORD.
