### King James Version: Judges Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> Then [Jerubbaal](../ebd/ebd204.htm#002.md), who is
[Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md), and all the people that were with him,
rose up early, and pitched beside the well of
[Harod](../ebd/ebd164.htm#008.md): so that the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of the Midianites were on the north side
of them, by the hill of [Moreh](../ebd/ebd259.htm#006.md), in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the LORD said unto
[Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md), The people that are with thee are too
many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) vaunt themselves against me, saying,
Mine own hand hath saved me.  

<span id="003">3</span> Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the
people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and
depart early from [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md). And there returned of the people twenty
and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the LORD said unto
[Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md), The people are yet too many; bring them
down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall
be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same
shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go
with thee, the same shall not go.  

<span id="005">5</span> So he brought down the people unto the water:
and the LORD said unto [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md), Every one that
lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou
set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And the number of them that lapped, putting
their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of
the people bowed down upon their knees to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md)
water.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the LORD said unto
[Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md), By the three hundred men that lapped
will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all
the other people go every man unto his place.  

<span id="008">8</span> So the people took victuals in their hand, and
their [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md): and he sent all the rest of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) every man unto his
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md), and retained those three hundred men: and
the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of [Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md) was
beneath him in the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And it came to pass the same night, that the
LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md); for I have delivered it into thine
hand.  

<span id="010">10</span> But if thou fear to go down, go thou with
Phurah thy servant down to the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md):  

<span id="011">11</span> And thou shalt hear what they say; and
afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md). Then went he down with Phurah his servant
unto the outside of the armed men that were in the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all
the children of the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) lay along in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) like grasshoppers for multitude; and
their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for
multitude.  

<span id="013">13</span> And when [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) was
come, behold, there was a man that told a [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md)
unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005), and, lo, a [cake](../ebd/ebd068.htm#009.md)
of [barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003) [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md)
tumbled into the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of
[Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md), and came unto a
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md), and smote it that it fell, and overturned
it, that the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) lay along.  

<span id="014">14</span> And his fellow answered and said, This is
nothing else save the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) of
[Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) the son of
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000.md), a man of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): for into his hand hath God delivered
[Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md), and all the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And it was so, when
[Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) heard the telling of the
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md), and the interpretation thereof, that he
worshipped, and returned into the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and said, Arise; for the LORD hath
delivered into your hand the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of
[Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And he divided the three hundred men into three
companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty
pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he said unto them, Look on me, and do
likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md), it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye
do.  

<span id="018">18</span> When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are
with me, then blow ye the [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md) also on
every side of all the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md), and say, The
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) of the LORD, and of
[Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> So [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md), and the
hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md) in the beginning of the middle watch; and
they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md), and brake the pitchers that were in
their hands.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the three companies blew the
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md), and brake the pitchers, and held the
lamps in their left hands, and the [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md) in
their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) of the LORD, and of
[Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And they stood every man in his place round
about the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md); and all the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) ran, and cried, and fled.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the three hundred blew the
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md), and the LORD set every man's
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) against his fellow, even throughout all
the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007): and the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md)
fled to Bethshittah in [Zererath](../ebd/ebd391.htm#005.md), and to the
border of Abelmeholah, unto [Tabbath](../ebd/ebd355.htm#008.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
gathered themselves together out of [Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006.md),
and out of [Asher](../ebd/ebd033.htm#008.md), and out of all
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md), and pursued after the Midianites.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) sent
messengers throughout all [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), saying, come down against the
Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md). Then all the men of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) gathered themselves together, and took
the waters unto Bethbarah and [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> And they took two princes of the Midianites,
[Oreb](../ebd/ebd280.htm#001) and [Zeeb](../ebd/ebd389.htm#009.md); and
they slew [Oreb](../ebd/ebd280.htm#001.md) upon the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) [Oreb](../ebd/ebd280.htm#001.md), and
[Zeeb](../ebd/ebd389.htm#009.md) they slew at the winepress of
[Zeeb](../ebd/ebd389.htm#009.md), and pursued
[Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007.md), and brought the heads of
[Oreb](../ebd/ebd280.htm#001) and [Zeeb](../ebd/ebd389.htm#009.md) to
[Gideon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#003.md) on the other side
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md).
