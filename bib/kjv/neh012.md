[ward](../ebd/ebd379.htm#001) over against

<span id="026">26</span> These were in the days of

[Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), the
scribe.  

<span id="027">27</span> And at the dedication of the wall of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) they sought the Levites out of all
their places, to bring them to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), to
keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with
singing, with [cymbals](../ebd/ebd095.htm#001), psalteries, and with
harps.  

<span id="028">28</span> And the sons of the singers gathered themselves
together, both out of the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) country round
about [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and from the
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003) of Netophathi;  

<span id="029">29</span> Also from the house of
[Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001), and out of the fields of
[Geba](../ebd/ebd144.htm#004) and [Azmaveth](../ebd/ebd038.htm#000): for
the singers had builded them [villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003) round
about [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="030">30</span> And the priests and the Levites purified
themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.  

<span id="031">31</span> Then I brought up the princes of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) upon the wall, and appointed two great
companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right hand
upon the wall toward the [dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003)
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008):  

<span id="032">32</span> And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the
princes of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007),  

<span id="033">33</span> And [Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005),

<span id="034">34</span> [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008), and
[Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005), and
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006),  

<span id="035">35</span> And certain of the priests' sons with
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001); namely,
[Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006) the son of
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000), the son of
[Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005), the son of
[Mattaniah](../ebd/ebd243.htm#009), the son of
[Michaiah](../ebd/ebd253.htm#000), the son of
[Zaccur](../ebd/ebd386.htm#004), the son of
[Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002):  

<span id="036">36</span> And his brethren,
[Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005), and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai,
[Nethaneel](../ebd/ebd271.htm#003), and [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007),
[Hanani](../ebd/ebd162.htm#003), with the musical instruments of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) the man of God, and
[Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006) the scribe before them.  

<span id="037">37</span> And at the [fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000)
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), which was over against them, they went up
by the stairs of the city of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), at the
going up of the wall, above the house of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004),
even unto the water [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) eastward.  

<span id="038">38</span> And the other company of them that gave thanks
went over against them, and I after them, and the half of the people
upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad
wall;  

<span id="039">39</span> And from above the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000), and
above the old [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), and above the
[fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005) [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), and the
tower of [Hananeel](../ebd/ebd162.htm#002), and the tower of
[Meah](../ebd/ebd245.htm#001), even unto the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008): and they
stood still in the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006)
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008).  

<span id="040">40</span> So stood the two companies of them that gave
thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:  

<span id="041">41</span> And the priests;
[Eliakim](../ebd/ebd116.htm#000), [Maaseiah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#007),
Miniamin, [Michaiah](../ebd/ebd253.htm#000),
[Elioenai](../ebd/ebd117.htm#003), [Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006),
and [Hananiah](../ebd/ebd162.htm#004), with
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001);  

<span id="042">42</span> And [Maaseiah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#007), and
[Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005), and [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000),
and [Uzzi](../ebd/ebd376.htm#003), and
[Jehohanan](../ebd/ebd200.htm#008), and Malchijah, and
[Elam](../ebd/ebd114.htm#003), and [Ezer](../ebd/ebd129.htm#004). And
the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.  

<span id="043">43</span> Also that day they offered great sacrifices,
and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives
also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) was heard even afar off.  

<span id="044">44</span> And at that time were some appointed over the
chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and
for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the
portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) rejoiced for the priests and for the
Levites that waited.  

<span id="045">45</span> And both the singers and the porters kept the
[ward](../ebd/ebd379.htm#001) of their God, and the
[ward](../ebd/ebd379.htm#001) of the
[purification](../ebd/ebd302.htm#007), according to the commandment of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and of [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007)
his son.  

<span id="046">46</span> For in the days of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) and [Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002) of old
there were chief of the singers, and [songs](../ebd/ebd348.htm#002) of
praise and thanksgiving unto God.  

<span id="047">47</span> And all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in the
days of [Zerubbabel](../ebd/ebd391.htm#008), and in the days of
[Nehemiah](../ebd/ebd269.htm#007), gave the portions of the singers and
the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto
the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001).
