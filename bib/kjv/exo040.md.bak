### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 40

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> On the first day of the first month shalt thou
set up the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And thou shalt put therein the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md),
and cover the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) with the vail.  

<span id="004">4</span> And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in
order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt
bring in the [candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md), and light the lamps
thereof.  

<span id="005">5</span> And thou shalt set the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) for the
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) before the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md)
of the [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md), and put the
[hanging](../ebd/ebd163.htm#001.md) of the door to the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And thou shalt set the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) of the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) before the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md)
of the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And thou shalt set the
[laver](../ebd/ebd224.htm#009) between the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md)
of the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) and the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), and shalt put water therein.  

<span id="008">8</span> And thou shalt set up the court round about, and
hang up the [hanging](../ebd/ebd163.htm#001.md) at the court
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and
[anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008) the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md),
and all that is therein, and shalt [hallow](../ebd/ebd160.htm#001.md) it,
and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.  

<span id="010">10</span> And thou shalt [anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008.md)
the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) of the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and all his vessels, and sanctify the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md): and it shall be an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) most holy.  

<span id="011">11</span> And thou shalt [anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008.md)
the [laver](../ebd/ebd224.htm#009.md) and his foot, and sanctify it.  

<span id="012">12</span> And thou shalt bring
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and his sons unto the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), and wash them with water.  

<span id="013">13</span> And thou shalt put upon
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) the holy garments, and
[anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008.md) him, and sanctify him; that he may
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) unto me in the priest's office.  

<span id="014">14</span> And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them
with coats:  

<span id="015">15</span> And thou shalt [anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008.md)
them, as thou didst [anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008.md) their father, that
they may [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) unto me in the priest's
office: for their anointing shall surely be an
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) priesthood throughout their
generations.  

<span id="016">16</span> Thus did [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md):
according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.  

<span id="017">17</span> And it came to pass in the first month in the
second year, on the first day of the month, that the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) was reared up.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) reared up
the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), and fastened his sockets, and
set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up
his pillars.  

<span id="019">19</span> And he spread abroad the
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) over the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), and put the covering of the
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) above upon it; as the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And he took and put the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md) into the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md), and set the staves on the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000), and put the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md)
seat above upon the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md):  

<span id="021">21</span> And he brought the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md)
into the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), and set up the vail of the
covering, and covered the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md); as the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And he put the table in the
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), upon the side of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) [northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002.md),
without the vail.  

<span id="023">23</span> And he set the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md)
in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And he put the
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md) in the
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), over against the table, on the
side of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) southward.  

<span id="025">25</span> And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as
the LORD commanded [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And he put the golden
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) in the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) of
the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) before the vail:  

<span id="027">27</span> And he burnt sweet
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) thereon; as the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> And he set up the
[hanging](../ebd/ebd163.htm#001.md) at the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> And he put the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md)
of burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) by the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md)
of the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), and offered upon it the
burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) and the meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md); as the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> And he set the [laver](../ebd/ebd224.htm#009.md)
between the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) and the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), and put water there, to wash withal.  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) and his sons washed their hands and their
feet thereat:  

<span id="032">32</span> When they went into the
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), and when they came near unto the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), they washed; as the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> And he reared up the court round about the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) and the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), and set up the
[hanging](../ebd/ebd163.htm#001.md) of the court
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008). So [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md)
finished the work.  

<span id="034">34</span> Then a [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md) covered
the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), and the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the LORD filled the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md).  

<span id="035">35</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) was not able
to enter into the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), because the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md) abode thereon, and the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the LORD filled the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md).  

<span id="036">36</span> And when the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md) was
taken up from over the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), the children
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) went onward in all their journeys:  

<span id="037">37</span> But if the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md) were
not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken
up.  

<span id="038">38</span> For the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md) of the
LORD was upon the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) by day, and fire
was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), throughout all their journeys.
