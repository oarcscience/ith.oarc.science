### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> Now in the eighteenth year of
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) began
[Abijah](../ebd/ebd003.htm#006.md) to reign over
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> He reigned three years in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md). His mother's name also was
[Michaiah](../ebd/ebd253.htm#000.md) the daughter of
[Uriel](../ebd/ebd375.htm#003) of [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008.md). And
there was war between [Abijah](../ebd/ebd003.htm#006.md) and
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Abijah](../ebd/ebd003.htm#006.md) set the
battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred
thousand [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) men:
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) also set the battle in array against
him with eight hundred thousand [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) men,
being mighty men of valour.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Abijah](../ebd/ebd003.htm#006.md) stood up
upon [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Zemaraim](../ebd/ebd390.htm#004.md),
which is in [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), and said, Hear me, thou
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md), and all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md);  

<span id="005">5</span> Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) gave the kingdom over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) for
ever, even to him and to his sons by a [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md)
of [salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008.md)?  

<span id="006">6</span> Yet [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) the son of
[Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003.md), the servant of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) the son of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), is risen up, and hath rebelled against
his lord.  

<span id="007">7</span> And there are gathered unto him vain men, the
children of [Belial](../ebd/ebd051.htm#007.md), and have strengthened
themselves against [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md) the son of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007), when [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007.md)
was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.  

<span id="008">8</span> And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the
LORD in the hand of the sons of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md); and ye
be a great multitude, and there are with your golden calves, which
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) made you for gods.  

<span id="009">9</span> Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD,
the sons of [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and the Levites, and have
made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that
whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
rams, the same may be a [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) of them that are
no gods.  

<span id="010">10</span> But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have
not forsaken him; and the priests, which
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) unto the LORD, are the sons of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and the Levites wait upon their
business:  

<span id="011">11</span> And they burn unto the LORD every morning and
every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002): the [shewbread](../ebd/ebd336.htm#008.md)
also set they in order upon the pure table; and the
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md)
with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of
the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.  

<span id="012">12</span> And, behold, God himself is with us for our
captain, and his priests with sounding [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md)
to cry [alarm](../ebd/ebd016.htm#007.md) against you. O children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), fight ye not against the LORD God of
your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.  

<span id="013">13</span> But [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) caused an
ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and the ambushment was behind them.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) looked
back, behold, the battle was before and behind: and they cried unto the
LORD, and the priests sounded with the
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> Then the men of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)
gave a shout: and as the men of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) shouted,
it came to pass, that God smote [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) and
all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) before
[Abijah](../ebd/ebd003.htm#006) and [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) fled before
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md): and God delivered them into their
hand.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Abijah](../ebd/ebd003.htm#006.md) and his
people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) five hundred thousand
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) men.  

<span id="018">18</span> Thus the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) were brought under at that time, and the
children of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) prevailed, because they
relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Abijah](../ebd/ebd003.htm#006.md) pursued
after [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md), and took cities from him,
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md) with the towns thereof, and
[Jeshanah](../ebd/ebd204.htm#008.md) with the towns thereof, and
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) with the towns thereof.  

<span id="020">20</span> Neither did [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md)
recover strength again in the days of [Abijah](../ebd/ebd003.htm#006.md):
and the LORD struck him, and he died.  

<span id="021">21</span> But [Abijah](../ebd/ebd003.htm#006.md) waxed
mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and
sixteen daughters.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the rest of the acts of
[Abijah](../ebd/ebd003.htm#006.md), and his ways, and his sayings, are
written in the story of the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md)
[Iddo](../ebd/ebd186.htm#005.md).
