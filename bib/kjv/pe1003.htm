<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Peter Chapter 3</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd089.htm#001">conversation</A> of the wives;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;While they behold your chaste <A HREF="../ebd/ebd089.htm#001">conversation</A> coupled with fear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, or of putting on of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, which is in the sight of God of great price.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Even as Sara obeyed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">calling</A> him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> of life; that your prayers be not hindered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Let him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#006">eschew</A> evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd246.htm#003">meekness</A> and fear:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Having a good <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</A>; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good <A HREF="../ebd/ebd089.htm#001">conversation</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, but quickened by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</A>, while the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, but the answer of a good <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</A> toward God,) by the resurrection of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Who is gone into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.<BR>
