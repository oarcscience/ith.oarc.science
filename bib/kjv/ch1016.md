### King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> So they brought the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md)
of God, and set it in the midst of the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md)
that [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) had pitched for it: and they offered
burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.  

<span id="002">2</span> And when [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) had made
an end of [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) the burnt offerings and the
peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he dealt to every one of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), both man and woman, to every one a loaf
of [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), and a good piece of
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), and a [flagon](../ebd/ebd135.htm#002.md) of
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And he appointed certain of the Levites to
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) before the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD, and to record, and to thank
and praise the LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):  

<span id="005">5</span> [Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002.md) the chief, and
next to him [Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006.md),
[Jeiel](../ebd/ebd203.htm#000.md), and
[Shemiramoth](../ebd/ebd334.htm#009.md), and
[Jehiel](../ebd/ebd200.htm#003.md), and
[Mattithiah](../ebd/ebd244.htm#006), and [Eliab](../ebd/ebd115.htm#008.md),
and [Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003.md), and Obededom: and
[Jeiel](../ebd/ebd203.htm#000.md) with psalteries and with harps; but
[Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002.md) made a sound with
[cymbals](../ebd/ebd095.htm#001.md);  

<span id="006">6</span> [Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003.md) also and
[Jahaziel](../ebd/ebd195.htm#006.md) the priests with
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md) continually before the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of
God.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then on that day [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
delivered first this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of
[Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002.md) and his brethren.  

<span id="008">8</span> Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name,
make known his deeds among the people.  

<span id="009">9</span> Sing unto him, sing
[psalms](../ebd/ebd301.htm#005.md) unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous
works.  

<span id="010">10</span> [Glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) ye in his holy
name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.  

<span id="011">11</span> Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face
continually.  

<span id="012">12</span> Remember his marvellous works that he hath
done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;  

<span id="013">13</span> O ye seed of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
his servant, ye children of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), his
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) ones.  

<span id="014">14</span> He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in
all the earth.  

<span id="015">15</span> Be ye mindful always of his
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md); the word which he commanded to a
thousand generations;  

<span id="016">16</span> Even of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md)
which he made with [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), and of his
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) unto [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md);  

<span id="017">17</span> And hath confirmed the same to
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) for a law, and to
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) for an
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md)
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md),  

<span id="018">18</span> Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md), the lot of your inheritance;  

<span id="019">19</span> When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers
in it.  

<span id="020">20</span> And when they went from nation to nation, and
from one kingdom to another people;  

<span id="021">21</span> He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he
reproved kings for their sakes,  

<span id="022">22</span> Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my
prophets no harm.  

<span id="023">23</span> Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth
from day to day his [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> Declare his [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md)
among the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md); his marvellous works among
all nations.  

<span id="025">25</span> For great is the LORD, and greatly to be
praised: he also is to be feared above all gods.  

<span id="026">26</span> For all the gods of the people are idols: but
the LORD made the heavens.  

<span id="027">27</span> [Glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) and honour are
in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place.  

<span id="028">28</span> Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people,
give unto the LORD [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) and strength.  

<span id="029">29</span> Give unto the LORD the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) due unto his name: bring an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and come before him:
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) the LORD in the beauty of
[holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> Fear before him, all the earth: the world also
shall be stable, that it be not moved.  

<span id="031">31</span> Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth
rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.  

<span id="032">32</span> Let the sea roar, and the
[fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007.md) thereof: let the fields rejoice, and
all that is therein.  

<span id="033">33</span> Then shall the trees of the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) sing out at the presence of the LORD,
because he cometh to [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) the earth.  

<span id="034">34</span> O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good;
for his [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) endureth for ever.  

<span id="035">35</span> And say ye, Save us, O God of our
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md), and gather us together, and deliver
us from the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), that we may give thanks to
thy holy name, and [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) in thy praise.  

<span id="036">36</span> Blessed be the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) for ever and ever. And all the people
said, [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md), and praised the LORD.  

<span id="037">37</span> So he left there before the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of
the LORD [Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002.md) and his brethren, to
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) before the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) continually, as every day's work
required:  

<span id="038">38</span> And Obededom with their brethren, threescore
and eight; Obededom also the son of [Jeduthun](../ebd/ebd199.htm#009.md)
and [Hosah](../ebd/ebd183.htm#005.md) to be porters:  

<span id="039">39</span> And [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008.md) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), and his brethren the priests, before
the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the LORD in the high place
that was at [Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002.md),  

<span id="040">40</span> To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) of the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) continually morning and evening, and
to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he
commanded [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md);  

<span id="041">41</span> And with them [Heman](../ebd/ebd173.htm#009.md)
and [Jeduthun](../ebd/ebd199.htm#009.md), and the rest that were
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md), who were expressed by name, to give
thanks to the LORD, because his [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) endureth
for ever;  

<span id="042">42</span> And with them [Heman](../ebd/ebd173.htm#009.md)
and [Jeduthun](../ebd/ebd199.htm#009.md) with
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001) and [cymbals](../ebd/ebd095.htm#001.md)
for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God.
And the sons of [Jeduthun](../ebd/ebd199.htm#009.md) were porters.  

<span id="043">43</span> And all the people departed every man to his
house: and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) returned to
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) his house.
