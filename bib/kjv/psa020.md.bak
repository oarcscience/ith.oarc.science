### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the
name of the God of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) defend thee;  

<span id="002">2</span> Send thee help from the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md), and strengthen thee out of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md);  

<span id="003">3</span> Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002); [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Grant thee according to thine own heart, and
fulfil all thy counsel.  

<span id="005">5</span> We will rejoice in thy
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md), and in the name of our God we will
set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.  

<span id="006">6</span> Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he
will hear him from his holy [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) with the
saving strength of his right hand.  

<span id="007">7</span> Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but
we will remember the name of the LORD our God.  

<span id="008">8</span> They are brought down and fallen: but we are
risen, and stand upright.  

<span id="009">9</span> Save, LORD: let the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) hear us when we call.
