### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass after this, that
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008) prepared him chariots and horses, and
fifty men to run before him.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008) rose up
early, and stood beside the way of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008):
and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) for judgment, then
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008) called unto him, and said, Of what city
art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008) said unto
him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) to hear thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008) said moreover,
Oh that I were made [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) in the land, that
every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would
do him [justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007)!  

<span id="005">5</span> And it was so, that when any man came nigh to
him to do him [obeisance](../ebd/ebd276.htm#006), he put forth his hand,
and took him, and kissed him.  

<span id="006">6</span> And on this manner did
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008) to all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
that came to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) for judgment: so
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008) stole the hearts of the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="007">7</span> And it came to pass after forty years, that
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008) said unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow,
which I have vowed unto the LORD, in [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004).  

<span id="008">8</span> For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at
[Geshur](../ebd/ebd147.htm#001) in [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002),
saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), then I will serve the LORD.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said unto
him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004).  

<span id="010">10</span> But [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008) sent
[spies](../ebd/ebd349.htm#007) throughout all the tribes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of
the trumpet, then ye shall say, [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008)
reigneth in [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004).  

<span id="011">11</span> And with [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008) went
two hundred men out of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), that were
called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any
thing.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008) sent for
[Ahithophel](../ebd/ebd015.htm#000) the Gilonite, David's
[counsellor](../ebd/ebd091.htm#005), from his city, even from
[Giloh](../ebd/ebd149.htm#002), while he offered sacrifices. And the
conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008).  

<span id="013">13</span> And there came a
[messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005) to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004),
saying, The hearts of the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) are
after [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008).  

<span id="014">14</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said unto
all his servants that were with him at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), Arise, and let us flee; for we shall
not else escape from [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008): make speed to
depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite
the city with the edge of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="015">15</span> And the king's servants said unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), Behold, thy servants are ready to do
whatsoever my lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) shall appoint.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) went
forth, and all his household after him. And the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) left ten women, which were concubines, to
keep the house.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) went
forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far
off.  

<span id="018">18</span> And all his servants passed on beside him; and
all the Cherethites, and all the [Pelethites](../ebd/ebd289.htm#000),
and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009), passed on before the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="019">19</span> Then said the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) to
[Ittai](../ebd/ebd191.htm#007) the [Gittite](../ebd/ebd149.htm#009),
Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001): for thou art a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), and also an
[exile](../ebd/ebd128.htm#004).  

<span id="020">20</span> Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I
this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may,
return thou, and take back thy brethren: [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005)
and truth be with thee.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Ittai](../ebd/ebd191.htm#007) answered the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my
lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) liveth, surely in what place my
lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) shall be, whether in death or
life, even there also will thy servant be.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said to
[Ittai](../ebd/ebd191.htm#007), Go and pass over. And
[Ittai](../ebd/ebd191.htm#007) the [Gittite](../ebd/ebd149.htm#009)
passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with
him.  

<span id="023">23</span> And all the country wept with a loud voice, and
all the people passed over: the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) also
himself passed over the [brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006)
[Kidron](../ebd/ebd218.htm#008), and all the people passed over, toward
the way of the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005).  

<span id="024">24</span> And lo [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008) also, and
all the Levites were with him, bearing the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000)
of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of God: and they set down the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of God; and
[Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005) went up, until all the people had done
passing out of the city.  

<span id="025">25</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said unto
[Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008), Carry back the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of God into the city: if I shall find
favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me both
it, and his [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007):  

<span id="026">26</span> But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee;
behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.  

<span id="027">27</span> The [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said also
unto [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),
Art not thou a [seer](../ebd/ebd326.htm#000)? return into the city in
peace, and your two sons with you, [Ahimaaz](../ebd/ebd014.htm#002) thy
son, and [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) the son of
[Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005).  

<span id="028">28</span> See, I will tarry in the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) of the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), until there come word from you to
certify me.  

<span id="029">29</span> [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008) therefore and
[Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005) carried the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of God again to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): and they tarried there.  

<span id="030">30</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) went up by
the ascent of [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) Olivet, and wept as he went
up, and had his head covered, and he went
[barefoot](../ebd/ebd044.htm#008): and all the people that was with him
covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.  

<span id="031">31</span> And one told [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004),
saying, [Ahithophel](../ebd/ebd015.htm#000) is among the conspirators
with [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008). And
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the
counsel of [Ahithophel](../ebd/ebd015.htm#000) into foolishness.  

<span id="032">32</span> And it came to pass, that when
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) was come to the top of the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007), where he worshipped God, behold,
[Hushai](../ebd/ebd185.htm#003) the [Archite](../ebd/ebd029.htm#006)
came to meet him with his [coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004)
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007), and earth upon his head:  

<span id="033">33</span> Unto whom [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said,
If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) unto me:  

<span id="034">34</span> But if thou return to the city, and say unto
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008), I will be thy servant, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001); as I have been thy father's servant
hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me
defeat the counsel of [Ahithophel](../ebd/ebd015.htm#000).  

<span id="035">35</span> And hast thou not there with thee
[Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008) and [Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005) the
priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear
out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to
[Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008) and [Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005) the
priests.  

<span id="036">36</span> Behold, they have there with them their two
sons, [Ahimaaz](../ebd/ebd014.htm#002) Zadok's son, and
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall
send unto me every thing that ye can hear.  

<span id="037">37</span> So [Hushai](../ebd/ebd185.htm#003) David's
friend came into the city, and [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008) came
into [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).
