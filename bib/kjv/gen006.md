### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, when men began to multiply
on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,  

<span id="002">2</span> That the sons of God saw the daughters of men
that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the LORD said, My
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) shall not always strive with man, for
that he also is [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md): yet his days shall be an
hundred and twenty years.  

<span id="004">4</span> There were [giants](../ebd/ebd147.htm#006.md) in
the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came
in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same
became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.  

<span id="005">5</span> And God saw that the wickedness of man was great
in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart
was only evil continually.  

<span id="006">6</span> And it repented the LORD that he had made man on
the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I
have created from the face of the earth; both man, and
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md), and the creeping thing, and the fowls of
the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.  

<span id="008">8</span> But [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002.md) found
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) in the eyes of the LORD.  

<span id="009">9</span> These are the generations of
[Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002): [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002.md) was a just
man and perfect in his generations, and [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002.md)
walked with God.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002.md) begat three
sons, [Shem](../ebd/ebd334.htm#002), [Ham](../ebd/ebd160.htm#003.md), and
[Japheth](../ebd/ebd197.htm#002.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> The earth also was corrupt before God, and the
earth was filled with violence.  

<span id="012">12</span> And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it
was corrupt; for all [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) had corrupted his
way upon the earth.  

<span id="013">13</span> And God said unto
[Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002.md), The end of all
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) is come before me; for the earth is
filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with
the earth.  

<span id="014">14</span> Make thee an [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of
[gopher](../ebd/ebd153.htm#001) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md); rooms
shalt thou make in the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md), and shalt
[pitch](../ebd/ebd296.htm#008.md) it within and without with
[pitch](../ebd/ebd296.htm#008.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And this is the fashion which thou shalt make
it of: The length of the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) shall be three
hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it
thirty cubits.  

<span id="016">16</span> A window shalt thou make to the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000), and in a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md)
shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) shalt thou set in the side thereof; with
lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.  

<span id="017">17</span> And, behold, I, even I, do bring a
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000.md) of waters upon the earth, to destroy all
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), wherein is the breath of life, from
under [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md); and every thing that is in the
earth shall die.  

<span id="018">18</span> But with thee will I establish my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md); and thou shalt come into the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md), thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy
sons' wives with thee.  

<span id="019">19</span> And of every living thing of all
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), two of every sort shalt thou bring into
the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md), to keep them alive with thee; they
shall be male and female.  

<span id="020">20</span> Of fowls after their kind, and of
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) after their kind, of every creeping
thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto
thee, to keep them alive.  

<span id="021">21</span> And take thou unto thee of all food that is
eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for
thee, and for them.  

<span id="022">22</span> Thus did [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002.md);
according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
