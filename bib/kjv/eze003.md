### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that
thou findest; eat this [roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004.md), and go speak unto
the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat
that [roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000.md) to eat, and fill thy
[bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004) with this [roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004.md)
that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md) for sweetness.  

<span id="004">4</span> And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee
unto the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and speak with my
words unto them.  

<span id="005">5</span> For thou art not sent to a people of a strange
speech and of an hard language, but to the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md);  

<span id="006">6</span> Not to many people of a strange speech and of an
hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent
thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.  

<span id="007">7</span> But the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all
the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) are impudent and
hardhearted.  

<span id="008">8</span> Behold, I have made thy face strong against
their faces, and thy [forehead](../ebd/ebd137.htm#002.md) strong against
their foreheads.  

<span id="009">9</span> As an [adamant](../ebd/ebd008.htm#001.md) harder
than [flint](../ebd/ebd135.htm#009.md) have I made thy
[forehead](../ebd/ebd137.htm#002.md): fear them not, neither be dismayed at
their looks, though they be a rebellious house.  

<span id="010">10</span> Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my
words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with
thine ears.  

<span id="011">11</span> And go, get thee to them of the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md), unto the children of thy people, and
speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they
will hear, or whether they will forbear.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) took
me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed
be the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the LORD from his place.  

<span id="013">13</span> I heard also the noise of the wings of the
living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels
over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.  

<span id="014">14</span> So the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) lifted
me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md); but the hand of the LORD was strong
upon me.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then I came to them of the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md) at Telabib, that dwelt by the river
of [Chebar](../ebd/ebd078.htm#002.md), and I sat where they sat, and
remained there astonished among them [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
days.  

<span id="016">16</span> And it came to pass at the end of
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days, that the word of the LORD came unto
me, saying,  

<span id="017">17</span> Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto
the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): therefore hear the word at
my mouth, and give them warning from me.  

<span id="018">18</span> When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely
die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked
from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in
his iniquity; but his [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) will I require at
thine hand.  

<span id="019">19</span> Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not
from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his
iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.  

<span id="020">20</span> Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), and commit iniquity, and I lay a
stumbling-block before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given
him warning, he shall die in his [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), and his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) which he hath done shall not be
remembered; but his [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) will I require at
thine hand.  

<span id="021">21</span> Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man,
that the righteous [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) not, and he doth not
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), he shall surely live, because he is
warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and
he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md), and I will there talk with thee.  

<span id="023">23</span> Then I arose, and went forth into the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md): and, behold, the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the LORD stood there, as the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) which I saw by the river of
[Chebar](../ebd/ebd078.htm#002.md): and I fell on my face.  

<span id="024">24</span> Then the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md)
entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said
unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.  

<span id="025">25</span> But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003.md) upon thee, and shall bind thee with them,
and thou shalt not go out among them:  

<span id="026">26</span> And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof
of thy mouth, that thou shalt be [dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002.md), and
shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.  

<span id="027">27</span> But when I speak with thee, I will open thy
mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that
heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they
are a rebellious house.
