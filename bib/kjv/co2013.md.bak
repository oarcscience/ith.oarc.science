### King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> This is the third time I am coming to you. In
the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.  

<span id="002">2</span> I told you before, and foretell you, as if I
were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them
which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I
will not spare:  

<span id="003">3</span> Since ye seek a proof of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) speaking in me, which to you-ward is not
weak, but is mighty in you.  

<span id="004">4</span> For though he was crucified through weakness,
yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we
shall live with him by the power of God toward you.  

<span id="005">5</span> Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith;
prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) is in
you, except ye be reprobates?  

<span id="006">6</span> But I trust that ye shall know that we are not
reprobates.  

<span id="007">7</span> Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that
we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest,
though we be as reprobates.  

<span id="008">8</span> For we can do nothing against the truth, but for
the truth.  

<span id="009">9</span> For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are
strong: and this also we wish, even your
[perfection](../ebd/ebd290.htm#001.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> Therefore I write these things being absent,
lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which
the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of
good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and
peace shall be with you.  

<span id="012">12</span> Greet one another with an holy
[kiss](../ebd/ebd221.htm#000.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> All the saints salute you.  

<span id="014">14</span> The [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), and the
love of God, and the [communion](../ebd/ebd087.htm#004.md) of the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md), be with you all.
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).
