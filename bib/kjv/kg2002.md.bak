### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) into [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) by
a whirlwind, that [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md) went with
[Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009) from [Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md) said unto
[Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md), Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD
hath sent me to [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md). And
[Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) said unto him, As the LORD liveth, and
as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And the sons of the prophets that were at
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md) came forth to
[Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md), and said unto him, Knowest thou that
the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said,
Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md) said unto
him, [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md), tarry here, I pray thee; for the
LORD hath sent me to [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md). And he said, As
the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they
came to [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the sons of the prophets that were at
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md) came to
[Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md), and said unto him, Knowest thou that
the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he
answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md) said unto
him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md). And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as
thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.  

<span id="007">7</span> And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went,
and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md) took his
[mantle](../ebd/ebd240.htm#009.md), and wrapped it together, and smote the
waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went
over on dry ground.  

<span id="009">9</span> And it came to pass, when they were gone over,
that [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md) said unto
[Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md), Ask what I shall do for thee, before I
be taken away from thee. And [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) said, I
pray thee, let a double portion of thy [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md)
be upon me.  

<span id="010">10</span> And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing:
nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so
unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it came to pass, as they still went on, and
talked, that, behold, there appeared a [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md)
of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md) went up by a whirlwind into
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) saw it, and
he cried, My father, my father, the [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and the horsemen thereof. And he saw
him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) them in two
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> He took up also the
[mantle](../ebd/ebd240.htm#009) of [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md) that
fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md);  

<span id="014">14</span> And he took the [mantle](../ebd/ebd240.htm#009.md)
of [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md) that fell from him, and smote the
waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md)? and when he also had smitten the
waters, they parted hither and thither: and
[Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) went over.  

<span id="015">15</span> And when the sons of the prophets which were to
view at [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md) saw him, they said, The
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md) doth
rest on [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md). And they came to meet him, and
bowed themselves to the ground before him.  

<span id="016">16</span> And they said unto him, Behold now, there be
with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek
thy master: lest peradventure the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the
LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md). And he said, Ye shall not send.  

<span id="017">17</span> And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he
said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days,
but found him not.  

<span id="018">18</span> And when they came again to him, (for he
tarried at [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008),.md) he said unto them, Did I
not say unto you, Go not?  

<span id="019">19</span> And the men of the city said unto
[Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md), Behold, I pray thee, the situation of
this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and
the ground [barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And he said, Bring me a new
[cruse](../ebd/ebd093.htm#004), and put [salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008.md)
therein. And they brought it to him.  

<span id="021">21</span> And he went forth unto the spring of the
waters, and cast the [salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008.md) in there, and said,
Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from
thence any more death or [barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007.md) land.  

<span id="022">22</span> So the waters were healed unto this day,
according to the saying of [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) which he
spake.  

<span id="023">23</span> And he went up from thence unto
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md): and as he was going up by the way,
there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and
said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.  

<span id="024">24</span> And he turned back, and looked on them, and
cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears
out of the [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md), and tare forty and two
children of them.  

<span id="025">25</span> And he went from thence to
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006.md), and from
thence he returned to [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md).
