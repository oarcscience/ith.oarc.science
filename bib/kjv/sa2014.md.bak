### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> Now [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) the son of
[Zeruiah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#009.md) perceived that the king's heart was
toward [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) sent to
Tekoah, and fetched thence a [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) woman, and
said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on
now mourning [apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000.md), and
[anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008.md) not thyself with oil, but be as a woman
that had a long time mourned for the dead:  

<span id="003">3</span> And come to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),
and speak on this manner unto him. So [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) put
the words in her mouth.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), she fell on her face to the ground, and
did [obeisance](../ebd/ebd276.htm#006.md), and said, Help, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said unto
her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and
mine husband is dead.  

<span id="006">6</span> And thy [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md) had
two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none
to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.  

<span id="007">7</span> And, behold, the whole family is risen against
thine [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md), and they said, Deliver him that
smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother
whom he slew; and we will destroy the [heir](../ebd/ebd171.htm#007.md)
also: and so they shall quench my [coal](../ebd/ebd085.htm#003.md) which is
left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon
the earth.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said unto
the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the woman of Tekoah said unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), My lord, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),
the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) and his [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) be
guiltless.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said,
Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch
thee any more.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then said she, I pray thee, let the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) remember the LORD thy God, that thou
wouldest not suffer the revengers of [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) to
destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD
liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then the woman said, Let thine
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md), I pray thee, speak one word unto my
lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md). And he said, Say on.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou
thought such a thing against the people of God? for the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) doth speak this thing as one which is
faulty, in that the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) doth not fetch home
again his banished.  

<span id="014">14</span> For we must needs die, and are as water spilt
on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God
respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not
expelled from him.  

<span id="015">15</span> Now therefore that I am come to speak of this
thing unto my lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), it is because the
people have made me afraid: and thy [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md)
said, I will now speak unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md); it may be
that the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) will perform the request of his
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> For the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) will
hear, to deliver his [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md) out of the hand
of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the
inheritance of God.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then thine [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md)
said, The word of my lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) shall now be
comfortable: for as an [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of God, so is my
lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) to discern good and bad:
therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) answered
and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I
shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) now speak.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said, Is
not the hand of [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) with thee in all this? And
the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), none can turn to the right hand or to the
left from ought that my lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) hath
spoken: for thy servant [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md), he bade me, and
he put all these words in the mouth of thine
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md):  

<span id="020">20</span> To fetch about this form of speech hath thy
servant [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) done this thing: and my lord is
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md), according to the wisdom of an
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of God, to know all things that are in
the earth.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said unto
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md), Behold now, I have done this thing: go
therefore, bring the young man [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) again.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) fell to the
ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001): and [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) said,
To day thy servant knoweth that I have found
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) in thy sight, my lord, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), in that the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
hath fulfilled the request of his servant.  

<span id="023">23</span> So [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) arose and went
to [Geshur](../ebd/ebd147.htm#001.md), and brought
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said, Let
him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) returned to his own house, and saw not
the king's face.  

<span id="025">25</span> But in all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
there was none to be so much praised as [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md)
for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) of his head there was no
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md) in him.  

<span id="026">26</span> And when he polled his head, (for it was at
every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him,
therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred
shekels after the king's weight.  

<span id="027">27</span> And unto [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) there
were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was
[Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003.md): she was a woman of a fair countenance.  

<span id="028">28</span> So [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) dwelt two
full years in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and saw not the king's
face.  

<span id="029">29</span> Therefore [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) sent
for [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md), to have sent him to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md); but he would not come to him: and when he
sent again the second time, he would not come.  

<span id="030">30</span> Therefore he said unto his servants, See,
Joab's field is near mine, and he hath [barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003.md)
there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on
fire.  

<span id="031">31</span> Then [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) arose, and
came to [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) unto his house, and said unto
him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?  

<span id="032">32</span> And [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) answered
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md), Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come
hither, that I may send thee to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), to
say, Wherefore am I come from [Geshur](../ebd/ebd147.htm#001.md)? it had
been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the
king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.  

<span id="033">33</span> So [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) came to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and told him: and when he had called for
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md), he came to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and bowed himself on his face to the
ground before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md): and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) kissed [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md).
