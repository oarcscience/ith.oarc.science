### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 114

<span id="001">1</span> When [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) went out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), the house of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) from a people of strange language;  

<span id="002">2</span> [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) was his
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005), and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
his dominion.  

<span id="003">3</span> The sea saw it, and fled:
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) was driven back.  

<span id="004">4</span> The mountains skipped like rams, and the little
hills like lambs.  

<span id="005">5</span> What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest?
thou [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), that thou wast driven back?  

<span id="006">6</span> Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye
little hills, like lambs?  

<span id="007">7</span> Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the
Lord, at the presence of the God of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md);  

<span id="008">8</span> Which turned the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md)
into a standing water, the [flint](../ebd/ebd135.htm#009.md) into a
[fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md) of waters.
