### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> In those days was
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) sick unto death. And the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) [Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007.md) the son
of [Amoz](../ebd/ebd021.htm#008.md) came to him, and said unto him, Thus
saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not
live.  

<span id="002">2</span> Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed
unto the LORD, saying,  

<span id="003">3</span> I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have
walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that
which is good in thy sight. And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) wept
sore.  

<span id="004">4</span> And it came to pass, afore
[Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007.md) was gone out into the middle court, that
the word of the LORD came to him, saying,  

<span id="005">5</span> Turn again, and tell
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) the captain of my people, Thus saith
the LORD, the God of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) thy father, I have
heard thy [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md), I have seen thy tears:
behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the
house of the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and
I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md); and I
will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's
sake.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007.md) said, Take a
lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the
[boil](../ebd/ebd061.htm#008.md), and he recovered.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) said unto
[Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007.md), What shall be the sign that the LORD
will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the
third day?  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007.md) said, This
sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that
he hath spoken: shall the [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) go forward ten
degrees, or go back ten degrees?  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) answered,
It is a light thing for the [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) to go down
ten degrees: nay, but let the [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) return
backward ten degrees.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007.md) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) cried unto the LORD: and he brought the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) ten degrees backward, by which it had
gone down in the [dial](../ebd/ebd103.htm#000.md) of
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of
[Baladan](../ebd/ebd042.htm#004), [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), sent letters and a present unto
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md): for he had heard that
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) had been sick.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) hearkened
unto them, and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md),
and the [spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005.md), and the precious
[ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007.md), and all the house of his
[armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006.md), and all that was found in his
treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) shewed them not.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then came [Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007.md) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) unto [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md), and said unto him, What said these
men? and from whence came they unto thee? And
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) said, They are come from a far
country, even from [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And he said, What have they seen in thine
house? And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) answered, All the things
that are in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my
treasures that I have not shewed them.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007.md) said unto
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md), Hear the word of the LORD.  

<span id="017">17</span> Behold, the days come, that all that is in
thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this
day, shall be carried into [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md): nothing
shall be left, saith the LORD.  

<span id="018">18</span> And of thy sons that shall issue from thee,
which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs
in the [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md) of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> Then said [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md)
unto [Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007.md), Good is the word of the LORD which
thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth be in
my days?  

<span id="020">20</span> And the rest of the acts of
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md), and all his might, and how he made a
pool, and a [conduit](../ebd/ebd087.htm#009.md), and brought water into the
city, are they not written in the book of the
[chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003.md) of the kings of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)?  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) slept
with his fathers: and [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) his son reigned
in his stead.
