### King James Version: Hosea Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as
an [eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003) against the house of the LORD, because
they have transgressed my [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), and
trespassed against my law.  

<span id="002">2</span> [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall cry unto
me, My God, we know thee.  

<span id="003">3</span> [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) hath cast off
the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue him.  

<span id="004">4</span> They have set up kings, but not by me: they have
made princes, and I knew it not: of their
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and their [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001)
have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thy [calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004), O
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004), hath cast thee off; mine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) is kindled against them: how long will it
be ere they attain to innocency?  

<span id="006">6</span> For from [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) was it
also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the
[calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004) of [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004) shall
be broken in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002).  

<span id="007">7</span> For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap
the whirlwind: it hath no stalk; the bud shall yield no meal: if so be
it yield, the strangers shall [swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009) it up.  

<span id="008">8</span> [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) is swallowed up:
now shall they be among the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) as a
vessel wherein is no pleasure.  

<span id="009">9</span> For they are gone up to
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005), a wild [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001)
alone by himself: [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) hath hired lovers.  

<span id="010">10</span> Yea, though they have hired among the nations,
now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
princes.  

<span id="011">11</span> Because [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) hath
made many altars to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), altars shall be unto
him to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="012">12</span> I have written to him the great things of my
law, but they were counted as a strange thing.  

<span id="013">13</span> They [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002)
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and
eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their
iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="014">14</span> For [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) hath
forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will
send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.
