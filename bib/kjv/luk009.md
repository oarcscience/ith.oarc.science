### King James Version: Luke Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> Then he called his twelve disciples together,
and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure
diseases.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God,
and to heal the sick.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he said unto them, Take nothing for your
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001), neither staves, nor
[scrip](../ebd/ebd324.htm#004), neither [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006),
neither money; neither have two coats apiece.  

<span id="004">4</span> And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide,
and thence depart.  

<span id="005">5</span> And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go
out of that city, shake off the very [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) from
your feet for a [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) against them.  

<span id="006">6</span> And they departed, and went through the towns,
preaching the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003), and healing every
where.  

<span id="007">7</span> Now Herod the [tetrarch](../ebd/ebd363.htm#000)
heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it
was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;  

<span id="008">8</span> And of some, that [Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002)
had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen
again.  

<span id="009">9</span> And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is
this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the apostles, when they were returned, told
him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately
into a [desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000) place belonging to the city
called [Bethsaida](../ebd/ebd056.htm#009).  

<span id="011">11</span> And the people, when they knew it, followed
him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God,
and healed them that had need of healing.  

<span id="012">12</span> And when the day began to wear away, then came
the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go
into the towns and country round about, and
[lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002), and get victuals: for we are here in a
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000) place.  

<span id="013">13</span> But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And
they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we
should go and buy meat for all this people.  

<span id="014">14</span> For they were about five thousand men. And he
said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.  

<span id="015">15</span> And they did so, and made them all sit down.  

<span id="016">16</span> Then he took the five loaves and the two
fishes, and looking up to [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), he blessed
them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the
multitude.  

<span id="017">17</span> And they did eat, and were all filled: and
there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.  

<span id="018">18</span> And it came to pass, as he was alone praying,
his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the
people that I am?  

<span id="019">19</span> They answering said, John the Baptist; but some
say, [Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002); and others say, that one of the old
prophets is risen again.  

<span id="020">20</span> He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am?
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) answering said, The
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) of God.  

<span id="021">21</span> And he straitly charged them, and commanded
them to tell no man that thing;  

<span id="022">22</span> Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things,
and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003), and be slain, and be raised the third
day.  

<span id="023">23</span> And he said to them all, If any man will come
after me, let him deny himself, and take up his
[cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000) daily, and follow me.  

<span id="024">24</span> For whosoever will save his life shall lose it:
but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.  

<span id="025">25</span> For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the
whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?  

<span id="026">26</span> For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my
words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his
own [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006), and in his Father's, and of the holy
angels.  

<span id="027">27</span> But I tell you of a truth, there be some
standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom
of God.  

<span id="028">28</span> And it came to pass about an eight days after
these sayings, he took [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) and John and
[James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007), and went up into a mountain to pray.  

<span id="029">29</span> And as he prayed, the fashion of his
countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.  

<span id="030">30</span> And, behold, there talked with him two men,
which were [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and
[Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002):  

<span id="031">31</span> Who appeared in [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006),
and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="032">32</span> But [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) and they
that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they
saw his [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006), and the two men that stood with
him.  

<span id="033">33</span> And it came to pass, as they departed from him,
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) said unto [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006),
Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles;
one for thee, and one for [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), and one for
[Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002): not knowing what he said.  

<span id="034">34</span> While he thus spake, there came a
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001), and overshadowed them: and they feared
as they entered into the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001).  

<span id="035">35</span> And there came a voice out of the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001), saying, This is my beloved Son: hear
him.  

<span id="036">36</span> And when the voice was past,
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) was found alone. And they kept it close,
and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.  

<span id="037">37</span> And it came to pass, that on the next day, when
they were come down from the hill, much people met him.  

<span id="038">38</span> And, behold, a man of the company cried out,
saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only
child.  

<span id="039">39</span> And, lo, a [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009)
taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he
foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.  

<span id="040">40</span> And I besought thy disciples to cast him out;
and they could not.  

<span id="041">41</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answering
said, O faithless and perverse [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008), how
long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.  

<span id="042">42</span> And as he was yet a coming, the
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007) threw him down, and tare him. And
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) rebuked the unclean
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), and healed the child, and delivered him
again to his father.  

<span id="043">43</span> And they were all amazed at the mighty power of
God. But while they wondered every one at all things which
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) did, he said unto his disciples,  

<span id="044">44</span> Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for
the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.  

<span id="045">45</span> But they understood not this saying, and it was
hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of
that saying.  

<span id="046">46</span> Then there arose a reasoning among them, which
of them should be greatest.  

<span id="047">47</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), perceiving
the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,  

<span id="048">48</span> And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive
this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me
receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same
shall be great.  

<span id="049">49</span> And John answered and said, Master, we saw one
casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth
not with us.  

<span id="050">50</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto
him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.  

<span id="051">51</span> And it came to pass, when the time was come
that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),  

<span id="052">52</span> And sent messengers before his face: and they
went, and entered into a village of the
[Samaritans](../ebd/ebd320.htm#005), to make ready for him.  

<span id="053">53</span> And they did not receive him, because his face
was as though he would go to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="054">54</span> And when his disciples
[James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007) and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt
thou that we command fire to come down from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and consume them, even as
[Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002) did?  

<span id="055">55</span> But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye
know not what manner of [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) ye are of.  

<span id="056">56</span> For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's
lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.  

<span id="057">57</span> And it came to pass, that, as they went in the
way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever
thou goest.  

<span id="058">58</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto
him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of
man hath not where to lay his head.  

<span id="059">59</span> And he said unto another, Follow me. But he
said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.  

<span id="060">60</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto him,
Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of
God.  

<span id="061">61</span> And another also said, Lord, I will follow
thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my
house.  

<span id="062">62</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto
him, No man, having put his hand to the [plough](../ebd/ebd297.htm#007),
and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
