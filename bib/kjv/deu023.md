### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 23

<span id="001">1</span> He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his
privy member cut off, shall not enter into the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the LORD.  

<span id="002">2</span> A [bastard](../ebd/ebd047.htm#000.md) shall not
enter into the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the LORD; even
to his tenth [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) shall he not enter into
the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the LORD.  

<span id="003">3</span> An [Ammonite](../ebd/ebd021.htm#003.md) or
[Moabite](../ebd/ebd258.htm#006.md) shall not enter into the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the LORD; even to their tenth
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) shall they not enter into the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the LORD for ever:  

<span id="004">4</span> Because they met you not with
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) and with water in the way, when ye came
forth out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md); and because they hired
against thee [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) the son of
[Beor](../ebd/ebd052.htm#009) of [Pethor](../ebd/ebd291.htm#006.md) of
[Mesopotamia](../ebd/ebd251.htm#003), to [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md)
thee.  

<span id="005">5</span> Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken
unto [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md); but the LORD thy God turned the
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) into a blessing unto thee, because the
LORD thy God loved thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their
prosperity all thy days for ever.  

<span id="007">7</span> Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy
brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) in his land.  

<span id="008">8</span> The children that are begotten of them shall
enter into the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the LORD in
their third [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> When the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) goeth
forth against thine enemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing.  

<span id="010">10</span> If there be among you any man, that is not
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) by reason of uncleanness that chanceth
him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md), he shall not come within the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md):  

<span id="011">11</span> But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he
shall wash himself with water: and when the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md)
is down, he shall come into the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md) again.  

<span id="012">12</span> Thou shalt have a place also without the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md), whither thou shalt go forth abroad:  

<span id="013">13</span> And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon;
and it shall be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig
therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee:  

<span id="014">14</span> For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of
thy [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md), to deliver thee, and to give up thine
enemies before thee; therefore shall thy [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md)
be holy: that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from
thee.  

<span id="015">15</span> Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the
servant which is escaped from his master unto thee:  

<span id="016">16</span> He shall dwell with thee, even among you, in
that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh
him best: thou shalt not oppress him.  

<span id="017">17</span> There shall be no whore of the daughters of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), nor a sodomite of the sons of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or
the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow: for
even both these are [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md) unto the LORD
thy God.  

<span id="019">19</span> Thou shalt not lend upon
[usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006.md) to thy brother;
[usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006) of money, [usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006.md)
of victuals, [usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006.md) of any thing that is lent
upon [usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006.md):  

<span id="020">20</span> Unto a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) thou
mayest lend upon [usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006.md); but unto thy brother
thou shalt not lend upon [usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006.md): that the LORD
thy God may [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) thee in all that thou settest
thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it.  

<span id="021">21</span> When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy
God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely
require it of thee; and it would be [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) in
thee.  

<span id="022">22</span> But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be
no [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) in thee.  

<span id="023">23</span> That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt
keep and perform; even a freewill [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md),
according as thou hast vowed unto the LORD thy God, which thou hast
promised with thy mouth.  

<span id="024">24</span> When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard,
then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou
shalt not put any in thy vessel.  

<span id="025">25</span> When thou comest into the standing
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md) of thy neighbour, then thou mayest pluck
the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not move a
[sickle](../ebd/ebd342.htm#008.md) unto thy neighbour's standing
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md).
