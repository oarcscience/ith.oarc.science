<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Nehemiah Chapter 6</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now it came to pass when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#003">Sanballat</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd369.htm#001">Tobiah</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#000">Geshem</A> the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</A> left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> upon the gates;)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;That <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#003">Sanballat</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#000">Geshem</A> sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd279.htm#002">Ono</A>. But they thought to do me mischief.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then sent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#003">Sanballat</A> his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Wherein was written, It is reported among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, according to these words.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, saying, There is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>: and now shall it be reported to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Afterward I came unto the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd334.htm#005">Shemaiah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#001">Delaiah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd246.htm#005">Mehetabeel</A>, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, and let us shut the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> to save his life? I will not go in.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</A> against me: for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd369.htm#001">Tobiah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#003">Sanballat</A> had hired him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;My God, think thou upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd369.htm#001">Tobiah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#003">Sanballat</A> according to these their works, and on the prophetess <A HREF="../ebd/ebd274.htm#001">Noadiah</A>, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month <A HREF="../ebd/ebd119.htm#003">Elul</A>, in fifty and two days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A> that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Moreover in those days the nobles of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> sent many letters unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd369.htm#001">Tobiah</A>, and the letters of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd369.htm#001">Tobiah</A> came unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For there were many in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#002">Shechaniah</A> the son of Arah; and his son <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</A> had taken the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#001">Meshullam</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd053.htm#003">Berechiah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd369.htm#001">Tobiah</A> sent letters to put me in fear.<BR>
