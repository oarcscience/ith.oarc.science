### King James Version: Hosea Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> When I would have healed
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), then the iniquity of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) was discovered, and the wickedness of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md): for they commit falsehood; and the
thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without.  

<span id="002">2</span> And they consider not in their hearts that I
remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them
about; they are before my face.  

<span id="003">3</span> They make the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) glad
with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.  

<span id="004">4</span> They are all adulterers, as an
[oven](../ebd/ebd281.htm#005.md) heated by the baker, who ceaseth from
raising after he hath kneaded the [dough](../ebd/ebd106.htm#006.md), until
it be leavened.  

<span id="005">5</span> In the day of our [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
the princes have made him sick with bottles of
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md); he stretched out his hand with
scorners.  

<span id="006">6</span> For they have made ready their heart like an
[oven](../ebd/ebd281.htm#005.md), whiles they lie in wait: their baker
sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.  

<span id="007">7</span> They are all hot as an
[oven](../ebd/ebd281.htm#005.md), and have devoured their judges; all their
kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.  

<span id="008">8</span> [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), he hath mixed
himself among the people; [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) is a
[cake](../ebd/ebd068.htm#009.md) not turned.  

<span id="009">9</span> Strangers have devoured his strength, and he
knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he
knoweth not.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the pride of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) testifieth to his face: and they do not
return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.  

<span id="011">11</span> [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) also is like a
silly [dove](../ebd/ebd106.htm#007.md) without heart: they call to
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), they go to
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> When they shall go, I will spread my
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002.md) upon them; I will bring them down as the
fowls of the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md); I will chastise them, as
their [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) hath heard.  

<span id="013">13</span> Woe unto them! for they have fled from me:
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md) unto them! because they have
transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have
spoken lies against me.  

<span id="014">14</span> And they have not cried unto me with their
heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) and [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), and
they rebel against me.  

<span id="015">15</span> Though I have bound and strengthened their
arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.  

<span id="016">16</span> They return, but not to the most High: they are
like a deceitful [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md): their princes shall fall
by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) for the rage of their tongue: this
shall be their derision in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).
