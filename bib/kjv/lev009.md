### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass on the eighth day, that
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) called [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) and
his sons, and the elders of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000);  

<span id="002">2</span> And he said unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001),
Take thee a young [calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004) for a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and a
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003) for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), without
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007), and offer them before the LORD.  

<span id="003">3</span> And unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid
of the goats for a [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001); and a [calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004)
and a [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003), both of the first year, without
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007), for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001);  

<span id="004">4</span> Also a [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) and a
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003) for peace offerings, to
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) before the LORD; and a meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) mingled with oil: for to day the LORD
will appear unto you.  

<span id="005">5</span> And they brought that which
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) commanded before the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004): and all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) drew near and stood before the
LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said, This is
the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the LORD shall appear unto you.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said unto
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), Go unto the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), and offer thy
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and thy
burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) for thyself, and for the people: and
offer the [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of the people, and make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) for them; as the LORD commanded.  

<span id="008">8</span> [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) therefore went
unto the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), and slew the
[calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004) of the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), which was for himself.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the sons of [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001)
brought the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) unto him: and he dipped his
finger in the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and put it upon the horns
of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), and poured out the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) at the bottom of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006):  

<span id="010">10</span> But the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005), and the
kidneys, and the [caul](../ebd/ebd074.htm#003) above the
[liver](../ebd/ebd230.htm#004) of the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), he burnt upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006); as the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003).  

<span id="011">11</span> And the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) and the
hide he burnt with fire without the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002).  

<span id="012">12</span> And he slew the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001); and Aaron's sons presented unto him
the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), which he sprinkled round about upon
the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006).  

<span id="013">13</span> And they presented the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) unto him, with the
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) thereof, and the head: and he burnt them
upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006).  

<span id="014">14</span> And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and
burnt them upon the burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) on the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006).  

<span id="015">15</span> And he brought the people's
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and took the
[goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001), which was the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) for the
people, and slew it, and offered it for [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), as
the first.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he brought the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and offered it according to the
manner.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he brought the meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and took an handful thereof, and
burnt it upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), beside the burnt
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of the morning.  

<span id="018">18</span> He slew also the
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) and the [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003)
for a [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of peace offerings, which was
for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), which he sprinkled upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) round about,  

<span id="019">19</span> And the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) of the
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) and of the
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003), the rump, and that which covereth the
inwards, and the kidneys, and the [caul](../ebd/ebd074.htm#003) above
the [liver](../ebd/ebd230.htm#004):  

<span id="020">20</span> And they put the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005)
upon the breasts, and he burnt the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006):  

<span id="021">21</span> And the breasts and the right shoulder
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) waved for a wave
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) before the LORD; as
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) commanded.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) lifted up
his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and peace offerings.  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) went into the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), and came out, and blessed the
people: and the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the LORD appeared unto
all the people.  

<span id="024">24</span> And there came a fire out from before the LORD,
and consumed upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) and the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005):
which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
