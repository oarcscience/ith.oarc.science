### King James Version: Joshua Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> But the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) committed a trespass in the accursed
thing: for [Achan](../ebd/ebd006.htm#006.md), the son of
[Carmi](../ebd/ebd072.htm#007.md), the son of
[Zabdi](../ebd/ebd385.htm#008.md), the son of
[Zerah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#001), of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), took of the accursed thing: and the
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) of the LORD was kindled against the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) sent men
from [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008) to [Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md),
which is beside Bethaven, on the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) of
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md), and spake unto them, saying, Go up and
view the country. And the men went up and viewed
[Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And they returned to
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), and said unto him, Let not all the
people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite
[Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md); and make not all the people to labour
thither; for they are but few.  

<span id="004">4</span> So there went up thither of the people about
three thousand men: and they fled before the men of
[Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the men of [Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md) smote
of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) even unto
[Shebarim](../ebd/ebd332.htm#008.md), and smote them in the going down:
wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md)
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) his clothes, and fell to the earth upon
his face before the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD until the
eventide, he and the elders of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and put
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) upon their heads.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) said, Alas,
O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), to deliver us into the hand of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md), to destroy us? would to God we had
been content, and dwelt on the other side
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md)!  

<span id="008">8</span> O LORD, what shall I say, when
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) turneth their backs before their
enemies!  

<span id="009">9</span> For the [Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007.md) and
all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us
round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto
thy great name?  

<span id="010">10</span> And the LORD said unto
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus
upon thy face?  

<span id="011">11</span> [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) hath sinned,
and they have also transgressed my [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md)
which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing,
and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even
among their own stuff.  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) could not stand before their enemies,
but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed:
neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from
among you.  

<span id="013">13</span> Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify
yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), There is an accursed thing in the midst
of thee, O [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): thou canst not stand before
thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.  

<span id="014">14</span> In the morning therefore ye shall be brought
according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) which the LORD taketh shall come
according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall
take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall
take shall come man by man.  

<span id="015">15</span> And it shall be, that he that is taken with the
accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath:
because he hath transgressed the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of
the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> So [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) rose up
early in the morning, and brought [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) by
their tribes; and the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) was taken:  

<span id="017">17</span> And he brought the family of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md); and he took the family of the Zarhites:
and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and
[Zabdi](../ebd/ebd385.htm#008.md) was taken:  

<span id="018">18</span> And he brought his household man by man; and
[Achan](../ebd/ebd006.htm#006.md), the son of
[Carmi](../ebd/ebd072.htm#007.md), the son of
[Zabdi](../ebd/ebd385.htm#008.md), the son of
[Zerah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#001), of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), was taken.  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) said unto
[Achan](../ebd/ebd006.htm#006.md), My son, give, I pray thee,
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) to the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and make
[confession](../ebd/ebd088.htm#003.md) unto him; and tell me now what thou
hast done; hide it not from me.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Achan](../ebd/ebd006.htm#006.md) answered
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), and said, Indeed I have sinned against
the LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and thus and thus have
I done:  

<span id="021">21</span> When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish
garment, and two hundred shekels of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and
a wedge of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) of fifty shekels weight, then I
coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in
the midst of my [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md), and the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) under it.  

<span id="022">22</span> So [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) sent
messengers, and they ran unto the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md); and,
behold, it was hid in his [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md), and the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) under it.  

<span id="023">23</span> And they took them out of the midst of the
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md), and brought them unto
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), and unto all the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and laid them out before the LORD.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), and all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) with him, took
[Achan](../ebd/ebd006.htm#006.md) the son of
[Zerah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#001), and the [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md),
and the garment, and the wedge of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and his
sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), and his [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md),
and all that he had: and they brought them unto the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [Achor](../ebd/ebd007.htm#000.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) said, Why
hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) stoned him with stones, and burned them
with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.  

<span id="026">26</span> And they raised over him a great
[heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md) of stones unto this day. So the LORD
turned from the fierceness of his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md).
Wherefore the name of that place was called, The
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [Achor](../ebd/ebd007.htm#000.md), unto
this day.
