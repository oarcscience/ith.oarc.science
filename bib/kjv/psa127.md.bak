### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 127

<span id="001">1</span> Except the LORD build the house, they labour in
vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh
but in vain.  

<span id="002">2</span> It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up
late, to eat the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) of sorrows: for so he
giveth his beloved sleep.  

<span id="003">3</span> Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and
the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of the womb is his reward.  

<span id="004">4</span> As [arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005.md) are in the
hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.  

<span id="005">5</span> Happy is the man that hath his
[quiver](../ebd/ebd304.htm#000.md) full of them: they shall not be ashamed,
but they shall speak with the enemies in the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md).
