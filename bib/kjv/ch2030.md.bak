### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 30

<span id="001">1</span> And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) sent to
all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md),
and wrote letters also to [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) and
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md), that they should come to the house of
the LORD at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), to keep the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md) unto the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> For the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) had taken
counsel, and his princes, and all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), to keep the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md) in the second month.  

<span id="003">3</span> For they could not keep it at that time, because
the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the
people gathered themselves together to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And the thing pleased the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) and all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> So they established a decree to make
proclamation throughout all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), from
[Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008) even to [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md),
that they should come to keep the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md) unto
the LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): for they had not done it of a long
time in such sort as it was written.  

<span id="006">6</span> So the posts went with the letters from the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) and his princes throughout all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and
according to the commandment of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),
saying, Ye children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), turn again unto
the LORD God of [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md),
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006), and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and
he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand
of the kings of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And be not ye like your fathers, and like your
brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who
therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.  

<span id="008">8</span> Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were,
but yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md), which he hath sanctified for ever:
and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn
away from you.  

<span id="009">9</span> For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your
brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead
them [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001.md), so that they shall come again
into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will
not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.  

<span id="010">10</span> So the posts passed from city to city through
the country of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) and
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) even unto
[Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003.md): but they laughed them to scorn, and
mocked them.  

<span id="011">11</span> Nevertheless divers of
[Asher](../ebd/ebd033.htm#008) and [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) and
of [Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003.md) humbled themselves, and came to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> Also in [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) the hand
of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) and of the princes, by the word of the
LORD.  

<span id="013">13</span> And there assembled at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) much people to keep the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) of unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) in the second month, a very great
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And they arose and took away the altars that
were in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and all the altars for
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) took they away, and cast them into the
[brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006) [Kidron](../ebd/ebd218.htm#008.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> Then they killed the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md) on the fourteenth day of the second
month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified
themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the
LORD.  

<span id="016">16</span> And they stood in their place after their
manner, according to the law of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) the man
of God: the priests sprinkled the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), which
they received of the hand of the Levites.  

<span id="017">17</span> For there were many in the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) that were not sanctified:
therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for
every one that was not [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md), to sanctify them
unto the LORD.  

<span id="018">18</span> For a multitude of the people, even many of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000), and [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md),
[Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002), and [Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003.md),
had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md) otherwise than it was written. But
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) prayed for them, saying, The good LORD
[pardon](../ebd/ebd285.htm#001.md) every one  

<span id="019">19</span> That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD
God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the
[purification](../ebd/ebd302.htm#007.md) of the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And the LORD hearkened to
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md), and healed the people.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) that were present at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) kept the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) of unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days with
great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by
day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) spake
comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the
LORD: and they did eat throughout the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md)
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days, [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md)
peace offerings, and making [confession](../ebd/ebd088.htm#003.md) to the
LORD God of their fathers.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the whole assembly took counsel to keep
other [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days: and they kept other
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days with gladness.  

<span id="024">24</span> For [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) did give
to the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) a thousand bullocks and
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) thousand [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md);
and the princes gave to the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) a
thousand bullocks and ten thousand [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md): and a
great number of priests sanctified themselves.  

<span id="025">25</span> And all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md),
with the priests and the Levites, and all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) that came out of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and the strangers that came out of the
land of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and that dwelt in
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), rejoiced.  

<span id="026">26</span> So there was great joy in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): for since the time of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) the son of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) there was not the like in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed
the people: and their voice was heard, and their
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) came up to his holy dwelling place, even
unto [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).
