### King James Version: Habakkuk Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the
tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall
answer when I am reproved.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000), and make it
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) upon [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006),
that he may run that readeth it.  

<span id="003">3</span> For the [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000) is yet
for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie:
though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not
tarry.  

<span id="004">4</span> Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not
upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.  

<span id="005">5</span> Yea also, because he transgresseth by
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), he is a proud man, neither keepeth at
home, who enlargeth his desire as [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003), and is
as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations,
and heapeth unto him all people:  

<span id="006">6</span> Shall not all these take up a
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003) against him, and a taunting
[proverb](../ebd/ebd301.htm#002) against him, and say, Woe to him that
increaseth that which is not his! how long? and to him that ladeth
himself with thick [clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004)!  

<span id="007">7</span> Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite
thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto
them?  

<span id="008">8</span> Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the
remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men's
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and for the violence of the land, of the
city, and of all that dwell therein.  

<span id="009">9</span> Woe to him that coveteth an evil
[covetousness](../ebd/ebd092.htm#000) to his house, that he may set his
nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!  

<span id="010">10</span> Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by
[cutting](../ebd/ebd095.htm#000) off many people, and hast sinned
against thy soul.  

<span id="011">11</span> For the [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) shall
cry out of the wall, and the [beam](../ebd/ebd048.htm#007) out of the
timber shall answer it.  

<span id="012">12</span> Woe to him that buildeth a town with
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and stablisheth a city by iniquity!  

<span id="013">13</span> Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the
people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary
themselves for very vanity?  

<span id="014">14</span> For the earth shall be filled with the
knowledge of the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the LORD, as the
waters cover the sea.  

<span id="015">15</span> Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), that puttest thy
[bottle](../ebd/ebd063.htm#002) to him, and makest him drunken also,
that thou mayest look on their nakedness!  

<span id="016">16</span> Thou art filled with shame for
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006): [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) thou
also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) of the LORD's right hand shall be turned
unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on thy
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006).  

<span id="017">17</span> For the violence of
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001) shall cover thee, and the spoil of
beasts, which made them afraid, because of men's
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and for the violence of the land, of the
city, and of all that dwell therein.  

<span id="018">18</span> What profiteth the graven image that the maker
thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that
the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make
[dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002) idols?  

<span id="019">19</span> Woe unto him that saith to the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), Awake; to the
[dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002) [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), Arise, it
shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001)
and [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and there is no breath at all in
the midst of it.  

<span id="020">20</span> But the LORD is in his holy
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004): let all the earth keep silence before
him.
