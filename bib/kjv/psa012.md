### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md) fail from among the children of men.  

<span id="002">2</span> They speak vanity every one with his neighbour:
with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.  

<span id="003">3</span> The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and
the tongue that speaketh proud things:  

<span id="004">4</span> Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail;
our lips are our own: who is lord over us?  

<span id="005">5</span> For the oppression of the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), for the sighing of the needy, now will I
arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at
him.  

<span id="006">6</span> The words of the LORD are pure words: as
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) tried in a
[furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000.md) of earth, purified
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times.  

<span id="007">7</span> Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt
preserve them from this [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) for ever.  

<span id="008">8</span> The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest
men are exalted.
