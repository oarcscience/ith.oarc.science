### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) called all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and said unto them, Hear, O
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), the statutes and judgments which I
speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do
them.  

<span id="002">2</span> The LORD our God made a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with us in
[Horeb](../ebd/ebd181.htm#009.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> The LORD made not this
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with our fathers, but with us, even
us, who are all of us here alive this day.  

<span id="004">4</span> The LORD talked with you face to face in the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) out of the midst of the fire,  

<span id="005">5</span> (I stood between the LORD and you at that time,
to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the
fire, and went not up into the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007);.md)
saying,  

<span id="006">6</span> I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of
the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), from the house of
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Thou shalt have none other gods before me.  

<span id="008">8</span> Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or
any likeness of any thing that is in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)
above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath
the earth:  

<span id="009">9</span> Thou shalt not [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) down
thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous
God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the
third and fourth [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) of them that hate
me,  

<span id="010">10</span> And shewing [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) unto
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md) of them that love me and keep my
commandments.  

<span id="011">11</span> Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy
God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his
name in vain.  

<span id="012">12</span> Keep the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) day
to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee.  

<span id="013">13</span> Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy
work:  

<span id="014">14</span> But the seventh day is the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt
not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy
manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007.md),
nor thine [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md), nor any of thy
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), nor thy
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) that is within thy gates; that thy
manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.  

<span id="015">15</span> And remember that thou wast a servant in the
land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and that the LORD thy God
brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out
arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) day.  

<span id="016">16</span> Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD
thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it
may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.  

<span id="017">17</span> Thou shalt not kill.  

<span id="018">18</span> Neither shalt thou commit
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> Neither shalt thou steal.  

<span id="020">20</span> Neither shalt thou bear false
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) against thy neighbour.  

<span id="021">21</span> Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife,
neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his
manservant, or his maidservant, his [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007.md), or his
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md), or any thing that is thy neighbour's.  

<span id="022">22</span> These words the LORD spake unto all your
assembly in the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) out of the midst of the
fire, of the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md), and of the thick
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), with a great voice: and he added no
more. And he wrote them in two [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006.md) of
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), and delivered them unto me.  

<span id="023">23</span> And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice
out of the midst of the [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), (for the
mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, even all the
heads of your tribes, and your elders;  

<span id="024">24</span> And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath
shewed us his [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) and his greatness, and we
have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day
that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.  

<span id="025">25</span> Now therefore why should we die? for this great
fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more,
then we shall die.  

<span id="026">26</span> For who is there of all
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), that hath heard the voice of the living
God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?  

<span id="027">27</span> Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our
God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall
speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.  

<span id="028">28</span> And the LORD heard the voice of your words,
when ye spake unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice
of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have
well said all that they have spoken.  

<span id="029">29</span> O that there were such an heart in them, that
they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might
be well with them, and with their children for ever!  

<span id="030">30</span> Go say to them, Get you into your tents
again.  

<span id="031">31</span> But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I
will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the
judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the
land which I give them to possess it.  

<span id="032">32</span> Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD
your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand
or to the left.  

<span id="033">33</span> Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD
your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well
with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall
possess.
