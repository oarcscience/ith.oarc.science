### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> Moreover the word of the LORD came to me,
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Go and cry in the ears of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), saying, Thus saith the LORD; I
remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals,
when thou wentest after me in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md),
in a land that was not sown.  

<span id="003">3</span> [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) was
[holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md) unto the LORD, and the firstfruits of
his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon
them, saith the LORD.  

<span id="004">4</span> Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and all the families of the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):  

<span id="005">5</span> Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your
fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked
after vanity, and are become vain?  

<span id="006">6</span> Neither said they, Where is the LORD that
brought us up out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), that
led us through the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), through a land
of deserts and of pits, through a land of
[drought](../ebd/ebd108.htm#005.md), and of the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) of death, through a land that no man
passed through, and where no man dwelt?  

<span id="007">7</span> And I brought you into a plentiful country, to
eat the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) thereof and the
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md) thereof; but when ye entered, ye
defiled my land, and made mine heritage an
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and
they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed
against me, and the prophets prophesied by
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md), and walked after things that do not
profit.  

<span id="009">9</span> Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the
LORD, and with your children's children will I plead.  

<span id="010">10</span> For pass over the isles of
[Chittim](../ebd/ebd081.htm#003.md), and see; and send unto
[Kedar](../ebd/ebd216.htm#003.md), and consider diligently, and see if
there be such a thing.  

<span id="011">11</span> Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet
no gods? but my people have changed their [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md)
for that which doth not profit.  

<span id="012">12</span> Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be
horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the LORD.  

<span id="013">13</span> For my people have committed two evils; they
have forsaken me the [fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md) of living waters,
and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.  

<span id="014">14</span> Is [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) a servant?
is he a homeborn [slave](../ebd/ebd346.htm#003.md)? why is he spoiled?  

<span id="015">15</span> The young [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001.md) roared
upon him, and yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are
burned without inhabitant.  

<span id="016">16</span> Also the children of
[Noph](../ebd/ebd274.htm#009) and [Tahapanes](../ebd/ebd357.htm#005.md)
have broken the [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) of thy head.  

<span id="017">17</span> Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in
that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?  

<span id="018">18</span> And now what hast thou to do in the way of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) the
waters of [Sihor](../ebd/ebd343.htm#003.md)? or what hast thou to do in the
way of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md), to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) the waters of the river?  

<span id="019">19</span> Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and
thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is
an evil thing and [bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009.md), that thou hast
forsaken the LORD thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the
Lord GOD of hosts.  

<span id="020">20</span> For of old time I have broken thy
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md), and burst thy
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003.md); and thou saidst, I will not transgress;
when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest,
playing the [harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> Yet I had planted thee a noble
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md), wholly a right seed: how then art thou
turned into the degenerate plant of a strange
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md) unto me?  

<span id="022">22</span> For though thou wash thee with
[nitre](../ebd/ebd273.htm#009.md), and take thee much
[soap](../ebd/ebd347.htm#002.md), yet thine iniquity is marked before me,
saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="023">23</span> How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have
not gone after [Baalim](../ebd/ebd039.htm#007.md)? see thy way in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md), know what thou hast done: thou art a
swift [dromedary](../ebd/ebd108.htm#002.md) traversing her ways;  

<span id="024">24</span> A wild [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md) used to the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), that snuffeth up the wind at her
pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her
will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.  

<span id="025">25</span> Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy
throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have
loved strangers, and after them will I go.  

<span id="026">26</span> As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is
the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) ashamed; they, their kings,
their princes, and their priests, and their prophets.  

<span id="027">27</span> Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), Thou hast brought me forth: for they
have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but in the time of
their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.  

<span id="028">28</span> But where are thy gods that thou hast made
thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble:
for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have
transgressed against me, saith the LORD.  

<span id="030">30</span> In vain have I smitten your children; they
received no correction: your own [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) hath
devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.  

<span id="031">31</span> O [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md), see ye
the word of the LORD. Have I been a [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md)
unto [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)? a land of
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md)? wherefore say my people, We are
lords; we will come no more unto thee?  

<span id="032">32</span> Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a
[bride](../ebd/ebd065.htm#001.md) her attire? yet my people have forgotten
me days without number.  

<span id="033">33</span> Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love?
therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways.  

<span id="034">34</span> Also in thy skirts is found the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of the souls of the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) innocents: I have not found it by secret
search, but upon all these.  

<span id="035">35</span> Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely
his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) shall turn from me. Behold, I will
plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.  

<span id="036">36</span> Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy
way? thou also shalt be ashamed of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), as
thou wast ashamed of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md).  

<span id="037">37</span> Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine
hands upon thine head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and
thou shalt not prosper in them.
