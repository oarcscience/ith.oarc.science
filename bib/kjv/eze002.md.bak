### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy
feet, and I will speak unto thee.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) entered
into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him
that spake unto me.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), to a rebellious nation
that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed
against me, even unto this very day.  

<span id="004">4</span> For they are impudent children and stiffhearted.
I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the
Lord GOD.  

<span id="005">5</span> And they, whether they will hear, or whether
they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know
that there hath been a [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) among them.  

<span id="006">6</span> And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them,
neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee,
and thou dost dwell among [scorpions](../ebd/ebd324.htm#001.md): be not
afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a
rebellious house.  

<span id="007">7</span> And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether
they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most
rebellious.  

<span id="008">8</span> But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee;
Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and
eat that I give thee.  

<span id="009">9</span> And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto
me; and, lo, a [roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004.md) of a book was therein;  

<span id="010">10</span> And he spread it before me; and it was written
within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and
mourning, and woe.
