### King James Version: Zechariah Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and
looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two
mountains; and the mountains were mountains of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003).  

<span id="002">2</span> In the first [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008)
were red horses; and in the second [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008)
black horses;  

<span id="003">3</span> And in the third
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) white horses; and in the fourth
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) grisled and
[bay](../ebd/ebd048.htm#001) horses.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then I answered and said unto the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) that talked with me, What are these, my
lord?  

<span id="005">5</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) answered
and said unto me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go
forth from standing before the LORD of all the earth.  

<span id="006">6</span> The black horses which are therein go forth into
the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go
forth toward the south country.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [bay](../ebd/ebd048.htm#001) went forth,
and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and
he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they
walked to and fro through the earth.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me,
saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) in the north country.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  

<span id="010">10</span> Take of them of the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002), even of
[Heldai](../ebd/ebd172.htm#002), of [Tobijah](../ebd/ebd369.htm#002),
and of [Jedaiah](../ebd/ebd199.htm#006), which are come from
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and come thou the same day, and go
into the house of [Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) the son of
[Zephaniah](../ebd/ebd390.htm#008);  

<span id="011">11</span> Then take [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and make crowns, and set them upon the
head of [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) the son of Josedech, the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003);  

<span id="012">12</span> And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the
LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The
[BRANCH](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002); and he shall grow up out of his place,
and he shall build the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of the LORD:  

<span id="013">13</span> Even he shall build the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of the LORD; and he shall bear the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006), and shall sit and rule upon his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001); and he shall be a
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) upon his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001): and the counsel of peace shall be
between them both.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the crowns shall be to
[Helem](../ebd/ebd172.htm#006), and to [Tobijah](../ebd/ebd369.htm#002),
and to [Jedaiah](../ebd/ebd199.htm#006), and to
[Hen](../ebd/ebd174.htm#002) the son of
[Zephaniah](../ebd/ebd390.htm#008), for a memorial in the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of the LORD.  

<span id="015">15</span> And they that are far off shall come and build
in the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of the LORD, and ye shall know
that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. And this shall come to
pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.
