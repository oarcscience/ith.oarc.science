### King James Version: Mark Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> And he began again to teach by the sea side: and
there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a
ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the
land.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he taught them many things by parables, and
said unto them in his doctrine,  

<span id="003">3</span> Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to
sow:  

<span id="004">4</span> And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by
the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.  

<span id="005">5</span> And some fell on stony ground, where it had not
much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of
earth:  

<span id="006">6</span> But when the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) was
up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.  

<span id="007">7</span> And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew
up, and choked it, and it yielded no [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And other fell on good ground, and did yield
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) that sprang up and increased; and brought
forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he said unto them, He that hath ears to
hear, let him hear.  

<span id="010">10</span> And when he was alone, they that were about him
with the twelve asked of him the [parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to
know the [mystery](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006.md) of the kingdom of God: but
unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:  

<span id="012">12</span> That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and
hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should
be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he said unto them, Know ye not this
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md)? and how then will ye know all
parables?  

<span id="014">14</span> The sower soweth the word.  

<span id="015">15</span> And these are they by the way side, where the
word is sown; but when they have heard, [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md)
cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their
hearts.  

<span id="016">16</span> And these are they likewise which are sown on
stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it
with gladness;  

<span id="017">17</span> And have no root in themselves, and so endure
but for a time: afterward, when affliction or
[persecution](../ebd/ebd290.htm#007.md) ariseth for the word's sake,
immediately they are offended.  

<span id="018">18</span> And these are they which are sown among thorns;
such as hear the word,  

<span id="019">19</span> And the cares of this world, and the
deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in,
choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.  

<span id="020">20</span> And these are they which are sown on good
ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md), some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an
hundred.  

<span id="021">21</span> And he said unto them, Is a
[candle](../ebd/ebd071.htm#000.md) brought to be put under a bushel, or
under a bed? and not to be set on a
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md)?  

<span id="022">22</span> For there is nothing hid, which shall not be
manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come
abroad.  

<span id="023">23</span> If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.  

<span id="024">24</span> And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear:
with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you
that hear shall more be given.  

<span id="025">25</span> For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he
that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.  

<span id="026">26</span> And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a
man should cast seed into the ground;  

<span id="027">27</span> And should sleep, and rise night and day, and
the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.  

<span id="028">28</span> For the earth bringeth forth
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of herself; first the
[blade](../ebd/ebd060.htm#003), then the [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md),
after that the full [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md) in the
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> But when the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) is
brought forth, immediately he putteth in the
[sickle](../ebd/ebd342.htm#008.md), because the
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md) is come.  

<span id="030">30</span> And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the
kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?  

<span id="031">31</span> It is like a [grain](../ebd/ebd154.htm#003.md) of
[mustard](../ebd/ebd262.htm#009.md) seed, which, when it is sown in the
earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:  

<span id="032">32</span> But when it is sown, it groweth up, and
becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so
that the fowls of the air may [lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002.md) under the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) of it.  

<span id="033">33</span> And with many such parables spake he the word
unto them, as they were able to hear it.  

<span id="034">34</span> But without a [parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md)
spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all
things to his disciples.  

<span id="035">35</span> And the same day, when the even was come, he
saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.  

<span id="036">36</span> And when they had sent away the multitude, they
took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other
little [ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003.md).  

<span id="037">37</span> And there arose a great storm of wind, and the
waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.  

<span id="038">38</span> And he was in the hinder part of the ship,
asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest
thou not that we perish?  

<span id="039">39</span> And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said
unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a
great calm.  

<span id="040">40</span> And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful?
how is it that ye have no faith?  

<span id="041">41</span> And they feared exceedingly, and said one to
another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey
him?
