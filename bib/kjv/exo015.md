### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> Then sang [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) this song unto the LORD, and
spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed
gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.  

<span id="002">2</span> The LORD is my strength and song, and he is
become my [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003): he is my God, and I will
prepare him an [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007); my father's God, and
I will exalt him.  

<span id="003">3</span> The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his
name.  

<span id="004">4</span> Pharaoh's chariots and his
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) hath he cast into the sea: his
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) captains also are drowned in the Red
sea.  

<span id="005">5</span> The depths have covered them: they sank into the
bottom as a [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005).  

<span id="006">6</span> Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in
power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) the enemy.  

<span id="007">7</span> And in the greatness of thine excellency thou
hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy
wrath, which consumed them as stubble.  

<span id="008">8</span> And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters
were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an
[heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000), and the depths were congealed in the
heart of the sea.  

<span id="009">9</span> The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake,
I will divide the spoil; my [lust](../ebd/ebd233.htm#005) shall be
satisfied upon them; I will draw my [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), my
hand shall destroy them.  

<span id="010">10</span> Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered
them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.  

<span id="011">11</span> Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods?
who is like thee, glorious in [holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006), fearful
in praises, doing wonders?  

<span id="012">12</span> Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth
swallowed them.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou in thy [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) hast
led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in
thy strength unto thy holy [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007).  

<span id="014">14</span> The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow
shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then the dukes of [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001)
shall be amazed; the mighty men of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005),
trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005) shall melt away.  

<span id="016">16</span> Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the
greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005); till thy people pass over, O LORD, till
the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.  

<span id="017">17</span> Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the
mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast
made for thee to dwell in, in the [Sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005), O
LORD, which thy hands have established.  

<span id="018">18</span> The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.  

<span id="019">19</span> For the horse of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) went in with his chariots and with his
horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea
upon them; but the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) went on
dry land in the midst of the sea.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Miriam](../ebd/ebd256.htm#003) the
prophetess, the sister of [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), took a
[timbrel](../ebd/ebd366.htm#004) in her hand; and all the women went out
after her with timbrels and with dances.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Miriam](../ebd/ebd256.htm#003) answered
them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse
and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.  

<span id="022">22</span> So [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) brought
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) from the Red sea, and they went out into
the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of
[Shur](../ebd/ebd342.htm#002); and they went three days in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), and found no water.  

<span id="023">23</span> And when they came to
[Marah](../ebd/ebd241.htm#003), they could not
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of the waters of
[Marah](../ebd/ebd241.htm#003), for they were
[bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009): therefore the name of it was called
[Marah](../ebd/ebd241.htm#003).  

<span id="024">24</span> And the people murmured against
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying, What shall we
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009)?  

<span id="025">25</span> And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed
him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made
sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he
proved them,  

<span id="026">26</span> And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to
the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his
sight, and wilt give [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) to his commandments,
and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee,
which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth
thee.  

<span id="027">27</span> And they came to [Elim](../ebd/ebd117.htm#001),
where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and
they encamped there by the waters.
