### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) journeyed
from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between
[Kadesh](../ebd/ebd215.htm#003) and [Shur](../ebd/ebd342.htm#002.md), and
sojourned in [Gerar](../ebd/ebd146.htm#005.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) said of
[Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md) his wife, She is my sister: and
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Gerar](../ebd/ebd146.htm#005.md) sent, and took
[Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> But God came to
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000) in a [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md)
by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the
woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.  

<span id="004">4</span> But [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) had not
come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous
nation?  

<span id="005">5</span> Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she,
even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart
and innocency of my hands have I done this.  

<span id="006">6</span> And God said unto him in a
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md), Yea, I know that thou didst this in the
integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against
me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.  

<span id="007">7</span> Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he
is a [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md), and he shall pray for thee, and
thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt
surely die, thou, and all that are thine.  

<span id="008">8</span> Therefore [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md)
rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all
these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) called
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), and said unto him, What hast thou done
unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and
on my kingdom a great [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)? thou hast done deeds
unto me that ought not to be done.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) said
unto [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), What sawest thou, that thou hast
done this thing?  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) said,
Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they
will slay me for my wife's sake.  

<span id="012">12</span> And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the
daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became
my wife.  

<span id="013">13</span> And it came to pass, when God caused me to
wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy
kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall
come, say of me, He is my brother.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) took
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), and oxen, and menservants, and
womenservants, and gave them unto [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), and
restored him [Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md) his wife.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md) said,
Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.  

<span id="016">16</span> And unto [Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md) he
said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md):
behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with
thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.  

<span id="017">17</span> So [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) prayed unto
God: and God healed [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md), and his wife,
and his maidservants; and they bare children.  

<span id="018">18</span> For the LORD had [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md)
closed up all the wombs of the house of
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md), because of
[Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003.md) Abraham's wife.
