### King James Version: Esther Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> When [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005) perceived
all that was done, [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005)
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007) his clothes, and put on
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001) with [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000),
and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a
[bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009) cry;  

<span id="002">2</span> And came even before the king's
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008): for none might enter into the king's
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) clothed with
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001).  

<span id="003">3</span> And in every province, whithersoever the king's
commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the
Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001) and [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000).  

<span id="004">4</span> So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and
told it her. Then was the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007) exceedingly
grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005), and to take away his
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001) from him: but he received it not.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then called [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) for
[Hatach](../ebd/ebd167.htm#001), one of the king's chamberlains, whom he
had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005), to know what it was, and why it
was.  

<span id="006">6</span> So [Hatach](../ebd/ebd167.htm#001) went forth to
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005) unto the street of the city, which was
before the king's [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008).  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005) told him
of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) had promised to pay to the king's
treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.  

<span id="008">8</span> Also he gave him the copy of the
[writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005) of the decree that was given at
[Shushan](../ebd/ebd342.htm#003) to destroy them, to shew it unto
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006), and to declare it unto her, and to
charge her that she should go in unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001),
to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her
people.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Hatach](../ebd/ebd167.htm#001) came and
told [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) the words of
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005).  

<span id="010">10</span> Again [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) spake
unto [Hatach](../ebd/ebd167.htm#001), and gave him commandment unto
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005);  

<span id="011">11</span> All the king's servants, and the people of the
king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or women, shall
come unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) into the inner court, who is
not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to
whom the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) shall hold out the golden
[sceptre](../ebd/ebd323.htm#006), that he may live: but I have not been
called to come in unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) these thirty
days.  

<span id="012">12</span> And they told to
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005) Esther's words.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005)
commanded to answer [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006), Think not with
thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the
Jews.  

<span id="014">14</span> For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at
this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the
Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be
destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such
a time as this?  

<span id="015">15</span> Then [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) bade them
return [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005) this answer,  

<span id="016">16</span> Go, gather together all the Jews that are
present in [Shushan](../ebd/ebd342.htm#003), and
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) ye for me, and neither eat nor
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) three days, night or day: I also and my
maidens will [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) likewise; and so will I go in
unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), which is not according to the
law: and if I perish, I perish.  

<span id="017">17</span> So [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005) went his
way, and did according to all that [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) had
commanded him.
