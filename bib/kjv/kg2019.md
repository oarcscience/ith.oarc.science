### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, when
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) heard
it, that he [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007) his clothes, and covered
himself with [sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001), and went into the house
of the LORD.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he sent [Eliakim](../ebd/ebd116.htm#000),
which was over the household, and [Shebna](../ebd/ebd332.htm#009) the
scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001), to [Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007)
the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) the son of
[Amoz](../ebd/ebd021.htm#008).  

<span id="003">3</span> And they said unto him, Thus saith
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003), This day is a day of trouble, and of
rebuke, and [blasphemy](../ebd/ebd060.htm#005); for the children are
come to the [birth](../ebd/ebd059.htm#002), and there is not strength to
bring forth.  

<span id="004">4</span> It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the
words of [Rabshakeh](../ebd/ebd305.htm#000), whom the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) his
master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words
which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) for the remnant that are left.  

<span id="005">5</span> So the servants of [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) came to
[Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007).  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007) said unto
them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not
afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005)
have blasphemed me.  

<span id="007">7</span> Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he
shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause
him to fall by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) in his own land.  

<span id="008">8</span> So [Rabshakeh](../ebd/ebd305.htm#000) returned,
and found the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) warring against
[Libnah](../ebd/ebd228.htm#004): for he had heard that he was departed
from [Lachish](../ebd/ebd222.htm#009).  

<span id="009">9</span> And when he heard say of
[Tirhakah](../ebd/ebd368.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Ethiopia](../ebd/ebd126.htm#005), Behold, he is come out to fight
against thee: he sent messengers again unto
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="010">10</span> Thus shall ye speak to
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), saying, Let not thy God in whom thou
trustest deceive thee, saying, [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) shall
not be delivered into the hand of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005).  

<span id="011">11</span> Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) have done to all lands, by destroying
them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?  

<span id="012">12</span> Have the gods of the nations delivered them
which my fathers have destroyed; as [Gozan](../ebd/ebd153.htm#009), and
[Haran](../ebd/ebd163.htm#007), and [Rezeph](../ebd/ebd312.htm#005), and
the children of [Eden](../ebd/ebd112.htm#009) which were in Thelasar?  

<span id="013">13</span> Where is the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005), and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
of [Arpad](../ebd/ebd032.htm#002), and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
of the city of [Sepharvaim](../ebd/ebd327.htm#009), of
[Hena](../ebd/ebd174.htm#003), and [Ivah](../ebd/ebd191.htm#009)?  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) received
the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) went up into the house of the LORD,
and spread it before the LORD.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) prayed
before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which dwellest between the cherubims,
thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth;
thou hast made [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) and earth.  

<span id="016">16</span> LORD, [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) down thine
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004), and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and see:
and hear the words of [Sennacherib](../ebd/ebd327.htm#005), which hath
sent him to reproach the living God.  

<span id="017">17</span> Of a truth, LORD, the kings of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) have destroyed the nations and their
lands,  

<span id="018">18</span> And have cast their gods into the fire: for
they were no gods, but the work of men's hands,
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) and [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005):
therefore they have destroyed them.  

<span id="019">19</span> Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee,
save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may
know that thou art the LORD God, even thou only.  

<span id="020">20</span> Then [Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007) the son of
[Amoz](../ebd/ebd021.htm#008) sent to [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003),
saying, Thus saith the LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), That
which thou hast prayed to me against
[Sennacherib](../ebd/ebd327.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) I have heard.  

<span id="021">21</span> This is the word that the LORD hath spoken
concerning him; The [virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009) the daughter of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002) hath despised thee, and laughed thee to
scorn; the daughter of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) hath shaken
her head at thee.  

<span id="022">22</span> Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and
against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on
high? even against the Holy One of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="023">23</span> By thy messengers thou hast reproached the
LORD, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to
the height of the mountains, to the sides of
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001), and will cut down the tall
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007) trees thereof, and the choice
[fir](../ebd/ebd133.htm#005) trees thereof: and I will enter into the
lodgings of his borders, and into the [forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006) of
his [Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006).  

<span id="024">24</span> I have digged and
[drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007) strange waters, and with the sole of my
feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.  

<span id="025">25</span> Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done
it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to
pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous
heaps.  

<span id="026">26</span> Therefore their inhabitants were of small
power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005) of the field, and as the green
[herb](../ebd/ebd174.htm#008), as the [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005) on
the house tops, and as [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) blasted before it
be grown up.  

<span id="027">27</span> But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and
thy coming in, and thy rage against me.  

<span id="028">28</span> Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is
come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my
[hook](../ebd/ebd181.htm#004) in thy nose, and my
[bridle](../ebd/ebd065.htm#002) in thy lips, and I will turn thee back
by the way by which thou camest.  

<span id="029">29</span> And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall
eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year
that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and
reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.  

<span id="030">30</span> And the remnant that is escaped of the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) shall yet again take root downward, and
bear [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) upward.  

<span id="031">31</span> For out of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005)
shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002): the
[zeal](../ebd/ebd388.htm#003) of the LORD of hosts shall do this.  

<span id="032">32</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005), He
shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before
it with [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001), nor cast a bank against it.  

<span id="033">33</span> By the way that he came, by the same shall he
return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.  

<span id="034">34</span> For I will defend this city, to save it, for
mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.  

<span id="035">35</span> And it came to pass that night, that the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the LORD went out, and smote in the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and
five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they
were all dead corpses.  

<span id="036">36</span> So [Sennacherib](../ebd/ebd327.htm#005)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005)
departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at
[Nineveh](../ebd/ebd273.htm#006).  

<span id="037">37</span> And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in
the house of [Nisroch](../ebd/ebd273.htm#008) his god, that
[Adrammelech](../ebd/ebd010.htm#003) and
[Sharezer](../ebd/ebd331.htm#008) his sons smote him with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003): and they escaped into the land of
[Armenia](../ebd/ebd031.htm#004). And
[Esarhaddon](../ebd/ebd124.htm#004) his son reigned in his stead.
