### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 39

<span id="001">1</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) was brought
down to [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md); and
[Potiphar](../ebd/ebd299.htm#002.md), an officer of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), captain of the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md), an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of
the [Ishmeelites](../ebd/ebd190.htm#007.md), which had brought him down
thither.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the LORD was with
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), and he was a prosperous man; and he was
in the house of his master the Egyptian.  

<span id="003">3</span> And his master saw that the LORD was with him,
and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) found
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) in his sight, and he served him: and he
made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his
hand.  

<span id="005">5</span> And it came to pass from the time that he had
made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD
blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the
LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand;
and he knew not ought he had, save the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md)
which he did eat. And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) was a goodly
person, and well favoured.  

<span id="007">7</span> And it came to pass after these things, that his
master's wife cast her eyes upon [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md); and
she said, Lie with me.  

<span id="008">8</span> But he refused, and said unto his master's wife,
Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath
committed all that he hath to my hand;  

<span id="009">9</span> There is none greater in this house than I;
neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art
his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) against God?  

<span id="010">10</span> And it came to pass, as she spake to
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) day by day, that he hearkened not unto
her, to lie by her, or to be with her.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it came to pass about this time, that
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) went into the house to do his business;
and there was none of the men of the house there within.  

<span id="012">12</span> And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie
with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him
out.  

<span id="013">13</span> And it came to pass, when she saw that he had
left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,  

<span id="014">14</span> That she called unto the men of her house, and
spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an
[Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009.md) unto us to mock us; he came in unto me
to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:  

<span id="015">15</span> And it came to pass, when he heard that I
lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and
fled, and got him out.  

<span id="016">16</span> And she laid up his garment by her, until his
lord came home.  

<span id="017">17</span> And she spake unto him according to these
words, saying, The [Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009.md) servant, which thou
hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:  

<span id="018">18</span> And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice
and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.  

<span id="019">19</span> And it came to pass, when his master heard the
words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner
did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.  

<span id="020">20</span> And Joseph's master took him, and put him into
the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md), a place where the king's prisoners
were bound: and he was there in the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> But the LORD was with
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), and shewed him
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md), and gave him favour in the sight of the
keeper of the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And the keeper of the
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md) committed to Joseph's hand all the
prisoners that were in the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md); and
whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.  

<span id="023">23</span> The keeper of the
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md) looked not to any thing that was under
his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD
made it to prosper.
