### King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the
heavenly [calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007), consider the
[Apostle](../ebd/ebd026.htm#008) and High
[Priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) of our profession,
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006);  

<span id="002">2</span> Who was [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) to him
that appointed him, as also [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) was
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) in all his house.  

<span id="003">3</span> For this man was counted worthy of more
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) than [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003),
inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the
house.  

<span id="004">4</span> For every house is builded by some man; but he
that built all things is God.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) verily was
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) in all his house, as a servant, for a
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) of those things which were to be
spoken after;  

<span id="006">6</span> But [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) as a son
over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) the confidence and the rejoicing of the
hope firm unto the end.  

<span id="007">7</span> Wherefore (as the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005) saith, To day if ye will hear his
voice,  

<span id="008">8</span> Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation,
in the day of [temptation](../ebd/ebd361.htm#008) in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005):  

<span id="009">9</span> When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw
my works forty years.  

<span id="010">10</span> Wherefore I was grieved with that
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008), and said, They do alway err in
their heart; and they have not known my ways.  

<span id="011">11</span> So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter
into my rest.)  

<span id="012">12</span> Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of
you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.  

<span id="013">13</span> But exhort one another daily, while it is
called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="014">14</span> For we are made partakers of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), if we hold the beginning of our
confidence stedfast unto the end;  

<span id="015">15</span> While it is said, To day if ye will hear his
voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.  

<span id="016">16</span> For some, when they had heard, did provoke:
howbeit not all that came out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) by
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003).  

<span id="017">17</span> But with whom was he grieved forty years? was
it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005)?  

<span id="018">18</span> And to whom sware he that they should not enter
into his rest, but to them that believed not?  

<span id="019">19</span> So we see that they could not enter in because
of unbelief.
