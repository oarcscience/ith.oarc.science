### King James Version: Luke Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) being full of
the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005) returned from
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), and was led by the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005),  

<span id="002">2</span> Being forty days tempted of the
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007). And in those days he did eat nothing:
and when they were ended, he afterward hungered.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007) said unto
him, If thou be the Son of God, command this
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) that it be made
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006).  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered him,
saying, It is written, That man shall not live by
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) alone, but by every word of God.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007), taking
him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the
world in a moment of time.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007) said unto
him, All this power will I give thee, and the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of them: for that is delivered unto me;
and to whomsoever I will I give it.  

<span id="007">7</span> If thou therefore wilt
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) me, all shall be thine.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered and
said unto him, Get thee behind me, [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000): for
it is written, Thou shalt [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) the Lord thy
God, and him only shalt thou serve.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he brought him to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and set him on a
[pinnacle](../ebd/ebd295.htm#009) of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), and said unto him, If thou be the Son
of God, cast thyself down from hence:  

<span id="010">10</span> For it is written, He shall give his angels
charge over thee, to keep thee:  

<span id="011">11</span> And in their hands they shall bear thee up,
lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005).  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answering
said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.  

<span id="013">13</span> And when the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007) had
ended all the [temptation](../ebd/ebd361.htm#008), he departed from him
for a season.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) returned in
the power of the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) into
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008): and there went out a fame of him
through all the region round about.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he taught in their synagogues, being
glorified of all.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he came to
[Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007), where he had been brought up: and, as
his [custom](../ebd/ebd094.htm#008) was, he went into the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009) on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day, and stood up for to read.  

<span id="017">17</span> And there was delivered unto him the book of
the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) [Esaias](../ebd/ebd124.htm#003).
And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was
written,  

<span id="018">18</span> The [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of the Lord
is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) to the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006); he
hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the
captives, and recovering of sight to the [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009),
to set at liberty them that are bruised,  

<span id="019">19</span> To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.  

<span id="020">20</span> And he closed the book, and he gave it again to
the [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007), and sat down. And the eyes of all
them that were in the [synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009) were fastened
on him.  

<span id="021">21</span> And he began to say unto them, This day is this
[scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005) fulfilled in your ears.  

<span id="022">22</span> And all bare him
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008), and wondered at the gracious words
which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's
son?  

<span id="023">23</span> And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto
me this [proverb](../ebd/ebd301.htm#002),
[Physician](../ebd/ebd295.htm#000), heal thyself: whatsoever we have
heard done in [Capernaum](../ebd/ebd071.htm#007), do also here in thy
country.  

<span id="024">24</span> And he said, Verily I say unto you, No
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) is accepted in his own country.  

<span id="025">25</span> But I tell you of a truth, many
[widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003) were in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
in the days of [Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002), when the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) was shut up three years and six months,
when great [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) was throughout all the
land;  

<span id="026">26</span> But unto none of them was
[Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002) sent, save unto
[Sarepta](../ebd/ebd322.htm#008), a city of
[Sidon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#000), unto a woman that was a widow.  

<span id="027">27</span> And many lepers were in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in the time of Eliseus the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008); and none of them was cleansed, saving
[Naaman](../ebd/ebd263.htm#009) the Syrian.  

<span id="028">28</span> And all they in the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009), when they heard these things, were
filled with wrath,  

<span id="029">29</span> And rose up, and thrust him out of the city,
and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that
they might cast him down headlong.  

<span id="030">30</span> But he passing through the midst of them went
his way,  

<span id="031">31</span> And came down to
[Capernaum](../ebd/ebd071.htm#007), a city of
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008), and taught them on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) days.  

<span id="032">32</span> And they were astonished at his doctrine: for
his word was with power.  

<span id="033">33</span> And in the [synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009)
there was a man, which had a [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of an
unclean [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007), and cried out with a loud
voice,  

<span id="034">34</span> Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with
thee, thou [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) of
[Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007)? art thou come to destroy us? I know
thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.  

<span id="035">35</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) rebuked him,
saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007) had thrown him in the midst, he came out
of him, and hurt him not.  

<span id="036">36</span> And they were all amazed, and spake among
themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he
commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.  

<span id="037">37</span> And the fame of him went out into every place
of the country round about.  

<span id="038">38</span> And he arose out of the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009), and entered into Simon's house. And
Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great
[fever](../ebd/ebd132.htm#009); and they besought him for her.  

<span id="039">39</span> And he stood over her, and rebuked the
[fever](../ebd/ebd132.htm#009); and it left her: and immediately she
arose and ministered unto them.  

<span id="040">40</span> Now when the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) was
setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them
unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.  

<span id="041">41</span> And devils also came out of many, crying out,
and saying, Thou art [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) the Son of God. And
he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="042">42</span> And when it was day, he departed and went into
a [desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000) place: and the people sought him, and
came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.  

<span id="043">43</span> And he said unto them, I must preach the
kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.  

<span id="044">44</span> And he preached in the synagogues of
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008).
