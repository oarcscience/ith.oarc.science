### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said, Is
there yet any that is left of the house of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), that I may shew him kindness for
Jonathan's sake?  

<span id="002">2</span> And there was of the house of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) a servant whose name was
[Ziba](../ebd/ebd392.htm#003). And when they had called him unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said
unto him, Art thou [Ziba](../ebd/ebd392.htm#003)? And he said, Thy
servant is he.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said, Is
there not yet any of the house of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), that I
may shew the kindness of God unto him? And [Ziba](../ebd/ebd392.htm#003)
said unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001),
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) hath yet a son, which is lame on his
feet.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said unto
him, Where is he? And [Ziba](../ebd/ebd392.htm#003) said unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), Behold, he is in the house of
[Machir](../ebd/ebd235.htm#006), the son of
[Ammiel](../ebd/ebd020.htm#006), in Lodebar.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) sent, and fetched him out of the house of
[Machir](../ebd/ebd235.htm#006), the son of
[Ammiel](../ebd/ebd020.htm#006), from Lodebar.  

<span id="006">6</span> Now when [Mephibosheth](../ebd/ebd248.htm#006),
the son of [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000), the son of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), was come unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), he fell on his face, and did reverence.
And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said,
[Mephibosheth](../ebd/ebd248.htm#006). And he answered, Behold thy
servant!  

<span id="007">7</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said unto
him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) thy father's sake, and will restore
thee all the land of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) thy father; and thou
shalt eat [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) at my table continually.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy
servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?  

<span id="009">9</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) called to
[Ziba](../ebd/ebd392.htm#003), Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have
given unto thy master's son all that pertained to
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) and to all his house.  

<span id="010">10</span> Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants,
shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that
thy master's son may have food to eat: but
[Mephibosheth](../ebd/ebd248.htm#006) thy master's son shall eat
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) alway at my table. Now
[Ziba](../ebd/ebd392.htm#003) had fifteen sons and twenty servants.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then said [Ziba](../ebd/ebd392.htm#003) unto
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), According to all that my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) hath commanded his servant, so shall thy
servant do. As for [Mephibosheth](../ebd/ebd248.htm#006), said the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), he shall eat at my table, as one of the
king's sons.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Mephibosheth](../ebd/ebd248.htm#006) had a
young son, whose name was [Micha](../ebd/ebd252.htm#008). And all that
dwelt in the house of [Ziba](../ebd/ebd392.htm#003) were servants unto
[Mephibosheth](../ebd/ebd248.htm#006).  

<span id="013">13</span> So [Mephibosheth](../ebd/ebd248.htm#006) dwelt
in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): for he did eat continually at the
king's table; and was lame on both his feet.
