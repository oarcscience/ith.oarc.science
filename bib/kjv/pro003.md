### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart
keep my commandments:  

<span id="002">2</span> For length of days, and long life, and peace,
shall they add to thee.  

<span id="003">3</span> Let not [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) and truth
forsake thee: bind them about thy [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md); write
them upon the table of thine heart:  

<span id="004">4</span> So shalt thou find favour and good understanding
in the sight of God and man.  

<span id="005">5</span> Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean
not unto thine own understanding.  

<span id="006">6</span> In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall
direct thy paths.  

<span id="007">7</span> Be not [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) in thine
own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.  

<span id="008">8</span> It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to
thy bones.  

<span id="009">9</span> Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the
firstfruits of all thine increase:  

<span id="010">10</span> So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and
thy presses shall burst out with new [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD;
neither be weary of his correction:  

<span id="012">12</span> For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as
a father the son in whom he delighteth.  

<span id="013">13</span> Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the
man that getteth understanding.  

<span id="014">14</span> For the merchandise of it is better than the
merchandise of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and the gain thereof
than fine [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> She is more precious than rubies: and all the
things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.  

<span id="016">16</span> Length of days is in her right hand; and in her
left hand riches and honour.  

<span id="017">17</span> Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her
paths are peace.  

<span id="018">18</span> She is a tree of life to them that lay hold
upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.  

<span id="019">19</span> The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by
understanding hath he established the heavens.  

<span id="020">20</span> By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and
the clouds drop down the [dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> My son, let not them depart from thine eyes:
keep sound wisdom and discretion:  

<span id="022">22</span> So shall they be life unto thy soul, and
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) to thy [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy
foot shall not stumble.  

<span id="024">24</span> When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid:
yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.  

<span id="025">25</span> Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the
desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.  

<span id="026">26</span> For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall
keep thy foot from being taken.  

<span id="027">27</span> Withhold not good from them to whom it is due,
when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.  

<span id="028">28</span> Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again,
and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.  

<span id="029">29</span> Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing
he dwelleth securely by thee.  

<span id="030">30</span> Strive not with a man without cause, if he have
done thee no harm.  

<span id="031">31</span> Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of
his ways.  

<span id="032">32</span> For the froward is
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md) to the LORD: but his secret is with
the righteous.  

<span id="033">33</span> The [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) of the LORD
is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md) of the just.  

<span id="034">34</span> Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) unto the lowly.  

<span id="035">35</span> The [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) shall inherit
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md): but shame shall be the promotion of
fools.
