### King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> Now of the things which we have spoken this is
the sum: We have such an high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), who is
set on the right hand of the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of the
Majesty in the heavens;  

<span id="002">2</span> A [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) of the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005), and of the true
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003), which the Lord pitched, and not
man.  

<span id="003">3</span> For every high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003)
is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity
that this man have somewhat also to offer.  

<span id="004">4</span> For if he were on earth, he should not be a
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), seeing that there are priests that
offer gifts according to the law:  

<span id="005">5</span> Who serve unto the example and
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) of heavenly things, as
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) was admonished of God when he was about
to make the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003): for, See, saith he,
that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007).  

<span id="006">6</span> But now hath he obtained a more excellent
ministry, by how much also he is the [mediator](../ebd/ebd246.htm#002)
of a better [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), which was established
upon better promises.  

<span id="007">7</span> For if that first
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) had been faultless, then should no
place have been sought for the second.  

<span id="008">8</span> For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold,
the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and with the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007):  

<span id="009">9</span> Not according to the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) that I made with their fathers in the
day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009); because they continued not in my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), and I regarded them not, saith the
Lord.  

<span id="010">10</span> For this is the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) that I will make with the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) after those days, saith the Lord; I will
put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will
be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:  

<span id="011">11</span> And they shall not teach every man his
neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all
shall know me, from the least to the greatest.  

<span id="012">12</span> For I will be merciful to their
unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no
more.  

<span id="013">13</span> In that he saith, A new
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), he hath made the first old. Now that
which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.
