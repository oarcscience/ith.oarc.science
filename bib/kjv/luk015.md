### King James Version: Luke Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> Then drew near unto him all the publicans and
sinners for to hear him.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) and
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) murmured, saying, This man receiveth
sinners, and eateth with them.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he spake this
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003) unto them, saying,  

<span id="004">4</span> What man of you, having an hundred
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), if he lose one of them, doth not leave
the ninety and nine in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), and go
after that which is lost, until he find it?  

<span id="005">5</span> And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his
shoulders, rejoicing.  

<span id="006">6</span> And when he cometh home, he calleth together his
friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have
found my [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) which was lost.  

<span id="007">7</span> I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) over one sinner that repenteth, more
than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no
[repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008).  

<span id="008">8</span> Either what woman having ten
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), if
she lose one piece, doth not light a [candle](../ebd/ebd071.htm#000),
and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?  

<span id="009">9</span> And when she hath found it, she calleth her
friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have
found the piece which I had lost.  

<span id="010">10</span> Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the
presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.  

<span id="011">11</span> And he said, A certain man had two sons:  

<span id="012">12</span> And the younger of them said to his father,
Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided
unto them his living.  

<span id="013">13</span> And not many days after the younger son
gathered all together, and took his [journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001)
into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous
living.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) in that land; and he began to be in
want.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he went and joined himself to a citizen of
that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed
[swine](../ebd/ebd354.htm#002).  

<span id="016">16</span> And he would fain have filled his
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000) with the husks that the
[swine](../ebd/ebd354.htm#002) did eat: and no man gave unto him.  

<span id="017">17</span> And when he came to himself, he said, How many
hired servants of my father's have [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) enough
and to spare, and I perish with hunger!  

<span id="018">18</span> I will arise and go to my father, and will say
unto him, Father, I have sinned against [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006),
and before thee,  

<span id="019">19</span> And am no more worthy to be called thy son:
make me as one of thy hired servants.  

<span id="020">20</span> And he arose, and came to his father. But when
he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and
ran, and fell on his [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000), and kissed him.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the son said unto him, Father, I have
sinned against [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and in thy sight, and am
no more worthy to be called thy son.  

<span id="022">22</span> But the father said to his servants, Bring
forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a
[ring](../ebd/ebd313.htm#007) on his hand, and shoes on his feet:  

<span id="023">23</span> And bring hither the fatted
[calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004), and kill it; and let us eat, and be
merry:  

<span id="024">24</span> For this my son was dead, and is alive again;
he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.  

<span id="025">25</span> Now his [elder](../ebd/ebd114.htm#008) son was
in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick
and dancing.  

<span id="026">26</span> And he called one of the servants, and asked
what these things meant.  

<span id="027">27</span> And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and
thy father hath killed the fatted [calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004), because
he hath received him safe and sound.  

<span id="028">28</span> And he was angry, and would not go in:
therefore came his father out, and intreated him.  

<span id="029">29</span> And he answering said to his father, Lo, these
many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy
commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry
with my friends:  

<span id="030">30</span> But as soon as this thy son was come, which
hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the
fatted [calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004).  

<span id="031">31</span> And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with
me, and all that I have is thine.  

<span id="032">32</span> It was meet that we should make merry, and be
glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost,
and is found.
