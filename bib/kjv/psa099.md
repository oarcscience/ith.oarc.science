### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 99

<span id="001">1</span> The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he
sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.  

<span id="002">2</span> The LORD is great in
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md); and he is high above all the people.  

<span id="003">3</span> Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for
it is holy.  

<span id="004">4</span> The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou
dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) in
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Exalt ye the LORD our God, and
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) at his
[footstool](../ebd/ebd136.htm#009.md); for he is holy.  

<span id="006">6</span> [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) among his priests, and
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) among them that call upon his name; they
called upon the LORD, and he answered them.  

<span id="007">7</span> He spake unto them in the cloudy
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md): they kept his testimonies, and the
ordinance that he gave them.  

<span id="008">8</span> Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast
a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their
inventions.  

<span id="009">9</span> Exalt the LORD our God, and
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) at his holy hill; for the LORD our God
is holy.
