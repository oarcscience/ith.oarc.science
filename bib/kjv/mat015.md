### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> Then came to [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) and [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008),
which were of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Why do thy disciples transgress the
[tradition](../ebd/ebd371.htm#005) of the elders? for they wash not
their hands when they eat [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006).  

<span id="003">3</span> But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye
also transgress the commandment of God by your
[tradition](../ebd/ebd371.htm#005)?  

<span id="004">4</span> For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and
mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.  

<span id="005">5</span> But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or
his mother, It is a [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005), by whatsoever thou
mightest be profited by me;  

<span id="006">6</span> And honour not his father or his mother, he
shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect
by your [tradition](../ebd/ebd371.htm#005).  

<span id="007">7</span> Ye hypocrites, well did
[Esaias](../ebd/ebd124.htm#003) prophesy of you, saying,  

<span id="008">8</span> This people draweth nigh unto me with their
mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from
me.  

<span id="009">9</span> But in vain they do
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) me, teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men.  

<span id="010">10</span> And he called the multitude, and said unto
them, Hear, and understand:  

<span id="011">11</span> Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a
man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then came his disciples, and said unto him,
Knowest thou that the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) were offended,
after they heard this saying?  

<span id="013">13</span> But he answered and said, Every plant, which my
heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.  

<span id="014">14</span> Let them alone: they be
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009) leaders of the
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009). And if the
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009) lead the [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009),
both shall fall into the ditch.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then answered [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002)
and said unto him, Declare unto us this
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003).  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said, Are ye
also yet without understanding?  

<span id="017">17</span> Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever
entereth in at the mouth goeth into the [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000),
and is cast out into the draught?  

<span id="018">18</span> But those things which proceed out of the mouth
come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.  

<span id="019">19</span> For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts,
murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008), blasphemies:  

<span id="020">20</span> These are the things which defile a man: but to
eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) went
thence, and departed into the coasts of [Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001)
and [Sidon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#000).  

<span id="022">22</span> And, behold, a woman of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005) came out of the same coasts, and cried
unto him, saying, Have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) on me, O Lord,
thou son of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004); my daughter is grievously
vexed with a [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007).  

<span id="023">23</span> But he answered her not a word. And his
disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth
after us.  

<span id="024">24</span> But he answered and said, I am not sent but
unto the lost [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) of the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="025">25</span> Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord,
help me.  

<span id="026">26</span> But he answered and said, It is not meet to
take the children's [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and to cast it to
dogs.  

<span id="027">27</span> And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of
the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.  

<span id="028">28</span> Then [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered
and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as
thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) departed
from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008); and went up into a mountain, and sat
down there.  

<span id="030">30</span> And great multitudes came unto him, having with
them those that were lame, [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009),
[dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002), maimed, and many others, and cast them
down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:  

<span id="031">31</span> Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they
saw the [dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002) to speak, the maimed to be whole,
the lame to walk, and the [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009) to see: and
they glorified the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="032">32</span> Then [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) called his
disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude,
because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat:
and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.  

<span id="033">33</span> And his disciples say unto him, Whence should
we have so much [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), as to fill so great a multitude?  

<span id="034">34</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith unto
them, How many loaves have ye? And they said,
[Seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005), and a few little fishes.  

<span id="035">35</span> And he commanded the multitude to sit down on
the ground.  

<span id="036">36</span> And he took the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his
disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.  

<span id="037">37</span> And they did all eat, and were filled: and they
took up of the broken meat that was left [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
baskets full.  

<span id="038">38</span> And they that did eat were four thousand men,
beside women and children.  

<span id="039">39</span> And he sent away the multitude, and took ship,
and came into the coasts of [Magdala](../ebd/ebd236.htm#004).
