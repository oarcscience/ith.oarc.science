</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</A>, among whom I dwell:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A>: only bring not my son thither again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the servant put his hand under the thigh of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#003">Mesopotamia</A>, unto the city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd265.htm#006">Nahor</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And he said O LORD God of my master <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</A>, I pray thee, that I may <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>; and she shall say, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">Drink</A>, and I will give thy camels <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</A> came out, who was born to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd057.htm#003">Bethuel</A>, son of Milcah, the wife of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd265.htm#006">Nahor</A>, Abraham's brother, with her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</A> upon her shoulder.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</A>, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</A>, and came up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> a little water of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And she said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">Drink</A>, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</A> upon her hand, and gave him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And when she had done giving him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And she hasted, and emptied her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</A> into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A> prosperous or not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#009">shekel</A> weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</A> in?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And she said unto him, I am the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd057.htm#003">Bethuel</A> the son of Milcah, which she bare unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd265.htm#006">Nahor</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;She said moreover unto him, We have both <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</A> and provender enough, and room to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</A> in.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, who hath not left destitute my master of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</A> had a brother, and his name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> ran out unto the man, unto the well.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</A> his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</A> and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And he said, I am Abraham's servant.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</A> my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</A>, in whose land I dwell:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;Then shalt thou be clear from this my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A>, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</A> cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And she say to me, Both <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's son.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</A> came forth with her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</A> on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, I pray thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;And she made haste, and let down her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</A> from her shoulder, and said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">Drink</A>, and I will give thy camels <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> also: so I drank, and she made the camels <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd057.htm#003">Bethuel</A>, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd057.htm#003">Bethuel</A> answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;Behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</A> is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#005">bowing</A> himself to the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="053">53</A>&nbsp;And the servant brought forth jewels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and jewels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and raiment, and gave them to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</A>: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="054">54</A>&nbsp;And they did eat and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="055">55</A>&nbsp;And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="056">56</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="057">57</A>&nbsp;And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="058">58</A>&nbsp;And they called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</A>, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="059">59</A>&nbsp;And they sent away <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</A> their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="060">60</A>&nbsp;And they blessed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</A>, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</A> of millions, and let thy seed possess the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of those which hate them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="061">61</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</A> arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</A>, and went his way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="062">62</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="063">63</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="064">64</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</A> lifted up her eyes, and when she saw <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, she lighted off the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#000">camel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="065">65</A>&nbsp;For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="066">66</A>&nbsp;And the servant told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> all things that he had done.<BR>
