### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 116

<span id="001">1</span> I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice
and my supplications.  

<span id="002">2</span> Because he hath inclined his
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) unto me, therefore will I call upon him as
long as I live.  

<span id="003">3</span> The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains
of [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md) gat hold upon me: I found trouble and
sorrow.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD,
I beseech thee, deliver my soul.  

<span id="005">5</span> Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our
God is merciful.  

<span id="006">6</span> The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought
low, and he helped me.  

<span id="007">7</span> Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD
hath dealt bountifully with thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine
eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.  

<span id="009">9</span> I will walk before the LORD in the land of the
living.  

<span id="010">10</span> I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was
greatly afflicted:  

<span id="011">11</span> I said in my haste, All men are liars.  

<span id="012">12</span> What shall I render unto the LORD for all his
benefits toward me?  

<span id="013">13</span> I will take the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000.md) of
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md), and call upon the name of the
LORD.  

<span id="014">14</span> I will pay my [vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001.md)
unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.  

<span id="015">15</span> Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death
of his saints.  

<span id="016">16</span> O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy
servant, and the son of thine [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md): thou
hast loosed my bonds.  

<span id="017">17</span> I will offer to thee the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) of thanksgiving, and will call upon
the name of the LORD.  

<span id="018">18</span> I will pay my [vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001.md)
unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.  

<span id="019">19</span> In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst
of thee, O [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md). Praise ye the LORD.
