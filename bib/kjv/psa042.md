### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 42

<span id="001">1</span> As the [hart](../ebd/ebd165.htm#004.md) panteth
after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.  

<span id="002">2</span> My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God:
when shall I come and appear before God?  

<span id="003">3</span> My tears have been my meat day and night, while
they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?  

<span id="004">4</span> When I remember these things, I pour out my soul
in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house
of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept
holyday.  

<span id="005">5</span> Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art
thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for
the help of his countenance.  

<span id="006">6</span> O my God, my soul is cast down within me:
therefore will I remember thee from the land of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), and of the Hermonites, from the hill
[Mizar](../ebd/ebd257.htm#009.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> [Deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) calleth unto
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) at the noise of thy
[waterspouts](../ebd/ebd379.htm#008.md): all thy waves and thy billows are
gone over me.  

<span id="008">8</span> Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in
the day time, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) unto the God of my life.  

<span id="009">9</span> I will say unto God my
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md), Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I
mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?  

<span id="010">10</span> As with a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) in my
bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is
thy God?  

<span id="011">11</span> Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art
thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him,
who is the health of my countenance, and my God.
