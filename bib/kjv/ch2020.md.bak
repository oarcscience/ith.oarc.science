### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> It came to pass after this also, that the
children of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), and the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002.md), and with them other beside the
Ammonites, came against [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md) to
battle.  

<span id="002">2</span> Then there came some that told
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md), saying, There cometh a great
multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md); and, behold, they be in Hazazontamar,
which is [Engedi](../ebd/ebd120.htm#009.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md) feared,
and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) throughout all
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) gathered
themselves together, to ask help of the LORD: even out of all the cities
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) they came to seek the LORD.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md) stood
in the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md),
in the house of the LORD, before the new court,  

<span id="006">6</span> And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not
thou God in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)? and rulest not thou over
all the kingdoms of the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md)? and in thine
hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand
thee?  

<span id="007">7</span> Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the
inhabitants of this land before thy people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and gavest it to the seed of
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) thy friend for ever?  

<span id="008">8</span> And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md) therein for thy name, saying,  

<span id="009">9</span> If, when evil cometh upon us, as the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), judgment, or pestilence, or
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md), we stand before this house, and in thy
presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee in our
affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.  

<span id="010">10</span> And now, behold, the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) and [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) and
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004.md), whom thou
wouldest not let [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) invade, when they came
out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), but they turned from
them, and destroyed them not;  

<span id="011">11</span> Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to
cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.  

<span id="012">12</span> O our God, wilt thou not
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) them? for we have no might against this
great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but
our eyes are upon thee.  

<span id="013">13</span> And all [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) stood
before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their
children.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then upon [Jahaziel](../ebd/ebd195.htm#006.md) the
son of [Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006.md), the son of
[Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003.md), the son of
[Jeiel](../ebd/ebd203.htm#000.md), the son of
[Mattaniah](../ebd/ebd243.htm#009), a [Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009.md) of
the sons of [Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002.md), came the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the LORD in the midst of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md);  

<span id="015">15</span> And he said, Hearken ye, all
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and ye inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and thou
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md), Thus
saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this
great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.  

<span id="016">16</span> To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they
come up by the cliff of [Ziz](../ebd/ebd395.htm#000.md); and ye shall find
them at the end of the [brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006.md), before the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) of
[Jeruel](../ebd/ebd204.htm#004.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set
yourselves, stand ye still, and see the
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) of the LORD with you, O
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md):
fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD
will be with you.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md) bowed
his head with his face to the ground: and all
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) fell before the LORD, worshipping the
LORD.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the Levites, of the children of the
[Kohathites](../ebd/ebd222.htm#002.md), and of the children of the
[Korhites](../ebd/ebd222.htm#006.md), stood up to praise the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) with a loud voice on high.  

<span id="020">20</span> And they rose early in the morning, and went
forth into the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) of Tekoa: and as they
went forth, [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md) stood and said, Hear
me, O [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and ye inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md); Believe in the LORD your God, so
shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.  

<span id="021">21</span> And when he had consulted with the people, he
appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of
[holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md), as they went out before the army, and
to say, Praise the LORD; for his [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) endureth
for ever.  

<span id="022">22</span> And when they began to sing and to praise, the
LORD set ambushments against the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002), [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), and
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004.md), which were
come against [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md); and they were smitten.  

<span id="023">23</span> For the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) and [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) stood
up against the inhabitants of [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004.md), utterly to slay and destroy them: and
when they had made an end of the inhabitants of
[Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004.md), every one helped to destroy another.  

<span id="024">24</span> And when [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) came
toward the watch tower in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), they
looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to
the earth, and none escaped.  

<span id="025">25</span> And when [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md)
and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among
them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels,
which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away:
and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.  

<span id="026">26</span> And on the fourth day they assembled themselves
in the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) of
[Berachah](../ebd/ebd053.htm#001.md); for there they blessed the LORD:
therefore the name of the same place was called, The
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [Berachah](../ebd/ebd053.htm#001.md),
unto this day.  

<span id="027">27</span> Then they returned, every man of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md),
and [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md) in the forefront of them, to go
again to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) with joy; for the LORD had
made them to rejoice over their enemies.  

<span id="028">28</span> And they came to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) with psalteries and harps and
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md) unto the house of the LORD.  

<span id="029">29</span> And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of
those countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the
enemies of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> So the realm of
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md) was quiet: for his God gave him
rest round about.  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md)
reigned over [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md): he was thirty and five
years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years
in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md). And his mother's name was
[Azubah](../ebd/ebd038.htm#002.md) the daughter of Shilhi.  

<span id="032">32</span> And he walked in the way of
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md) his father, and departed not from it, doing
that which was right in the sight of the LORD.  

<span id="033">33</span> Howbeit the high places were not taken away:
for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of
their fathers.  

<span id="034">34</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md), first and last, behold, they are
written in the book of [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md) the son of
[Hanani](../ebd/ebd162.htm#003.md), who is mentioned in the book of the
kings of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="035">35</span> And after this did
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) join himself with
[Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), who did very wickedly:  

<span id="036">36</span> And he joined himself with him to make
[ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003.md) to go to
[Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002.md): and they made the
[ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003.md) in Eziongaber.  

<span id="037">37</span> Then [Eliezer](../ebd/ebd116.htm#007.md) the son
of Dodavah of [Mareshah](../ebd/ebd241.htm#009.md) prophesied against
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md), saying, Because thou hast joined
thyself with [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006.md), the LORD hath broken thy
works. And the [ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003.md) were broken, that they
were not able to go to [Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002.md).
