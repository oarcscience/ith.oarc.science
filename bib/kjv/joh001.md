### King James Version: John Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
with God, and the Word was God.  

<span id="002">2</span> The same was in the beginning with God.  

<span id="003">3</span> All things were made by him; and without him was
not any thing made that was made.  

<span id="004">4</span> In him was life; and the life was the light of
men.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the light shineth in
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008); and the
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) comprehended it not.  

<span id="006">6</span> There was a man sent from God, whose name was
John.  

<span id="007">7</span> The same came for a
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008), to bear
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) of the Light, that all men through him
might believe.  

<span id="008">8</span> He was not that Light, but was sent to bear
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) of that Light.  

<span id="009">9</span> That was the true Light, which lighteth every
man that cometh into the world.  

<span id="010">10</span> He was in the world, and the world was made by
him, and the world knew him not.  

<span id="011">11</span> He came unto his own, and his own received him
not.  

<span id="012">12</span> But as many as received him, to them gave he
power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his
name:  

<span id="013">13</span> Which were born, not of
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), nor of the will of the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), nor of the will of man, but of God.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the Word was made
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006), the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) as of
the only begotten of the Father,) full of [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000)
and truth.  

<span id="015">15</span> John bare [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) of
him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh
after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.  

<span id="016">16</span> And of his [fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007)
have all we received, and [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) for
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000).  

<span id="017">17</span> For the law was given by
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), but [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) and
truth came by [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="018">18</span> No man hath seen God at any time, the only
begotten Son, which is in the [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008) of the
Father, he hath declared him.  

<span id="019">19</span> And this is the record of John, when the Jews
sent priests and Levites from [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) to ask
him, Who art thou?  

<span id="020">20</span> And he confessed, and denied not; but
confessed, I am not the [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="021">21</span> And they asked him, What then? Art thou
[Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002)? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)? And he answered, No.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we
may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?  

<span id="023">23</span> He said, I am the voice of one crying in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), Make straight the way of the Lord,
as said the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)
[Esaias](../ebd/ebd124.htm#003).  

<span id="024">24</span> And they which were sent were of the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008).  

<span id="025">25</span> And they asked him, and said unto him, Why
baptizest thou then, if thou be not that
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), nor [Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002),
neither that [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)?  

<span id="026">26</span> John answered them, saying, I baptize with
water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;  

<span id="027">27</span> He it is, who coming after me is preferred
before me, whose shoe's [latchet](../ebd/ebd224.htm#006) I am not worthy
to unloose.  

<span id="028">28</span> These things were done in
[Bethabara](../ebd/ebd054.htm#004) beyond
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), where John was baptizing.  

<span id="029">29</span> The next day John seeth
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) coming unto him, and saith, Behold the
[Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003) of God, which taketh away the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) of the world.  

<span id="030">30</span> This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a
man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.  

<span id="031">31</span> And I knew him not: but that he should be made
manifest to [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), therefore am I come
baptizing with water.  

<span id="032">32</span> And John bare record, saying, I saw the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) descending from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) like a [dove](../ebd/ebd106.htm#007),
and it abode upon him.  

<span id="033">33</span> And I knew him not: but he that sent me to
baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) descending, and remaining on him, the
same is he which baptizeth with the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005).  

<span id="034">34</span> And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son
of God.  

<span id="035">35</span> Again the next day after John stood, and two of
his disciples;  

<span id="036">36</span> And looking upon [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
as he walked, he saith, Behold the [Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003) of
God!  

<span id="037">37</span> And the two disciples heard him speak, and they
followed [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="038">38</span> Then [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) turned, and
saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto
him, [Rabbi](../ebd/ebd304.htm#006), (which is to say, being
interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?  

<span id="039">39</span> He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and
saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the
tenth hour.  

<span id="040">40</span> One of the two which heard John speak, and
followed him, was [Andrew](../ebd/ebd023.htm#007),
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004) Peter's brother.  

<span id="041">41</span> He first findeth his own brother
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004), and saith unto him, We have found the
Messias, which is, being interpreted, the
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="042">42</span> And he brought him to
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006). And when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
beheld him, he said, Thou art [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004) the son of
Jona: thou shalt be called [Cephas](../ebd/ebd075.htm#005), which is by
interpretation, A [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005).  

<span id="043">43</span> The day following
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) would go forth into
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008), and findeth
[Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008), and saith unto him, Follow me.  

<span id="044">44</span> Now [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008) was of
[Bethsaida](../ebd/ebd056.htm#009), the city of
[Andrew](../ebd/ebd023.htm#007) and [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002).  

<span id="045">45</span> [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008) findeth
[Nathanael](../ebd/ebd267.htm#003), and saith unto him, We have found
him, of whom [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) in the law, and the
prophets, did write, [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) of
[Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007), the son of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005).  

<span id="046">46</span> And [Nathanael](../ebd/ebd267.htm#003) said
unto him, Can there any good thing come out of
[Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007)? [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008) saith
unto him, Come and see.  

<span id="047">47</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saw
[Nathanael](../ebd/ebd267.htm#003) coming to him, and saith of him,
Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!  

<span id="048">48</span> [Nathanael](../ebd/ebd267.htm#003) saith unto
him, Whence knowest thou me? [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered and
said unto him, Before that [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008) called thee,
when thou wast under the [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001) tree, I saw
thee.  

<span id="049">49</span> [Nathanael](../ebd/ebd267.htm#003) answered and
saith unto him, [Rabbi](../ebd/ebd304.htm#006), thou art the Son of God;
thou art the [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="050">50</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered and
said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the
[fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001) tree, believest thou? thou shalt see
greater things than these.  

<span id="051">51</span> And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say
unto you, Hereafter ye shall see [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) open,
and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
