### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> And when [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) saw
that it pleased the LORD to [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md)
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), he went not, as at other times, to seek
for [enchantments](../ebd/ebd120.htm#004.md), but he set his face toward
the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) lifted up
his eyes, and he saw [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) abiding in his
tents according to their tribes; and the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md)
of God came upon him.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he took up his
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md), and said,
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003) the son of [Beor](../ebd/ebd052.htm#009.md)
hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:  

<span id="004">4</span> He hath said, which heard the words of God,
which saw the [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md) of the Almighty, falling
into a [trance](../ebd/ebd371.htm#006.md), but having his eyes open:  

<span id="005">5</span> How goodly are thy tents, O
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and thy tabernacles, O
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)!  

<span id="006">6</span> As the valleys are they spread forth, as
[gardens](../ebd/ebd143.htm#001.md) by the river's side, as the trees of
lign [aloes](../ebd/ebd018.htm#004.md) which the LORD hath planted, and as
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md) trees beside the waters.  

<span id="007">7</span> He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and
his seed shall be in many waters, and his [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
shall be higher than [Agag](../ebd/ebd011.htm#008.md), and his kingdom
shall be exalted.  

<span id="008">8</span> God brought him forth out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md); he hath as it were the strength of an
[unicorn](../ebd/ebd374.htm#007.md): he shall eat up the nations his
enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his
[arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a
great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and
cursed is he that curseth thee.  

<span id="010">10</span> And Balak's [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) was
kindled against [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md), and he smote his hands
together: and [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md) said unto
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md), I called thee to
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast
altogether blessed them these three times.  

<span id="011">11</span> Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought
to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back
from honour.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) said unto
[Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md), Spake I not also to thy messengers which
thou sentest unto me, saying,  

<span id="013">13</span> If [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md) would give me
his house full of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) and
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), I cannot go beyond the commandment of the
LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD
saith, that will I speak?  

<span id="014">14</span> And now, behold, I go unto my people: come
therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy
people in the latter days.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he took up his
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md), and said,
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003) the son of [Beor](../ebd/ebd052.htm#009.md)
hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:  

<span id="016">16</span> He hath said, which heard the words of God, and
knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md) of the Almighty, falling into a
[trance](../ebd/ebd371.htm#006.md), but having his eyes open:  

<span id="017">17</span> I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold
him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), and a [Sceptre](../ebd/ebd323.htm#006.md)
shall rise out of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and shall smite the
corners of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), and destroy all the children
of [Sheth](../ebd/ebd336.htm#004.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md) shall be a
possession, [Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004.md) also shall be a possession for
his enemies; and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) shall do valiantly.  

<span id="019">19</span> Out of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) shall
come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth
of the city.  

<span id="020">20</span> And when he looked on
[Amalek](../ebd/ebd018.htm#009.md), he took up his
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md), and said,
[Amalek](../ebd/ebd018.htm#009.md) was the first of the nations; but his
latter end shall be that he perish for ever.  

<span id="021">21</span> And he looked on the
[Kenites](../ebd/ebd217.htm#004.md), and took up his
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md), and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace,
and thou puttest thy nest in a [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until
[Asshur](../ebd/ebd035.htm#002.md) shall carry thee away
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And he took up his
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md), and said, Alas, who shall live when
God doeth this!  

<span id="024">24</span> And [ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003.md) shall come
from the coast of [Chittim](../ebd/ebd081.htm#003.md), and shall afflict
[Asshur](../ebd/ebd035.htm#002.md), and shall afflict
[Eber](../ebd/ebd112.htm#001.md), and he also shall perish for ever.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) rose up,
and went and returned to his place: and [Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006.md)
also went his way.
