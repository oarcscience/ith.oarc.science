### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> In those days came John the Baptist, preaching
in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of Judaea,  

<span id="002">2</span> And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) is at hand.  

<span id="003">3</span> For this is he that was spoken of by the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) [Esaias](../ebd/ebd124.htm#003),
saying, The voice of one crying in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
make his paths straight.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the same John had his raiment of camel's
hair, and a leathern [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005) about his loins;
and his meat was locusts and wild [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001).  

<span id="005">5</span> Then went out to him
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and all Judaea, and all the region
round about [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004),  

<span id="006">6</span> And were baptized of him in
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), confessing their sins.  

<span id="007">7</span> But when he saw many of the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) and
[Sadducees](../ebd/ebd318.htm#003) come to his baptism, he said unto
them, O [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) of vipers, who hath warned
you to flee from the wrath to come?  

<span id="008">8</span> Bring forth therefore fruits meet for
[repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008):  

<span id="009">9</span> And think not to say within yourselves, We have
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) to our father: for I say unto you, that
God is able of these stones to raise up children unto
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005).  

<span id="010">10</span> And now also the [axe](../ebd/ebd037.htm#003)
is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth
not forth good [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) is hewn down, and cast
into the fire.  

<span id="011">11</span> I indeed baptize you with water unto
[repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008). but he that cometh after me is
mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize
you with the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005), and with fire:  

<span id="012">12</span> Whose [fan](../ebd/ebd131.htm#001) is in his
hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000) into the [garner](../ebd/ebd143.htm#005);
but he will burn up the [chaff](../ebd/ebd075.htm#007) with unquenchable
fire.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then cometh [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) from
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008) to [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) unto
John, to be baptized of him.  

<span id="014">14</span> But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be
baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answering
said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil
all [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004). Then he suffered him.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), when he was
baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens
were opened unto him, and he saw the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of
God descending like a [dove](../ebd/ebd106.htm#007), and lighting upon
him:  

<span id="017">17</span> And lo a voice from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom
I am well pleased.
