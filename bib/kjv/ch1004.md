and Ashan, five cities:  

<span id="033">33</span> And all their [villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md)
that were round about the same cities, unto
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md). These were their habitations, and their
genealogy.  

<span id="034">34</span> And Meshobab, and Jamlech, and Joshah, the son
of [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007.md),

[Jedaiah](../ebd/ebd199.htm#006.md), the son of
[Shimri](../ebd/ebd338.htm#006.md), the son of
[Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005.md);  

<span id="038">38</span> These mentioned by their names were princes in
their families: and the house of their fathers increased greatly.  

<span id="039">39</span> And they went to the entrance of
[Gedor](../ebd/ebd145.htm#003.md), even unto the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) side of the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md), to seek pasture for their flocks.  

<span id="040">40</span> And they found [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md)
pasture and good, and the land was wide, and quiet, and peaceable; for
they of [Ham](../ebd/ebd160.htm#003.md) had dwelt there of old.  

<span id="041">41</span> And these written by name came in the days of
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and smote their tents, and the
habitations that were found there, and destroyed them utterly unto this
day, and dwelt in their rooms: because there was pasture there for their
flocks.  

<span id="042">42</span> And some of them, even of the sons of
[Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002.md), five hundred men, went to
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004.md), having for
their captains [Pelatiah](../ebd/ebd288.htm#006.md), and Neariah, and
Rephaiah, and [Uzziel](../ebd/ebd376.htm#005.md), the sons of
[Ishi](../ebd/ebd190.htm#004.md).  

<span id="043">43</span> And they smote the rest of the Amalekites that
were escaped, and dwelt there unto this day.
