### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> The same day went [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
out of the house, and sat by the sea side.  

<span id="002">2</span> And great multitudes were gathered together unto
him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood
on the shore.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he spake many things unto them in parables,
saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;  

<span id="004">4</span> And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way
side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:  

<span id="005">5</span> Some fell upon stony places, where they had not
much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness
of earth:  

<span id="006">6</span> And when the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) was
up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered
away.  

<span id="007">7</span> And some fell among thorns; and the thorns
sprung up, and choked them:  

<span id="008">8</span> But other fell into good ground, and brought
forth [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md), some an hundredfold, some
sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.  

<span id="009">9</span> Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why
speakest thou unto them in parables?  

<span id="011">11</span> He answered and said unto them, Because it is
given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), but to them it is not given.  

<span id="012">12</span> For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and
he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be
taken away even that he hath.  

<span id="013">13</span> Therefore speak I to them in parables: because
they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they
understand.  

<span id="014">14</span> And in them is fulfilled the
[prophecy](../ebd/ebd300.htm#007) of [Esaias](../ebd/ebd124.htm#003.md),
which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and
seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:  

<span id="015">15</span> For this people's heart is waxed gross, and
their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at
any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and
should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I
should heal them.  

<span id="016">16</span> But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and
your ears, for they hear.  

<span id="017">17</span> For verily I say unto you, That many prophets
and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and
have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not
heard them.  

<span id="018">18</span> Hear ye therefore the
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md) of the sower.  

<span id="019">19</span> When any one heareth the word of the kingdom,
and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away
that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the
way side.  

<span id="020">20</span> But he that received the seed into stony
places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy
receiveth it;  

<span id="021">21</span> Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for
a while: for when [tribulation](../ebd/ebd372.htm#005.md) or
[persecution](../ebd/ebd290.htm#007.md) ariseth because of the word, by and
by he is offended.  

<span id="022">22</span> He also that received seed among the thorns is
he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the
deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.  

<span id="023">23</span> But he that received seed into the good ground
is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md), and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold,
some sixty, some thirty.  

<span id="024">24</span> Another [parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md) put he
forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)
is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:  

<span id="025">25</span> But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed
[tares](../ebd/ebd359.htm#000) among the [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md),
and went his way.  

<span id="026">26</span> But when the [blade](../ebd/ebd060.htm#003.md) was
sprung up, and brought forth [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md), then
appeared the [tares](../ebd/ebd359.htm#000.md) also.  

<span id="027">27</span> So the servants of the householder came and
said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from
whence then hath it [tares](../ebd/ebd359.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="028">28</span> He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The
servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?  

<span id="029">29</span> But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the
[tares](../ebd/ebd359.htm#000.md), ye root up also the
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md) with them.  

<span id="030">30</span> Let both grow together until the
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md): and in the time of
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md) I will say to the reapers, Gather ye
together first the [tares](../ebd/ebd359.htm#000.md), and bind them in
bundles to burn them: but gather the [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md) into
my [barn](../ebd/ebd045.htm#004.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> Another [parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md) put he
forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)
is like to a [grain](../ebd/ebd154.htm#003.md) of
[mustard](../ebd/ebd262.htm#009.md) seed, which a man took, and sowed in
his field:  

<span id="032">32</span> Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but
when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree,
so that the birds of the air come and [lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002.md) in
the branches thereof.  

<span id="033">33</span> Another [parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md) spake
he unto them; The kingdom of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) is like
unto [leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000.md), which a woman took, and hid in
three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.  

<span id="034">34</span> All these things spake
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) unto the multitude in parables; and
without a [parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md) spake he not unto them:  

<span id="035">35</span> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by
the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md), saying, I will open my mouth in
parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the
foundation of the world.  

<span id="036">36</span> Then [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) sent the
multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto
him, saying, Declare unto us the [parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md) of the
[tares](../ebd/ebd359.htm#000.md) of the field.  

<span id="037">37</span> He answered and said unto them, He that soweth
the good seed is the Son of man;  

<span id="038">38</span> The field is the world; the good seed are the
children of the kingdom; but the [tares](../ebd/ebd359.htm#000.md) are the
children of the wicked one;  

<span id="039">39</span> The enemy that sowed them is the
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007); the [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md) is
the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.  

<span id="040">40</span> As therefore the [tares](../ebd/ebd359.htm#000.md)
are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this
world.  

<span id="041">41</span> The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and
they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them
which do iniquity;  

<span id="042">42</span> And shall cast them into a
[furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000.md) of fire: there shall be wailing and
gnashing of teeth.  

<span id="043">43</span> Then shall the righteous shine forth as the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath
ears to hear, let him hear.  

<span id="044">44</span> Again, the kingdom of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) is like unto treasure hid in a field;
the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth
and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.  

<span id="045">45</span> Again, the kingdom of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) is like unto a
[merchant](../ebd/ebd249.htm#003.md) man, seeking goodly pearls:  

<span id="046">46</span> Who, when he had found one
[pearl](../ebd/ebd287.htm#007.md) of great price, went and sold all that he
had, and bought it.  

<span id="047">47</span> Again, the kingdom of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) is like unto a
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002.md), that was cast into the sea, and gathered
of every kind:  

<span id="048">48</span> Which, when it was full, they drew to shore,
and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad
away.  

<span id="049">49</span> So shall it be at the end of the world: the
angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,  

<span id="050">50</span> And shall cast them into the
[furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000.md) of fire: there shall be wailing and
gnashing of teeth.  

<span id="051">51</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saith unto them,
Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.  

<span id="052">52</span> Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe
which is instructed unto the kingdom of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)
is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of
his treasure things new and old.  

<span id="053">53</span> And it came to pass, that when
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) had finished these parables, he departed
thence.  

<span id="054">54</span> And when he was come into his own country, he
taught them in their [synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009.md), insomuch that
they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and
these mighty works?  

<span id="055">55</span> Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his
mother called [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md)? and his brethren,
[James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md), and Joses, and
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004), and [Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001.md)?  

<span id="056">56</span> And his sisters, are they not all with us?
Whence then hath this man all these things?  

<span id="057">57</span> And they were offended in him. But
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto them, A
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) is not without honour, save in his own
country, and in his own house.  

<span id="058">58</span> And he did not many mighty works there because
of their unbelief.
