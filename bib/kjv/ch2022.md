### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> And the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) made [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006)
his youngest son [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) in his stead: for the
band of men that came with the Arabians to the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) had slain all the eldest. So
[Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006) the son of
[Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) reigned.  

<span id="002">2</span> Forty and two years old was
[Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006) when he began to reign, and he reigned
one year in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005). His mother's name also
was [Athaliah](../ebd/ebd036.htm#002) the daughter of
[Omri](../ebd/ebd278.htm#006).  

<span id="003">3</span> He also walked in the ways of the house of
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002): for his mother was his
[counsellor](../ebd/ebd091.htm#005) to do wickedly.  

<span id="004">4</span> Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD
like the house of [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002): for they were his
counsellors after the death of his father to his
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004).  

<span id="005">5</span> He walked also after their counsel, and went
with [Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005) the son of
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to war against
[Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002) at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote
[Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003).  

<span id="006">6</span> And he returned to be healed in
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008) because of the wounds which were given
him at [Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005), when he fought with
[Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002). And [Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005) the
son of [Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) went down to see
[Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005) the son of
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) at [Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008),
because he was sick.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) of
[Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006) was of God by coming to
[Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003): for when he was come, he went out with
[Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005) against [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007)
the son of [Nimshi](../ebd/ebd273.htm#005), whom the LORD had anointed
to cut off the house of [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002).  

<span id="008">8</span> And it came to pass, that, when
[Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007) was executing judgment upon the house of
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002), and found the princes of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and the sons of the brethren of
[Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006), that ministered to
[Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006), he slew them.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he sought [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006):
and they caught him, (for he was hid in
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004),) and brought him to
[Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007): and when they had slain him, they buried
him: Because, said they, he is the son of
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006), who sought the LORD with all his
heart. So the house of [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006) had no power to
keep still the kingdom.  

<span id="010">10</span> But when [Athaliah](../ebd/ebd036.htm#002) the
mother of [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006) saw that her son was dead,
she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="011">11</span> But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), took [Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000) the
son of [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006), and stole him from among the
king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber.
So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005), the wife of
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),
(for she was the sister of [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006),) hid him
from [Athaliah](../ebd/ebd036.htm#002), so that she slew him not.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he was with them hid in the house of God
six years: and [Athaliah](../ebd/ebd036.htm#002) reigned over the
land.
