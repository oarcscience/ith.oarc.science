### King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> Now after this it came to pass, that
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) smote the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), and subdued them, and took
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009.md) and her towns out of the hand of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he smote [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md); and
the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) smote
[Hadarezer](../ebd/ebd157.htm#004) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Zobah](../ebd/ebd395.htm#005) unto [Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005.md), as
he went to stablish his dominion by the river
[Euphrates](../ebd/ebd127.htm#001.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) took from him
a thousand chariots, and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) thousand
horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
also houghed all the [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md) horses, but
reserved of them an hundred chariots.  

<span id="005">5</span> And when the Syrians of
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md) came to help
[Hadarezer](../ebd/ebd157.htm#004) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Zobah](../ebd/ebd395.htm#005), [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) slew of
the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) put
garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, and
brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
whithersoever he went.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) took the
shields of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) that were on the servants of
[Hadarezer](../ebd/ebd157.htm#004.md), and brought them to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Likewise from Tibhath, and from
[Chun](../ebd/ebd082.htm#009.md), cities of
[Hadarezer](../ebd/ebd157.htm#004.md), brought
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) very much [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md),
wherewith [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) made the brasen sea, and the
pillars, and the vessels of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Now when Tou [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005) heard how [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
had smitten all the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of
[Hadarezer](../ebd/ebd157.htm#004) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Zobah](../ebd/ebd395.htm#005.md);  

<span id="010">10</span> He sent [Hadoram](../ebd/ebd158.htm#001.md) his
son to [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), to
enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought
against [Hadarezer](../ebd/ebd157.htm#004.md), and smitten him; (for
[Hadarezer](../ebd/ebd157.htm#004) had war with Tou;.md) and with him all
manner of vessels of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) and
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Them also [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) dedicated unto the LORD, with the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md)
that he brought from all these nations; from
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001), and from [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md),
and from the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002.md), and from the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), and from
[Amalek](../ebd/ebd018.htm#009.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> Moreover [Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005.md) the
son of [Zeruiah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#009.md) slew of the Edomites in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008.md)
eighteen thousand.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he put garrisons in
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md); and all the Edomites became David's
servants. Thus the LORD preserved [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
whithersoever he went.  

<span id="014">14</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) reigned over
all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and executed judgment and
[justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007.md) among all his people.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) the son of
[Zeruiah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#009.md) was over the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007); and [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md)
the son of Ahilud, [recorder](../ebd/ebd308.htm#005.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008.md) the son of
[Ahitub](../ebd/ebd015.htm#001), and [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000.md)
the son of [Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005.md), were the priests; and
[Shavsha](../ebd/ebd332.htm#002.md) was scribe;  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003.md) the son of
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md) was over the Cherethites and the
[Pelethites](../ebd/ebd289.htm#000.md); and the sons of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) were chief about the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).
