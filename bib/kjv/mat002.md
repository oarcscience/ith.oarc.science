### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> Now when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) was born
in [Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005.md) of Judaea in the days of Herod the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), behold, there came
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) men from the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md)
to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md),  

<span id="002">2</span> Saying, Where is he that is born
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of the Jews? for we have seen his star in
the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md), and are come to
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) him.  

<span id="003">3</span> When Herod the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) had
heard these things, he was troubled, and all
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) with him.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when he had gathered all the chief priests
and [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md) of the people together, he demanded
of them where [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) should be born.  

<span id="005">5</span> And they said unto him, In
[Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005.md) of Judaea: for thus it is written by
the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md),  

<span id="006">6</span> And thou [Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005.md), in
the land of [Juda](../ebd/ebd212.htm#006.md), art not the least among the
princes of [Juda](../ebd/ebd212.htm#006.md): for out of thee shall come a
Governor, that shall rule my people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Then Herod, when he had privily called the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) men, enquired of them diligently what time
the star appeared.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he sent them to
[Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005.md), and said, Go and search diligently
for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again,
that I may come and [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) him also.  

<span id="009">9</span> When they had heard the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), they departed; and, lo, the star, which
they saw in the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md), went before them, till it
came and stood over where the young child was.  

<span id="010">10</span> When they saw the star, they rejoiced with
exceeding great joy.  

<span id="011">11</span> And when they were come into the house, they
saw the young child with [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md) his mother, and
fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures,
they presented unto him gifts; [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and
[frankincense](../ebd/ebd138.htm#004.md) and
[myrrh](../ebd/ebd263.htm#003.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And being warned of God in a
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md) that they should not return to Herod,
they departed into their own country another way.  

<span id="013">13</span> And when they were departed, behold, the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the Lord appeareth to
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) in a [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md),
saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and be thou there until I bring thee
word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.  

<span id="014">14</span> When he arose, he took the young child and his
mother by night, and departed into [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md):  

<span id="015">15</span> And was there until the death of Herod: that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md), saying, Out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) have I called my son.  

<span id="016">16</span> Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of
the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) men, was exceeding wroth, and sent
forth, and slew all the children that were in
[Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005.md), and in all the coasts thereof, from
two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently
enquired of the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) men.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by
Jeremy the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md), saying,  

<span id="018">18</span> In [Rama](../ebd/ebd306.htm#004.md) was there a
voice heard, [lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005.md), and weeping, and
great mourning, [Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004.md) weeping for her
children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.  

<span id="019">19</span> But when Herod was dead, behold, an
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the Lord appeareth in a
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005) to [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md),  

<span id="020">20</span> Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his
mother, and go into the land of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): for
they are dead which sought the young child's life.  

<span id="021">21</span> And he arose, and took the young child and his
mother, and came into the land of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> But when he heard that
[Archelaus](../ebd/ebd029.htm#001.md) did reign in Judaea in the room of
his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being
warned of God in a [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md), he turned aside into
the parts of [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md):  

<span id="023">23</span> And he came and dwelt in a city called
[Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007.md): that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a
[Nazarene](../ebd/ebd267.htm#006.md).
