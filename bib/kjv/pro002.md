### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide
my commandments with thee;  

<span id="002">2</span> So that thou incline thine
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to
understanding;  

<span id="003">3</span> Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest
up thy voice for understanding;  

<span id="004">4</span> If thou seekest her as
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and searchest for her as for hid
treasures;  

<span id="005">5</span> Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD,
and find the knowledge of God.  

<span id="006">6</span> For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth
cometh knowledge and understanding.  

<span id="007">7</span> He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he
is a [buckler](../ebd/ebd066.htm#000) to them that walk uprightly.  

<span id="008">8</span> He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth
the way of his saints.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then shalt thou understand
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), and judgment, and equity; yea,
every good path.  

<span id="010">10</span> When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and
knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;  

<span id="011">11</span> Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding
shall keep thee:  

<span id="012">12</span> To deliver thee from the way of the evil man,
from the man that speaketh froward things;  

<span id="013">13</span> Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in
the ways of [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008);  

<span id="014">14</span> Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the
frowardness of the wicked;  

<span id="015">15</span> Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in
their paths:  

<span id="016">16</span> To deliver thee from the strange woman, even
from the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) which flattereth with her
words;  

<span id="017">17</span> Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and
forgetteth the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of her God.  

<span id="018">18</span> For her house inclineth unto death, and her
paths unto the dead.  

<span id="019">19</span> None that go unto her return again, neither
take they hold of the paths of life.  

<span id="020">20</span> That thou mayest walk in the way of good men,
and keep the paths of the righteous.  

<span id="021">21</span> For the upright shall dwell in the land, and
the perfect shall remain in it.  

<span id="022">22</span> But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth,
and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
