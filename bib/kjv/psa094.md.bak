### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 94

<span id="001">1</span> O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God,
to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.  

<span id="002">2</span> Lift up thyself, thou
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) of the earth: render a reward to the
proud.  

<span id="003">3</span> LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall
the wicked triumph?  

<span id="004">4</span> How long shall they utter and speak hard things?
and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?  

<span id="005">5</span> They break in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md)
thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.  

<span id="006">6</span> They slay the widow and the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), and [murder](../ebd/ebd262.htm#002.md)
the fatherless.  

<span id="007">7</span> Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither
shall the God of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) regard it.  

<span id="008">8</span> Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye
fools, when will ye be [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md)?  

<span id="009">9</span> He that planted the
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md), shall he not hear? he that formed the eye,
shall he not see?  

<span id="010">10</span> He that chastiseth the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), shall not he correct? he that teacheth
man knowledge, shall not he know?  

<span id="011">11</span> The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they
are vanity.  

<span id="012">12</span> Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O
LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;  

<span id="013">13</span> That thou mayest give him rest from the days of
adversity, until the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md) be digged for the
wicked.  

<span id="014">14</span> For the LORD will not cast off his people,
neither will he forsake his inheritance.  

<span id="015">15</span> But judgment shall return unto
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md): and all the upright in heart
shall follow it.  

<span id="016">16</span> Who will rise up for me against the evildoers?
or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?  

<span id="017">17</span> Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had
almost dwelt in silence.  

<span id="018">18</span> When I said, My foot slippeth; thy
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md), O LORD, held me up.  

<span id="019">19</span> In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy
comforts delight my soul.  

<span id="020">20</span> Shall the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of
iniquity have [fellowship](../ebd/ebd132.htm#002.md) with thee, which
frameth mischief by a law?  

<span id="021">21</span> They gather themselves together against the
soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md) of my refuge.  

<span id="023">23</span> And he shall bring upon them their own
iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD
our God shall cut them off.
