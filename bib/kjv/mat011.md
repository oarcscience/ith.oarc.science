### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, when
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) had made an end of commanding his twelve
disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.  

<span id="002">2</span> Now when John had heard in the
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006) the works of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), he sent two of his disciples,  

<span id="003">3</span> And said unto him, Art thou he that should come,
or do we look for another?  

<span id="004">4</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered and said
unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and
see:  

<span id="005">5</span> The [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009) receive their
sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear,
the dead are raised up, and the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) have the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) preached to them.  

<span id="006">6</span> And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be
offended in me.  

<span id="007">7</span> And as they departed,
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) began to say unto the multitudes
concerning John, What went ye out into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) to see? A
[reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000) shaken with the wind?  

<span id="008">8</span> But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed
in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings'
houses.  

<span id="009">9</span> But what went ye out for to see? A
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)? yea, I say unto you, and more than a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008).  

<span id="010">10</span> For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold,
I send my [messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005) before thy face, which
shall prepare thy way before thee.  

<span id="011">11</span> Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born
of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist:
notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) is greater than he.  

<span id="012">12</span> And from the days of John the Baptist until now
the kingdom of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) suffereth violence, and
the violent take it by force.  

<span id="013">13</span> For all the prophets and the law prophesied
until John.  

<span id="014">14</span> And if ye will receive it, this is
[Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002), which was for to come.  

<span id="015">15</span> He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.  

<span id="016">16</span> But whereunto shall I liken this
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008)? It is like unto children
[sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009) in the markets, and
[calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007) unto their fellows,  

<span id="017">17</span> And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have
not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.  

<span id="018">18</span> For John came neither
[eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006) nor drinking, and they say, He hath a
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007).  

<span id="019">19</span> The Son of man came
[eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006) and drinking, and they say, Behold a man
gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But
wisdom is justified of her children.  

<span id="020">20</span> Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein
most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:  

<span id="021">21</span> Woe unto thee,
[Chorazin](../ebd/ebd081.htm#007)! woe unto thee,
[Bethsaida](../ebd/ebd056.htm#009)! for if the mighty works, which were
done in you, had been done in [Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001) and
[Sidon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#000), they would have repented long ago in
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001) and [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000).  

<span id="022">22</span> But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable
for [Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001) and [Sidon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#000) at
the day of judgment, than for you.  

<span id="023">23</span> And thou, [Capernaum](../ebd/ebd071.htm#007),
which art exalted unto [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), shalt be brought
down to [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003): for if the mighty works, which
have been done in thee, had been done in [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004),
it would have remained until this day.  

<span id="024">24</span> But I say unto you, That it shall be more
tolerable for the land of [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004) in the day of
judgment, than for thee.  

<span id="025">25</span> At that time [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) and earth, because thou hast hid these
things from the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) and prudent, and hast
revealed them unto babes.  

<span id="026">26</span> Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy
sight.  

<span id="027">27</span> All things are delivered unto me of my Father:
and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the
Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.  

<span id="028">28</span> Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy
laden, and I will give you rest.  

<span id="029">29</span> Take my [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) upon you,
and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find
rest unto your souls.  

<span id="030">30</span> For my [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) is easy,
and my [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) is light.
