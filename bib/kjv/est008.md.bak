### King James Version: Esther Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> On that day did the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md) give
the house of [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004.md) the Jews' enemy unto
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md). And
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md) came before the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001); for [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md) had
told what he was unto her.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) took off
his [ring](../ebd/ebd313.htm#007.md), which he had taken from
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004.md), and gave it unto
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005). And [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md)
set [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md) over the house of
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md) spake yet
again before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and fell down at his
feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) the [Agagite](../ebd/ebd011.htm#009.md), and
his device that he had devised against the Jews.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) held out
the golden [sceptre](../ebd/ebd323.htm#006.md) toward
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006). So [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md)
arose, and stood before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),  

<span id="005">5</span> And said, If it please the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and if I have favour in his sight, and
the thing seem right before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and I be
pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised
by [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004.md) the son of
[Hammedatha](../ebd/ebd160.htm#008.md) the
[Agagite](../ebd/ebd011.htm#009.md), which he wrote to destroy the Jews
which are in all the king's provinces:  

<span id="006">6</span> For how can I endure to see the evil that shall
come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md) of my kindred?  

<span id="007">7</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md) said unto
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md) and
to [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005) the [Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004.md),
Behold, I have given [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md) the house of
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004.md), and him they have hanged upon the
[gallows](../ebd/ebd142.htm#005.md), because he laid his hand upon the
Jews.  

<span id="008">8</span> Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in
the king's name, and [seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002.md) it with the king's
[ring](../ebd/ebd313.htm#007): for the [writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005.md)
which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's
[ring](../ebd/ebd313.htm#007.md), may no man reverse.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then were the king's
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md) called at that time in the third month,
that is, the month [Sivan](../ebd/ebd346.htm#000.md), on the three and
twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md) commanded unto the Jews, and to the
lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from
[India](../ebd/ebd188.htm#003) unto [Ethiopia](../ebd/ebd126.htm#005.md),
an hundred twenty and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) provinces, unto
every province according to the [writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005.md)
thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews
according to their [writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005.md), and according to
their language.  

<span id="010">10</span> And he wrote in the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the
king's [ring](../ebd/ebd313.htm#007.md), and sent letters by posts on
horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:  

<span id="011">11</span> Wherein the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together,
and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay and to cause to perish,
all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both
little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,  

<span id="012">12</span> Upon one day in all the provinces of
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md),
namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month
[Adar](../ebd/ebd008.htm#002.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> The copy of the
[writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005.md) for a commandment to be given in every
province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be
ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.  

<span id="014">14</span> So the posts that rode upon mules and camels
went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And
the decree was given at [Shushan](../ebd/ebd342.htm#003.md) the
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md) went out
from the presence of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) in royal
[apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000) of [blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003.md) and
white, and with a great [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and with a garment of fine
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md) and purple: and the city of
[Shushan](../ebd/ebd342.htm#003.md) rejoiced and was glad.  

<span id="016">16</span> The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and
honour.  

<span id="017">17</span> And in every province, and in every city,
whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had
joy and gladness, a [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) and a good day. And
many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews
fell upon them.
