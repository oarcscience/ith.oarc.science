### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> And when [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Arad](../ebd/ebd028.htm#000) the [Canaanite](../ebd/ebd070.htm#008),
which dwelt in the south, heard tell that
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) came by the way of the
[spies](../ebd/ebd349.htm#007); then he fought against
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and took some of them prisoners.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) vowed a vow
unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my
hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the LORD hearkened to the voice of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and delivered up the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007); and they utterly destroyed them and
their cities: and he called the name of the place
[Hormah](../ebd/ebd182.htm#002).  

<span id="004">4</span> And they journeyed from
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Hor](../ebd/ebd181.htm#008) by the way
of the Red sea, to compass the land of [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001):
and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the people spake against God, and against
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Wherefore have ye brought us up out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) to die in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005)? for there is no
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), neither is there any water; and our soul
loatheth this light [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006).  

<span id="006">6</span> And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the
people, and they [bit](../ebd/ebd059.htm#006) the people; and much
people of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) died.  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore the people came to
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), and said, We have sinned, for we have
spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he
take away the serpents from us. And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003)
prayed for the people.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Make thee a fiery
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009), and set it upon a pole: and it shall
come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it,
shall live.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) made a
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009) of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003), and
put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009) had bitten any man, when he beheld the
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009) of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003), he
lived.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) set forward, and pitched in
[Oboth](../ebd/ebd276.htm#008).  

<span id="011">11</span> And they journeyed from
[Oboth](../ebd/ebd276.htm#008), and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) which is before
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), toward the sunrising.  

<span id="012">12</span> From thence they removed, and pitched in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of Zared.  

<span id="013">13</span> From thence they removed, and pitched on the
other side of [Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000), which is in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) that cometh out of the coasts of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006): for [Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000) is
the border of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), between
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005) and the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006).  

<span id="014">14</span> Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of
the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of
[Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000),  

<span id="015">15</span> And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down
to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005).  

<span id="016">16</span> And from thence they went to
[Beer](../ebd/ebd050.htm#002): that is the well whereof the LORD spake
unto [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Gather the people together, and I
will give them water.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) sang this
song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:  

<span id="018">18</span> The princes digged the well, the nobles of the
people digged it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves.
And from the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) they went to
[Mattanah](../ebd/ebd243.htm#008):  

<span id="019">19</span> And from [Mattanah](../ebd/ebd243.htm#008) to
[Nahaliel](../ebd/ebd265.htm#000): and from
[Nahaliel](../ebd/ebd265.htm#000) to [Bamoth](../ebd/ebd043.htm#001):  

<span id="020">20</span> And from [Bamoth](../ebd/ebd043.htm#001) in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008), that is in the country of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), to the top of
[Pisgah](../ebd/ebd296.htm#004), which looketh toward
[Jeshimon](../ebd/ebd205.htm#002).  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) sent
messengers unto [Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006),
saying,  

<span id="022">22</span> Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn
into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of the waters of the well: but we will go
along by the king's high way, until we be past thy borders.  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002) would not
suffer [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to pass through his border: but
[Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002) gathered all his people together, and
went out against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005): and he came to
[Jahaz](../ebd/ebd195.htm#005), and fought against
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) smote him
with the edge of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and possessed his
land from [Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000) unto
[Jabbok](../ebd/ebd193.htm#006), even unto the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002): for the border of the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) was strong.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) took all
these cities: and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) dwelt in all the
cities of the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006), in
[Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009), and in all the
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003) thereof.  

<span id="026">26</span> For [Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009) was the
city of [Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
of the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006), who had fought against the
former [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005),
and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto
[Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000).  

<span id="027">27</span> Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come
into [Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009), let the city of
[Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002) be built and prepared:  

<span id="028">28</span> For there is a fire gone out of
[Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009), a flame from the city of
[Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002): it hath consumed Ar of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), and the lords of the high places of
[Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000).  

<span id="029">29</span> Woe to thee, [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005)!
thou art undone, O people of [Chemosh](../ebd/ebd078.htm#007): he hath
given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) unto [Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006).  

<span id="030">30</span> We have shot at them;
[Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009) is perished even unto
[Dibon](../ebd/ebd103.htm#005), and we have laid them waste even unto
[Nophah](../ebd/ebd275.htm#000), which reacheth unto
[Medeba](../ebd/ebd246.htm#000).  

<span id="031">31</span> Thus [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) dwelt in
the land of the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006).  

<span id="032">32</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) sent to spy
out [Jaazer](../ebd/ebd193.htm#002), and they took the
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003) thereof, and drove out the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006) that were there.  

<span id="033">33</span> And they turned and went up by the way of
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003): and [Og](../ebd/ebd277.htm#002) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003) went
out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at
[Edrei](../ebd/ebd113.htm#002).  

<span id="034">34</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Fear him not: for I have delivered him
into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to
him as thou didst unto [Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006),
which dwelt at [Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009).  

<span id="035">35</span> So they smote him, and his sons, and all his
people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his
land.
