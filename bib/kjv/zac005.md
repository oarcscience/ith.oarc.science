### King James Version: Zechariah Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and
looked, and behold a flying [roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I
answered, I see a flying [roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004); the length
thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then said he unto me, This is the
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) that goeth forth over the face of the
whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this
side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on
that side according to it.  

<span id="004">4</span> I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts,
and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of
him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst
of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the
stones thereof.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) that
talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and
see what is this that goeth forth.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an
[ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003) that goeth forth. He said moreover, This
is their resemblance through all the earth.  

<span id="007">7</span> And, behold, there was lifted up a
[talent](../ebd/ebd357.htm#009) of lead: and this is a woman that
sitteth in the midst of the [ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003).  

<span id="008">8</span> And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it
into the midst of the [ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003); and he cast the
weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and,
behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for
they had wings like the wings of a [stork](../ebd/ebd351.htm#007): and
they lifted up the [ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003) between the earth and
the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="010">10</span> Then said I to the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) that talked with me, Whither do these
bear the [ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003)?  

<span id="011">11</span> And he said unto me, To build it an house in
the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her
own base.
