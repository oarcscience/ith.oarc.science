### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay
it before thee, and pourtray upon it the city, even
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md):  

<span id="002">2</span> And lay siege against it, and build a fort
against it, and cast a [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) against it; set
the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md) also against it, and set battering
rams against it round about.  

<span id="003">3</span> Moreover take thou unto thee an
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004) [pan](../ebd/ebd283.htm#009.md), and set it
for a wall of [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md) between thee and the city:
and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt
lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the
iniquity of the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) upon it:
according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou
shalt bear their iniquity.  

<span id="005">5</span> For I have laid upon thee the years of their
iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety
days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again
on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) forty days: I have appointed thee each
day for a year.  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the
siege of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and thine arm shall be
uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.  

<span id="008">8</span> And, behold, I will lay
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003.md) upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee
from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.  

<span id="009">9</span> Take thou also unto thee
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000), and [barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003.md), and
[beans](../ebd/ebd048.htm#008), and [lentiles](../ebd/ebd227.htm#001.md),
and [millet](../ebd/ebd255.htm#003.md), and
[fitches](../ebd/ebd135.htm#000.md), and put them in one vessel, and make
thee [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) thereof, according to the number of
the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety
days shalt thou eat thereof.  

<span id="010">10</span> And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by
weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.  

<span id="011">11</span> Thou shalt [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) also
water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And thou shalt eat it as
[barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003.md) cakes, and thou shalt
[bake](../ebd/ebd042.htm#001) it with [dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003.md) that
cometh out of man, in their sight.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) eat their defiled
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) among the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md), whither I will drive them.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath
not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten
of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md); neither came there abominable
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) into my mouth.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee
cow's [dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003.md) for man's
[dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003.md), and thou shalt prepare thy
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) therewith.  

<span id="016">16</span> Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I
will break the staff of [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): and they shall eat
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) by weight, and with care; and they shall
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) water by measure, and with
astonishment:  

<span id="017">17</span> That they may want
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) and water, and be astonied one with
another, and consume away for their iniquity.
