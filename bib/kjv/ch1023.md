### King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 23

<span id="001">1</span> So when [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) was old
and full of days, he made [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) his son
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he gathered together all the princes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), with the priests and the Levites.  

<span id="003">3</span> Now the Levites were numbered from the age of
thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man,
was thirty and eight thousand.  

<span id="004">4</span> Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set
forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were
officers and judges:  

<span id="005">5</span> Moreover four thousand were porters; and four
thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), to praise therewith.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) divided them
into [courses](../ebd/ebd091.htm#006) among the sons of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006), namely, [Gershon](../ebd/ebd146.htm#009),
[Kohath](../ebd/ebd222.htm#001), and [Merari](../ebd/ebd249.htm#000).  

<span id="007">7</span> Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and
[Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002).  

<span id="008">8</span> The sons of Laadan; the chief was
[Jehiel](../ebd/ebd200.htm#003), and [Zetham](../ebd/ebd392.htm#000),
and [Joel](../ebd/ebd208.htm#005), three.  

<span id="009">9</span> The sons of [Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002);
Shelomith, and Haziel, and [Haran](../ebd/ebd163.htm#007), three. These
were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the sons of [Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002)
were, [Jahath](../ebd/ebd195.htm#004), [Zina](../ebd/ebd394.htm#001),
and [Jeush](../ebd/ebd206.htm#003), and [Beriah](../ebd/ebd053.htm#005).
These four were the sons of [Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002).  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Jahath](../ebd/ebd195.htm#004) was the
chief, and [Zizah](../ebd/ebd395.htm#002) the second: but
[Jeush](../ebd/ebd206.htm#003) and [Beriah](../ebd/ebd053.htm#005) had
not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their
father's house.  

<span id="012">12</span> The sons of [Kohath](../ebd/ebd222.htm#001);
[Amram](../ebd/ebd022.htm#001), [Izhar](../ebd/ebd192.htm#001),
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004), and [Uzziel](../ebd/ebd376.htm#005),
four.  

<span id="013">13</span> The sons of [Amram](../ebd/ebd022.htm#001);
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) and [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003): and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) was separated, that he should sanctify
the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) before the LORD, to
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) unto him, and to
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) in his name for ever.  

<span id="014">14</span> Now concerning [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003)
the man of God, his sons were named of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006).  

<span id="015">15</span> The sons of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003)
were, [Gershom](../ebd/ebd146.htm#008), and
[Eliezer](../ebd/ebd116.htm#007).  

<span id="016">16</span> Of the sons of
[Gershom](../ebd/ebd146.htm#008), [Shebuel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#000) was
the chief.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the sons of
[Eliezer](../ebd/ebd116.htm#007) were, [Rehabiah](../ebd/ebd309.htm#005)
the chief. And [Eliezer](../ebd/ebd116.htm#007) had none other sons; but
the sons of [Rehabiah](../ebd/ebd309.htm#005) were very many.  

<span id="018">18</span> Of the sons of [Izhar](../ebd/ebd192.htm#001);
Shelomith the chief.  

<span id="019">19</span> Of the sons of [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004);
Jeriah the first, [Amariah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#002) the second,
[Jahaziel](../ebd/ebd195.htm#006) the third, and Jekameam the fourth.  

<span id="020">20</span> Of the sons of [Uzziel](../ebd/ebd376.htm#005);
[Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005) the first and Jesiah the second.  

<span id="021">21</span> The sons of [Merari](../ebd/ebd249.htm#000);
Mahli, and [Mushi](../ebd/ebd262.htm#005). The sons of Mahli;
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000), and [Kish](../ebd/ebd220.htm#007).  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) died, and
had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of
[Kish](../ebd/ebd220.htm#007) took them.  

<span id="023">23</span> The sons of [Mushi](../ebd/ebd262.htm#005);
Mahli, and [Eder](../ebd/ebd113.htm#000), and Jeremoth, three.  

<span id="024">24</span> These were the sons of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006) after the house of their fathers; even the
chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their
polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from
the age of twenty years and upward.  

<span id="025">25</span> For [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said, The
LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) hath given rest unto his
people, that they may dwell in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) for
ever:  

<span id="026">26</span> And also unto the Levites; they shall no more
carry the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003), nor any vessels of it for
the service thereof.  

<span id="027">27</span> For by the last words of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) the Levites were numbered from twenty
years old and above:  

<span id="028">28</span> Because their office was to wait on the sons of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) for the service of the house of the LORD,
in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy
things, and the work of the service of the house of God;  

<span id="029">29</span> Both for the
[shewbread](../ebd/ebd336.htm#008), and for the fine
[flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001) for meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and for the unleavened cakes, and for
that which is baked in the [pan](../ebd/ebd283.htm#009), and for that
which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;  

<span id="030">30</span> And to stand every morning to thank and praise
the LORD, and likewise at even:  

<span id="031">31</span> And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD
in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number,
according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the
LORD:  

<span id="032">32</span> And that they should keep the charge of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), and the charge of the holy place,
and the charge of the sons of [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) their
brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD.
