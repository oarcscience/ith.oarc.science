### King James Version: Esther Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> So the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) and
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) came to [banquet](../ebd/ebd043.htm#006.md)
with [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md) the
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said again
unto [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md) on the second day at the
[banquet](../ebd/ebd043.htm#006) of [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), What
is thy petition, [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md)
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md)? and it shall be granted thee: and what
is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the
kingdom.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md) the
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md) answered and said, If I have found favour
in thy sight, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and if it please the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), let my life be given me at my petition,
and my people at my request:  

<span id="004">4</span> For we are sold, I and my people, to be
destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for
bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could
not countervail the king's damage.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md) answered and said unto
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md), Who
is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md) said, The
[adversary](../ebd/ebd011.htm#001.md) and enemy is this wicked
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004). Then [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004.md) was
afraid before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) and the
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) arising
from the [banquet](../ebd/ebd043.htm#006.md) of
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) in his wrath went into the
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md) garden: and
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004.md) stood up to make request for his life to
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md); for
he saw that there was evil determined against him by the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) returned
out of the [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md) garden into the place of the
[banquet](../ebd/ebd043.htm#006) of [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md); and
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004.md) was fallen upon the bed whereon
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md) was. Then said the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), Will he force the
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md) also before me in the house? As the word
went out of king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.  

<span id="009">9</span> And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said
before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), Behold also, the
[gallows](../ebd/ebd142.htm#005.md) fifty cubits high, which
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004.md) had made for
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md), who spoken good for the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), standeth in the house of
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004). Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
said, Hang him thereon.  

<span id="010">10</span> So they hanged [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004.md)
on the [gallows](../ebd/ebd142.htm#005.md) that he had prepared for
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md). Then was the king's wrath pacified.
