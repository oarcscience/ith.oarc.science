### King James Version: Acts Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> And certain men which came down from Judaea
taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner
of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), ye cannot be saved.  

<span id="002">2</span> When therefore [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) and
[Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005.md) had no small dissension and
disputation with them, they determined that
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) and [Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005.md), and
certain other of them, should go up to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) unto the apostles and elders about
this question.  

<span id="003">3</span> And being brought on their way by the church,
they passed through [Phenice](../ebd/ebd293.htm#001.md) and
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md), declaring the
[conversion](../ebd/ebd089.htm#002.md) of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md): and they caused great joy unto all
the brethren.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when they were come to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), they were received of the church,
and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God
had done with them.  

<span id="005">5</span> But there rose up certain of the
[sect](../ebd/ebd325.htm#008) of the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md)
which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to
command them to keep the law of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And the apostles and elders came together for to
consider of this matter.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when there had been much disputing,
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) rose up, and said unto them, Men and
brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us,
that the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) by my mouth should hear the
word of the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md), and believe.  

<span id="008">8</span> And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md), giving them the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md), even as he did unto us;  

<span id="009">9</span> And put no difference between us and them,
purifying their hearts by faith.  

<span id="010">10</span> Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) upon the [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md) of
the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?  

<span id="011">11</span> But we believe that through the
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of the LORD
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) we shall
be saved, even as they.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave
audience to [Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005.md) and
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md), declaring what miracles and wonders God
had wrought among the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) by them.  

<span id="013">13</span> And after they had held their peace,
[James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md) answered, saying, Men and brethren,
hearken unto me:  

<span id="014">14</span> [Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002.md) hath declared
how God at the first did visit the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md), to
take out of them a people for his name.  

<span id="015">15</span> And to this agree the words of the prophets; as
it is written,  

<span id="016">16</span> After this I will return, and will build again
the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), which is fallen down; and I will build
again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:  

<span id="017">17</span> That the residue of men might seek after the
Lord, and all the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md), upon whom my name
is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.  

<span id="018">18</span> Known unto God are all his works from the
beginning of the world.  

<span id="019">19</span> Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not
them, which from among the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) are turned
to God:  

<span id="020">20</span> But that we write unto them, that they abstain
from pollutions of idols, and from [fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008.md),
and from things strangled, and from [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> For [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) of old time
hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues
every [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) day.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then pleased it the apostles and elders with
the whole church, to send [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) men of their
own company to [Antioch](../ebd/ebd025.htm#001.md) with
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) and [Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005.md);
namely, [Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001.md) surnamed
[Barsabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#008) and [Silas](../ebd/ebd343.htm#004.md),
chief men among the brethren:  

<span id="023">23</span> And they wrote letters by them after this
manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the
brethren which are of the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) in
[Antioch](../ebd/ebd025.htm#001) and [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md) and
[Cilicia](../ebd/ebd083.htm#003.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which
went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls,
saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no
such commandment:  

<span id="025">25</span> It seemed good unto us, being assembled with
one accord, to send [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) men unto you with
our beloved [Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005.md) and
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md),  

<span id="026">26</span> Men that have hazarded their lives for the name
of our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> We have sent therefore
[Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001) and [Silas](../ebd/ebd343.htm#004.md), who
shall also tell you the same things by mouth.  

<span id="028">28</span> For it seemed good to the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md), and to us, to lay upon you no greater
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md) than these necessary things;  

<span id="029">29</span> That ye abstain from meats offered to idols,
and from [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), and from things strangled, and
from [fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008.md): from which if ye keep
yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.  

<span id="030">30</span> So when they were dismissed, they came to
[Antioch](../ebd/ebd025.htm#001.md): and when they had gathered the
multitude together, they delivered the epistle:  

<span id="031">31</span> Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the
consolation.  

<span id="032">32</span> And [Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001.md) and
[Silas](../ebd/ebd343.htm#004.md), being prophets also themselves, exhorted
the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.  

<span id="033">33</span> And after they had tarried there a space, they
were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.  

<span id="034">34</span> Notwithstanding it pleased
[Silas](../ebd/ebd343.htm#004.md) to abide there still.  

<span id="035">35</span> [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) also and
[Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005.md) continued in
[Antioch](../ebd/ebd025.htm#001.md), teaching and preaching the word of the
Lord, with many others also.  

<span id="036">36</span> And some days after
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) said unto
[Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005.md), Let us go again and visit our
brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and
see how they do.  

<span id="037">37</span> And [Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005.md)
determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.  

<span id="038">38</span> But [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) thought not
good to take him with them, who departed from them from
[Pamphylia](../ebd/ebd283.htm#008.md), and went not with them to the
work.  

<span id="039">39</span> And the contention was so sharp between them,
that they departed asunder one from the other: and so
[Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005.md) took Mark, and sailed unto
[Cyprus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#003.md);  

<span id="040">40</span> And [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) chose
[Silas](../ebd/ebd343.htm#004.md), and departed, being recommended by the
brethren unto the [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of God.  

<span id="041">41</span> And he went through
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002) and [Cilicia](../ebd/ebd083.htm#003.md),
confirming the churches.
