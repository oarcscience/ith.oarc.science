</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd039.htm#007">Baalim</A>, and burned <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> to graven images.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;I taught <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;I drew them with cords of a man, with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</A> of love: and I was to them as they that take off the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;He shall not return into the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and the Assyrian shall be his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, because they refused to return.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;How shall I give thee up, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>? how shall I deliver thee, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>?  how shall I make thee as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd009.htm#003">Admah</A>? how shall I set thee as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#009">Zeboim</A>? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;I will not execute the fierceness of mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, I will not return to destroy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.<BR>
</P>
