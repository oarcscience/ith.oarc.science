### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 49

<span id="001">1</span> Hear this, all ye people; give
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md), all ye inhabitants of the world:  

<span id="002">2</span> Both low and high, rich and
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), together.  

<span id="003">3</span> My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the
meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.  

<span id="004">4</span> I will incline mine [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md)
to a [parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md): I will open my dark saying upon
the [harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil,
when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?  

<span id="006">6</span> They that trust in their wealth, and boast
themselves in the multitude of their riches;  

<span id="007">7</span> None of them can by any means redeem his
brother, nor give to God a [ransom](../ebd/ebd307.htm#005.md) for him:  

<span id="008">8</span> (For the [redemption](../ebd/ebd308.htm#009.md) of
their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)  

<span id="009">9</span> That he should still live for ever, and not see
corruption.  

<span id="010">10</span> For he seeth that [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md)
men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave
their wealth to others.  

<span id="011">11</span> Their inward thought is, that their houses
shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations;
they call their lands after their own names.  

<span id="012">12</span> Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not:
he is like the beasts that perish.  

<span id="013">13</span> This their way is their folly: yet their
posterity approve their sayings. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> Like [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) they are
laid in the [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md); death shall feed on them;
and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their
beauty shall consume in the [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md) from their
dwelling.  

<span id="015">15</span> But God will redeem my soul from the power of
the [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md): for he shall receive me.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when
the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of his house is increased;  

<span id="017">17</span> For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away:
his [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) shall not descend after him.  

<span id="018">18</span> Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and
men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.  

<span id="019">19</span> He shall go to the
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) of his fathers; they shall never see
light.  

<span id="020">20</span> Man that is in honour, and understandeth not,
is like the beasts that perish.
