<span id="019">19</span> [Geber](../ebd/ebd144.htm#007.md) the son of Uri
was in the country of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md), in the country of
[Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006), and of [Og](../ebd/ebd277.htm#002.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003.md); and he
was the only officer which was in the land.  

<span id="020">20</span> [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) were many, as the sand which is by the
sea in multitude, [eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006.md) and drinking, and
making merry.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) reigned
over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), and unto the border of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): they brought presents, and served
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) all the days of his life.  

<span id="022">22</span> And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty
measures of fine [flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001.md), and threescore measures
of meal,  

<span id="023">23</span> Ten [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) oxen, and
twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), beside harts, and roebucks, and
fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.  

<span id="024">24</span> For he had dominion over all the region on this
side the river, from [Tiphsah](../ebd/ebd367.htm#007.md) even to Azzah,
over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides
round about him.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) dwelt safely, every man under his
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004) and under his [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001.md)
tree, from [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md) even to
[Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008.md), all the days of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) had forty
thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand
horsemen.  

<span id="027">27</span> And those officers provided victual for
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), and for
all that came unto [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) Solomon's table, every
man in his month: they lacked nothing.  

<span id="028">28</span> [Barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003.md) also and
[straw](../ebd/ebd352.htm#000.md) for the horses and dromedaries brought
they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his
charge.  

<span id="029">29</span> And God gave [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md)
wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as
the sand that is on the sea shore.  

<span id="030">30</span> And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all
the children of the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) country, and all the
wisdom of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> For he was wiser than all men; than
[Ethan](../ebd/ebd126.htm#002) the [Ezrahite](../ebd/ebd129.htm#008.md),
and [Heman](../ebd/ebd173.htm#009.md), and Chalcol, and
[Darda](../ebd/ebd097.htm#005.md), the sons of
[Mahol](../ebd/ebd238.htm#002.md): and his fame was in all nations round
about.  

<span id="032">32</span> And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his
[songs](../ebd/ebd348.htm#002.md) were a thousand and five.  

<span id="033">33</span> And he spake of trees, from the
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md) tree that is in
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md) even unto the
[hyssop](../ebd/ebd185.htm#007.md) that springeth out of the wall: he spake
also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.  

<span id="034">34</span> And there came of all people to hear the wisdom
of [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), from all kings of the earth, which
had heard of his wisdom.
