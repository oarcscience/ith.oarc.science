### King James Version: Acts Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> And after the uproar was ceased,
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) called unto him the disciples, and
embraced them, and departed for to go into
[Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And when he had gone over those parts, and had
given them much exhortation, he came into
[Greece](../ebd/ebd155.htm#003.md),  

<span id="003">3</span> And there abode three months. And when the Jews
laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md), he purposed to return through
[Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And there accompanied him into
[Asia](../ebd/ebd034.htm#008) [Sopater](../ebd/ebd348.htm#005.md) of
[Berea](../ebd/ebd053.htm#002.md); and of the Thessalonians,
[Aristarchus](../ebd/ebd030.htm#008.md) and
[Secundus](../ebd/ebd325.htm#009); and [Gaius](../ebd/ebd141.htm#003.md) of
[Derbe](../ebd/ebd101.htm#009), and [Timotheus](../ebd/ebd367.htm#001.md);
and of [Asia](../ebd/ebd034.htm#008), [Tychicus](../ebd/ebd373.htm#008.md)
and [Trophimus](../ebd/ebd373.htm#000.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> These going before tarried for us at
[Troas](../ebd/ebd372.htm#008.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And we sailed away from
[Philippi](../ebd/ebd293.htm#009.md) after the days of unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), and came unto them to
[Troas](../ebd/ebd372.htm#008.md) in five days; where we abode
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days.  

<span id="007">7</span> And upon the first day of the week, when the
disciples came together to break [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md),
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) preached unto them, ready to depart on the
morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.  

<span id="008">8</span> And there were many lights in the upper
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md), where they were gathered together.  

<span id="009">9</span> And there sat in a window a certain young man
named [Eutychus](../ebd/ebd127.htm#003.md), being fallen into a
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) sleep: and as
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) was long preaching, he sunk down with
sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) went down,
and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his
life is in him.  

<span id="011">11</span> When he therefore was come up again, and had
broken [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), and eaten, and talked a long
while, even till break of day, so he departed.  

<span id="012">12</span> And they brought the young man alive, and were
not a little comforted.  

<span id="013">13</span> And we went before to ship, and sailed unto
[Assos](../ebd/ebd035.htm#003.md), there intending to take in
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md): for so had he appointed, minding himself
to go afoot.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when he met with us at
[Assos](../ebd/ebd035.htm#003.md), we took him in, and came to
[Mitylene](../ebd/ebd257.htm#007.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And we sailed thence, and came the next day
over against [Chios](../ebd/ebd081.htm#001.md); and the next day we arrived
at [Samos](../ebd/ebd320.htm#008.md), and tarried at
[Trogyllium](../ebd/ebd372.htm#009.md); and the next day we came to
[Miletus](../ebd/ebd254.htm#009.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> For [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) had
determined to sail by [Ephesus](../ebd/ebd122.htm#007.md), because he would
not spend the time in [Asia](../ebd/ebd034.htm#008.md): for he hasted, if
it were possible for him, to be at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md)
the day of [Pentecost](../ebd/ebd289.htm#004.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And from [Miletus](../ebd/ebd254.htm#009.md) he
sent to [Ephesus](../ebd/ebd122.htm#007.md), and called the elders of the
church.  

<span id="018">18</span> And when they were come to him, he said unto
them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into
[Asia](../ebd/ebd034.htm#008.md), after what manner I have been with you at
all [seasons](../ebd/ebd325.htm#003.md),  

<span id="019">19</span> Serving the LORD with all
[humility](../ebd/ebd184.htm#007.md) of mind, and with many tears, and
temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:  

<span id="020">20</span> And how I kept back nothing that was profitable
unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from
house to house,  

<span id="021">21</span> Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the
Greeks, [repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008.md) toward God, and faith toward
our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And now, behold, I go bound in the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) unto [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md),
not knowing the things that shall befall me there:  

<span id="023">23</span> Save that the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md) witnesseth in every city, saying that
bonds and [afflictions](../ebd/ebd011.htm#006.md) abide me.  

<span id="024">24</span> But none of these things move me, neither count
I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy,
and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), to testify the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) of the [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of
God.  

<span id="025">25</span> And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom
I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.  

<span id="026">26</span> Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I
am pure from the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of all men.  

<span id="027">27</span> For I have not shunned to declare unto you all
the counsel of God.  

<span id="028">28</span> Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all
the flock, over the which the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md) hath
made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased
with his own [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> For I know this, that after my departing shall
grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.  

<span id="030">30</span> Also of your own selves shall men arise,
speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.  

<span id="031">31</span> Therefore watch, and remember, that by the
space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with
tears.  

<span id="032">32</span> And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to
the word of his [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md), which is able to build
you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are
sanctified.  

<span id="033">33</span> I have coveted no man's
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), or [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), or
[apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000.md).  

<span id="034">34</span> Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have
ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.  

<span id="035">35</span> I have shewed you all things, how that so
labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the
Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), how he said, It is more blessed to
give than to receive.  

<span id="036">36</span> And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down,
and prayed with them all.  

<span id="037">37</span> And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md), and kissed him,  

<span id="038">38</span> Sorrowing most of all for the words which he
spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him
unto the ship.
