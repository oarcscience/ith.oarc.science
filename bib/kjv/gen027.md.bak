### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 27

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, that when
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) was old, and his eyes were dim, so that
he could not see, he called [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) his eldest
son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am
I.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not
the day of my death:  

<span id="003">3</span> Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons,
thy [quiver](../ebd/ebd304.htm#000.md) and thy
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md), and go out to the field, and take me some
venison;  

<span id="004">4</span> And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and
bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) thee before I die.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md) heard when
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006) spake to [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md)
his son. And [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) went to the field to hunt for
venison, and to bring it.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md) spake unto
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy
father speak unto [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) thy brother, saying,  

<span id="007">7</span> Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that
I may eat, and [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) thee before the LORD
before my death.  

<span id="008">8</span> Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according
to that which I command thee.  

<span id="009">9</span> Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence
two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy
father, such as he loveth:  

<span id="010">10</span> And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he
may eat, and that he may [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) thee before his
death.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) said to
[Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md) his mother, Behold,
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) my brother is a hairy man, and I am a
smooth man:  

<span id="012">12</span> My father peradventure will feel me, and I
shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) upon me, and not a blessing.  

<span id="013">13</span> And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md), my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch
me them.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he went, and fetched, and brought them to
his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father
loved.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md) took
goodly raiment of her eldest son [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md), which
were with her in the house, and put them upon
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) her younger son:  

<span id="016">16</span> And she put the skins of the kids of the goats
upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md):  

<span id="017">17</span> And she gave the savoury meat and the
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), which she had prepared, into the hand of
her son [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And he came unto his father, and said, My
father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) said unto
his father, I am [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) thy first born; I have
done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my
venison, that thy soul may [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) me.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) said unto
his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he
said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) said unto
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel
thee, my son, whether thou be my very son [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md)
or not.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) went near
unto [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) his father; and he felt him, and
said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And he discerned him not, because his hands
were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.  

<span id="024">24</span> And he said, Art thou my very son
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md)? And he said, I am.  

<span id="025">25</span> And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will
eat of my son's venison, that my soul may [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md)
thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) and he drank.  

<span id="026">26</span> And his father [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md)
said unto him, Come near now, and [kiss](../ebd/ebd221.htm#000.md) me, my
son.  

<span id="027">27</span> And he came near, and kissed him: and he
smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the
smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath
blessed:  

<span id="028">28</span> Therefore God give thee of the
[dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and the
fatness of the earth, and plenty of [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md) and
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md):  

<span id="029">29</span> Let people serve thee, and nations
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) down to thee: be lord over thy brethren,
and let thy mother's sons [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) down to thee:
cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth
thee.  

<span id="030">30</span> And it came to pass, as soon as
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) had made an end of blessing
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), and [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) was
yet scarce gone out from the presence of [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md)
his father, that [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) his brother came in from
his [hunting](../ebd/ebd184.htm#008.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> And he also had made savoury meat, and brought
it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and
eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) me.  

<span id="032">32</span> And [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) his father
said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> And [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) trembled
very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison,
and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have
blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.  

<span id="034">34</span> And when [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) heard
the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding
[bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009.md) cry, and said unto his father,
[Bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) me, even me also, O my father.  

<span id="035">35</span> And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty,
and hath taken away thy blessing.  

<span id="036">36</span> And he said, Is not he rightly named
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md)? for he hath supplanted me these two
times: he took away my [birthright](../ebd/ebd059.htm#004.md); and, behold,
now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved
a blessing for me?  

<span id="037">37</span> And [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) answered and
said unto [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md), Behold, I have made him thy
lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) and [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) have I
sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?  

<span id="038">38</span> And [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) said unto his
father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father?
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) me, even me also, O my father. And
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) lifted up his voice, and wept.  

<span id="039">39</span> And [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) his father
answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of
the earth, and of the [dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) from above;  

<span id="040">40</span> And by thy [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) shalt
thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when
thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md) from off thy
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md).  

<span id="041">41</span> And [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) hated
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) because of the blessing wherewith his
father blessed him: and [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) said in his heart,
The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my
brother [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md).  

<span id="042">42</span> And these words of
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005) her [elder](../ebd/ebd114.htm#008.md) son
were told to [Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md): and she sent and called
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) her younger son, and said unto him,
Behold, thy brother [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md), as touching thee,
doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.  

<span id="043">43</span> Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise,
flee thou to [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md) my brother to
[Haran](../ebd/ebd163.htm#007.md);  

<span id="044">44</span> And tarry with him a few days, until thy
brother's [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md) turn away;  

<span id="045">45</span> Until thy brother's
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) turn away from thee, and he forget that
which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from
thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?  

<span id="046">46</span> And [Rebekah](../ebd/ebd308.htm#001.md) said to
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md), I am weary of my life because of the
daughters of [Heth](../ebd/ebd177.htm#001.md): if
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) take a wife of the daughters of
[Heth](../ebd/ebd177.htm#001.md), such as these which are of the daughters
of the land, what good shall my life do me?
