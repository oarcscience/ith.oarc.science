<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 42</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then all the captains of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#000">forces</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd215.htm#007">Kareah</A>, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then they said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A>, The LORD be a true and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Then called he <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd215.htm#007">Kareah</A>, and all the captains of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#000">forces</A> which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Be not afraid of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Saying, No; but we will go into the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>; and there will we dwell:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and go to sojourn there;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then it shall come to pass, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>, whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>; and there ye shall die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> to sojourn there; they shall die by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; As mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> and my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A> hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>; so shall my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A> be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A>, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>; Go ye not into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>: know certainly that I have admonished you this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn.<BR>
