### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> Why do the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md)
rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?  

<span id="002">2</span> The kings of the earth set themselves, and the
rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his
anointed, saying,  

<span id="003">3</span> Let us break their
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003.md) asunder, and cast away their cords from
us.  

<span id="004">4</span> He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the
LORD shall have them in derision.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and
vex them in his sore displeasure.  

<span id="006">6</span> Yet have I set my [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
upon my holy hill of [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said
unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> Ask of me, and I shall give thee the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) for thine inheritance, and the
uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.  

<span id="009">9</span> Thou shalt break them with a rod of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md); thou shalt dash them in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md) like a potter's vessel.  

<span id="010">10</span> Be [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) now therefore,
O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.  

<span id="011">11</span> Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with
trembling.  

<span id="012">12</span> [Kiss](../ebd/ebd221.htm#000.md) the Son, lest he
be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a
little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
