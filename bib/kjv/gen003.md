### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Now the [serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009) was
more subtil than any [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) of the field which
the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said,
Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?  

<span id="002">2</span> And the woman said unto the
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009), We may eat of the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of the trees of the garden:  

<span id="003">3</span> But of the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of the
tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not
eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the [serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009) said
unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:  

<span id="005">5</span> For God doth know that in the day ye eat
thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods,
knowing good and evil.  

<span id="006">6</span> And when the woman saw that the tree was good
for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired
to make one [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), she took of the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto
her husband with her; and he did eat.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the eyes of them both were opened, and they
knew that they were [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003); and they sewed
[fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001) leaves together, and made themselves
aprons.  

<span id="008">8</span> And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking
in the garden in the cool of the day: and [Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007)
and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst
the trees of the garden.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the LORD God called unto
[Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007), and said unto him, Where art thou?  

<span id="010">10</span> And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden,
and I was afraid, because I was [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003); and I
hid myself.  

<span id="011">11</span> And he said, Who told thee that thou wast
[naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003)? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I
commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?  

<span id="012">12</span> And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to
be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is
this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009) beguiled me, and I did eat.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the LORD God said unto the
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009), Because thou hast done this, thou art
cursed above all [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002), and above every
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) of the field; upon thy
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000) shalt thou go, and
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:  

<span id="015">15</span> And I will put [enmity](../ebd/ebd121.htm#003)
between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall
bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.  

<span id="016">16</span> Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply
thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth
children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over
thee.  

<span id="017">17</span> And unto [Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007) he said,
Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten
of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of
it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it
all the days of thy life;  

<span id="018">18</span> Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth
to thee; and thou shalt eat the [herb](../ebd/ebd174.htm#008) of the
field;  

<span id="019">19</span> In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), till thou return unto the ground; for
out of it wast thou taken: for [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) thou art,
and unto [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) shalt thou return.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007) called his
wife's name [Eve](../ebd/ebd127.htm#005); because she was the mother of
all living.  

<span id="021">21</span> Unto [Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007) also and to
his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is
become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth
his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for
ever:  

<span id="023">23</span> Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the
garden of [Eden](../ebd/ebd112.htm#009), to till the ground from whence
he was taken.  

<span id="024">24</span> So he drove out the man; and he placed at the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) of the garden of
[Eden](../ebd/ebd112.htm#009) Cherubims, and a flaming
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) which turned every way, to keep the way
of the tree of life.
