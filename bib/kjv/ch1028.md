### King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 28

<span id="001">1</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) assembled all
the princes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), the princes of the
tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) by course, and the captains over the
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md), and captains over the hundreds, and
the stewards over all the substance and possession of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and of his sons, with the officers, and
with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men, unto
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Then [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me,
my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to build an
house of rest for the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of the LORD, and for the
[footstool](../ebd/ebd136.htm#009.md) of our God, and had made ready for
the building:  

<span id="003">3</span> But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an
house for my name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Howbeit the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) chose me before all the house of my
father to be [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) for ever: for he hath
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) to be the
ruler; and of the house of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), the house of
my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):  

<span id="005">5</span> And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me
many sons,) he hath [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) my son to sit upon the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of the kingdom of the LORD over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And he said unto me,
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) thy son, he shall build my house and my
courts: for I have [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) him to be my son, and
I will be his father.  

<span id="007">7</span> Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever,
if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this
day.  

<span id="008">8</span> Now therefore in the sight of all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the LORD, and in the audience
of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God:
that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for
your children after you for ever.  

<span id="009">9</span> And thou, [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) my
son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart
and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all hearts, and
understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he
will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off
for ever.  

<span id="010">10</span> Take heed now; for the LORD hath
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) thee to build an house for the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md): be strong, and do it.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) gave to
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) his son the pattern of the porch, and
of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper
chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of
the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) seat,  

<span id="012">12</span> And the pattern of all that he had by the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), of the courts of the house of the LORD,
and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of
God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:  

<span id="013">13</span> Also for the [courses](../ebd/ebd091.htm#006.md)
of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of
the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house
of the LORD.  

<span id="014">14</span> He gave of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) by
weight for things of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), for all instruments
of all manner of service; [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) also for all
instruments of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) by weight, for all
instruments of every kind of service:  

<span id="015">15</span> Even the weight for the candlesticks of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and for their lamps of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), by weight for every
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md), and for the lamps thereof: and for
the candlesticks of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) by weight, both for
the [candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md), and also for the lamps
thereof, according to the use of every
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And by weight he gave
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) for the [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006.md) of
[shewbread](../ebd/ebd336.htm#008.md), for every table; and likewise
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) for the [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006.md)
of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md):  

<span id="017">17</span> Also pure [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) for the
fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basons he
gave [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) by weight for every bason; and
likewise [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) by weight for every bason of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md):  

<span id="018">18</span> And for the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) of
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) refined [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md)
by weight; and [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) for the pattern of the
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md) of the cherubims, that spread out their
wings, and covered the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of the LORD.  

<span id="019">19</span> All this, said [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md),
the LORD made me understand in [writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005.md) by his
hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said to
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) his son, Be strong and of good courage,
and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my God,
will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou
hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.  

<span id="021">21</span> And, behold, the
[courses](../ebd/ebd091.htm#006.md) of the priests and the Levites, even
they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and
there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing
skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the
people will be wholly at thy commandment.
