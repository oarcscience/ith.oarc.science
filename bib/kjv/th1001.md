### King James Version: 1 Thessalonians Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), and Silvanus, and
[Timotheus](../ebd/ebd367.htm#001), unto the church of the Thessalonians
which is in God the Father and in the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000):
[Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) be unto you, and peace, from God our
Father, and the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="002">2</span> We give thanks to God always for you all, making
mention of you in our prayers;  

<span id="003">3</span> Remembering without ceasing your work of faith,
and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), in the
sight of God and our Father;  

<span id="004">4</span> Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of
God.  

<span id="005">5</span> For our [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) came not
unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005), and in much
[assurance](../ebd/ebd035.htm#004); as ye know what manner of men we
were among you for your sake.  

<span id="006">6</span> And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord,
having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005).  

<span id="007">7</span> So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in
[Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003) and
[Achaia](../ebd/ebd006.htm#004).  

<span id="008">8</span> For from you sounded out the word of the Lord
not only in [Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003) and
[Achaia](../ebd/ebd006.htm#004), but also in every place your faith to
God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.  

<span id="009">9</span> For they themselves shew of us what manner of
entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to
serve the living and true God;  

<span id="010">10</span> And to wait for his Son from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), whom he raised from the dead, even
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), which delivered us from the wrath to
come.
