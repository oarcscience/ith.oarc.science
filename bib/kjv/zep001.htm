<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Therefore their goods shall become a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#006">booty</A>, and their houses a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> thereof.<BR>
