### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 32

<span id="001">1</span> Behold, a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) shall
reign in [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), and princes shall rule
in judgment.  

<span id="002">2</span> And a man shall be as an hiding place from the
wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place,
as the [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) of a great
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) in a weary land.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim,
and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.  

<span id="004">4</span> The heart also of the rash shall understand
knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak
plainly.  

<span id="005">5</span> The vile person shall be no more called liberal,
nor the [churl](../ebd/ebd083.htm#001) said to be bountiful.  

<span id="006">6</span> For the vile person will speak villany, and his
heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error
against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will
cause the [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of the thirsty to fail.  

<span id="007">7</span> The instruments also of the
[churl](../ebd/ebd083.htm#001) are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to
destroy the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) with lying words, even when
the needy speaketh right.  

<span id="008">8</span> But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by
liberal things shall he stand.  

<span id="009">9</span> Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my
voice, ye careless daughters; give [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) unto my
speech.  

<span id="010">10</span> Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye
careless women: for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not
come.  

<span id="011">11</span> Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be
troubled, ye careless ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001) upon your loins.  

<span id="012">12</span> They shall lament for the teats, for the
pleasant fields, for the fruitful [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004).  

<span id="013">13</span> Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns
and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city:  

<span id="014">14</span> Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the
multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and
[towers](../ebd/ebd371.htm#002) shall be for dens for ever, a joy of
wild asses, a pasture of flocks;  

<span id="015">15</span> Until the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) be
poured upon us from on high, and the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005)
be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006).  

<span id="016">16</span> Then judgment shall dwell in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), and
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) remain in the fruitful field.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the work of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) shall be peace; and the effect of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) quietness and
[assurance](../ebd/ebd035.htm#004) for ever.  

<span id="018">18</span> And my people shall dwell in a peaceable
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007), and in sure
[dwellings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#001), and in quiet resting places;  

<span id="019">19</span> When it shall [hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002),
coming down on the [forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006); and the city shall
be low in a low place.  

<span id="020">20</span> Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that
send forth thither the feet of the [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) and the
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001).
