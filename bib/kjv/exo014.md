### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that they turn and
[encamp](../ebd/ebd120.htm#003) before Pihahiroth, between
[Migdol](../ebd/ebd254.htm#003) and the sea, over against Baalzephon:
before it shall ye [encamp](../ebd/ebd120.htm#003) by the sea.  

<span id="003">3</span> For [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) will say of
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), They are entangled in
the land, the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) hath shut them in.  

<span id="004">4</span> And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall
follow after them; and I will be honoured upon
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), and upon all his
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007); that the Egyptians may know that I am the
LORD. And they did so.  

<span id="005">5</span> And it was told the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) that the
people fled: and the heart of [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) and of
his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we
done this, that we have let [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) go from
serving us?  

<span id="006">6</span> And he made ready his
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008), and took his people with him:  

<span id="007">7</span> And he took six hundred
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) chariots, and all the chariots of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and captains over every one of them.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the LORD hardened the heart of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and he pursued after the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) went out with an high hand.  

<span id="009">9</span> But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the
horses and chariots of [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), and his
horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside
Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.  

<span id="010">10</span> And when [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) drew
nigh, the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) lifted up their
eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore
afraid: and the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) cried out
unto the LORD.  

<span id="011">11</span> And they said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Because there were no graves in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), hast thou taken us away to die in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005)? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with
us, to carry us forth out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009)?  

<span id="012">12</span> Is not this the word that we did tell thee in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), saying, Let us alone, that we may serve
the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians,
than that we should die in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005).  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said unto
the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) of the LORD, which he will shew to
you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see
them again no more for ever.  

<span id="014">14</span> The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold
your peace.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak
unto the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that they go
forward:  

<span id="016">16</span> But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine
hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall go on dry ground through the midst
of the sea.  

<span id="017">17</span> And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the
Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), and upon all his
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007), upon his chariots, and upon his
horsemen.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the Egyptians shall know that I am the
LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), upon his chariots, and upon his
horsemen.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of God,
which went before the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), removed and went behind them; and the
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007) of the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001)
went from before their face, and stood behind them:  

<span id="020">20</span> And it came between the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) of the Egyptians and the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and it
was a [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) and
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) to them, but it gave light by night to
these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) stretched
out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a
strong [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) wind all that night, and made the
sea dry land, and the waters were divided.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) went into the midst of the sea upon the
dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand,
and on their left.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after
them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots,
and his horsemen.  

<span id="024">24</span> And it came to pass, that in the morning watch
the LORD looked unto the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of the Egyptians
through the [pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007) of fire and of the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001), and troubled the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of the Egyptians,  

<span id="025">25</span> And took off their
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) wheels, that they drave them heavily:
so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); for the LORD fighteth for them against
the Egyptians.  

<span id="026">26</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Stretch out thine hand over the sea,
that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots,
and upon their horsemen.  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) stretched
forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when
the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD
overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.  

<span id="028">28</span> And the waters returned, and covered the
chariots, and the horsemen, and all the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) that came into the sea after them;
there remained not so much as one of them.  

<span id="029">29</span> But the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) walked upon dry land in the midst of the
sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on
their left.  

<span id="030">30</span> Thus the LORD saved
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) that day out of the hand of the
Egyptians; and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) saw the Egyptians dead
upon the sea shore.  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) saw that
great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared
the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003).
