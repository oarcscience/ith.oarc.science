### King James Version: Job Chapter 25

<span id="001">1</span> Then answered [Bildad](../ebd/ebd058.htm#006)
the [Shuhite](../ebd/ebd341.htm#008), and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace
in his high places.  

<span id="003">3</span> Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom
doth not his light arise?  

<span id="004">4</span> How then can man be justified with God? or how
can he be [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) that is born of a woman?  

<span id="005">5</span> Behold even to the
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004), and it shineth not; yea, the
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008) are not pure in his sight.  

<span id="006">6</span> How much less man, that is a
[worm](../ebd/ebd384.htm#000)? and the son of man, which is a
[worm](../ebd/ebd384.htm#000)?
