### King James Version: Ruth Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> Now it came to pass in the days when the judges
ruled, that there was a [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md) in the land. And
a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), he, and his wife, and his two sons.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the name of the man was
[Elimelech](../ebd/ebd117.htm#002.md), and the name of his wife
[Naomi](../ebd/ebd266.htm#004.md), and the name of his two sons
[Mahlon](../ebd/ebd238.htm#001) and [Chilion](../ebd/ebd080.htm#007.md),
Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), and continued there.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Elimelech](../ebd/ebd117.htm#002.md) Naomi's
husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.  

<span id="004">4</span> And they took them wives of the women of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md); the name of the one was
[Orpah](../ebd/ebd280.htm#007.md), and the name of the other
[Ruth](../ebd/ebd316.htm#008.md): and they dwelled there about ten years.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Mahlon](../ebd/ebd238.htm#001.md) and
[Chilion](../ebd/ebd080.htm#007.md) died also both of them; and the woman
was left of her two sons and her husband.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then she arose with her daughters in law, that
she might return from the country of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md): for
she had heard in the country of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) how that
the LORD had visited his people in giving them
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Wherefore she went forth out of the place where
she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way
to return unto the land of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Naomi](../ebd/ebd266.htm#004.md) said unto her
two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD
deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.  

<span id="009">9</span> The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each
of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they
lifted up their voice, and wept.  

<span id="010">10</span> And they said unto her, Surely we will return
with thee unto thy people.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Naomi](../ebd/ebd266.htm#004.md) said, Turn
again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons
in my womb, that they may be your husbands?  

<span id="012">12</span> Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am
too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should
have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;  

<span id="013">13</span> Would ye tarry for them till they were grown?
would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it
grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out
against me.  

<span id="014">14</span> And they lifted up their voice, and wept again:
and [Orpah](../ebd/ebd280.htm#007.md) kissed her mother in law; but
[Ruth](../ebd/ebd316.htm#008.md) clave unto her.  

<span id="015">15</span> And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone
back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in
law.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Ruth](../ebd/ebd316.htm#008.md) said, Intreat
me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for
whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will
[lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002.md): thy people shall be my people, and thy
God my God:  

<span id="017">17</span> Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I
be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part
thee and me.  

<span id="018">18</span> When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to
go with her, then she left speaking unto her.  

<span id="019">19</span> So they two went until they came to
[Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005.md). And it came to pass, when they were
come to [Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005.md), that all the city was moved
about them, and they said, Is this [Naomi](../ebd/ebd266.htm#004.md)?  

<span id="020">20</span> And she said unto them, Call me not
[Naomi](../ebd/ebd266.htm#004), call me [Mara](../ebd/ebd241.htm#002.md):
for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.  

<span id="021">21</span> I went out full and the LORD hath brought me
home again empty: why then call ye me [Naomi](../ebd/ebd266.htm#004.md),
seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath
afflicted me?  

<span id="022">22</span> So [Naomi](../ebd/ebd266.htm#004.md) returned, and
[Ruth](../ebd/ebd316.htm#008.md) the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with
her, which returned out of the country of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md):
and they came to [Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005.md) in the beginning of
[barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003) [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md).
