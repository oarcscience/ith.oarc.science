### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 27

<span id="001">1</span> Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest
not what a day may bring forth.  

<span id="002">2</span> Let another man praise thee, and not thine own
mouth; a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), and not thine own lips.  

<span id="003">3</span> A [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) is heavy, and
the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both.  

<span id="004">4</span> Wrath is cruel, and
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) is outrageous; but who is able to stand
before envy?  

<span id="005">5</span> Open rebuke is better than secret love.  

<span id="006">6</span> [Faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) are the wounds
of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.  

<span id="007">7</span> The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the
hungry soul every [bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009) thing is sweet.  

<span id="008">8</span> As a [bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000) that
wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place.  

<span id="009">9</span> [Ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007) and perfume
rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty
counsel.  

<span id="010">10</span> Thine own friend, and thy father's friend,
forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy
calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far
off.  

<span id="011">11</span> My son, be [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), and
make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.  

<span id="012">12</span> A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth
himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished.  

<span id="013">13</span> Take his garment that is
[surety](../ebd/ebd353.htm#005) for a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009),
and take a [pledge](../ebd/ebd297.htm#005) of him for a strange woman.  

<span id="014">14</span> He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice,
rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) to him.  

<span id="015">15</span> A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a
contentious woman are alike.  

<span id="016">16</span> Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the
[ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007) of his right hand, which bewrayeth
itself.  

<span id="017">17</span> [Iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004) sharpeneth
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004); so a man sharpeneth the countenance of
his friend.  

<span id="018">18</span> Whoso keepeth the [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001)
tree shall eat the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) thereof: so he that
waiteth on his master shall be honoured.  

<span id="019">19</span> As in water face answereth to face, so the
heart of man to man.  

<span id="020">20</span> [Hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003) and
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) are never full; so the eyes of man
are never satisfied.  

<span id="021">21</span> As the fining pot for
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and the
[furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000) for [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001); so
is a man to his praise.  

<span id="022">22</span> Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a
[mortar](../ebd/ebd260.htm#000) among [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000)
with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.  

<span id="023">23</span> Be thou diligent to know the state of thy
flocks, and look well to thy herds.  

<span id="024">24</span> For riches are not for ever: and doth the
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) endure to every
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008)?  

<span id="025">25</span> The [hay](../ebd/ebd168.htm#002) appeareth, and
the tender [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005) sheweth itself, and herbs of
the mountains are gathered.  

<span id="026">26</span> The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats
are the price of the field.  

<span id="027">27</span> And thou shalt have goats'
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000) enough for thy food, for the food of thy
household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens.
