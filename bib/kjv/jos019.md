### King James Version: Joshua Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> And the second lot came forth to
[Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002.md), even for the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002.md) according to their families: and their
inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And they had in their inheritance
[Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008), and [Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006.md),
and [Moladah](../ebd/ebd258.htm#008.md),  

<span id="003">3</span> And Hazarshual, and
[Balah](../ebd/ebd042.htm#005.md), and Azem,  

<span id="004">4</span> And Eltolad, and Bethul, and
[Hormah](../ebd/ebd182.htm#002.md),  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Ziklag](../ebd/ebd393.htm#003.md), and
Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah,  

<span id="006">6</span> And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities
and their [villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md):  

<span id="007">7</span> Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities
and their [villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md):  

<span id="008">8</span> And all the [villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md)
that were round about these cities to Baalathbeer, Ramath of the south.
This is the inheritance of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of the
children of [Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002.md) according to their
families.  

<span id="009">9</span> Out of the portion of the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) was the inheritance of the children of
[Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002.md): for the part of the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) was too much for them: therefore the
children of [Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002.md) had their inheritance within
the inheritance of them.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the third lot came up for the children of
[Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003.md) according to their families: and the
border of their inheritance was unto Sarid:  

<span id="011">11</span> And their border went up toward the sea, and
[Maralah](../ebd/ebd241.htm#004.md), and reached to Dabbasheth, and reached
to the river that is before [Jokneam](../ebd/ebd210.htm#002.md);  

<span id="012">12</span> And turned from Sarid eastward toward the
sunrising unto the border of Chislothtabor, and then goeth out to
[Daberath](../ebd/ebd095.htm#007.md), and goeth up to
[Japhia](../ebd/ebd197.htm#003.md),  

<span id="013">13</span> And from thence passeth on along on the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) to Gittahhepher, to Ittahkazin, and goeth
out to Remmonmethoar to [Neah](../ebd/ebd267.htm#009.md);  

<span id="014">14</span> And the border compasseth it on the north side
to Hannathon: and the outgoings thereof are in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) of Jiphthahel:  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Kattath](../ebd/ebd216.htm#002.md), and
[Nahallal](../ebd/ebd265.htm#001), and [Shimron](../ebd/ebd338.htm#008.md),
and [Idalah](../ebd/ebd186.htm#004.md), and
[Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005.md): twelve cities with their
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> This is the inheritance of the children of
[Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003.md) according to their families, these
cities with their [villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And the fourth lot came out to
[Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002.md), for the children of
[Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002.md) according to their families.  

<span id="018">18</span> And their border was toward
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008.md), and
[Chesulloth](../ebd/ebd079.htm#009.md), and
[Shunem](../ebd/ebd342.htm#001.md),  

<span id="019">19</span> And Haphraim, and
[Shihon](../ebd/ebd337.htm#003.md), and Anaharath,  

<span id="020">20</span> And Rabbith, and
[Kishion](../ebd/ebd220.htm#008), and [Abez](../ebd/ebd002.htm#001.md),  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Remeth](../ebd/ebd310.htm#004.md), and
Engannim, and Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez;  

<span id="022">22</span> And the coast reacheth to
[Tabor](../ebd/ebd356.htm#007.md), and Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh; and the
outgoings of their border were at [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md):
sixteen cities with their [villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> This is the inheritance of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002.md) according to their families, the
cities and their [villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And the fifth lot came out for the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Asher](../ebd/ebd033.htm#008.md) according to their families.  

<span id="025">25</span> And their border was
[Helkath](../ebd/ebd173.htm#001.md), and Hali, and Beten, and
[Achshaph](../ebd/ebd007.htm#002.md),  

<span id="026">26</span> And Alammelech, and Amad, and
[Misheal](../ebd/ebd256.htm#009.md); and reacheth to
[Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006) [westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008.md), and
to Shihorlibnath;  

<span id="027">27</span> And turneth toward the sunrising to Bethdagon,
and reacheth to [Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003.md), and to the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) of Jiphthahel toward the north side of
Bethemek, and [Neiel](../ebd/ebd270.htm#002.md), and goeth out to
[Cabul](../ebd/ebd068.htm#001.md) on the left hand,  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004.md), and
[Rehob](../ebd/ebd309.htm#006), and [Hammon](../ebd/ebd161.htm#002.md), and
[Kanah](../ebd/ebd215.htm#006.md), even unto great
[Zidon](../ebd/ebd393.htm#000.md);  

<span id="029">29</span> And then the coast turneth to
[Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005.md), and to the strong city
[Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001.md); and the coast turneth to
[Hosah](../ebd/ebd183.htm#005.md); and the outgoings thereof are at the sea
from the coast to [Achzib](../ebd/ebd007.htm#003.md):  

<span id="030">30</span> [Ummah](../ebd/ebd374.htm#005.md) also, and Aphek,
and [Rehob](../ebd/ebd309.htm#006.md): twenty and two cities with their
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> This is the inheritance of the

<span id="032">32</span> The sixth lot came out to the children of
[Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006.md), even for the children of

<span id="033">33</span> And their coast was from
[Heleph](../ebd/ebd172.htm#007), from [Allon](../ebd/ebd017.htm#007.md) to

unto Lakum; and the outgoings thereof were at
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md):  

<span id="034">34</span> And then the coast turneth

[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md).  

<span id="039">39</span> This is the inheritance of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006.md) according to their families, the
cities and their [villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md).  

<span id="040">40</span> And the seventh lot came out for the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md) according to their families.  

<span id="041">41</span> And the coast of their inheritance was
[Zorah](../ebd/ebd396.htm#002), and [Eshtaol](../ebd/ebd125.htm#002.md),
and Irshemesh,

<span id="047">47</span> And the coast of the children of
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md) went out too little for them: therefore the
children of [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md) went up to fight against
Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and
called Leshem, [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md), after the name of

[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md) according to their families, these cities
with their [villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md).  

<span id="049">49</span> When they had made an end of dividing the land
for inheritance by their coasts, the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) gave an inheritance to
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) the son of [Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006.md)
among them:  

<span id="050">50</span> According to the word of the LORD they gave him
the city which he asked, even Timnathserah in
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md): and he
built the city, and dwelt therein.  

<span id="051">51</span> These are the inheritances, which
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md),
and [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) the son of
[Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006.md), and the heads of the fathers of the tribes
of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), divided for an
inheritance by lot in [Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008.md) before the LORD,
at the door of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md). So they made an end of dividing
the country.
