### King James Version: Jude Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> [Jude](../ebd/ebd213.htm#002.md), the servant of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), and
brother of [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md), to them that are sanctified
by God the Father, and preserved in [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), and called:  

<span id="002">2</span> [Mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) unto you, and
peace, and love, be multiplied.  

<span id="003">3</span> Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto
you of the common [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md), it was needful for
me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend
for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.  

<span id="004">4</span> For there are certain men crept in unawares, who
were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning
the [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of our God into lasciviousness, and
denying the only Lord God, and our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> I will therefore put you in remembrance, though
ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the
land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), afterward destroyed them that
believed not.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the angels which kept not their first
estate, but left their own [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md), he hath
reserved in [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) chains under
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) unto the judgment of the great day.  

<span id="007">7</span> Even as [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004.md) and
Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves
over to [fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008.md), and going after strange
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), are set forth for an example, suffering
the vengeance of eternal fire.  

<span id="008">8</span> Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), despise dominion, and speak evil of
dignities.  

<span id="009">9</span> Yet [Michael](../ebd/ebd252.htm#009.md) the
[archangel](../ebd/ebd028.htm#009.md), when contending with the
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md) he disputed about the body of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), durst not bring against him a railing
accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.  

<span id="010">10</span> But these speak evil of those things which they
know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things
they corrupt themselves.  

<span id="011">11</span> Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of
[Cain](../ebd/ebd068.htm#007.md), and ran greedily after the error of
[Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003.md) for reward, and perished in the
gainsaying of Core.  

<span id="012">12</span> These are spots in your feasts of
[charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009.md), when they
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) with you, feeding themselves without
fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of
[winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009.md); trees whose
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) withereth, without
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md), twice dead, plucked up by the roots;  

<span id="013">13</span> Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own
shame; [wandering](../ebd/ebd378.htm#008.md)
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md), to whom is reserved the blackness of
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) for ever.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Enoch](../ebd/ebd121.htm#004.md) also, the
seventh from [Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007.md), prophesied of these, saying,
Behold, the Lord cometh with ten [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md) of
his saints,  

<span id="015">15</span> To execute judgment upon all, and to convince
all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they
have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly
sinners have spoken against him.  

<span id="016">16</span> These are murmurers, complainers, walking after
their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great
[swelling](../ebd/ebd354.htm#001.md) words, having men's persons in
admiration because of advantage.  

<span id="017">17</span> But, beloved, remember ye the words which were
spoken before of the apostles of our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md);  

<span id="018">18</span> How that they told you there should be mockers
in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.  

<span id="019">19</span> These be they who separate themselves, sensual,
having not the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your
most holy faith, praying in the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md),  

<span id="021">21</span> Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for
the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) unto
eternal life.  

<span id="022">22</span> And of some have compassion, making a
difference:  

<span id="023">23</span> And others save with fear, pulling them out of
the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> Now unto him that is able to keep you from
falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) with exceeding joy,  

<span id="025">25</span> To the only [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) God
our [Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003), be [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md)
and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever.
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).
