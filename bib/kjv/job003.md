### King James Version: Job Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his
day.  

<span id="002">2</span> And Job spake, and said,  

<span id="003">3</span> Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the
night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.  

<span id="004">4</span> Let that day be
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md); let not God regard it from above,
neither let the light shine upon it.  

<span id="005">5</span> Let [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) and the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) of death stain it; let a
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md) dwell upon it; let the blackness of the
day terrify it.  

<span id="006">6</span> As for that night, let
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) seize upon it; let it not be joined
unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the
months.  

<span id="007">7</span> Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful
voice come therein.  

<span id="008">8</span> Let them [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) it that
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) the day, who are ready to raise up their
mourning.  

<span id="009">9</span> Let the [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md) of the
twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither
let it see the dawning of the day:  

<span id="010">10</span> Because it shut not up the
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from
mine eyes.  

<span id="011">11</span> Why died I not from the womb? why did I not
give up the [ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md) when I came out of the
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="012">12</span> Why did the knees prevent me? or why the
breasts that I should suck?  

<span id="013">13</span> For now should I have lain still and been
quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,  

<span id="014">14</span> With kings and counsellors of the earth, which
build desolate places for themselves;  

<span id="015">15</span> Or with princes that had
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), who filled their houses with
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md):  

<span id="016">16</span> Or as an hidden untimely
[birth](../ebd/ebd059.htm#002.md) I had not been; as infants which never
saw light.  

<span id="017">17</span> There the wicked cease from troubling; and
there the weary be at rest.  

<span id="018">18</span> There the prisoners rest together; they hear
not the voice of the oppressor.  

<span id="019">19</span> The small and great are there; and the servant
is free from his master.  

<span id="020">20</span> Wherefore is light given to him that is in
misery, and life unto the [bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009.md) in soul;  

<span id="021">21</span> Which long for death, but it cometh not; and
dig for it more than for hid treasures;  

<span id="022">22</span> Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when
they can find the [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md)?  

<span id="023">23</span> Why is light given to a man whose way is hid,
and whom God hath hedged in?  

<span id="024">24</span> For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my
roarings are poured out like the waters.  

<span id="025">25</span> For the thing which I greatly feared is come
upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.  

<span id="026">26</span> I was not in safety, neither had I rest,
neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
