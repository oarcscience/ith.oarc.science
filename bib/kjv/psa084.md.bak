### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 84

<span id="001">1</span> How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of
hosts!  

<span id="002">2</span> My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the
courts of the LORD: my heart and my [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md)
crieth out for the living God.  

<span id="003">3</span> Yea, the [sparrow](../ebd/ebd349.htm#003.md) hath
found an house, and the [swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009.md) a nest for
herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of
hosts, my [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and my God.  

<span id="004">4</span> Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they
will be still praising thee. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in
whose heart are the ways of them.  

<span id="006">6</span> Who passing through the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) of Baca make it a well; the
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) also filleth the pools.  

<span id="007">7</span> They go from strength to strength, every one of
them in [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md) appeareth before God.  

<span id="008">8</span> O LORD God of hosts, hear my
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000): give [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md), O
God of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007). [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Behold, O God our
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001.md), and look upon the face of thine
anointed.  

<span id="010">10</span> For a day in thy courts is better than a
thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to
dwell in the tents of wickedness.  

<span id="011">11</span> For the LORD God is a
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) and [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001.md): the
LORD will give [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) and
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md): no good thing will he withhold from them
that walk uprightly.  

<span id="012">12</span> O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that
trusteth in thee.
