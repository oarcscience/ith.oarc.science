### King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> Now it came to pass, as
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) sat in his house, that
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said to [Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md)
the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md), Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars,
but the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of the LORD remaineth under
curtains.  

<span id="002">2</span> Then [Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md) said unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), Do all that is in thine heart; for God
is with thee.  

<span id="003">3</span> And it came to pass the same night, that the
word of God came to [Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md), saying,  

<span id="004">4</span> Go and tell [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) my
servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell
in:  

<span id="005">5</span> For I have not dwelt in an house since the day
that I brought up [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) unto this day; but
have gone from [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) to
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md), and from one
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) to another.  

<span id="006">6</span> Wheresoever I have walked with all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), spake I a word to any of the judges of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), whom I commanded to feed my people,
saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?  

<span id="007">7</span> Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my
servant [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I
took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), that thou shouldest be ruler over my
people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):  

<span id="008">8</span> And I have been with thee whithersoever thou
hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and
have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the
earth.  

<span id="009">9</span> Also I will ordain a place for my people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and will plant them, and they shall
dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the
children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,  

<span id="010">10</span> And since the time that I commanded judges to
be over my people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md). Moreover I will
subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will
build thee an house.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it shall come to pass, when thy days be
expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up
thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish
his kingdom.  

<span id="012">12</span> He shall build me an house, and I will stablish
his [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) for ever.  

<span id="013">13</span> I will be his father, and he shall be my son:
and I will not take my [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) away from him, as
I took it from him that was before thee:  

<span id="014">14</span> But I will settle him in mine house and in my
kingdom for ever: and his [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) shall be
established for evermore.  

<span id="015">15</span> According to all these words, and according to
all this [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md), so did
[Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md) speak unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) came and sat before the LORD, and said,
Who am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me
hitherto?  

<span id="017">17</span> And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O
God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while
to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high
degree, O LORD God.  

<span id="018">18</span> What can [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) speak
more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy
servant.  

<span id="019">19</span> O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according
to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known
all these great things.  

<span id="020">20</span> O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is
there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our
ears.  

<span id="021">21</span> And what one nation in the earth is like thy
people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), whom God went to redeem to be
his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by
driving out nations from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out
of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md)?  

<span id="022">22</span> For thy people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest
their God.  

<span id="023">23</span> Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou
hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be
established for ever, and do as thou hast said.  

<span id="024">24</span> Let it even be established, that thy name may
be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), even a God to
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and let the house of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) thy servant be established before thee.  

<span id="025">25</span> For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that
thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his
heart to pray before thee.  

<span id="026">26</span> And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised
this [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md) unto thy servant:  

<span id="027">27</span> Now therefore let it please thee to
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) the house of thy servant, that it may be
before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed
for ever.
