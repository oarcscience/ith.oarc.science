### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), and
unto his sons, and unto all the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and say unto them; This is the thing
which the LORD hath commanded, saying,  

<span id="003">3</span> What man soever there be of the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that killeth an
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007), or [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003), or
[goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001), in the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002), or
that killeth it out of the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002),  

<span id="004">4</span> And bringeth it not unto the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), to offer an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) unto the LORD before the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the LORD;
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) shall be imputed unto that man; he hath
shed [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000); and that man shall be cut off from
among his people:  

<span id="005">5</span> To the end that the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) may bring their sacrifices, which they
offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD,
unto the door of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), unto the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and offer them for peace offerings unto
the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
sprinkle the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of the LORD at the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), and burn the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) for a sweet savour unto the LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> And they shall no more offer their sacrifices
unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a
statute for ever unto them throughout their generations.  

<span id="008">8</span> And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man
there be of the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), or of the
strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) or
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002),  

<span id="009">9</span> And bringeth it not unto the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), to offer it unto the LORD; even
that man shall be cut off from among his people.  

<span id="010">10</span> And whatsoever man there be of the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), or of the strangers that sojourn among
you, that eateth any manner of [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000); I will
even set my face against that soul that eateth
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and will cut him off from among his
people.  

<span id="011">11</span> For the life of the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) is in the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000):
and I have given it to you upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) to
make an [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) for your souls: for it is the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) that maketh an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) for the soul.  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore I said unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), No soul of you shall eat
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), neither shall any
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) that sojourneth among you eat
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000).  

<span id="013">13</span> And whatsoever man there be of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), or of the strangers that sojourn among
you, which hunteth and catcheth any [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) or
fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) thereof, and cover it with
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008).  

<span id="014">14</span> For it is the life of all
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007); the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of it
is for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Ye shall eat the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of no manner of
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007): for the life of all
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) is the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000)
thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.  

<span id="015">15</span> And every soul that eateth that which died of
itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your
own country, or a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), he shall both wash
his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even:
then shall he be [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005).  

<span id="016">16</span> But if he wash them not, nor bathe his
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007); then he shall bear his iniquity.
