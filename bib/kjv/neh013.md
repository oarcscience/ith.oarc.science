### King James Version: Nehemiah Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> On that day they read in the book of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) in the audience of the people; and
therein was found written, that the [Ammonite](../ebd/ebd021.htm#003)
and the [Moabite](../ebd/ebd258.htm#006) should not come into the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of God for ever;  

<span id="002">2</span> Because they met not the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) with [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) and
with water, but hired [Balaam](../ebd/ebd042.htm#003) against them, that
he should [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) them: howbeit our God turned
the [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) into a blessing.  

<span id="003">3</span> Now it came to pass, when they had heard the
law, that they separated from [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) all the
mixed multitude.  

<span id="004">4</span> And before this,
[Eliashib](../ebd/ebd116.htm#003) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),
having the oversight of the [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003) of the
house of our God, was allied unto [Tobiah](../ebd/ebd369.htm#001):  

<span id="005">5</span> And he had prepared for him a great
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003), where aforetime they laid the meat
offerings, the [frankincense](../ebd/ebd138.htm#004), and the vessels,
and the tithes of the [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006), the new
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), and the oil, which was commanded to be
given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the
offerings of the priests.  

<span id="006">6</span> But in all this time was not I at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): for in the two and thirtieth year of
[Artaxerxes](../ebd/ebd032.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) came I unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and after certain days obtained I leave
of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001):  

<span id="007">7</span> And I came to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and understood of the evil that
[Eliashib](../ebd/ebd116.htm#003) did for
[Tobiah](../ebd/ebd369.htm#001), in preparing him a
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003) in the courts of the house of God.  

<span id="008">8</span> And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth
all the household stuff to [Tobiah](../ebd/ebd369.htm#001) out of the
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003).  

<span id="009">9</span> Then I commanded, and they cleansed the
chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God,
with the meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) and the
[frankincense](../ebd/ebd138.htm#004).  

<span id="010">10</span> And I perceived that the portions of the
Levites had not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that
did the work, were fled every one to his field.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why
is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them
in their place.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then brought all [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)
the [tithe](../ebd/ebd368.htm#005) of the [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006)
and the new [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) and the oil unto the
treasuries.  

<span id="013">13</span> And I made treasurers over the treasuries,
[Shelemiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#001) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),
and [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008) the scribe, and of the Levites,
[Pedaiah](../ebd/ebd288.htm#001): and next to them was
[Hanan](../ebd/ebd162.htm#001) the son of
[Zaccur](../ebd/ebd386.htm#004), the son of
[Mattaniah](../ebd/ebd243.htm#009): for they were counted
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005), and their office was to distribute
unto their brethren.  

<span id="014">14</span> Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and
wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and
for the offices thereof.  

<span id="015">15</span> In those days saw I in
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) some treading
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) presses on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003), and bringing in sheaves, and lading
asses; as also [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), grapes, and figs, and all
manner of burdens, which they brought into
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day: and I testified against them in
the day wherein they sold victuals.  

<span id="016">16</span> There dwelt men of
[Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001) also therein, which brought
[fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005), and all manner of ware, and sold on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) unto the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="017">17</span> Then I contended with the nobles of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and said unto them, What evil thing is
this that ye do, and profane the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day?  

<span id="018">18</span> Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God
bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath
upon [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) by profaning the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003).  

<span id="019">19</span> And it came to pass, that when the gates of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) began to be dark before the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003), I commanded that the gates should be
shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003): and some of my servants set I at the
gates, that there should no [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) be brought
in on the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day.  

<span id="020">20</span> So the merchants and sellers of all kind of
ware lodged without [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) once or twice.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then I testified against them, and said unto
them, Why [lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002) ye about the wall? if ye do so
again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more
on the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003).  

<span id="022">22</span> And I commanded the Levites that they should
cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to
sanctify the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day. Remember me, O my
God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of
thy [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005).  

<span id="023">23</span> In those days also saw I Jews that had married
wives of [Ashdod](../ebd/ebd033.htm#006), of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002), and of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005):  

<span id="024">24</span> And their children spake half in the speech of
[Ashdod](../ebd/ebd033.htm#006), and could not speak in the Jews'
language, but according to the language of each people.  

<span id="025">25</span> And I contended with them, and cursed them, and
smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear
by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor
take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.  

<span id="026">26</span> Did not [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) by these things? yet among many nations was
there no [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) like him, who was beloved of his
God, and God made him [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): nevertheless even him did outlandish
women cause to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="027">27</span> Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this
great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?  

<span id="028">28</span> And one of the sons of
[Joiada](../ebd/ebd209.htm#006), the son of
[Eliashib](../ebd/ebd116.htm#003) the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), was son in law to
[Sanballat](../ebd/ebd321.htm#003) the
[Horonite](../ebd/ebd182.htm#006): therefore I chased him from me.  

<span id="029">29</span> Remember them, O my God, because they have
defiled the priesthood, and the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of the
priesthood, and of the Levites.  

<span id="030">30</span> Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and
appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his
business;  

<span id="031">31</span> And for the [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), at times appointed, and for the
firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.
