### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 32

<span id="001">1</span> Now the children of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009.md) and the children of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md) had a very great multitude of
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md): and when they saw the land of Jazer,
and the land of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md), that, behold, the place
was a place for [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md);  

<span id="002">2</span> The children of [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md) and
the children of [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009.md) came and spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), and to [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000.md)
the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), and unto the princes of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), saying,  

<span id="003">3</span> [Ataroth](../ebd/ebd036.htm#000.md), and
[Dibon](../ebd/ebd103.htm#005.md), and Jazer, and
[Nimrah](../ebd/ebd273.htm#002), and [Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009.md),
and [Elealeh](../ebd/ebd114.htm#009.md), and Shebam, and
[Nebo](../ebd/ebd268.htm#004.md), and Beon,  

<span id="004">4</span> Even the country which the LORD smote before the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), is a land for
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), and thy servants have
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md):  

<span id="005">5</span> Wherefore, said they, if we have found
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) in thy sight, let this land be given unto
thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said unto the
children of [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md) and to the children of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009.md), Shall your brethren go to war, and
shall ye sit here?  

<span id="007">7</span> And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) from going over into the
land which the LORD hath given them?  

<span id="008">8</span> Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from
Kadeshbarnea to see the land.  

<span id="009">9</span> For when they went up unto the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [Eshcol](../ebd/ebd125.htm#000.md), and
saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), that they should not go into the land
which the LORD had given them.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the LORD's [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md)
was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying,  

<span id="011">11</span> Surely none of the men that came up out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), from twenty years old and upward, shall
see the land which I sware unto [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), unto
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006), and unto [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md);
because they have not wholly followed me:  

<span id="012">12</span> Save [Caleb](../ebd/ebd069.htm#003.md) the son of
[Jephunneh](../ebd/ebd203.htm#004.md) the Kenezite, and
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) the son of [Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006.md):
for they have wholly followed the LORD.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the LORD's [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md)
was kindled against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and he made them
wander in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) forty years, until all
the [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md), that had done evil in the sight
of the LORD, was consumed.  

<span id="014">14</span> And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers'
stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) of the LORD toward
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet
again leave them in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md); and ye
shall destroy all this people.  

<span id="016">16</span> And they came near unto him, and said, We will
build sheepfolds here for our [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), and
cities for our little ones:  

<span id="017">17</span> But we ourselves will go ready armed before the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), until we have brought them
unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities
because of the inhabitants of the land.  

<span id="018">18</span> We will not return unto our houses, until the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) have inherited every man his
inheritance.  

<span id="019">19</span> For we will not inherit with them on yonder
side [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), or forward; because our
inheritance is fallen to us on this side [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md)
eastward.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said unto
them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the LORD to
war,  

<span id="021">21</span> And will go all of you armed over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) before the LORD, until he hath driven
out his enemies from before him,  

<span id="022">22</span> And the land be subdued before the LORD: then
afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); and this land shall be your possession
before the LORD.  

<span id="023">23</span> But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have
sinned against the LORD: and be sure your [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
will find you out.  

<span id="024">24</span> Build you cities for your little ones, and
folds for your [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md); and do that which hath
proceeded out of your mouth.  

<span id="025">25</span> And the children of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md) and the children of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009.md) spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying, Thy servants will do as my lord
commandeth.  

<span id="026">26</span> Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all
our [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), shall be there in the cities of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md):  

<span id="027">27</span> But thy servants will pass over, every man
armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord saith.  

<span id="028">28</span> So concerning them
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) commanded
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md),
and [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) the son of
[Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006.md), and the chief fathers of the tribes of the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said unto
them, If the children of [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md) and the children
of [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009.md) will pass with you over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), every man armed to battle, before the
LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them
the land of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md) for a possession:  

<span id="030">30</span> But if they will not pass over with you armed,
they shall have possessions among you in the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> And the children of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md) and the children of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009.md) answered, saying, As the LORD hath said
unto thy servants, so will we do.  

<span id="032">32</span> We will pass over armed before the LORD into
the land of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md), that the possession of our
inheritance on this side [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) may be ours.  

<span id="033">33</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) gave unto
them, even to the children of [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md), and to the
children of [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009.md), and unto half the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) the
son of [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), the kingdom of
[Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md), and the kingdom of
[Og](../ebd/ebd277.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003.md), the land, with the cities thereof in
the coasts, even the cities of the country round about.  

<span id="034">34</span> And the children of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007) built [Dibon](../ebd/ebd103.htm#005.md), and
[Ataroth](../ebd/ebd036.htm#000), and [Aroer](../ebd/ebd032.htm#001.md),  

<span id="035">35</span> And Atroth, [Shophan](../ebd/ebd341.htm#001.md),
and [Jaazer](../ebd/ebd193.htm#002.md), and Jogbehah,  

<span id="036">36</span> And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities:
and folds for [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md).  

<span id="037">37</span> And the children of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009) built [Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009.md),
and [Elealeh](../ebd/ebd114.htm#009.md), and
[Kirjathaim](../ebd/ebd220.htm#001.md),  

<span id="038">38</span> And [Nebo](../ebd/ebd268.htm#004.md), and
Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and
[Shibmah](../ebd/ebd337.htm#000.md): and gave other names unto the cities
which they builded.  

<span id="039">39</span> And the children of
[Machir](../ebd/ebd235.htm#006.md) the son of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) went to
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md), and took it, and dispossessed the
Amorite which was in it.  

<span id="040">40</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) gave
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009) unto [Machir](../ebd/ebd235.htm#006.md) the
son of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md); and he dwelt therein.  

<span id="041">41</span> And [Jair](../ebd/ebd196.htm#001.md) the son of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) went and took the small towns thereof,
and called them Havothjair.  

<span id="042">42</span> And [Nobah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#004.md) went and
took [Kenath](../ebd/ebd217.htm#002.md), and the
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md) thereof, and called it
[Nobah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#004.md), after his own name.
