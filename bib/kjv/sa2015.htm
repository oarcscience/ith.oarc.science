</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> rose up early, and stood beside the way of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> for judgment, then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> to hear thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> said moreover, Oh that I were made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</A>!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#006">obeisance</A>, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And on this manner did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> to all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> that came to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> for judgment: so <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> stole the hearts of the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after forty years, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#001">Geshur</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A>, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, then I will serve the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> sent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#007">spies</A> throughout all the tribes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> reigneth in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> went two hundred men out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> sent for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</A> the Gilonite, David's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#005">counsellor</A>, from his city, even from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#002">Giloh</A>, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And there came a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, saying, The hearts of the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> are after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said unto all his servants that were with him at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And the king's servants said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> shall appoint.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> went forth, and all his household after him. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd289.htm#000">Pelethites</A>, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</A>, passed on before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Then said the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#007">Ittai</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#009">Gittite</A>, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>: for thou art a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A>, and also an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd128.htm#004">exile</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> and truth be with thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#007">Ittai</A> answered the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> liveth, surely in what place my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#007">Ittai</A>, Go and pass over. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#007">Ittai</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#009">Gittite</A> passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> also himself passed over the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd218.htm#008">Kidron</A>, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And lo <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</A> also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of God: and they set down the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of God; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</A> went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</A>, Carry back the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said also unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, Art not thou a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#000">seer</A>? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#002">Ahimaaz</A> thy son, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;See, I will tarry in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, until there come word from you to certify me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</A> therefore and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</A> carried the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of God again to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: and they tarried there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> went up by the ascent of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went <A HREF="../ebd/ebd044.htm#008">barefoot</A>: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And one told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</A> is among the conspirators with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</A> into foolishness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> was come to the top of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A>, where he worshipped God, behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd185.htm#003">Hushai</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd029.htm#006">Archite</A> came to meet him with his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A>, and earth upon his head:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Unto whom <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A> unto me:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;But if thou return to the city, and say unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>, I will be thy servant, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And hast thou not there with thee <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</A> the priests?  therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</A> the priests.<BR>
