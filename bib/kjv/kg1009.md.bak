### King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, when
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) had finished the building of the house
of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was
pleased to do,  

<span id="002">2</span> That the LORD appeared to
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) the second time, as he had appeared
unto him at [Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) and thy supplication, that thou hast
made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to
put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there
perpetually.  

<span id="004">4</span> And if thou wilt walk before me, as
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) thy father walked, in integrity of heart,
and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee,
and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:  

<span id="005">5</span> Then I will establish the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of thy kingdom upon
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) for ever, as I promised to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) thy father, saying, There shall not fail
thee a man upon the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> But if ye shall at all turn from following me,
ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes
which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) them:  

<span id="007">7</span> Then will I cut off
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) out of the land which I have given them;
and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my
sight; and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) shall be a
[proverb](../ebd/ebd301.htm#002.md) and a byword among all people:  

<span id="008">8</span> And at this house, which is high, every one that
passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall
[hiss](../ebd/ebd179.htm#005.md); and they shall say, Why hath the LORD
done thus unto this land, and to this house?  

<span id="009">9</span> And they shall answer, Because they forsook the
LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and have taken hold upon other gods, and
have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought
upon them all this evil.  

<span id="010">10</span> And it came to pass at the end of twenty years,
when [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) had built the two houses, the
house of the LORD, and the king's house,  

<span id="011">11</span> (Now [Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001.md) had
furnished [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) with
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007) trees and [fir](../ebd/ebd133.htm#005.md)
trees, and with [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), according to all his
desire,) that then [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) gave [Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003.md)
twenty cities in the land of [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003.md) came out
from [Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001.md) to see the cities which
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) had given him; and they pleased him
not.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he said, What cities are these which thou
hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of
[Cabul](../ebd/ebd068.htm#001.md) unto this day.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003.md) sent to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) sixscore talents of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And this is the reason of the
[levy](../ebd/ebd228.htm#001) which [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) raised; for to build the house of the
LORD, and his own house, and [Millo](../ebd/ebd255.htm#004.md), and the
wall of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and
[Hazor](../ebd/ebd169.htm#006), and [Megiddo](../ebd/ebd246.htm#004.md),
and [Gezer](../ebd/ebd147.htm#004.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> For [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) had gone
up, and taken [Gezer](../ebd/ebd147.htm#004.md), and burnt it with fire,
and slain the [Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007.md) that dwelt in the
city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) built
[Gezer](../ebd/ebd147.htm#004.md), and Bethhoron the nether,  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Baalath](../ebd/ebd038.htm#006.md), and
[Tadmor](../ebd/ebd357.htm#004.md) in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), in the land,  

<span id="019">19</span> And all the cities of store that
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) had, and cities for his chariots, and
cities for his horsemen, and that which [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md)
desired to build in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and in
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md), and in all the land of his dominion.  

<span id="020">20</span> And all the people that were left of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006), [Hittites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#006.md),
[Perizzites](../ebd/ebd290.htm#006), [Hivites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#007.md),
and [Jebusites](../ebd/ebd199.htm#004.md), which were not of the children
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),  

<span id="021">21</span> Their children that were left after them in the
land, whom the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) also were not
able utterly to destroy, upon those did [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md)
[levy](../ebd/ebd228.htm#001) a [tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006.md) of
bondservice unto this day.  

<span id="022">22</span> But of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) did [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md)
make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his
princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his
horsemen.  

<span id="023">23</span> These were the chief of the officers that were
over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the
people that wrought in the work.  

<span id="024">24</span> But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city
of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) unto her house which
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) had built for her: then did he build
[Millo](../ebd/ebd255.htm#004.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> And three times in a year did
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) offer burnt offerings and peace
offerings upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) which he built unto
the LORD, and he burnt [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) that was before the LORD. So he finished
the house.  

<span id="026">26</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) made a navy of
[ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003.md) in Eziongeber, which is beside Eloth, on
the shore of the Red sea, in the land of
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003.md) sent in the
navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the
servants of [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> And they came to
[Ophir](../ebd/ebd279.htm#007.md), and fetched from thence
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), four hundred and twenty talents, and
brought it to [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md).
