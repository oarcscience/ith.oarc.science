### King James Version: Zechariah Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass in the fourth year of
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007.md), that the
word of the LORD came unto [Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006.md) in the
fourth day of the ninth month, even in
[Chisleu](../ebd/ebd081.htm#002.md);  

<span id="002">2</span> When they had sent unto the house of God
[Sherezer](../ebd/ebd335.htm#009.md) and Regemmelech, and their men, to
pray before the LORD,  

<span id="003">3</span> And to speak unto the priests which were in the
house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep
in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many
years?  

<span id="004">4</span> Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me,
saying,  

<span id="005">5</span> Speak unto all the people of the land, and to
the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh
month, even those seventy years, did ye at all
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) unto me, even to me?  

<span id="006">6</span> And when ye did eat, and when ye did
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), did not ye eat for yourselves, and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) for yourselves?  

<span id="007">7</span> Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath
cried by the former prophets, when [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md)
was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her,
when men inhabited the south and the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md)?  

<span id="008">8</span> And the word of the LORD came unto
[Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006.md), saying,  

<span id="009">9</span> Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute
true judgment, and shew [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) and compassions
every man to his brother:  

<span id="010">10</span> And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless,
the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md), nor the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md); and let none of you imagine evil against
his brother in your heart.  

<span id="011">11</span> But they refused to hearken, and pulled away
the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.  

<span id="012">12</span> Yea, they made their hearts as an
[adamant](../ebd/ebd008.htm#001) [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), lest
they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath
sent in his [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) by the former prophets:
therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="013">13</span> Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried,
and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the
LORD of hosts:  

<span id="014">14</span> But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all
the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them,
that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land
desolate.
