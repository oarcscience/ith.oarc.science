<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Joshua Chapter 7</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;But the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd006.htm#006">Achan</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#007">Carmi</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd385.htm#008">Zabdi</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#001">Zerah</A>, of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, took of the accursed thing: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> of the LORD was kindled against the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> sent men from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A>, which is beside Bethaven, on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</A>, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And they returned to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A>; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but few.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A> smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> even unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd332.htm#008">Shebarim</A>, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and put <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> upon their heads.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>, to deliver us into the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</A>, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;O LORD, what shall I say, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> turneth their backs before their enemies!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</A> and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Therefore the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A> which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> rose up early in the morning, and brought <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> by their tribes; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> was taken:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And he brought the family of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd385.htm#008">Zabdi</A> was taken:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And he brought his household man by man; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd006.htm#006">Achan</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#007">Carmi</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd385.htm#008">Zabdi</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#001">Zerah</A>, of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, was taken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd006.htm#006">Achan</A>, My son, give, I pray thee, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> to the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and make <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#003">confession</A> unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd006.htm#006">Achan</A> answered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and thus and thus have I done:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and a wedge of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> under it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> sent messengers, and they ran unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>; and, behold, it was hid in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> under it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And they took them out of the midst of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>, and brought them unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>, and unto all the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and laid them out before the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>, and all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> with him, took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd006.htm#006">Achan</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#001">Zerah</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and the garment, and the wedge of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd007.htm#000">Achor</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And they raised over him a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A> of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd007.htm#000">Achor</A>, unto this day.<BR>
