### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 126

<span id="001">1</span> When the LORD turned again the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) of [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), we
were like them that [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our
tongue with singing: then said they among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), The LORD hath done great things for
them.  

<span id="003">3</span> The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof
we are glad.  

<span id="004">4</span> Turn again our
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md), O LORD, as the streams in the
south.  

<span id="005">5</span> They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.  

<span id="006">6</span> He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing
precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his
sheaves with him.
