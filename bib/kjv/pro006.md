### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> My son, if thou be
[surety](../ebd/ebd353.htm#005.md) for thy friend, if thou hast stricken
thy hand with a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md),  

<span id="002">2</span> Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth,
thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.  

<span id="003">3</span> Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when
thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make
sure thy friend.  

<span id="004">4</span> Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to
thine eyelids.  

<span id="005">5</span> Deliver thyself as a
[roe](../ebd/ebd315.htm#002.md) from the hand of the hunter, and as a
[bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000.md) from the hand of the
[fowler](../ebd/ebd138.htm#002.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Go to the [ant](../ebd/ebd024.htm#009.md), thou
sluggard; consider her ways, and be [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md):  

<span id="007">7</span> Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,  

<span id="008">8</span> Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth
her food in the [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt
thou arise out of thy sleep?  

<span id="010">10</span> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little
folding of the hands to sleep:  

<span id="011">11</span> So shall thy poverty come as one that
travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.  

<span id="012">12</span> A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a
froward mouth.  

<span id="013">13</span> He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his
feet, he teacheth with his fingers;  

<span id="014">14</span> Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth
mischief continually; he soweth discord.  

<span id="015">15</span> Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly;
suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.  

<span id="016">16</span> These six things doth the LORD hate: yea,
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) are an
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md) unto him:  

<span id="017">17</span> A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that
shed innocent [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md),  

<span id="018">18</span> An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations,
feet that be swift in running to mischief,  

<span id="019">19</span> A false [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) that
speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.  

<span id="020">20</span> My son, keep thy father's commandment, and
forsake not the law of thy mother:  

<span id="021">21</span> Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie
them about thy [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou
sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with
thee.  

<span id="023">23</span> For the commandment is a
[lamp](../ebd/ebd223.htm#007.md); and the law is light; and reproofs of
instruction are the way of life:  

<span id="024">24</span> To keep thee from the evil woman, from the
flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.  

<span id="025">25</span> [Lust](../ebd/ebd233.htm#005.md) not after her
beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.  

<span id="026">26</span> For by means of a whorish woman a man is
brought to a piece of [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md): and the adultress
will hunt for the precious life.  

<span id="027">27</span> Can a man take fire in his
[bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md), and his clothes not be burned?  

<span id="028">28</span> Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be
burned?  

<span id="029">29</span> So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife;
whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.  

<span id="030">30</span> Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to
satisfy his soul when he is hungry;  

<span id="031">31</span> But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold;
he shall give all the substance of his house.  

<span id="032">32</span> But whoso committeth
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009.md) with a woman lacketh understanding: he
that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.  

<span id="033">33</span> A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his
reproach shall not be wiped away.  

<span id="034">34</span> For [jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008.md) is the
rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.  

<span id="035">35</span> He will not regard any
[ransom](../ebd/ebd307.htm#005.md); neither will he rest content, though
thou givest many gifts.
