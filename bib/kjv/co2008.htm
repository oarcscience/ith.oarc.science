<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 8</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> of God bestowed on the churches of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A> poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A>, and take upon us the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#002">fellowship</A> of the ministering to the saints.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Insomuch that we desired <A HREF="../ebd/ebd368.htm#007">Titus</A>, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For ye know the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> of our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>, that ye through his poverty might be rich.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But thanks be to God, which put the same <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#006">earnest</A> care into the heart of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd368.htm#007">Titus</A> for you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> throughout all the churches;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And not that only, but who was also <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> of the churches to travel with us with this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A>, which is administered by us to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Whether any do enquire of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd368.htm#007">Titus</A>, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.<BR>
