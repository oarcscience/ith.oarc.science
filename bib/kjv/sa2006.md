### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> Again, [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) gathered
together all the [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), thirty thousand.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) arose, and
went with all the people that were with him from Baale of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), to bring up from thence the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God, whose name is called by the name of
the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims.  

<span id="003">3</span> And they set the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of
God upon a new [cart](../ebd/ebd073.htm#001.md), and brought it out of the
house of [Abinadab](../ebd/ebd004.htm#001.md) that was in
[Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008): and [Uzzah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#001.md) and
[Ahio](../ebd/ebd014.htm#007.md), the sons of
[Abinadab](../ebd/ebd004.htm#001.md), drave the new
[cart](../ebd/ebd073.htm#001.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And they brought it out of the house of
[Abinadab](../ebd/ebd004.htm#001.md) which was at
[Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008.md), accompanying the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of God: and [Ahio](../ebd/ebd014.htm#007.md)
went before the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) and all the
house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) played before the LORD on all
manner of instruments made of [fir](../ebd/ebd133.htm#005.md)
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md), even on harps, and on psalteries, and on
timbrels, and on cornets, and on [cymbals](../ebd/ebd095.htm#001.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor,
[Uzzah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#001.md) put forth his hand to the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen
shook it.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) of the
LORD was kindled against [Uzzah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#001.md); and God smote
him there for his error; and there he died by the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) was
displeased, because the LORD had made a [breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005.md)
upon [Uzzah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#001.md): and he called the name of the place
Perezuzzah to this day.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) was afraid of
the LORD that day, and said, How shall the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md)
of the LORD come to me?  

<span id="010">10</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) would not
remove the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD unto him into the
city of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md): but
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) carried it aside into the house of
Obededom the [Gittite](../ebd/ebd149.htm#009.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the
LORD continued in the house of Obededom the
[Gittite](../ebd/ebd149.htm#009.md) three months: and the LORD blessed
Obededom, and all his household.  

<span id="012">12</span> And it was told [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), saying, The LORD hath blessed the house
of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of God. So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
went and brought up the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God from the
house of Obededom into the city of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) with
gladness.  

<span id="013">13</span> And it was so, that when they that bare the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD had gone six paces, he
sacrificed oxen and fatlings.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) danced
before the LORD with all his might; and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
was girded with a [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md)
[ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) and all the
house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) brought up the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD with shouting, and with the
sound of the trumpet.  

<span id="016">16</span> And as the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the
LORD came into the city of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md),
[Michal](../ebd/ebd253.htm#001.md) Saul's daughter looked through a window,
and saw [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her
heart.  

<span id="017">17</span> And they brought in the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD, and set it in his place, in
the midst of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) that
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) had pitched for it: and
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) offered burnt offerings and peace
offerings before the LORD.  

<span id="018">18</span> And as soon as [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
had made an end of [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) burnt offerings and
peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of
hosts.  

<span id="019">19</span> And he dealt among all the people, even among
the whole multitude of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), as well to the
women as men, to every one a [cake](../ebd/ebd068.htm#009.md) of
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), and a good piece of
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), and a [flagon](../ebd/ebd135.htm#002.md) of
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md). So all the people departed every one to
his house.  

<span id="020">20</span> Then [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) returned to
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) his household. And
[Michal](../ebd/ebd253.htm#001.md) the daughter of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) came out to meet
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and said, How glorious was the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) to day,
who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his
servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!  

<span id="021">21</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said unto
[Michal](../ebd/ebd253.htm#001.md), It was before the LORD, which chose me
before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over
the people of the LORD, over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): therefore
will I play before the LORD.  

<span id="022">22</span> And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will
be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast
spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.  

<span id="023">23</span> Therefore [Michal](../ebd/ebd253.htm#001.md) the
daughter of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) had no child unto the day of
her death.
