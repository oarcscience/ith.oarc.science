### King James Version: Esther Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month
[Adar](../ebd/ebd008.htm#002.md), on the thirteenth day of the same, when
the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution,
in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them,
(though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them
that hated them;)  

<span id="002">2</span> The Jews gathered themselves together in their
cities throughout all the provinces of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md), to lay hand on such as sought their
hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon
all people.  

<span id="003">3</span> And all the rulers of the provinces, and the
lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), helped the Jews; because the fear of
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md) fell upon them.  

<span id="004">4</span> For [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md) was great
in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces:
for this man [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md) waxed greater and
greater.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the
stroke of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), and slaughter, and
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md), and did what they would unto those
that hated them.  

<span id="006">6</span> And in [Shushan](../ebd/ebd342.htm#003.md) the
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md) the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred
men.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Parshandatha](../ebd/ebd285.htm#005.md), and
Dalphon, and Aspatha,  

<span id="008">8</span> And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Parmashta](../ebd/ebd285.htm#003.md), and
Arisai, and Aridai, and [Vajezatha](../ebd/ebd376.htm#007.md),  

<span id="010">10</span> The ten sons of [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004.md)
the son of [Hammedatha](../ebd/ebd160.htm#008.md), the enemy of the Jews,
slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.  

<span id="011">11</span> On that day the number of those that were slain
in [Shushan](../ebd/ebd342.htm#003) the [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md)
was brought before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said unto
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md), The
Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in
[Shushan](../ebd/ebd342.htm#003) the [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md),
and the ten sons of [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004.md); what have they done
in the rest of the king's provinces? now what is thy petition? and it
shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be
done.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then said [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md), If
it please the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), let it be granted to the
Jews which are in [Shushan](../ebd/ebd342.htm#003.md) to do to morrow also
according unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged
upon the [gallows](../ebd/ebd142.htm#005.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) commanded
it so to be done: and the decree was given at
[Shushan](../ebd/ebd342.htm#003.md); and they hanged Haman's ten sons.  

<span id="015">15</span> For the Jews that were in
[Shushan](../ebd/ebd342.htm#003.md) gathered themselves together on the
fourteenth day also of the month [Adar](../ebd/ebd008.htm#002.md), and slew
three hundred men at [Shushan](../ebd/ebd342.htm#003.md); but on the prey
they laid not their hand.  

<span id="016">16</span> But the other Jews that were in the king's
provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and
had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five
thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,  

<span id="017">17</span> On the thirteenth day of the month
[Adar](../ebd/ebd008.htm#002.md); and on the fourteenth day of the same
rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.  

<span id="018">18</span> But the Jews that were at
[Shushan](../ebd/ebd342.htm#003.md) assembled together on the thirteenth
day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of
the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.  

<span id="019">19</span> Therefore the Jews of the
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md), that dwelt in the unwalled towns,
made the fourteenth day of the month [Adar](../ebd/ebd008.htm#002.md) a day
of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to
another.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md) wrote
these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the
provinces of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md), both nigh and far,  

<span id="021">21</span> To stablish this among them, that they should
keep the fourteenth day of the month [Adar](../ebd/ebd008.htm#002.md), and
the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,  

<span id="022">22</span> As the days wherein the Jews rested from their
enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy,
and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of
feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to
the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun,
and as [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md) had written unto them;  

<span id="024">24</span> Because [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004.md) the son
of [Hammedatha](../ebd/ebd160.htm#008.md), the
[Agagite](../ebd/ebd011.htm#009.md), the enemy of all the Jews, had devised
against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast
[Pur](../ebd/ebd302.htm#006.md), that is, the lot, to consume them, and to
destroy them;  

<span id="025">25</span> But when [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md) came
before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), he commanded by letters that
his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon
his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the
[gallows](../ebd/ebd142.htm#005.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> Wherefore they called these days Purim after
the name of [Pur](../ebd/ebd302.htm#006.md). Therefore for all the words of
this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and
which had come unto them,  

<span id="027">27</span> The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon
their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it
should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their
[writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005.md), and according to their appointed time
every year;  

<span id="028">28</span> And that these days should be remembered and
kept throughout every [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md), every family,
every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not
fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their
seed.  

<span id="029">29</span> Then [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md) the
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md), the daughter of
[Abihail](../ebd/ebd003.htm#003), and [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md)
the [Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004.md), wrote with all authority, to confirm
this second letter of Purim.  

<span id="030">30</span> And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to
the hundred twenty and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) provinces of the
kingdom of [Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md), with words of peace and
truth,  

<span id="031">31</span> To confirm these days of Purim in their times
appointed, according as [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md) the
[Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004) and [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md) the
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md) had enjoined them, and as they had
decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings
and their cry.  

<span id="032">32</span> And the decree of
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md) confirmed these matters of Purim; and it
was written in the book.
