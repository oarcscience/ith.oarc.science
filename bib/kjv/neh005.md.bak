### King James Version: Nehemiah Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> And there was a great cry of the people and of
their wives against their brethren the Jews.  

<span id="002">2</span> For there were that said, We, our sons, and our
daughters, are many: therefore we take up [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md)
for them, that we may eat, and live.  

<span id="003">3</span> Some also there were that said, We have
mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md), because of the
[dearth](../ebd/ebd099.htm#005.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> There were also that said, We have borrowed
money for the king's [tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006.md), and that upon our
lands and vineyards.  

<span id="005">5</span> Yet now our [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) is as
the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) of our brethren, our children as
their children: and, lo, we bring into [bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md)
our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are
brought unto [bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md) already: neither is it in
our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I was very angry when I heard their cry and
these words.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the
nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact
[usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006.md), every one of his brother. And I set a
great assembly against them.  

<span id="008">8</span> And I said unto them, We after our ability have
redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md); and will ye even sell your brethren?
or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found
nothing to answer.  

<span id="009">9</span> Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye
not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) our enemies?  

<span id="010">10</span> I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants,
might exact of them money and [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md): I pray you,
let us leave off this [usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day,
their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also
the hundredth part of the money, and of the
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006), the [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), and
the oil, that ye exact of them.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then said they, We will restore them, and will
require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the
priests, and took an [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md) of them, that they
should do according to this promise.  

<span id="013">13</span> Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out
every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this
promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) said,
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md), and praised the LORD. And the people did
according to this promise.  

<span id="014">14</span> Moreover from the time that I was appointed to
be their governor in the land of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), from
the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of
[Artaxerxes](../ebd/ebd032.htm#006) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),
that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) of the governor.  

<span id="015">15</span> But the former governors that had been before
me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) and [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), beside
forty shekels of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md); yea, even their
servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the
fear of God.  

<span id="016">16</span> Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall,
neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither
unto the work.  

<span id="017">17</span> Moreover there were at my table an hundred and
fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among
the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) that are about us.  

<span id="018">18</span> Now that which was prepared for me daily was
one [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007.md) and six choice
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md); also fowls were prepared for me, and
once in ten days store of all sorts of [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md):
yet for all this required not I the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) of
the governor, because the [bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md) was heavy
upon this people.  

<span id="019">19</span> Think upon me, my God, for good, according to
all that I have done for this people.
