### King James Version: Job Chapter 40

<span id="001">1</span> Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty
instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then Job answered the LORD, and said,  

<span id="004">4</span> Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I
will lay mine hand upon my mouth.  

<span id="005">5</span> Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea,
twice; but I will proceed no further.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the
whirlwind, and said,  

<span id="007">7</span> Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand
of thee, and declare thou unto me.  

<span id="008">8</span> Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou
condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?  

<span id="009">9</span> Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou
[thunder](../ebd/ebd365.htm#003.md) with a voice like him?  

<span id="010">10</span> Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency;
and array thyself with [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) and beauty.  

<span id="011">11</span> Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold
every one that is proud, and abase him.  

<span id="012">12</span> Look on every one that is proud, and bring him
low; and tread down the wicked in their place.  

<span id="013">13</span> Hide them in the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md)
together; and bind their faces in secret.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then will I also confess unto thee that thine
own right hand can save thee.  

<span id="015">15</span> Behold now [behemoth](../ebd/ebd051.htm#003.md),
which I made with thee; he eateth [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md) as an
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his
force is in the navel of his [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> He moveth his tail like a
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md): the sinews of his stones are wrapped
together.  

<span id="018">18</span> His bones are as strong
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md); his
bones are like bars of [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> He is the chief of the ways of God: he that
made him can make his [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) to approach unto
him.  

<span id="020">20</span> Surely the mountains bring him forth food,
where all the beasts of the field play.  

<span id="021">21</span> He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert
of the [reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000.md), and fens.  

<span id="022">22</span> The shady trees cover him with their
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002); the [willows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#006.md) of
the [brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006.md) compass him about.  

<span id="023">23</span> Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth
not: he trusteth that he can draw up [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md)
into his mouth.  

<span id="024">24</span> He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth
through snares.
