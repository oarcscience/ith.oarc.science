### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as
the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.  

<span id="002">2</span> Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but
the LORD pondereth the hearts.  

<span id="003">3</span> To do [justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007) and
judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002).  

<span id="004">4</span> An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing
of the wicked, is [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="005">5</span> The thoughts of the diligent tend only to
plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want.  

<span id="006">6</span> The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a
vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.  

<span id="007">7</span> The [robbery](../ebd/ebd315.htm#000) of the
wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.  

<span id="008">8</span> The way of man is froward and strange: but as
for the pure, his work is right.  

<span id="009">9</span> It is better to dwell in a corner of the
housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.  

<span id="010">10</span> The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his
neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.  

<span id="011">11</span> When the scorner is punished, the simple is
made [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004): and when the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.  

<span id="012">12</span> The righteous man wisely considereth the house
of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.  

<span id="013">13</span> Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006), he also shall cry himself, but shall not
be heard.  

<span id="014">14</span> A [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005) in secret
pacifieth [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002): and a reward in the
[bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008) strong wrath.  

<span id="015">15</span> It is joy to the just to do judgment: but
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) shall be to the workers of
iniquity.  

<span id="016">16</span> The man that wandereth out of the way of
understanding shall remain in the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004)
of the dead.  

<span id="017">17</span> He that loveth pleasure shall be a
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) man: he that loveth
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) and oil shall not be rich.  

<span id="018">18</span> The wicked shall be a
[ransom](../ebd/ebd307.htm#005) for the righteous, and the transgressor
for the upright.  

<span id="019">19</span> It is better to dwell in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), than with a contentious and an
angry woman.  

<span id="020">20</span> There is treasure to be desired and oil in the
dwelling of the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004); but a foolish man
spendeth it up.  

<span id="021">21</span> He that followeth after
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) and
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) findeth life,
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), and honour.  

<span id="022">22</span> A [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) man scaleth the
city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence
thereof.  

<span id="023">23</span> Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth
his soul from troubles.  

<span id="024">24</span> Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who
dealeth in proud wrath.  

<span id="025">25</span> The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his
hands refuse to labour.  

<span id="026">26</span> He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the
righteous giveth and spareth not.  

<span id="027">27</span> The [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of the
wicked is [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003): how much more, when he
bringeth it with a wicked mind?  

<span id="028">28</span> A false [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) shall
perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.  

<span id="029">29</span> A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the
upright, he directeth his way.  

<span id="030">30</span> There is no wisdom nor understanding nor
counsel against the LORD.  

<span id="031">31</span> The horse is prepared against the day of
battle: but safety is of the LORD.
