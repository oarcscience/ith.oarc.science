### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass in the days of
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005.md) the son of
[Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000.md), the son of
[Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004), [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), that [Rezin](../ebd/ebd312.htm#006.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md), and
[Pekah](../ebd/ebd288.htm#002.md) the son of
[Remaliah](../ebd/ebd310.htm#003), [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), went up toward
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) to war against it, but could not
prevail against it.  

<span id="002">2</span> And it was told the house of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), saying, [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md)
is confederate with [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md). And his heart was
moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) are moved with the wind.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then said the LORD unto
[Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007.md), Go forth now to meet
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005.md), thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end
of the [conduit](../ebd/ebd087.htm#009.md) of the upper pool in the
[highway](../ebd/ebd178.htm#005.md) of the fuller's field;  

<span id="004">4</span> And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear
not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking
firebrands, for the fierce [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) of
[Rezin](../ebd/ebd312.htm#006) with [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md), and
of the son of [Remaliah](../ebd/ebd310.htm#003.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Because [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md),
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), and the son of
[Remaliah](../ebd/ebd310.htm#003.md), have taken evil counsel against thee,
saying,  

<span id="006">6</span> Let us go up against
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and vex it, and let us make a
[breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005.md) therein for us, and set a
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) in the midst of it, even the son of
[Tabeal](../ebd/ebd355.htm#009.md):  

<span id="007">7</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand,
neither shall it come to pass.  

<span id="008">8</span> For the head of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md)
is [Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md), and the head of
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007) is [Rezin](../ebd/ebd312.htm#006.md); and
within threescore and five years shall [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md)
be broken, that it be not a people.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the head of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md)
is [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md), and the head of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md) is Remaliah's son. If ye will not
believe, surely ye shall not be established.  

<span id="010">10</span> Moreover the LORD spake again unto
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005.md), saying,  

<span id="011">11</span> Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it
either in the depth, or in the height above.  

<span id="012">12</span> But [Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005.md) said, I will
not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he said, Hear ye now, O house of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md); Is it a small thing for you to weary
men, but will ye weary my God also?  

<span id="014">14</span> Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a
sign; Behold, a [virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009.md) shall conceive, and bear
a son, and shall call his name [Immanuel](../ebd/ebd187.htm#007.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> [Butter](../ebd/ebd067.htm#002.md) and
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md) shall he eat, that he may know to refuse
the evil, and choose the good.  

<span id="016">16</span> For before the child shall know to refuse the
evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be
forsaken of both her kings.  

<span id="017">17</span> The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy
people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the
day that [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) departed from
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007); even the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the
LORD shall [hiss](../ebd/ebd179.htm#005.md) for the
[fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004.md) that is in the uttermost part of the rivers
of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and for the
[bee](../ebd/ebd050.htm#000.md) that is in the land of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And they shall come, and shall rest all of them
in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all
thorns, and upon all bushes.  

<span id="020">20</span> In the same day shall the Lord shave with a
[razor](../ebd/ebd307.htm#009.md) that is hired, namely, by them beyond the
river, by the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md), the head, and the hair of the feet:
and it shall also consume the [beard](../ebd/ebd049.htm#000.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that a
man shall nourish a young [cow](../ebd/ebd092.htm#001.md), and two
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md);  

<span id="022">22</span> And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000.md) that they shall give he shall eat
[butter](../ebd/ebd067.htm#002): for [butter](../ebd/ebd067.htm#002.md) and
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md) shall every one eat that is left in the
land.  

<span id="023">23</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that
every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand
silverlings, it shall even be for briers and thorns.  

<span id="024">24</span> With [arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005.md) and with
bows shall men come thither; because all the land shall become briers
and thorns.  

<span id="025">25</span> And on all hills that shall be digged with the
[mattock](../ebd/ebd244.htm#007.md), there shall not come thither the fear
of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and
for the treading of lesser [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md).
