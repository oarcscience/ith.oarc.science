### King James Version: Nehemiah Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> The words of [Nehemiah](../ebd/ebd269.htm#007.md)
the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month
[Chisleu](../ebd/ebd081.htm#002.md), in the twentieth year, as I was in
[Shushan](../ebd/ebd342.htm#003) the [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md),  

<span id="002">2</span> That [Hanani](../ebd/ebd162.htm#003.md), one of my
brethren, came, he and certain men of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md);
and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left
of the [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md), and concerning
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And they said unto me, The remnant that are left
of the [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md) there in the province are in
great affliction and reproach: the wall of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) also is broken down, and the gates
thereof are burned with fire.  

<span id="004">4</span> And it came to pass, when I heard these words,
that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and
prayed before the God of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md),  

<span id="005">5</span> And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), the great and terrible God, that
keepeth [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) and
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) for them that love him and observe his
commandments:  

<span id="006">6</span> Let thine [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) now be
attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) of thy servant, which I pray before thee
now, day and night, for the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), which we have sinned against thee: both
I and my father's house have sinned.  

<span id="007">7</span> We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and
have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments,
which thou commandedst thy servant [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou
commandedst thy servant [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying, If ye
transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:  

<span id="009">9</span> But if ye turn unto me, and keep my
commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the
uttermost part of the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), yet will I gather
them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) to set my name there.  

<span id="010">10</span> Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom
thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.  

<span id="011">11</span> O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) be attentive to the
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) of thy servant, and to the
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) of thy servants, who desire to fear thy
name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) in the sight of this man. For I was the
king's cupbearer.
