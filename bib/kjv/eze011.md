### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> Moreover the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009)
lifted me up, and brought me unto the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000)
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the LORD's house, which looketh
eastward: and behold at the door of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008)
five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of
[Azur](../ebd/ebd038.htm#003), and [Pelatiah](../ebd/ebd288.htm#006) the
son of [Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003), princes of the people.  

<span id="002">2</span> Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the
men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:  

<span id="003">3</span> Which say, It is not near; let us build houses:
this city is the caldron, and we be the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007).  

<span id="004">4</span> Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son
of man.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of the
LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus
have ye said, O house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): for I know the
things that come into your mind, every one of them.  

<span id="006">6</span> Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and
ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain
whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), and this city is the caldron: but I will
bring you forth out of the midst of it.  

<span id="008">8</span> Ye have feared the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003); and I will bring a
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) upon you, saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="009">9</span> And I will bring you out of the midst thereof,
and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments
among you.  

<span id="010">10</span> Ye shall fall by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003); I will [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005)
you in the border of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and ye shall know
that I am the LORD.  

<span id="011">11</span> This city shall not be your caldron, neither
shall ye be the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) in the midst thereof; but
I will [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) you in the border of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000):  

<span id="012">12</span> And ye shall know that I am the LORD: for ye
have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have
done after the manners of the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005) that are
round about you.  

<span id="013">13</span> And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that
[Pelatiah](../ebd/ebd288.htm#006) the son of
[Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003) died. Then fell I down upon my face,
and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a
full end of the remnant of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)?  

<span id="014">14</span> Again the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="015">15</span> Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren,
the men of thy kindred, and all the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) wholly, are they unto whom the
inhabitants of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) have said, Get you far
from the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession.  

<span id="016">16</span> Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
Although I have cast them far off among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), and although I have scattered them
among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005) in the countries where they shall
come.  

<span id="017">17</span> Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will
even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries
where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="018">18</span> And they shall come thither, and they shall
take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations
thereof from thence.  

<span id="019">19</span> And I will give them one heart, and I will put
a new [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) within you; and I will take the
stony heart out of their [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), and will give
them an heart of [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007):  

<span id="020">20</span> That they may walk in my statutes, and keep
mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be
their God.  

<span id="021">21</span> But as for them whose heart walketh after the
heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will
recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and
the wheels beside them; and the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the
God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) was over them above.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the
LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain
which is on the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) side of the city.  

<span id="024">24</span> Afterwards the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009)
took me up, and brought me in a [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000) by the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of God into
[Chaldea](../ebd/ebd076.htm#000), to them of the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002). So the
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000) that I had seen went up from me.  

<span id="025">25</span> Then I spake unto them of the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) all the things that the LORD had
shewed me.
