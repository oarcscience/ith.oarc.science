### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> And they took their
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001) from [Elim](../ebd/ebd117.htm#001.md), and
all the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) came unto the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md),
which is between [Elim](../ebd/ebd117.htm#001.md) and
[Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009.md), on the fifteenth day of the second month
after their departing out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the whole
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) murmured against
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md):  

<span id="003">3</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) said unto them, Would to God we had died
by the hand of the LORD in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md),
when we sat by the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) pots, and when we did
eat [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) to the full; for ye have brought us
forth into this [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), to kill this whole
assembly with hunger.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then said the LORD unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Behold, I will
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) for you; and the people shall go out and
gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they
will walk in my law, or no.  

<span id="005">5</span> And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day
they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as
much as they gather daily.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) said unto all the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), At even, then ye shall know that the
LORD hath brought you out from the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md):  

<span id="007">7</span> And in the morning, then ye shall see the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the LORD; for that he heareth your
murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against
us?  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said, This
shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) to eat, and in the morning
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) to the full; for that the LORD heareth
your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your
murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) spake unto
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), Say unto all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), Come near before the LORD: for he hath
heard your murmurings.  

<span id="010">10</span> And it came to pass, as
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) spake unto the whole
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), that they looked toward the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), and, behold, the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the LORD appeared in the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="012">12</span> I have heard the murmurings of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): speak unto them, saying, At even ye
shall eat [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), and in the morning ye shall be
filled with [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md); and ye shall know that I am
the LORD your God.  

<span id="013">13</span> And it came to pass, that at even the
[quails](../ebd/ebd303.htm#002.md) came up, and covered the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md): and in the morning the
[dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md) lay round about the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And when the [dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md) that
lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) there lay a small round thing, as
small as the hoar [frost](../ebd/ebd138.htm#009.md) on the ground.  

<span id="015">15</span> And when the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) saw it, they said one to another, It is
[manna](../ebd/ebd240.htm#006.md): for they wist not what it was. And
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said unto them, This is the
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) which the LORD hath given you to eat.  

<span id="016">16</span> This is the thing which the LORD hath
commanded, Gather of it every man according to his
[eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006), an [omer](../ebd/ebd278.htm#005.md) for
every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man
for them which are in his tents.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) did so, and gathered, some more, some
less.  

<span id="018">18</span> And when they did mete it with an
[omer](../ebd/ebd278.htm#005.md), he that gathered much had nothing over,
and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man
according to his [eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said, Let no
man leave of it till the morning.  

<span id="020">20</span> Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md); but some of them left of it until the
morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) was wroth with them.  

<span id="021">21</span> And they gathered it every morning, every man
according to his [eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006.md): and when the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) waxed hot, it melted.  

<span id="022">22</span> And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they
gathered twice as much [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), two omers for one
man: and all the rulers of the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md)
came and told [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And he said unto them, This is that which the
LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) unto the LORD:
[bake](../ebd/ebd042.htm#001.md) that which ye will
[bake](../ebd/ebd042.htm#001.md) to day, and
[seethe](../ebd/ebd326.htm#001.md) that ye will
[seethe](../ebd/ebd326.htm#001.md); and that which remaineth over lay up
for you to be kept until the morning.  

<span id="024">24</span> And they laid it up till the morning, as
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) bade: and it did not stink, neither was
there any [worm](../ebd/ebd384.htm#000.md) therein.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said, Eat
that to day; for to day is a [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) unto the
LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.  

<span id="026">26</span> Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh
day, which is the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md), in it there shall be
none.  

<span id="027">27</span> And it came to pass, that there went out some
of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.  

<span id="028">28</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), How long refuse ye to keep my
commandments and my laws?  

<span id="029">29</span> See, for that the LORD hath given you the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md), therefore he giveth you on the sixth
day the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) of two days; abide ye every man
in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.  

<span id="030">30</span> So the people rested on the seventh day.  

<span id="031">31</span> And the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) called the name thereof
[Manna](../ebd/ebd240.htm#006.md): and it was like
[coriander](../ebd/ebd090.htm#001.md) seed, white; and the taste of it was
like [wafers](../ebd/ebd378.htm#003.md) made with
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said, This
is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an
[omer](../ebd/ebd278.htm#005.md) of it to be kept for your generations;
that they may see the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) wherewith I have
fed you in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), when I brought you
forth from the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said unto
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), Take a pot, and put an
[omer](../ebd/ebd278.htm#005) full of [manna](../ebd/ebd240.htm#006.md)
therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your
generations.  

<span id="034">34</span> As the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), so [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) laid
it up before the [Testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md), to be kept.  

<span id="035">35</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) did eat [manna](../ebd/ebd240.htm#006.md)
forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat
[manna](../ebd/ebd240.htm#006.md), until they came unto the borders of the
land of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md).  

<span id="036">36</span> Now an [omer](../ebd/ebd278.htm#005.md) is the
tenth part of an [ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003.md).
