### King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) called to be an
[apostle](../ebd/ebd026.htm#008) of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) through the will of God, and
[Sosthenes](../ebd/ebd348.htm#009.md) our brother,  

<span id="002">2</span> Unto the church of God which is at
[Corinth](../ebd/ebd090.htm#002.md), to them that are sanctified in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), called
to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) our Lord,
both their's and our's:  

<span id="003">3</span> [Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) be unto you, and
peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> I thank my God always on your behalf, for the
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of God which is given you by
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md);  

<span id="005">5</span> That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in
all utterance, and in all knowledge;  

<span id="006">6</span> Even as the [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md)
of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) was confirmed in you:  

<span id="007">7</span> So that ye come behind in no
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005.md); waiting for the coming of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md):  

<span id="008">8</span> Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye
may be blameless in the day of our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> God is [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md), by
whom ye were called unto the [fellowship](../ebd/ebd132.htm#002.md) of his
Son [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) our
Lord.  

<span id="010">10</span> Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our
Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md),
that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among
you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in
the same judgment.  

<span id="011">11</span> For it hath been declared unto me of you, my
brethren, by them which are of the house of
[Chloe](../ebd/ebd081.htm#005.md), that there are contentions among you.  

<span id="012">12</span> Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I
am of [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md); and I of
[Apollos](../ebd/ebd026.htm#006.md); and I of
[Cephas](../ebd/ebd075.htm#005.md); and I of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> Is [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) divided? was
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) crucified for you? or were ye baptized in
the name of [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md)?  

<span id="014">14</span> I thank God that I baptized none of you, but
[Crispus](../ebd/ebd092.htm#009) and [Gaius](../ebd/ebd141.htm#003.md);  

<span id="015">15</span> Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine
own name.  

<span id="016">16</span> And I baptized also the household of
[Stephanas](../ebd/ebd351.htm#001.md): besides, I know not whether I
baptized any other.  

<span id="017">17</span> For [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) sent me not
to baptize, but to preach the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md): not with
wisdom of words, lest the [cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000.md) of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) should be made of none effect.  

<span id="018">18</span> For the preaching of the
[cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000.md) is to them that perish foolishness; but
unto us which are saved it is the power of God.  

<span id="019">19</span> For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of
the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md), and will bring to nothing the
understanding of the prudent.  

<span id="020">20</span> Where is the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md)?
where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God
made foolish the wisdom of this world?  

<span id="021">21</span> For after that in the wisdom of God the world
by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching
to save them that believe.  

<span id="022">22</span> For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks
seek after wisdom:  

<span id="023">23</span> But we preach [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks
foolishness;  

<span id="024">24</span> But unto them which are called, both Jews and
Greeks, [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) the power of God, and the wisdom
of God.  

<span id="025">25</span> Because the foolishness of God is wiser than
men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.  

<span id="026">26</span> For ye see your
[calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007.md), brethren, how that not many
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) men after the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), not many mighty, not many noble, are
called:  

<span id="027">27</span> But God hath [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md)
the foolish things of the world to confound the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md); and God hath
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) the weak things of the world to confound
the things which are mighty;  

<span id="028">28</span> And base things of the world, and things which
are despised, hath God [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md), yea, and things
which are not, to bring to nought things that are:  

<span id="029">29</span> That no [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) should
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) in his presence.  

<span id="030">30</span> But of him are ye in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), who of
God is made unto us wisdom, and [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md),
and [sanctification](../ebd/ebd321.htm#004.md), and
[redemption](../ebd/ebd308.htm#009.md):  

<span id="031">31</span> That, according as it is written, He that
glorieth, let him [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) in the Lord.
