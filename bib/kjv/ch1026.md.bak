### King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 26

<span id="001">1</span> Concerning the divisions of the porters: Of the
[Korhites](../ebd/ebd222.htm#006.md) was
[Meshelemiah](../ebd/ebd250.htm#009.md) the son of
[Kore](../ebd/ebd222.htm#005.md), of the sons of
[Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the sons of
[Meshelemiah](../ebd/ebd250.htm#009.md) were,
[Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006.md) the firstborn,
[Jediael](../ebd/ebd199.htm#007.md) the second,
[Zebadiah](../ebd/ebd388.htm#005.md) the third, Jathniel the fourth,  

<span id="003">3</span> [Elam](../ebd/ebd114.htm#003.md) the fifth,
[Jehohanan](../ebd/ebd200.htm#008.md) the sixth,
[Elioenai](../ebd/ebd117.htm#003.md) the seventh.  

<span id="004">4</span> Moreover the sons of Obededom were,
[Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005.md) the firstborn,
[Jehozabad](../ebd/ebd202.htm#005.md) the second,
[Joah](../ebd/ebd207.htm#007.md) the third, and Sacar the fourth, and
[Nethaneel](../ebd/ebd271.htm#003.md) the fifth.  

<span id="005">5</span> [Ammiel](../ebd/ebd020.htm#006.md) the sixth,
[Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002.md) the seventh,
[Peulthai](../ebd/ebd291.htm#009.md) the eighth: for God blessed him.  

<span id="006">6</span> Also unto [Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005.md) his
son were sons born, that ruled throughout the house of their father: for
they were mighty men of valour.  

<span id="007">7</span> The sons of [Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005.md);
[Othni](../ebd/ebd281.htm#002), and [Rephael](../ebd/ebd310.htm#009.md),
and [Obed](../ebd/ebd276.htm#004.md), Elzabad, whose brethren were strong
men, [Elihu](../ebd/ebd116.htm#008.md), and Semachiah.  

<span id="008">8</span> All these of the sons of Obededom: they and
their sons and their brethren, able men for strength for the service,
were threescore and two of Obededom.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Meshelemiah](../ebd/ebd250.htm#009.md) had
sons and brethren, strong men, eighteen.  

<span id="010">10</span> Also [Hosah](../ebd/ebd183.htm#005.md), of the
children of [Merari](../ebd/ebd249.htm#000.md), had sons;
[Simri](../ebd/ebd344.htm#005.md) the chief, (for though he was not the
firstborn, yet his father made him the chief;)  

<span id="011">11</span> [Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006.md) the second,
Tebaliah the third, [Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006.md) the fourth: all
the sons and brethren of [Hosah](../ebd/ebd183.htm#005.md) were thirteen.  

<span id="012">12</span> Among these were the divisions of the porters,
even among the chief men, having wards one against another, to
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) in the house of the LORD.  

<span id="013">13</span> And they cast lots, as well the small as the
great, according to the house of their fathers, for every
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And the lot eastward fell to
[Shelemiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#001.md). Then for
[Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006.md) his son, a
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) [counsellor](../ebd/ebd091.htm#005.md), they
cast lots; and his lot came out [northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> To Obededom southward; and to his sons the
house of [Asuppim](../ebd/ebd035.htm#008.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> To Shuppim and [Hosah](../ebd/ebd183.htm#005.md)
the lot came forth [westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008.md), with the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) Shallecheth, by the
[causeway](../ebd/ebd074.htm#005.md) of the going up,
[ward](../ebd/ebd379.htm#001) against [ward](../ebd/ebd379.htm#001.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Eastward were six Levites,
[northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002.md) four a day, southward four a day, and
toward [Asuppim](../ebd/ebd035.htm#008.md) two and two.  

<span id="018">18</span> At [Parbar](../ebd/ebd284.htm#008.md)
[westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008.md), four at the
[causeway](../ebd/ebd074.htm#005.md), and two at
[Parbar](../ebd/ebd284.htm#008.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> These are the divisions of the porters among
the sons of [Kore](../ebd/ebd222.htm#005.md), and among the sons of
[Merari](../ebd/ebd249.htm#000.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And of the Levites,
[Ahijah](../ebd/ebd014.htm#000.md) was over the treasures of the house of
God, and over the treasures of the dedicated things.  

<span id="021">21</span> As concerning the sons of Laadan; the sons of
the Gershonite Laadan, chief fathers, even of Laadan the Gershonite,
were Jehieli.  

<span id="022">22</span> The sons of Jehieli;
[Zetham](../ebd/ebd392.htm#000), and [Joel](../ebd/ebd208.htm#005.md) his
brother, which were over the treasures of the house of the LORD.  

<span id="023">23</span> Of the Amramites, and the Izharites, the
Hebronites, and the Uzzielites:  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Shebuel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#000.md) the son of
[Gershom](../ebd/ebd146.htm#008.md), the son of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), was ruler of the treasures.  

<span id="025">25</span> And his brethren by
[Eliezer](../ebd/ebd116.htm#007); [Rehabiah](../ebd/ebd309.htm#005.md) his
son, and [Jeshaiah](../ebd/ebd204.htm#007.md) his son, and
[Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003.md) his son, and
[Zichri](../ebd/ebd392.htm#007.md) his son, and Shelomith his son.  

<span id="026">26</span> Which Shelomith and his brethren were over all
the treasures of the dedicated things, which
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and
the chief fathers, the captains over [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md)
and hundreds, and the captains of the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md), had
dedicated.  

<span id="027">27</span> Out of the spoils won in battles did they
dedicate to maintain the house of the LORD.  

<span id="028">28</span> And all that [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md)
the [seer](../ebd/ebd326.htm#000), and [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) the
son of [Kish](../ebd/ebd220.htm#007), and [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002.md)
the son of [Ner](../ebd/ebd270.htm#007.md), and
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) the son of
[Zeruiah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#009.md), had dedicated; and whosoever had
dedicated any thing, it was under the hand of Shelomith, and of his
brethren.  

<span id="029">29</span> Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were
for the outward business over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), for
officers and judges.  

<span id="030">30</span> And of the Hebronites,
[Hashabiah](../ebd/ebd166.htm#001.md) and his brethren, men of valour, a
thousand and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) hundred, were officers among
them of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) on this side
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) [westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008.md) in all
the business of the LORD, and in the service of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief,
even among the Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers.
In the fortieth year of the reign of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) they
were sought for, and there were found among them mighty men of valour at
Jazer of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> And his brethren, men of valour, were two
thousand and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) hundred chief fathers, whom
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) made rulers
over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md), for
every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).
