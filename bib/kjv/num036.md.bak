### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 36

<span id="001">1</span> And the chief fathers of the families of the
children of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md), the son of
[Machir](../ebd/ebd235.htm#006.md), the son of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md), of the families of the sons of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), came near, and spake before
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), and before the princes, the chief
fathers of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):  

<span id="002">2</span> And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to
give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and my lord was commanded by the LORD
to give the inheritance of [Zelophehad](../ebd/ebd390.htm#002.md) our
brother unto his daughters.  

<span id="003">3</span> And if they be married to any of the sons of the
other tribes of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), then
shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers,
and shall be put to the inheritance of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) whereunto they are received: so shall it
be taken from the lot of our inheritance.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when the jubile of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) shall be, then shall their inheritance
be put unto the inheritance of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md)
whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away
from the inheritance of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of our
fathers.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) commanded the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) according to the word of the
LORD, saying, The [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of the sons of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) hath said well.  

<span id="006">6</span> This is the thing which the LORD doth command
concerning the daughters of [Zelophehad](../ebd/ebd390.htm#002.md), saying,
Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of their father shall they marry.  

<span id="007">7</span> So shall not the inheritance of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) remove from
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) to [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md): for
every one of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) shall keep
himself to the inheritance of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of his
fathers.  

<span id="008">8</span> And every daughter, that possesseth an
inheritance in any [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), shall be wife unto one of the family of
the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of her father, that the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) may enjoy every man the inheritance of
his fathers.  

<span id="009">9</span> Neither shall the inheritance remove from one
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) to another
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md); but every one of the tribes of the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) shall keep himself to his
own inheritance.  

<span id="010">10</span> Even as the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), so did the daughters of
[Zelophehad](../ebd/ebd390.htm#002.md):  

<span id="011">11</span> For [Mahlah](../ebd/ebd238.htm#000.md), Tirzah,
and [Hoglah](../ebd/ebd180.htm#003.md), and Milcah, and
[Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002.md), the daughters of
[Zelophehad](../ebd/ebd390.htm#002.md), were married unto their father's
brothers' sons:  

<span id="012">12</span> And they were married into the families of the
sons of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md) the son of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), and their inheritance remained in the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of the family of their father.  

<span id="013">13</span> These are the commandments and the judgments,
which the LORD commanded by the hand of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md)
unto the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) in the plains of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005) by [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) near
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md).
