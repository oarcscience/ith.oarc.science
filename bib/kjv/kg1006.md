### King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass in the four hundred and
eightieth year after the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
were come out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), in the
fourth year of Solomon's reign over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), in
the month [Zif](../ebd/ebd393.htm#001), which is the second month, that
he began to build the house of the LORD.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the house which
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) built for
the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth
thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the porch before the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of the house, twenty cubits was the
length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits
was the breadth thereof before the house.  

<span id="004">4</span> And for the house he made windows of narrow
lights.  

<span id="005">5</span> And against the wall of the house he built
chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both
of the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) and of the
[oracle](../ebd/ebd280.htm#000): and he made chambers round about:  

<span id="006">6</span> The nethermost [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003)
was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the
third was [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) cubits broad: for without in
the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams
should not be fastened in the walls of the house.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the house, when it was in building, was
built of [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) made ready before it was brought
thither: so that there was neither [hammer](../ebd/ebd161.htm#000) nor
[axe](../ebd/ebd037.htm#003) nor any tool of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004) heard in the house, while it was in
building.  

<span id="008">8</span> The door for the middle
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003) was in the right side of the house: and
they went up with winding stairs into the middle
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003), and out of the middle into the
third.  

<span id="009">9</span> So he built the house, and finished it; and
covered the house with beams and boards of
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007).  

<span id="010">10</span> And then he built chambers against all the
house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007).  

<span id="011">11</span> And the word of the LORD came to
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007), saying,  

<span id="012">12</span> Concerning this house which thou art in
building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments,
and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my
word with thee, which I spake unto [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) thy
father:  

<span id="013">13</span> And I will dwell among the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and will not forsake my people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="014">14</span> So [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) built the
house, and finished it.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he built the walls of the house within with
boards of [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007), both the floor of the house,
and the walls of the [ceiling](../ebd/ebd074.htm#009): and he covered
them on the inside with [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and covered the
floor of the house with planks of [fir](../ebd/ebd133.htm#005).  

<span id="016">16</span> And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the
house, both the floor and the walls with boards of
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007): he even built them for it within, even
for the [oracle](../ebd/ebd280.htm#000), even for the most holy place.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the house, that is, the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) before it, was forty cubits long.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007) of the
house within was carved with knops and open
[flowers](../ebd/ebd136.htm#002): all was
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007); there was no
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) seen.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the [oracle](../ebd/ebd280.htm#000) he
prepared in the house within, to set there the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of
the LORD.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the [oracle](../ebd/ebd280.htm#000) in the
forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and
twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001); and so covered the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) which was of
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007).  

<span id="021">21</span> So [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) overlaid
the house within with pure [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001): and he made a
partition by the chains of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) before the
[oracle](../ebd/ebd280.htm#000); and he overlaid it with
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="022">22</span> And the whole house he overlaid with
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), until he had finished all the house: also
the whole [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) that was by the
[oracle](../ebd/ebd280.htm#000) he overlaid with
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="023">23</span> And within the [oracle](../ebd/ebd280.htm#000)
he made two cherubims of [olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009) tree, each ten
cubits high.  

<span id="024">24</span> And five cubits was the one wing of the
[cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003), and five cubits the other wing of the
[cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003): from the uttermost part of the one wing
unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.  

<span id="025">25</span> And the other [cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003)
was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size.  

<span id="026">26</span> The height of the one
[cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003) was ten cubits, and so was it of the
other [cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003).  

<span id="027">27</span> And he set the cherubims within the inner
house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the
wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other
[cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003) touched the other wall; and their wings
touched one another in the midst of the house.  

<span id="028">28</span> And he overlaid the cherubims with
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="029">29</span> And he carved all the walls of the house round
about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open
[flowers](../ebd/ebd136.htm#002), within and without.  

<span id="030">30</span> And the floors of the house he overlaid with
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), within and without.  

<span id="031">31</span> And for the entering of the
[oracle](../ebd/ebd280.htm#000) he made [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009)
of [olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009) tree: the
[lintel](../ebd/ebd230.htm#000) and side posts were a fifth part of the
wall.  

<span id="032">32</span> The two [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009) also
were of [olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009) tree; and he carved upon them
carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open
[flowers](../ebd/ebd136.htm#002), and overlaid them with
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and spread [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001)
upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.  

<span id="033">33</span> So also made he for the door of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) posts of [olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009)
tree, a fourth part of the wall.  

<span id="034">34</span> And the two [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009) were
of [fir](../ebd/ebd133.htm#005) tree: the two leaves of the one door
were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.  

<span id="035">35</span> And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees
and open [flowers](../ebd/ebd136.htm#002): and covered them with
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) fitted upon the carved work.  

<span id="036">36</span> And he built the inner court with three rows of
hewed [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), and a row of
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007) beams.  

<span id="037">37</span> In the fourth year was the foundation of the
house of the LORD laid, in the month [Zif](../ebd/ebd393.htm#001):  

<span id="038">38</span> And in the eleventh year, in the month
[Bul](../ebd/ebd066.htm#002), which is the eighth month, was the house
finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the
fashion of it. So was he [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) years in
building it.
