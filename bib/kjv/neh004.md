### King James Version: Nehemiah Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> But it came to pass, that when
[Sanballat](../ebd/ebd321.htm#003) heard that we builded the wall, he
was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he spake before his brethren and the army of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004), and said, What do these feeble Jews?
will they fortify themselves? will they
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002)? will they make an end in a day? will
they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are
burned?  

<span id="003">3</span> Now [Tobiah](../ebd/ebd369.htm#001) the
[Ammonite](../ebd/ebd021.htm#003) was by him, and he said, Even that
which they build, if a [fox](../ebd/ebd138.htm#003) go up, he shall even
break down their [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) wall.  

<span id="004">4</span> Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn
their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land
of [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002):  

<span id="005">5</span> And cover not their iniquity, and let not their
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) be blotted out from before thee: for they
have provoked thee to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) before the
builders.  

<span id="006">6</span> So built we the wall; and all the wall was
joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to
work.  

<span id="007">7</span> But it came to pass, that when
[Sanballat](../ebd/ebd321.htm#003), and [Tobiah](../ebd/ebd369.htm#001),
and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the
walls of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) were made up, and that the
breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,  

<span id="008">8</span> And conspired all of them together to come and
to fight against [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and to hinder it.  

<span id="009">9</span> Nevertheless we made our
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) unto our God, and set a watch against
them day and night, because of them.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) said, The
strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much
rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.  

<span id="011">11</span> And our adversaries said, They shall not know,
neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and
cause the work to cease.  

<span id="012">12</span> And it came to pass, that when the Jews which
dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence
ye shall return unto us they will be upon you.  

<span id="013">13</span> Therefore set I in the lower places behind the
wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their
families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.  

<span id="014">14</span> And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the
nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye
afraid of them: remember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and
fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and
your houses.  

<span id="015">15</span> And it came to pass, when our enemies heard
that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought,
that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.  

<span id="016">16</span> And it came to pass from that time forth, that
the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them
held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and
the rulers were behind all the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="017">17</span> They which builded on the wall, and they that
bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands
wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.  

<span id="018">18</span> For the builders, every one had his
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) girded by his side, and so builded. And
he that sounded the trumpet was by me.  

<span id="019">19</span> And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers,
and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are
separated upon the wall, one far from another.  

<span id="020">20</span> In what place therefore ye hear the sound of
the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.  

<span id="021">21</span> So we laboured in the work: and half of them
held the spears from the rising of the morning till the
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008) appeared.  

<span id="022">22</span> Likewise at the same time said I unto the
people, Let every one with his servant [lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002)
within [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), that in the night they may be
a [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009) to us, and labour on the day.  

<span id="023">23</span> So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants,
nor the men of the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009) which followed me,
none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for
[washing](../ebd/ebd379.htm#002).
