### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a
great [roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004.md), and write in it with a man's pen
concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.  

<span id="002">2</span> And I took unto me
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md) witnesses to record,
[Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), and
[Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006.md) the son of Jeberechiah.  

<span id="003">3</span> And I went unto the prophetess; and she
conceived, and bare a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name
Mahershalalhashbaz.  

<span id="004">4</span> For before the child shall have knowledge to
cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md) and the spoil of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md) shall be taken away before the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> The LORD spake also unto me again, saying,  

<span id="006">6</span> Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of
Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in [Rezin](../ebd/ebd312.htm#006.md)
and Remaliah's son;  

<span id="007">7</span> Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon
them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md), and
all his [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md): and he shall come up over all
his channels, and go over all his banks:  

<span id="008">8</span> And he shall pass through
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md); he shall overflow and go over, he shall
reach even to the [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md); and the stretching out
of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O
[Immanuel](../ebd/ebd187.htm#007.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall
be broken in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md); and give
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md), all ye of far countries: gird yourselves,
and ye shall be broken in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md); gird
yourselves, and ye shall be broken in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> Take counsel together, and it shall come to
nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.  

<span id="011">11</span> For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong
hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this
people, saying,  

<span id="012">12</span> Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom
this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be
afraid.  

<span id="013">13</span> Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him
be your fear, and let him be your dread.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he shall be for a
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md); but for a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) of stumbling and for a
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md) of offence to both the houses of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), for a [gin](../ebd/ebd149.htm#004.md) and
for a [snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009.md) to the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And many among them shall stumble, and fall,
and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.  

<span id="016">16</span> Bind up the [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md),
[seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002.md) the law among my disciples.  

<span id="017">17</span> And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his
face from the house of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and I will look
for him.  

<span id="018">18</span> Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath
given me are for signs and for wonders in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth
in [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto
them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that
mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the
dead?  

<span id="020">20</span> To the law and to the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md): if they speak not according to this
word, it is because there is no light in them.  

<span id="021">21</span> And they shall pass through it, hardly
[bestead](../ebd/ebd054.htm#001.md) and hungry: and it shall come to pass,
that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) their [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) and
their God, and look upward.  

<span id="022">22</span> And they shall look unto the earth; and behold
trouble and [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), dimness of anguish; and
they shall be driven to [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md).
