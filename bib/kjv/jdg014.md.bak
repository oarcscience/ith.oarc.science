### King James Version: Judges Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> And [Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000.md) went down to
[Timnath](../ebd/ebd366.htm#006.md), and saw a woman in
[Timnath](../ebd/ebd366.htm#006.md) of the daughters of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he came up, and told his father and his
mother, and said, I have seen a woman in
[Timnath](../ebd/ebd366.htm#006.md) of the daughters of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md): now therefore get her for me to
wife.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is
there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my
people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)? And
[Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000.md) said unto his father, Get her for me;
for she pleaseth me well.  

<span id="004">4</span> But his father and his mother knew not that it
was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md): for at that time the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) had dominion over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Then went [Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000.md) down,
and his father and his mother, to [Timnath](../ebd/ebd366.htm#006.md), and
came to the vineyards of [Timnath](../ebd/ebd366.htm#006.md): and, behold,
a young lion roared against him.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the
LORD came mightily upon him, and he [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) him as
he would have [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) a kid, and he had nothing in
his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he went down, and talked with the woman; and
she pleased [Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000.md) well.  

<span id="008">8</span> And after a time he returned to take her, and he
turned aside to see the [carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md) of the lion:
and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001) in the [carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md)
of the lion.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he took thereof in his hands, and went on
[eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006.md), and came to his father and mother, and
he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken
the [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md) out of the
[carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md) of the lion.  

<span id="010">10</span> So his father went down unto the woman: and
[Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000.md) made there a
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md); for so used the young men to do.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it came to pass, when they saw him, that
they brought thirty companions to be with him.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000.md) said unto
them, I will now put forth a [riddle](../ebd/ebd313.htm#003.md) unto you:
if ye can certainly declare it me within the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days of the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md), and find it out, then I will give you
thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:  

<span id="013">13</span> But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye
give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto
him, Put forth thy [riddle](../ebd/ebd313.htm#003.md), that we may hear
it.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he said unto them, Out of the eater came
forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could
not in three days expound the [riddle](../ebd/ebd313.htm#003.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that
they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare
unto us the [riddle](../ebd/ebd313.htm#003.md), lest we burn thee and thy
father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it
not so?  

<span id="016">16</span> And Samson's wife wept before him, and said,
Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a
[riddle](../ebd/ebd313.htm#003.md) unto the children of my people, and hast
not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my
father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?  

<span id="017">17</span> And she wept before him the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days, while their
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) lasted: and it came to pass on the
seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she
told the [riddle](../ebd/ebd313.htm#003.md) to the children of her
people.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the men of the city said unto him on the
seventh day before the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) went down, What is
sweeter than [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md)? And what is stronger than a
lion? and he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my
[heifer](../ebd/ebd171.htm#006.md), ye had not found out my
[riddle](../ebd/ebd313.htm#003.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the
LORD came upon him, and he went down to
[Ashkelon](../ebd/ebd034.htm#001.md), and slew thirty men of them, and took
their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the
[riddle](../ebd/ebd313.htm#003). And his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md)
was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.  

<span id="020">20</span> But Samson's wife was given to his companion,
whom he had used as his friend.
