### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 147

<span id="001">1</span> Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing
praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.  

<span id="002">2</span> The LORD doth build up
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): he gathereth together the outcasts
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up
their wounds.  

<span id="004">4</span> He telleth the number of the
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md); he calleth them all by their names.  

<span id="005">5</span> Great is our Lord, and of great power: his
understanding is infinite.  

<span id="006">6</span> The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the
wicked down to the ground.  

<span id="007">7</span> Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing
praise upon the [harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001.md) unto our God:  

<span id="008">8</span> Who covereth the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)
with clouds, who prepareth [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) for the earth,
who maketh [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md) to grow upon the mountains.  

<span id="009">9</span> He giveth to the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md)
his food, and to the young ravens which cry.  

<span id="010">10</span> He delighteth not in the strength of the horse:
he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.  

<span id="011">11</span> The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him,
in those that hope in his [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> Praise the LORD, O
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md); praise thy God, O
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates;
he hath blessed thy children within thee.  

<span id="014">14</span> He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth
thee with the finest of the [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth:
his word runneth very swiftly.  

<span id="016">16</span> He giveth [snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000.md) like
[wool](../ebd/ebd383.htm#005.md): he scattereth the hoarfrost like
[ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> He casteth forth his
[ice](../ebd/ebd186.htm#001.md) like morsels: who can stand before his
cold?  

<span id="018">18</span> He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he
causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.  

<span id="019">19</span> He sheweth his word unto
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), his statutes and his judgments unto
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as
for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.
