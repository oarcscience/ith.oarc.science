### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Send thou men, that they may search the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md), which I give unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): of every [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md)
of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) by the
commandment of the LORD sent them from the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Paran](../ebd/ebd284.htm#006.md):
all those men were heads of the children of

<span id="004">4</span> And these were their names: of the

<span id="010">10</span> Of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
[Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003), [Gaddiel](../ebd/ebd141.htm#001.md) the
son of Sodi.  

<span id="011">11</span> Of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), namely, of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md),
[Gaddi](../ebd/ebd141.htm#000.md) the son of
[Susi](../ebd/ebd353.htm#008.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> Of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of

<span id="014">14</span> Of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
[Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006.md), Nahbi the son of Vophsi.  

<span id="015">15</span> Of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007.md), Geuel the son of Machi.  

<span id="016">16</span> These are the names of the men which
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) sent to spy out the land. And
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) called Oshea the son of
[Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006.md) Jehoshua.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) sent them to
spy out the land of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md), and said unto them,
Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:  

<span id="018">18</span> And see the land, what it is, and the people
that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;  

<span id="019">19</span> And what the land is that they dwell in,
whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in,
whether in tents, or in strong holds;  

<span id="020">20</span> And what the land is, whether it be
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) or lean, whether there be
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) therein, or not. And be ye of good
courage, and bring of the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of the land.
Now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes.  

<span id="021">21</span> So they went up, and searched the land from the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Zin](../ebd/ebd394.htm#000.md) unto
[Rehob](../ebd/ebd309.htm#006.md), as men come to
[Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And they ascended by the south, and came unto
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004); where [Ahiman](../ebd/ebd014.htm#003.md),
[Sheshai](../ebd/ebd336.htm#002), and [Talmai](../ebd/ebd358.htm#001.md),
the children of [Anak](../ebd/ebd022.htm#005.md), were. (Now
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004) was built [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
years before [Zoan](../ebd/ebd395.htm#003.md) in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009)..md)  

<span id="023">23</span> And they came unto the
[brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006) of [Eshcol](../ebd/ebd125.htm#000.md), and
cut down from thence a [branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002.md) with one cluster
of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they brought
of the pomegranates, and of the figs.  

<span id="024">24</span> The place was called the
[brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006) [Eshcol](../ebd/ebd125.htm#000.md), because
of the cluster of grapes which the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) cut down from thence.  

<span id="025">25</span> And they returned from searching of the land
after forty days.  

<span id="026">26</span> And they went and came to
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), and to [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md),
and to all the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), unto the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Paran](../ebd/ebd284.htm#006.md),
to [Kadesh](../ebd/ebd215.htm#003.md); and brought back word unto them, and
unto all the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), and shewed them the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of the land.  

<span id="027">27</span> And they told him, and said, We came unto the
land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000) and [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md); and
this is the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of it.  

<span id="028">28</span> Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in
the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw
the children of [Anak](../ebd/ebd022.htm#005.md) there.  

<span id="029">29</span> The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south:
and the [Hittites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#006.md), and the
[Jebusites](../ebd/ebd199.htm#004.md), and the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md), dwell in the mountains: and the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007.md) dwell by the sea, and by the coast
of [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Caleb](../ebd/ebd069.htm#003.md) stilled the
people before [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), and said, Let us go up at
once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.  

<span id="031">31</span> But the men that went up with him said, We be
not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.  

<span id="032">32</span> And they brought up an evil report of the land
which they had searched unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), saying, The land, through which we have
gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and
all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature.  

<span id="033">33</span> And there we saw the
[giants](../ebd/ebd147.htm#006.md), the sons of
[Anak](../ebd/ebd022.htm#005.md), which come of the
[giants](../ebd/ebd147.htm#006.md): and we were in our own sight as
grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.
