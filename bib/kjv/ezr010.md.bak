### King James Version: Ezra Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> Now when [Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006.md) had
prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down
before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) a very great
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of men and women and children: for
the people wept very sore.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Shechaniah](../ebd/ebd333.htm#002.md) the son
of [Jehiel](../ebd/ebd200.htm#003.md), one of the sons of
[Elam](../ebd/ebd114.htm#003.md), answered and said unto
[Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006.md), We have trespassed against our God, and
have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is
hope in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) concerning this thing.  

<span id="003">3</span> Now therefore let us make a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with our God to put away all the
wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my
lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let
it be done according to the law.  

<span id="004">4</span> Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we
also will be with thee: be of good courage, and do it.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then arose [Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006.md), and
made the chief priests, the Levites, and all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), to swear that they should do according
to this word. And they sware.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then [Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006.md) rose up from
before the house of God, and went into the
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003) of [Johanan](../ebd/ebd208.htm#009.md) the
son of [Eliashib](../ebd/ebd116.htm#003.md): and when he came thither, he
did eat no [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), nor
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) water: for he mourned because of the
transgression of them that had been carried away.  

<span id="007">7</span> And they made proclamation throughout
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md)
unto all the children of the [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md), that
they should gather themselves together unto
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md);  

<span id="008">8</span> And that whosoever would not come within three
days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his
substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of those that had been carried
away.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then all the men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md)
gathered themselves together unto [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md)
within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the
month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God,
trembling because of this matter, and for the great
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006.md) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) stood up, and said unto them, Ye have
transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Now therefore make
[confession](../ebd/ebd088.htm#003.md) unto the LORD God of your fathers,
and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the
land, and from the strange wives.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) answered and said with a loud
voice, As thou hast said, so must we do.  

<span id="013">13</span> But the people are many, and it is a time of
much [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md), and we are not able to stand
without, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that
have transgressed in this thing.  

<span id="014">14</span> Let now our rulers of all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) stand, and let all them which have
taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them
the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath
of our God for this matter be turned from us.  

<span id="015">15</span> Only [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) the son
of [Asahel](../ebd/ebd033.htm#001.md) and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were
employed about this matter: and [Meshullam](../ebd/ebd251.htm#001.md) and
[Shabbethai](../ebd/ebd330.htm#000) the [Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009.md)
helped them.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the children of the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md) did so. And
[Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), with
certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all
of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of
the tenth month to examine the matter.  

<span id="017">17</span> And they made an end with all the men that had
taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.  

<span id="018">18</span> And among the sons of the priests there were
found that had taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of
[Jeshua](../ebd/ebd205.htm#003.md) the son of Jozadak, and his brethren;
[Maaseiah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#007), and [Eliezer](../ebd/ebd116.htm#007.md),
and [Jarib](../ebd/ebd197.htm#006.md), and
[Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And they gave their hands that they would put
away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003.md) of the flock for their trespass.  

<span id="020">20</span> And of the sons of
[Immer](../ebd/ebd187.htm#008); [Hanani](../ebd/ebd162.htm#003.md), and
[Zebadiah](../ebd/ebd388.htm#005.md).
