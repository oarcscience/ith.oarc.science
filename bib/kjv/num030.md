### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 30

<span id="001">1</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) spake unto
the heads of the tribes concerning the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), saying, This is the thing which the
LORD hath commanded.  

<span id="002">2</span> If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md) to bind his soul with a
[bond](../ebd/ebd062.htm#001.md); he shall not break his word, he shall do
according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.  

<span id="003">3</span> If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and
bind herself by a [bond](../ebd/ebd062.htm#001.md), being in her father's
house in her youth;  

<span id="004">4</span> And her father hear her vow, and her
[bond](../ebd/ebd062.htm#001.md) wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her
father shall hold his peace at her; then all her
[vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001.md) shall stand, and every
[bond](../ebd/ebd062.htm#001.md) wherewith she hath bound her soul shall
stand.  

<span id="005">5</span> But if her father disallow her in the day that
he heareth; not any of her [vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001.md), or of her
bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall
forgive her, because her father disallowed her.  

<span id="006">6</span> And if she had at all an husband, when she
vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;  

<span id="007">7</span> And her husband heard it, and held his peace at
her in the day that he heard it: then her [vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001.md)
shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.  

<span id="008">8</span> But if her husband disallowed her on the day
that he heard it; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that
which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none
effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.  

<span id="009">9</span> But every vow of a widow, and of her that is
divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against
her.  

<span id="010">10</span> And if she vowed in her husband's house, or
bound her soul by a [bond](../ebd/ebd062.htm#001.md) with an
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md);  

<span id="011">11</span> And her husband heard it, and held his peace at
her, and disallowed her not: then all her [vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001.md)
shall stand, and every [bond](../ebd/ebd062.htm#001.md) wherewith she bound
her soul shall stand.  

<span id="012">12</span> But if her husband hath utterly made them void
on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips
concerning her [vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001.md), or concerning the
[bond](../ebd/ebd062.htm#001.md) of her soul, shall not stand: her husband
hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.  

<span id="013">13</span> Every vow, and every binding
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md) to afflict the soul, her husband may
establish it, or her husband may make it void.  

<span id="014">14</span> But if her husband altogether hold his peace at
her from day to day; then he establisheth all her
[vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001.md), or all her bonds, which are upon her: he
confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he
heard them.  

<span id="015">15</span> But if he shall any ways make them void after
that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.  

<span id="016">16</span> These are the statutes, which the LORD
commanded [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), between a man and his wife,
between the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth in her
father's house.
