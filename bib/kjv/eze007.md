### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD
unto the land of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); An end, the end is
come upon the four corners of the land.  

<span id="003">3</span> Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send
mine [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) upon thee, and will
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) thee according to thy ways, and will
recompense upon thee all thine abominations.  

<span id="004">4</span> And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will
I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine
abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am
the LORD.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil,
behold, is come.  

<span id="006">6</span> An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for
thee; behold, it is come.  

<span id="007">7</span> The morning is come unto thee, O thou that
dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and
not the sounding again of the mountains.  

<span id="008">8</span> Now will I shortly pour out my
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) upon thee, and accomplish mine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) upon thee: and I will
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) thee according to thy ways, and will
recompense thee for all thine abominations.  

<span id="009">9</span> And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I
have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine
abominations that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am
the LORD that smiteth.  

<span id="010">10</span> Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning
is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.  

<span id="011">11</span> Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness:
none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of
their's: neither shall there be wailing for them.  

<span id="012">12</span> The time is come, the day draweth near: let not
the buyer rejoice, nor the seller [mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004): for
wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.  

<span id="013">13</span> For the seller shall not return to that which
is sold, although they were yet alive: for the
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000) is touching the whole multitude thereof,
which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the
iniquity of his life.  

<span id="014">14</span> They have blown the trumpet, even to make all
ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the
multitude thereof.  

<span id="015">15</span> The [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) is without,
and the pestilence and the [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) within: he
that is in the field shall die with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003);
and he that is in the city, [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) and
pestilence shall devour him.  

<span id="016">16</span> But they that escape of them shall escape, and
shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them
mourning, every one for his iniquity.  

<span id="017">17</span> All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall
be weak as water.  

<span id="018">18</span> They shall also gird themselves with
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001), and horror shall cover them; and
shame shall be upon all faces, and [baldness](../ebd/ebd042.htm#008)
upon all their heads.  

<span id="019">19</span> They shall cast their
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) in the streets, and their
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) shall be removed: their
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and their [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001)
shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD:
they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their
[bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004): because it is the stumblingblock of
their iniquity.  

<span id="020">20</span> As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in
majesty: but they made the images of their abominations and of their
detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.  

<span id="021">21</span> And I will give it into the hands of the
strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and
they shall pollute it.  

<span id="022">22</span> My face will I turn also from them, and they
shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and
defile it.  

<span id="023">23</span> Make a [chain](../ebd/ebd075.htm#008): for the
land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.  

<span id="024">24</span> Wherefore I will bring the worst of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), and they shall possess their houses: I
will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places
shall be defiled.  

<span id="025">25</span> [Destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) cometh;
and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.  

<span id="026">26</span> Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour
shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000) of the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008);
but the law shall perish from the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and
counsel from the ancients.  

<span id="027">27</span> The [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) shall
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004), and the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004)
shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the
land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and
according to their deserts will I [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) them;
and they shall know that I am the LORD.
