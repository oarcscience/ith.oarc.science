### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> O ye children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md), gather yourselves to flee out of the
midst of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and blow the trumpet in
Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out
of the north, and great [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> I have likened the daughter of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md) to a comely and delicate woman.  

<span id="003">3</span> The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto
her; they shall [pitch](../ebd/ebd296.htm#008.md) their tents against her
round about; they shall feed every one in his place.  

<span id="004">4</span> Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go
up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the
evening are stretched out.  

<span id="005">5</span> Arise, and let us go by night, and let us
destroy her palaces.  

<span id="006">6</span> For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye
down trees, and cast a [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) against
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): this is the city to be visited; she
is wholly oppression in the midst of her.  

<span id="007">7</span> As a [fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md) casteth
out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is
heard in her; before me continually is grief and wounds.  

<span id="008">8</span> Be thou instructed, O
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), lest my soul depart from thee; lest
I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.  

<span id="009">9</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall
throughly [glean](../ebd/ebd150.htm#003.md) the remnant of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) as a [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md): turn
back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets.  

<span id="010">10</span> To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that
they may hear? behold, their [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) is
uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the LORD is
unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.  

<span id="011">11</span> Therefore I am full of the
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md) of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: I
will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of
young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken,
the aged with him that is full of days.  

<span id="012">12</span> And their houses shall be turned unto others,
with their fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand
upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD.  

<span id="013">13</span> For from the least of them even unto the
greatest of them every one is given to
[covetousness](../ebd/ebd092.htm#000.md); and from the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) even unto the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) every one dealeth falsely.  

<span id="014">14</span> They have healed also the hurt of the daughter
of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.  

<span id="015">15</span> Were they ashamed when they had committed
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md)? nay, they were not at all ashamed,
neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that
fall: at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the
LORD.  

<span id="016">16</span> Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and
see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein,
and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk
therein.  

<span id="017">17</span> Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken
to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.  

<span id="018">18</span> Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), what is among them.  

<span id="019">19</span> Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon
this people, even the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of their thoughts,
because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but
rejected it.  

<span id="020">20</span> To what purpose cometh there to me
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) from [Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006.md),
and the sweet [cane](../ebd/ebd071.htm#002.md) from a far country? your
burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.  

<span id="021">21</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will
lay stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons
together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall
perish.  

<span id="022">22</span> Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh
from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the
sides of the earth.  

<span id="023">23</span> They shall lay hold on
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) and spear; they are cruel, and have no
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md); their voice roareth like the sea; and
they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O
daughter of [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> We have heard the fame thereof: our hands
[wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000.md) feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, and
pain, as of a woman in travail.  

<span id="025">25</span> Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the
way; for the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) of the enemy and fear is on
every side.  

<span id="026">26</span> O daughter of my people, gird thee with
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001.md), and wallow thyself in
[ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000.md): make thee mourning, as for an only son,
most [bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009.md)
[lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005.md): for the spoiler shall suddenly
come upon us.  

<span id="027">27</span> I have set thee for a tower and a fortress
among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way.  

<span id="028">28</span> They are all grievous revolters, walking with
slanders: they are [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md) and
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md); they are all corrupters.  

<span id="029">29</span> The [bellows](../ebd/ebd051.htm#009.md) are
burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain:
for the wicked are not plucked away.  

<span id="030">30</span> [Reprobate](../ebd/ebd311.htm#003.md)
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) shall men call them, because the LORD
hath rejected them.
