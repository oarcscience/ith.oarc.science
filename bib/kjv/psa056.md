### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 56

<span id="001">1</span> Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would
[swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009) me up; he fighting daily oppresseth
me.  

<span id="002">2</span> Mine enemies would daily
[swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009) me up: for they be many that fight
against me, O thou most High.  

<span id="003">3</span> What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> In God I will praise his word, in God I have put
my trust; I will not fear what [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) can do
unto me.  

<span id="005">5</span> Every day they wrest my words: all their
thoughts are against me for evil.  

<span id="006">6</span> They gather themselves together, they hide
themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.  

<span id="007">7</span> Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) cast down the people, O God.  

<span id="008">8</span> Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears
into thy [bottle](../ebd/ebd063.htm#002): are they not in thy book?  

<span id="009">9</span> When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies
turn back: this I know; for God is for me.  

<span id="010">10</span> In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will
I praise his word.  

<span id="011">11</span> In God have I put my trust: I will not be
afraid what man can do unto me.  

<span id="012">12</span> Thy [vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001) are upon me,
O God: I will render praises unto thee.  

<span id="013">13</span> For thou hast delivered my soul from death:
wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God
in the light of the living?
