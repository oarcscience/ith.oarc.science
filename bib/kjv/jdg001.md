### King James Version: Judges Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> Now after the death of
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) it came to pass, that the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up
for us against the [Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007) first, to fight
against them?  

<span id="002">2</span> And the LORD said,
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) shall go up: behold, I have delivered the
land into his hand.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) said unto
[Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002) his brother, Come up with me into my
lot, that we may fight against the [Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007);
and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So
[Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002) went with him.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) went up; and
the LORD delivered the [Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007) and the
[Perizzites](../ebd/ebd290.htm#006) into their hand: and they slew of
them in [Bezek](../ebd/ebd058.htm#000) ten thousand men.  

<span id="005">5</span> And they found
[Adonibezek](../ebd/ebd009.htm#005) in [Bezek](../ebd/ebd058.htm#000):
and they fought against him, and they slew the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007) and the
[Perizzites](../ebd/ebd290.htm#006).  

<span id="006">6</span> But [Adonibezek](../ebd/ebd009.htm#005) fled;
and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and
his great toes.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Adonibezek](../ebd/ebd009.htm#005) said,
Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut
off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God hath
requited me. And they brought him to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),
and there he died.  

<span id="008">8</span> Now the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) had fought against
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and had taken it, and smitten it
with the edge of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and set the city on
fire.  

<span id="009">9</span> And afterward the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) went down to fight against the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007), that dwelt in the mountain, and in
the south, and in the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008).  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) went against
the [Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007) that dwelt in
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004): (now the name of
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004) before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew
[Sheshai](../ebd/ebd336.htm#002), and [Ahiman](../ebd/ebd014.htm#003),
and [Talmai](../ebd/ebd358.htm#001).  

<span id="011">11</span> And from thence he went against the inhabitants
of [Debir](../ebd/ebd099.htm#007): and the name of
[Debir](../ebd/ebd099.htm#007) before was Kirjathsepher:  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Caleb](../ebd/ebd069.htm#003) said, He
that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give
[Achsah](../ebd/ebd007.htm#001) my daughter to wife.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Othniel](../ebd/ebd281.htm#003) the son of
[Kenaz](../ebd/ebd217.htm#003), Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he
gave him [Achsah](../ebd/ebd007.htm#001) his daughter to wife.  

<span id="014">14</span> And it came to pass, when she came to him, that
she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001); and [Caleb](../ebd/ebd069.htm#003) said
unto her, What wilt thou?  

<span id="015">15</span> And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for
thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And
[Caleb](../ebd/ebd069.htm#003) gave her the upper springs and the nether
springs.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father
in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007),
which lieth in the south of [Arad](../ebd/ebd028.htm#000); and they went
and dwelt among the people.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) went with
[Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002) his brother, and they slew the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007) that inhabited
[Zephath](../ebd/ebd390.htm#009), and utterly destroyed it. And the name
of the city was called [Hormah](../ebd/ebd182.htm#002).  

<span id="018">18</span> Also [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) took
[Gaza](../ebd/ebd144.htm#003) with the coast thereof, and Askelon with
the coast thereof, and [Ekron](../ebd/ebd114.htm#001) with the coast
thereof.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the LORD was with
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007); and he drave out the inhabitants of the
mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008), because they had chariots of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004).  

<span id="020">20</span> And they gave [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004)
unto [Caleb](../ebd/ebd069.htm#003), as [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003)
said: and he expelled thence the three sons of
[Anak](../ebd/ebd022.htm#005).  

<span id="021">21</span> And the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) did not drive out the
[Jebusites](../ebd/ebd199.htm#004) that inhabited
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005); but the
[Jebusites](../ebd/ebd199.htm#004) dwell with the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005)
unto this day.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the house of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), they also went up against
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006): and the LORD was with them.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the house of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) sent to descry
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006). (Now the name of the city before was
[Luz](../ebd/ebd233.htm#006).)  

<span id="024">24</span> And the [spies](../ebd/ebd349.htm#007) saw a
man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray
thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005).  

<span id="025">25</span> And when he shewed them the entrance into the
city, they smote the city with the edge of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003); but they let go the man and all his
family.  

<span id="026">26</span> And the man went into the land of the
[Hittites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#006), and built a city, and called the name
thereof [Luz](../ebd/ebd233.htm#006): which is the name thereof unto
this day.  

<span id="027">27</span> Neither did [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002)
drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor
[Taanach](../ebd/ebd355.htm#005) and her towns, nor the inhabitants of
[Dor](../ebd/ebd106.htm#003) and her towns, nor the inhabitants of
[Ibleam](../ebd/ebd185.htm#009) and her towns, nor the inhabitants of
[Megiddo](../ebd/ebd246.htm#004) and her towns: but the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007) would dwell in that land.  

<span id="028">28</span> And it came to pass, when
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) was strong, that they put the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007) to [tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006),
and did not utterly drive them out.  

<span id="029">29</span> Neither did [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000)
drive out the [Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007) that dwelt in
[Gezer](../ebd/ebd147.htm#004); but the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007) dwelt in
[Gezer](../ebd/ebd147.htm#004) among them.  

<span id="030">30</span> Neither did [Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003)
drive out the inhabitants of [Kitron](../ebd/ebd221.htm#003), nor the
inhabitants of Nahalol; but the [Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007)
dwelt among them, and became tributaries.  

<span id="031">31</span> Neither did [Asher](../ebd/ebd033.htm#008)
drive out the inhabitants of [Accho](../ebd/ebd006.htm#001), nor the
inhabitants of [Zidon](../ebd/ebd393.htm#000), nor of
[Ahlab](../ebd/ebd015.htm#002), nor of [Achzib](../ebd/ebd007.htm#003),
nor of [Helbah](../ebd/ebd172.htm#000), nor of
[Aphik](../ebd/ebd026.htm#002), nor of [Rehob](../ebd/ebd309.htm#006):  

<span id="032">32</span> But the Asherites dwelt among the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007), the inhabitants of the land: for
they did not drive them out.  

<span id="033">33</span> Neither did [Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006)
drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of
Bethanath; but he dwelt among the [Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007),
the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh
and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.  

<span id="034">34</span> And the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006)
forced the children of [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009) into the mountain:
for they would not suffer them to come down to the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008):  

<span id="035">35</span> But the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006) would
dwell in [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Heres](../ebd/ebd175.htm#001)
in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) prevailed, so that they became
tributaries.  

<span id="036">36</span> And the coast of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006) was from the going up to
[Akrabbim](../ebd/ebd016.htm#004), from the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001), and upward.
