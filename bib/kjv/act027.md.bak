### King James Version: Acts Chapter 27

<span id="001">1</span> And when it was determined that we should sail
into [Italy](../ebd/ebd191.htm#004.md), they delivered
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) and certain other prisoners unto one named
[Julius](../ebd/ebd214.htm#003), a [centurion](../ebd/ebd075.htm#004.md) of
Augustus' band.  

<span id="002">2</span> And entering into a ship of
[Adramyttium](../ebd/ebd010.htm#004.md), we launched, meaning to sail by
the coasts of [Asia](../ebd/ebd034.htm#008.md); one
[Aristarchus](../ebd/ebd030.htm#008.md), a Macedonian of
[Thessalonica](../ebd/ebd364.htm#000.md), being with us.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the next day we touched at
[Sidon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#000). And [Julius](../ebd/ebd214.htm#003.md)
courteously entreated [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md), and gave him
liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when we had launched from thence, we sailed
under [Cyprus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#003.md), because the
[winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009.md) were contrary.  

<span id="005">5</span> And when we had sailed over the sea of
[Cilicia](../ebd/ebd083.htm#003) and [Pamphylia](../ebd/ebd283.htm#008.md),
we came to [Myra](../ebd/ebd263.htm#002.md), a city of
[Lycia](../ebd/ebd233.htm#008.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And there the [centurion](../ebd/ebd075.htm#004.md)
found a ship of [Alexandria](../ebd/ebd017.htm#001.md) sailing into
[Italy](../ebd/ebd191.htm#004.md); and he put us therein.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when we had sailed slowly many days, and
scarce were come over against [Cnidus](../ebd/ebd085.htm#002.md), the wind
not suffering us, we sailed under [Crete](../ebd/ebd092.htm#006.md), over
against [Salmone](../ebd/ebd319.htm#006.md);  

<span id="008">8</span> And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which
is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.  

<span id="009">9</span> Now when much time was spent, and when sailing
was now dangerous, because the [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) was now
already past, [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) admonished them,  

<span id="010">10</span> And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this
voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and
ship, but also of our lives.  

<span id="011">11</span> Nevertheless the
[centurion](../ebd/ebd075.htm#004.md) believed the master and the owner of
the ship, more than those things which were spoken by
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And because the [haven](../ebd/ebd167.htm#008.md)
was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence
also, if by any means they might attain to
[Phenice](../ebd/ebd293.htm#001.md), and there to winter; which is an
[haven](../ebd/ebd167.htm#008) of [Crete](../ebd/ebd092.htm#006.md), and
lieth toward the south west and north west.  

<span id="013">13</span> And when the south wind blew softly, supposing
that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close
by [Crete](../ebd/ebd092.htm#006.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> But not long after there arose against it a
tempestuous wind, called [Euroclydon](../ebd/ebd127.htm#002.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And when the ship was caught, and could not
bear up into the wind, we let her drive.  

<span id="016">16</span> And running under a certain
[island](../ebd/ebd190.htm#009.md) which is called
[Clauda](../ebd/ebd084.htm#001.md), we had much work to come by the boat:  

<span id="017">17</span> Which when they had taken up, they used
[helps](../ebd/ebd173.htm#007.md), undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest
they should fall into the [quicksands](../ebd/ebd303.htm#009.md), strake
sail, and so were driven.  

<span id="018">18</span> And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest,
the next day they lightened the ship;  

<span id="019">19</span> And the third day we cast out with our own
hands the [tackling](../ebd/ebd357.htm#003.md) of the ship.  

<span id="020">20</span> And when neither [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md)
nor [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md) in many days appeared, and no small
tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken
away.  

<span id="021">21</span> But after long abstinence
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) stood forth in the midst of them, and
said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from
[Crete](../ebd/ebd092.htm#006.md), and to have gained this harm and loss.  

<span id="022">22</span> And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for
there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.  

<span id="023">23</span> For there stood by me this night the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,  

<span id="024">24</span> Saying, Fear not,
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md); thou must be brought before
[Caesar](../ebd/ebd068.htm#002.md): and, lo, God hath given thee all them
that sail with thee.  

<span id="025">25</span> Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I
believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.  

<span id="026">26</span> Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain
[island](../ebd/ebd190.htm#009.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> But when the fourteenth night was come, as we
were driven up and down in [Adria](../ebd/ebd010.htm#005.md), about
midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;  

<span id="028">28</span> And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and
when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it
fifteen fathoms.  

<span id="029">29</span> Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon
rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the
day.  

<span id="030">30</span> And as the shipmen were about to flee out of
the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under
[colour](../ebd/ebd086.htm#008.md) as though they would have cast anchors
out of the foreship,  

<span id="031">31</span> [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) said to the
[centurion](../ebd/ebd075.htm#004.md) and to the soldiers, Except these
abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.  

<span id="032">32</span> Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the
boat, and let her fall off.  

<span id="033">33</span> And while the day was coming on,
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) besought them all to take meat, saying,
This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued
fasting, having taken nothing.  

<span id="034">34</span> Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for
this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head
of any of you.  

<span id="035">35</span> And when he had thus spoken, he took
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), and gave thanks to God in presence of
them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.  

<span id="036">36</span> Then were they all of good cheer, and they also
took some meat.  

<span id="037">37</span> And we were in all in the ship two hundred
threescore and sixteen souls.  

<span id="038">38</span> And when they had eaten enough, they lightened
the ship, and cast out the [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md) into the
sea.  

<span id="039">39</span> And when it was day, they knew not the land:
but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they
were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.  

<span id="040">40</span> And when they had taken up the anchors, they
committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003.md), and hoised up the mainsail to the wind,
and made toward shore.  

<span id="041">41</span> And falling into a place where two seas met,
they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md), and remained unmoveable, but the hinder
part was broken with the violence of the waves.  

<span id="042">42</span> And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the
prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.  

<span id="043">43</span> But the [centurion](../ebd/ebd075.htm#004.md),
willing to save [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md), kept them from their
purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves
first into the sea, and get to land:  

<span id="044">44</span> And the rest, some on boards, and some on
broken [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md) of the ship. And so it came to
pass, that they escaped all safe to land.
