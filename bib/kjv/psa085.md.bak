### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 85

<span id="001">1</span> Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land:
thou hast brought back the [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md) of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people,
thou hast covered all their [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast
turned thyself from the fierceness of thine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Turn us, O God of our
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md), and cause thine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) toward us to cease.  

<span id="005">5</span> Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou
draw out thine [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) to all generations?  

<span id="006">6</span> Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people
may rejoice in thee?  

<span id="007">7</span> Shew us thy [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md), O
LORD, and grant us thy [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he
will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not
turn again to folly.  

<span id="009">9</span> Surely his [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) is
nigh them that fear him; that [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) may dwell
in our land.  

<span id="010">10</span> [Mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) and truth are
met together; [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) and peace have
kissed each other.  

<span id="011">11</span> Truth shall spring out of the earth; and
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) shall look down from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good;
and our land shall yield her increase.  

<span id="013">13</span> [Righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) shall go
before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps.
