### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 33

<span id="001">1</span> Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise
is comely for the upright.  

<span id="002">2</span> Praise the LORD with
[harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001.md): sing unto him with the
[psaltery](../ebd/ebd301.htm#006.md) and an instrument of ten strings.  

<span id="003">3</span> Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a
loud noise.  

<span id="004">4</span> For the word of the LORD is right; and all his
works are done in truth.  

<span id="005">5</span> He loveth [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md)
and judgment: the earth is full of the [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md)
of the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> By the word of the LORD were the heavens made;
and all the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of them by the breath of his
mouth.  

<span id="007">7</span> He gathereth the waters of the sea together as
an [heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md): he layeth up the depth in
storehouses.  

<span id="008">8</span> Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the
inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.  

<span id="009">9</span> For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and
it stood [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> The LORD bringeth the counsel of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) to nought: he maketh the devices of the
people of none effect.  

<span id="011">11</span> The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the
thoughts of his heart to all generations.  

<span id="012">12</span> Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD;
and the people whom he hath [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) for his own
inheritance.  

<span id="013">13</span> The LORD looketh from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md); he beholdeth all the sons of men.  

<span id="014">14</span> From the place of his
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md) he looketh upon all the inhabitants
of the earth.  

<span id="015">15</span> He fashioneth their hearts alike; he
considereth all their works.  

<span id="016">16</span> There is no [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) saved
by the multitude of an [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md): a mighty man is
not delivered by much strength.  

<span id="017">17</span> An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither
shall he deliver any by his great strength.  

<span id="018">18</span> Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that
fear him, upon them that hope in his [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md);  

<span id="019">19</span> To deliver their soul from death, and to keep
them alive in [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help
and our [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we
have trusted in his holy name.  

<span id="022">22</span> Let thy [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md), O LORD,
be upon us, according as we hope in thee.
