### King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> To every thing there is a season, and a time to
every purpose under the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md):  

<span id="002">2</span> A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to
plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;  

<span id="003">3</span> A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to
break down, and a time to build up;  

<span id="004">4</span> A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004.md), and a time to
[dance](../ebd/ebd097.htm#000.md);  

<span id="005">5</span> A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather
stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from
embracing;  

<span id="006">6</span> A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to
keep, and a time to cast away;  

<span id="007">7</span> A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to
keep silence, and a time to speak;  

<span id="008">8</span> A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of
war, and a time of peace.  

<span id="009">9</span> What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein
he laboureth?  

<span id="010">10</span> I have seen the travail, which God hath given
to the sons of men to be exercised in it.  

<span id="011">11</span> He hath made every thing beautiful in his time:
also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out
the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.  

<span id="012">12</span> I know that there is no good in them, but for a
man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.  

<span id="013">13</span> And also that every man should eat and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), and enjoy the good of all his labour, it
is the [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005.md) of God.  

<span id="014">14</span> I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be
for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God
doeth it, that men should fear before him.  

<span id="015">15</span> That which hath been is now; and that which is
to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.  

<span id="016">16</span> And moreover I saw under the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) the place of judgment, that wickedness was
there; and the place of [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), that
iniquity was there.  

<span id="017">17</span> I said in mine heart, God shall
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) the righteous and the wicked: for there
is a time there for every purpose and for every work.  

<span id="018">18</span> I said in mine heart concerning the estate of
the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see
that they themselves are beasts.  

<span id="019">19</span> For that which befalleth the sons of men
befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so
dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no
preeminence above a [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md): for all is vanity.  

<span id="020">20</span> All go unto one place; all are of the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md), and all turn to
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) again.  

<span id="021">21</span> Who knoweth the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md)
of man that goeth upward, and the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) that goeth downward to the earth?  

<span id="022">22</span> Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing
better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his
portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?
