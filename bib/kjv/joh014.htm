</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#005">Thomas</A> saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A> saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A>? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?  the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;If ye love me, keep my commandments.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd087.htm#001">Comforter</A>, that he may abide with you for ever;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Even the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</A> saith unto him, not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd190.htm#000">Iscariot</A>, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;But the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd087.htm#001">Comforter</A>, which is the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.<BR>
