### King James Version: Ephesians Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> For this cause I [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002),
the prisoner of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) for you
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001),  

<span id="002">2</span> If ye have heard of the
[dispensation](../ebd/ebd104.htm#006) of the
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) of God which is given me to you-ward:  

<span id="003">3</span> How that by [revelation](../ebd/ebd312.htm#002)
he made known unto me the [mystery](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006); (as I wrote
afore in few words,  

<span id="004">4</span> Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my
knowledge in the [mystery](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006) of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000))  

<span id="005">5</span> Which in other ages was not made known unto the
sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets
by the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009);  

<span id="006">6</span> That the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001)
should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his
promise in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) by the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003):  

<span id="007">7</span> Whereof I was made a
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007), according to the
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005) of the [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) of
God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.  

<span id="008">8</span> Unto me, who am less than the least of all
saints, is this [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) given, that I should
preach among the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) the unsearchable
riches of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000);  

<span id="009">9</span> And to make all men see what is the
[fellowship](../ebd/ebd132.htm#002) of the
[mystery](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006), which from the beginning of the world
hath been hid in God, who created all things by
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000):  

<span id="010">10</span> To the intent that now unto the principalities
and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold
wisdom of God,  

<span id="011">11</span> According to the eternal purpose which he
purposed in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) our Lord:  

<span id="012">12</span> In whom we have boldness and access with
confidence by the faith of him.  

<span id="013">13</span> Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my
tribulations for you, which is your [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006).  

<span id="014">14</span> For this cause I [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003)
my knees unto the Father of our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000),  

<span id="015">15</span> Of whom the whole family in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) and earth is named,  

<span id="016">16</span> That he would grant you, according to the
riches of his [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006), to be strengthened with
might by his [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) in the inner man;  

<span id="017">17</span> That [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) may dwell
in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,  

<span id="018">18</span> May be able to comprehend with all saints what
is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;  

<span id="019">19</span> And to know the love of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), which passeth knowledge, that ye might
be filled with all the [fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007) of God.  

<span id="020">20</span> Now unto him that is able to do exceeding
abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that
worketh in us,  

<span id="021">21</span> Unto him be [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) in
the church by [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) throughout all ages, world without end.
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).
