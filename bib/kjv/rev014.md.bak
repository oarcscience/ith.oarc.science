### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> And I looked, and, lo, a
[Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md) stood on the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Sion](../ebd/ebd345.htm#003.md), and with
him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written
in their foreheads.  

<span id="002">2</span> And I heard a voice from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), as the voice of many waters, and as the
voice of a great [thunder](../ebd/ebd365.htm#003.md): and I heard the voice
of harpers harping with their harps:  

<span id="003">3</span> And they sung as it were a new song before the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), and before the four beasts, and the
elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and
four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.  

<span id="004">4</span> These are they which were not defiled with
women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the
[Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md) whithersoever he goeth. These were
redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the
[Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And in their mouth was found no guile: for they
are without fault before the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of God.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I saw another [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md)
[fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004.md) in the midst of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), having the
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) to
preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and
kindred, and tongue, and people,  

<span id="007">7</span> Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) to him; for the hour of his judgment is
come: and [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) him that made
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and earth, and the sea, and the
fountains of waters.  

<span id="008">8</span> And there followed another
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001), saying, [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md)
is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of the [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) of
the wrath of her [fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And the third [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md)
followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) and
his image, and receive his mark in his
[forehead](../ebd/ebd137.htm#002.md), or in his hand,  

<span id="010">10</span> The same shall [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md)
of the [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) of the wrath of God, which is
poured out without mixture into the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000.md) of his
indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and
[brimstone](../ebd/ebd065.htm#005.md) in the presence of the holy angels,
and in the presence of the [Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md):  

<span id="011">11</span> And the smoke of their
[torment](../ebd/ebd370.htm#009.md) ascendeth up for ever and ever: and
they have no rest day nor night, who [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md)
the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) and his image, and whosoever
receiveth the mark of his name.  

<span id="012">12</span> Here is the patience of the saints: here are
they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And I heard a voice from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the
dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), that they may rest from their labours;
and their works do follow them.  

<span id="014">14</span> And I looked, and behold a white
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md), and upon the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md) one sat like unto the Son of man, having
on his head a golden [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md), and in his hand a
sharp [sickle](../ebd/ebd342.htm#008.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And another [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) came
out of the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), crying with a loud voice to
him that sat on the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md), Thrust in thy
[sickle](../ebd/ebd342.htm#008.md), and reap: for the time is come for thee
to reap; for the [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md) of the earth is
ripe.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he that sat on the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md) thrust in his
[sickle](../ebd/ebd342.htm#008.md) on the earth; and the earth was
reaped.  

<span id="017">17</span> And another [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) came
out of the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) which is in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), he also having a sharp
[sickle](../ebd/ebd342.htm#008.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And another [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) came
out from the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), which had power over fire;
and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp
[sickle](../ebd/ebd342.htm#008.md), saying, Thrust in thy sharp
[sickle](../ebd/ebd342.htm#008.md), and gather the clusters of the
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md) of the earth; for her grapes are fully
ripe.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) thrust
in his [sickle](../ebd/ebd342.htm#008.md) into the earth, and gathered the
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md) of the earth, and cast it into the great
winepress of the wrath of God.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the winepress was trodden without the city,
and [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) came out of the winepress, even unto
the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred
furlongs.
