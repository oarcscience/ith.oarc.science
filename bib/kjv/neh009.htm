<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Nehemiah Chapter 9</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the seed of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#003">Jeshua</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#004">Bani</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd215.htm#004">Kadmiel</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd332.htm#007">Shebaniah</A>, Bunni, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#007">Sherebiah</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#004">Bani</A>, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then the Levites, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#003">Jeshua</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd215.htm#004">Kadmiel</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#004">Bani</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd166.htm#002">Hashabniah</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#007">Sherebiah</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd180.htm#002">Hodijah</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd332.htm#007">Shebaniah</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#005">Pethahiah</A>, said, Stand up and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> of heavens, with all their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> worshippeth thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</A>, and broughtest him forth out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd375.htm#001">Ur</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#002">Chaldees</A>, and gavest him the name of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And foundest his heart <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> before thee, and madest a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with him to give the land of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#006">Hittites</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd290.htm#006">Perizzites</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd199.htm#004">Jebusites</A>, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And didst see the affliction of our fathers in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and heardest their cry by the Red sea;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And shewedst signs and wonders upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> into the mighty waters.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</A>; and in the night by a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</A> of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Thou camest down also upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</A>, and spakest with them from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And madest known unto them thy holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A>, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> thy servant:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And gavest them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</A>: but thou art a God ready to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd285.htm#001">pardon</A>, gracious and merciful, slow to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Yea, when they had made them a molten <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</A>, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and had wrought great provocations;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A> departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</A> of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Thou gavest also thy good <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> to instruct them, and withheldest not thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</A> from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#002">Sihon</A>, and the land of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd176.htm#009">Heshbon</A>, and the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#002">Og</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#003">Bashan</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Their children also multipliedst thou as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</A>, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And they took strong cities, and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A>, and delighted themselves in thy great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>, and would not hear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> in thy prophets: yet would they not give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</A> unto this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A> that thou gavest them, and in the large and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And because of all this we make a sure <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</A> unto it.<BR>
