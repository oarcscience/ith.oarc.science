### King James Version: Ezra Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> Then [Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) made a decree, and search was made in the
house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And there was found at
[Achmetha](../ebd/ebd006.htm#009.md), in the
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md) that is in the province of the Medes, a
[roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004.md), and therein was a record thus written:  

<span id="003">3</span> In the first year of
[Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) the
same [Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
made a decree concerning the house of God at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), Let the house be builded, the place
where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be
strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth
thereof threescore cubits;  

<span id="004">4</span> With three rows of great stones, and a row of
new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house:  

<span id="005">5</span> And also let the golden and
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) vessels of the house of God, which
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) took forth out of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) which is at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and brought unto
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), be restored, and brought again unto
the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) which is at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), every one to his place, and place
them in the house of God.  

<span id="006">6</span> Now therefore, [Tatnai](../ebd/ebd359.htm#006.md),
governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the
[Apharsachites](../ebd/ebd026.htm#000.md), which are beyond the river, be
ye far from thence:  

<span id="007">7</span> Let the work of this house of God alone; let the
governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God
in his place.  

<span id="008">8</span> Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the
elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the
king's goods, even of the [tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006.md) beyond the
river, forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that they be not
hindered.  

<span id="009">9</span> And that which they have need of, both young
bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md),
[salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008), [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), and oil,
according to the appointment of the priests which are at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), let it be given them day by day
without fail:  

<span id="010">10</span> That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours
unto the God of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and pray for the life
of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and of his sons.  

<span id="011">11</span> Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall
alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set
up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for
this.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the God that hath caused his name to dwell
there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to
alter and to destroy this house of God which is at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005). I [Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007.md)
have made a decree; let it be done with speed.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then [Tatnai](../ebd/ebd359.htm#006.md), governor
on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and their companions, according
to that which [Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) had sent, so they did speedily.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the elders of the Jews builded, and they
prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) and [Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006.md)
the son of [Iddo](../ebd/ebd186.htm#005.md). And they builded, and finished
it, according to the commandment of the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and according to the commandment of
[Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006), and [Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007.md), and
[Artaxerxes](../ebd/ebd032.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And this house was finished on the third day of
the month [Adar](../ebd/ebd008.htm#002.md), which was in the sixth year of
the reign of [Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), the priests, and the Levites, and the
rest of the children of the [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md), kept the
dedication of this house of God with joy.  

<span id="017">17</span> And offered at the dedication of this house of
God an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) for all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), twelve he goats, according to the
number of the tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And they set the priests in their divisions,
and the Levites in their [courses](../ebd/ebd091.htm#006.md), for the
service of God, which is at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md); as it is
written in the book of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And the children of the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md) kept the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md) upon the fourteenth day of the first
month.  

<span id="020">20</span> For the priests and the Levites were purified
together, all of them were pure, and killed the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md) for all the children of the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md), and for their brethren the priests,
and for themselves.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), which were come again out of
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md), and all such as had separated
themselves unto them from the filthiness of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) of the land, to seek the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), did eat,  

<span id="022">22</span> And kept the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) of
unleavened [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart
of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md)
unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God,
the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).
