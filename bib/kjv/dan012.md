### King James Version: Daniel Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> And at that time shall
[Michael](../ebd/ebd252.htm#009) stand up, the great
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) which standeth for the children of thy
people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since
there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people
shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.  

<span id="002">2</span> And many of them that sleep in the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) of the earth shall awake, some to
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) life, and some to shame and
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) contempt.  

<span id="003">3</span> And they that be [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004)
shall shine as the brightness of the [firmament](../ebd/ebd134.htm#000);
and they that turn many to [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) as the
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008) for ever and ever.  

<span id="004">4</span> But thou, O [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001),
shut up the words, and [seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002) the book, even to
the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be
increased.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then I [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001) looked,
and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of
the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river.  

<span id="006">6</span> And one said to the man clothed in
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), which was upon the waters of the river,
How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?  

<span id="007">7</span> And I heard the man clothed in
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), which was upon the waters of the river,
when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and sware by him that liveth for ever
that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have
accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things
shall be finished.  

<span id="008">8</span> And I heard, but I understood not: then said I,
O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?  

<span id="009">9</span> And he said, Go thy way,
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001): for the words are closed up and sealed
till the time of the end.  

<span id="010">10</span> Many shall be purified, and made white, and
tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall
understand; but the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) shall understand.  

<span id="011">11</span> And from the time that the daily
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) shall be taken away, and the
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) that maketh desolate set up, there
shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.  

<span id="012">12</span> Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the
thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.  

<span id="013">13</span> But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou
shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.
