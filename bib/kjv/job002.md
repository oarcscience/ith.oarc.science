### King James Version: Job Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> Again there was a day when the sons of God came
to present themselves before the LORD, and
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md) came also among them to present himself
before the LORD.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the LORD said unto
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md), From whence comest thou? And
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md) answered the LORD, and said, From going
to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the LORD said unto
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md), Hast thou considered my servant Job,
that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man,
one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) his integrity, although thou movedst me
against him, to destroy him without cause.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md) answered the
LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for
his life.  

<span id="005">5</span> But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone
and his [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), and he will
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) thee to thy face.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the LORD said unto
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md), Behold, he is in thine hand; but save
his life.  

<span id="007">7</span> So went [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md) forth
from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the
sole of his foot unto his [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And he took him a
[potsherd](../ebd/ebd299.htm#004.md) to scrape himself withal; and he sat
down among the [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still
retain thine integrity? [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) God, and die.  

<span id="010">10</span> But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of
the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of
God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) with his lips.  

<span id="011">11</span> Now when Job's three friends heard of all this
evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place;
[Eliphaz](../ebd/ebd117.htm#005) the [Temanite](../ebd/ebd361.htm#002.md),
and [Bildad](../ebd/ebd058.htm#006.md) the
[Shuhite](../ebd/ebd341.htm#008), and [Zophar](../ebd/ebd396.htm#000.md)
the [Naamathite](../ebd/ebd264.htm#000.md): for they had made an
appointment together to come to [mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004.md) with him
and to comfort him.  

<span id="012">12</span> And when they lifted up their eyes afar off,
and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) every one his
[mantle](../ebd/ebd240.htm#009.md), and sprinkled
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) upon their heads toward
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> So they sat down with him upon the ground
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was
very great.
