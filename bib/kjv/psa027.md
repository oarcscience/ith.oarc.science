### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 27

<span id="001">1</span> The LORD is my light and my
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003); whom shall I fear? the LORD is the
strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?  

<span id="002">2</span> When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes,
came upon me to eat up my [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), they stumbled
and fell.  

<span id="003">3</span> Though an [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) should
[encamp](../ebd/ebd120.htm#003) against me, my heart shall not fear:
though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.  

<span id="004">4</span> One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will
I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of
my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004).  

<span id="005">5</span> For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in
his [pavilion](../ebd/ebd287.htm#004): in the secret of his
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) shall he hide me; he shall set me up
upon a [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001).  

<span id="006">6</span> And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine
enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea,
I will sing praises unto the LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) also upon me, and answer me.  

<span id="008">8</span> When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said
unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.  

<span id="009">9</span> Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy
servant away in [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002): thou hast been my help;
leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003).  

<span id="010">10</span> When my father and my mother forsake me, then
the LORD will take me up.  

<span id="011">11</span> Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) path, because of mine enemies.  

<span id="012">12</span> Deliver me not over unto the will of mine
enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as
breathe out cruelty.  

<span id="013">13</span> I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000) of the LORD in the land of the
living.  

<span id="014">14</span> Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he
shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.
