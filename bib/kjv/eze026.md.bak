### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 26

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the
first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), [Aha](../ebd/ebd013.htm#001.md), she is
broken that was the gates of the people: she is turned unto me: I shall
be replenished, now she is laid waste:  

<span id="003">3</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am
against thee, O Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against
thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come up.  

<span id="004">4</span> And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and
break down her [towers](../ebd/ebd371.htm#002.md): I will also scrape her
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) from her, and make her like the top of a
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in
the midst of the sea: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD: and it
shall become a spoil to the nations.  

<span id="006">6</span> And her daughters which are in the field shall
be slain by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md); and they shall know that
I am the LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will
bring upon Tyrus [Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), a
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of kings, from the north, with horses, and
with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.  

<span id="008">8</span> He shall slay with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) thy daughters in the field: and he shall
make a fort against thee, and cast a [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
against thee, and lift up the [buckler](../ebd/ebd066.htm#000.md) against
thee.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he shall set
[engines](../ebd/ebd121.htm#000.md) of war against thy walls, and with his
axes he shall break down thy [towers](../ebd/ebd371.htm#002.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> By reason of the abundance of his horses their
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at
the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when
he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made
a [breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread
down all thy streets: he shall slay thy people by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), and thy strong garrisons shall go down
to the ground.  

<span id="012">12</span> And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and
make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and
destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy
timber and thy [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) in the midst of the
water.  

<span id="013">13</span> And I will cause the noise of thy
[songs](../ebd/ebd348.htm#002.md) to cease; and the sound of thy harps
shall be no more heard.  

<span id="014">14</span> And I will make thee like the top of a
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md): thou shalt be a place to spread nets
upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the LORD have spoken it, saith
the Lord GOD.  

<span id="015">15</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the
isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the
slaughter is made in the midst of thee?  

<span id="016">16</span> Then all the princes of the sea shall come down
from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their
broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they
shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at every moment, and be
astonished at thee.  

<span id="017">17</span> And they shall take up a
[lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005.md) for thee, and say to thee, How art
thou destroyed, that wast inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city,
which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their
terror to be on all that haunt it!  

<span id="018">18</span> Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy
fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy
departure.  

<span id="019">19</span> For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make
thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I
shall bring up the [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) upon thee, and great
waters shall cover thee;  

<span id="020">20</span> When I shall bring thee down with them that
descend into the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md), with the people of old
time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth, in places
desolate of old, with them that go down to the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md), that thou be not inhabited; and I shall
set [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) in the land of the living;  

<span id="021">21</span> I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no
more: though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again,
saith the Lord GOD.
