### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> And the whole earth was of one language, and of
one speech.  

<span id="002">2</span> And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md), that they found a
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md) in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt
there.  

<span id="003">3</span> And they said one to another, Go to, let us make
brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), and [slime](../ebd/ebd346.htm#004.md) had
they for morter.  

<span id="004">4</span> And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and
a tower, whose top may reach unto [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md); and
let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the
whole earth.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the LORD came down to see the city and the
tower, which the children of men builded.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one,
and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now
nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.  

<span id="007">7</span> Go to, let us go down, and there confound their
language, that they may not understand one another's speech.  

<span id="008">8</span> So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence
upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.  

<span id="009">9</span> Therefore is the name of it called Babel;
because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and
from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the
earth.  

<span id="010">10</span> These are the generations of
[Shem](../ebd/ebd334.htm#002): [Shem](../ebd/ebd334.htm#002.md) was an
hundred years old, and begat [Arphaxad](../ebd/ebd032.htm#004.md) two years
after the [flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000.md):  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Shem](../ebd/ebd334.htm#002.md) lived after
he begat [Arphaxad](../ebd/ebd032.htm#004.md) five hundred years, and begat
sons and daughters.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Arphaxad](../ebd/ebd032.htm#004.md) lived
five and thirty years, and begat Salah:  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Arphaxad](../ebd/ebd032.htm#004.md) lived
after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and
daughters.  

<span id="014">14</span> And Salah lived thirty years, and begat
[Eber](../ebd/ebd112.htm#001.md):  

<span id="015">15</span> And Salah lived after he begat
[Eber](../ebd/ebd112.htm#001.md) four hundred and three years, and begat
sons and daughters.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Eber](../ebd/ebd112.htm#001.md) lived four
and thirty years, and begat [Peleg](../ebd/ebd288.htm#007.md):  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Eber](../ebd/ebd112.htm#001.md) lived after
he begat [Peleg](../ebd/ebd288.htm#007.md) four hundred and thirty years,
and begat sons and daughters.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Peleg](../ebd/ebd288.htm#007.md) lived thirty
years, and begat Reu:  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Peleg](../ebd/ebd288.htm#007.md) lived after
he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.  

<span id="020">20</span> And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat
[Serug](../ebd/ebd329.htm#001.md):  

<span id="021">21</span> And Reu lived after he begat
[Serug](../ebd/ebd329.htm#001.md) two hundred and
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) years, and begat sons and daughters.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Serug](../ebd/ebd329.htm#001.md) lived thirty
years, and begat [Nahor](../ebd/ebd265.htm#006.md):  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Serug](../ebd/ebd329.htm#001.md) lived after
he begat [Nahor](../ebd/ebd265.htm#006.md) two hundred years, and begat
sons and daughters.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Nahor](../ebd/ebd265.htm#006.md) lived nine
and twenty years, and begat [Terah](../ebd/ebd362.htm#001.md):  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Nahor](../ebd/ebd265.htm#006.md) lived after
he begat [Terah](../ebd/ebd362.htm#001.md) an hundred and nineteen years,
and begat sons and daughters.  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Terah](../ebd/ebd362.htm#001.md) lived
seventy years, and begat [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md),
[Nahor](../ebd/ebd265.htm#006), and [Haran](../ebd/ebd163.htm#007.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> Now these are the generations of
[Terah](../ebd/ebd362.htm#001): [Terah](../ebd/ebd362.htm#001.md) begat
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004), [Nahor](../ebd/ebd265.htm#006.md), and
[Haran](../ebd/ebd163.htm#007); and [Haran](../ebd/ebd163.htm#007.md) begat
Lot.  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Haran](../ebd/ebd163.htm#007.md) died before
his father [Terah](../ebd/ebd362.htm#001.md) in the land of his nativity,
in [Ur](../ebd/ebd375.htm#001.md) of the
[Chaldees](../ebd/ebd076.htm#002.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md) and
[Nahor](../ebd/ebd265.htm#006.md) took them wives: the name of Abram's wife
was [Sarai](../ebd/ebd322.htm#004.md); and the name of Nahor's wife,
Milcah, the daughter of [Haran](../ebd/ebd163.htm#007.md), the father of
Milcah, and the father of [Iscah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#009.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> But [Sarai](../ebd/ebd322.htm#004.md) was
[barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007.md); she had no child.  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Terah](../ebd/ebd362.htm#001.md) took
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md) his son, and Lot the son of
[Haran](../ebd/ebd163.htm#007.md) his son's son, and
[Sarai](../ebd/ebd322.htm#004.md) his daughter in law, his son Abram's
wife; and they went forth with them from [Ur](../ebd/ebd375.htm#001.md) of
the [Chaldees](../ebd/ebd076.htm#002.md), to go into the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md); and they came unto
[Haran](../ebd/ebd163.htm#007.md), and dwelt there.  

<span id="032">32</span> And the days of [Terah](../ebd/ebd362.htm#001.md)
were two hundred and five years: and [Terah](../ebd/ebd362.htm#001.md) died
in [Haran](../ebd/ebd163.htm#007.md).
