### King James Version: Job Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> Then answered [Zophar](../ebd/ebd396.htm#000.md)
the [Naamathite](../ebd/ebd264.htm#000.md), and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> Should not the multitude of words be answered?
and should a man full of talk be justified?  

<span id="003">3</span> Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and
when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?  

<span id="004">4</span> For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I
am [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) in thine eyes.  

<span id="005">5</span> But oh that God would speak, and open his lips
against thee;  

<span id="006">6</span> And that he would shew thee the secrets of
wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God
exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.  

<span id="007">7</span> Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou
find out the Almighty unto [perfection](../ebd/ebd290.htm#001.md)?  

<span id="008">8</span> It is as high as
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md); what canst thou do? deeper than
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md); what canst thou know?  

<span id="009">9</span> The measure thereof is longer than the earth,
and broader than the sea.  

<span id="010">10</span> If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together,
then who can hinder him?  

<span id="011">11</span> For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness
also; will he not then consider it?  

<span id="012">12</span> For vain men would be
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md), though man be born like a wild ass's
colt.  

<span id="013">13</span> If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out
thine hands toward him;  

<span id="014">14</span> If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away,
and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.  

<span id="015">15</span> For then shalt thou lift up thy face without
spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:  

<span id="016">16</span> Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and
remember it as waters that pass away:  

<span id="017">17</span> And thine age shall be clearer than the
noonday: thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.  

<span id="018">18</span> And thou shalt be secure, because there is
hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in
safety.  

<span id="019">19</span> Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make
thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.  

<span id="020">20</span> But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they
shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the
[ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md).
