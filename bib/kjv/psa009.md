### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart;
I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.  

<span id="002">2</span> I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing
praise to thy name, O thou most High.  

<span id="003">3</span> When mine enemies are turned back, they shall
fall and perish at thy presence.  

<span id="004">4</span> For thou hast maintained my right and my cause;
thou satest in the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) judging right.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thou hast rebuked the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou
hast put out their name for ever and ever.  

<span id="006">6</span> O thou enemy, destructions are come to a
perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is
perished with them.  

<span id="007">7</span> But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath
prepared his [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) for judgment.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he shall [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) the
world in [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), he shall
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) judgment to the people in
uprightness.  

<span id="009">9</span> The LORD also will be a refuge for the
oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.  

<span id="010">10</span> And they that know thy name will put their
trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.  

<span id="011">11</span> Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md): declare among the people his doings.  

<span id="012">12</span> When he maketh inquisition for
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), he remembereth them: he forgetteth not
the cry of the humble.  

<span id="013">13</span> Have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) upon me, O
LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that
liftest me up from the gates of death:  

<span id="014">14</span> That I may shew forth all thy praise in the
gates of the daughter of [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md): I will rejoice
in thy [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> The [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) are sunk
down in the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md) that they made: in the
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002.md) which they hid is their own foot taken.  

<span id="016">16</span> The LORD is known by the judgment which he
executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands.
[Higgaion](../ebd/ebd178.htm#002). [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> The wicked shall be turned into
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md), and all the nations that forget God.  

<span id="018">18</span> For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the
expectation of the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) shall not perish for
ever.  

<span id="019">19</span> Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) be judged in thy sight.  

<span id="020">20</span> Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may
know themselves to be but men. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).
