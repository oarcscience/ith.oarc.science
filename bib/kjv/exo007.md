### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), See, I have made thee a god to
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005): and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) thy
brother shall be thy [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) thy brother shall speak unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), that he send the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) out of his land.  

<span id="003">3</span> And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply
my signs and my wonders in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> But [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) shall not
hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and bring forth mine armies, and my
people the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), out of the land
of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) by great judgments.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD,
when I stretch forth mine hand upon [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and
bring out the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) from among
them.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) did as the LORD commanded them, so did
they.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) was fourscore
years old, and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) fourscore and three years
old, when they spake unto [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md),
saying,  

<span id="009">9</span> When [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) shall
speak unto you, saying, Shew a [miracle](../ebd/ebd256.htm#002.md) for you:
then thou shalt say unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), Take thy rod,
and cast it before [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), and it shall become
a [serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) went in unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), and they did so as the LORD had
commanded: and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) cast down his rod before
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), and before his servants, and it became
a [serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Then [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) also
called the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) men and the sorcerers: now the
[magicians](../ebd/ebd236.htm#007) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md),
they also did in like manner with their
[enchantments](../ebd/ebd120.htm#004.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> For they cast down every man his rod, and they
became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he
hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth
to let the people go.  

<span id="015">15</span> Get thee unto [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md)
in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by
the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009.md) shalt thou take in thine hand.  

<span id="016">16</span> And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of
the [Hebrews](../ebd/ebd171.htm#001.md) hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let
my people go, that they may serve me in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md): and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest
not hear.  

<span id="017">17</span> Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know
that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine
hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And the [fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005.md) that is
in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians
shall lothe to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) of the water of the
river.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Say unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md),
Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), upon their streams, upon their rivers,
and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may
become [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md); and that there may be
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) throughout all the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), both in vessels of
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md), and in vessels of
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) did so, as the LORD commanded; and he
lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the
sight of [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), and in the sight of his
servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And the [fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005.md) that was
in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) of the water of the river; and there was
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) throughout all the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And the [magicians](../ebd/ebd236.htm#007.md) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) did so with their
[enchantments](../ebd/ebd120.htm#004.md): and Pharaoh's heart was hardened,
neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said.  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) turned and
went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.  

<span id="024">24</span> And all the Egyptians digged round about the
river for water to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md); for they could not
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) of the water of the river.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days were
fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.
