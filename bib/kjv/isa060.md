### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 60

<span id="001">1</span> Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the LORD is risen upon thee.  

<span id="002">2</span> For, behold, the
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) shall cover the earth, and gross
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) the people: but the LORD shall arise
upon thee, and his [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) shall be seen upon
thee.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) shall
come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.  

<span id="004">4</span> Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all
they gather themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come
from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and
thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the
sea shall be converted unto thee, the [forces](../ebd/ebd137.htm#000) of
the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) shall come unto thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the
dromedaries of [Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007) and
[Ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003); all they from
[Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006) shall come: they shall bring
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) and [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002); and
they shall shew forth the praises of the LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> All the flocks of [Kedar](../ebd/ebd216.htm#003)
shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of
[Nebaioth](../ebd/ebd268.htm#001) shall
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) unto thee: they shall come up with
acceptance on mine [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), and I will
[glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005) the house of my
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006).  

<span id="008">8</span> Who are these that [fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004)
as a [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001), and as the doves to their
windows?  

<span id="009">9</span> Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the
[ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003) of [Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002)
first, to bring thy sons from far, their [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000)
and their [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) with them, unto the name of the
LORD thy God, and to the Holy One of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),
because he hath glorified thee.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the sons of strangers shall build up thy
walls, and their kings shall [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) unto
thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favour have I had
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) on thee.  

<span id="011">11</span> Therefore thy gates shall be open continually;
they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the
[forces](../ebd/ebd137.htm#000) of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001), and that their kings may be
brought.  

<span id="012">12</span> For the nation and kingdom that will not serve
thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.  

<span id="013">13</span> The [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001) shall come unto thee, the
[fir](../ebd/ebd133.htm#005) tree, the pine tree, and the
[box](../ebd/ebd063.htm#007) together, to beautify the place of my
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005); and I will make the place of my feet
glorious.  

<span id="014">14</span> The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall
come bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) themselves down at the soles of thy feet;
and they shall call thee; The city of the LORD, The
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002) of the Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="015">15</span> Whereas thou has been forsaken and hated, so
that no man went through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a
joy of many generations.  

<span id="016">16</span> Thou shalt also suck the
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000) of the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001),
and shalt suck the breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the LORD
am thy [Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003) and thy
[Redeemer](../ebd/ebd308.htm#008), the mighty One of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007).  

<span id="017">17</span> For [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003) I will bring
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and for [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004) I
will bring [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and for
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003), and for
stones [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004): I will also make thy officers
peace, and thine exactors [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="018">18</span> Violence shall no more be heard in thy land,
wasting nor [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) within thy borders; but
thou shalt call thy walls [Salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003), and thy
gates Praise.  

<span id="019">19</span> The [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) shall be no
more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004) give light unto thee: but the LORD shall
be unto thee an [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) light, and thy God
thy [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006).  

<span id="020">20</span> Thy [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) shall no more
go down; neither shall thy [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004) withdraw
itself: for the LORD shall be thine [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007)
light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.  

<span id="021">21</span> Thy people also shall be all righteous: they
shall inherit the land for ever, the [branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002) of
my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.  

<span id="022">22</span> A little one shall become a thousand, and a
small one a strong nation: I the LORD will hasten it in his time.
