</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</A>, to feed in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#001">gardens</A>, and to gather lilies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, terrible as an army with banners.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Thy teeth are as a flock of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> which go up from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd379.htm#002">washing</A>, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</A> among them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;As a piece of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#000">pomegranate</A> are thy temples within thy locks.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;My <A HREF="../ebd/ebd106.htm#007">dove</A>, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</A>, clear as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>, and terrible as an army with banners?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;I went down into the garden of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd275.htm#007">nuts</A> to see the fruits of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A>, and to see whether the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A> flourished and the pomegranates budded.<BR>
