### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 28

<span id="001">1</span> Woe to the [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) of
pride, to the drunkards of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), whose
glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) valleys of them that are overcome with
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md)!  

<span id="002">2</span> Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one,
which as a tempest of [hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002.md) and a destroying
storm, as a [flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000.md) of mighty waters overflowing,
shall cast down to the earth with the hand.  

<span id="003">3</span> The [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) of pride, the
drunkards of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), shall be trodden under
feet:  

<span id="004">4</span> And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of
the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md), shall
be a fading flower, and as the hasty [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md)
before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is
yet in his hand he eateth it up.  

<span id="005">5</span> In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), and
for a [diadem](../ebd/ebd102.htm#009.md) of beauty, unto the residue of his
people,  

<span id="006">6</span> And for a [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of
judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that
turn the battle to the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> But they also have erred through
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), and through strong
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) are out of the way; the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) and the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md)
have erred through strong [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), they are
swallowed up of [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), they are out of the way
through strong [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md); they err in
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md), they stumble in judgment.  

<span id="008">8</span> For all [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006.md) are full
of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he
make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000.md), and drawn from the breasts.  

<span id="010">10</span> For precept must be upon precept, precept upon
precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a
little:  

<span id="011">11</span> For with stammering lips and another tongue
will he speak to this people.  

<span id="012">12</span> To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye
may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would
not hear.  

<span id="013">13</span> But the word of the LORD was unto them precept
upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here
a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and
be broken, and snared, and taken.  

<span id="014">14</span> Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye
scornful men, that rule this people which is in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> Because ye have said, We have made a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with death, and with
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md) are we at agreement; when the overflowing
scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made
lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:  

<span id="016">16</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I
lay in [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md) for a foundation a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), a tried [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md),
a precious corner [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), a sure foundation: he
that believeth shall not make haste.  

<span id="017">17</span> Judgment also will I lay to the line, and
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) to the plummet: and the
[hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002.md) shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and
the waters shall overflow the hiding place.  

<span id="018">18</span> And your [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) with
death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md) shall not stand; when the overflowing
scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.  

<span id="019">19</span> From the time that it goeth forth it shall take
you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and
it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.  

<span id="020">20</span> For the bed is shorter than that a man can
stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap
himself in it.  

<span id="021">21</span> For the LORD shall rise up as in
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002.md), that
he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his
strange act.  

<span id="022">22</span> Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003.md) be made strong: for I have heard from the
Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.  

<span id="023">23</span> Give ye [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md), and hear
my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.  

<span id="024">24</span> Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he
open and break the clods of his ground?  

<span id="025">25</span> When he hath made
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md) the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad
the [fitches](../ebd/ebd135.htm#000.md), and scatter the
[cummin](../ebd/ebd093.htm#009.md), and cast in the principal
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md) and the appointed
[barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003.md) and the rie in their place?  

<span id="026">26</span> For his God doth instruct him to discretion,
and doth teach him.  

<span id="027">27</span> For the [fitches](../ebd/ebd135.htm#000.md) are
not threshed with a [threshing](../ebd/ebd364.htm#009.md) instrument,
neither is a [cart](../ebd/ebd073.htm#001.md)
[wheel](../ebd/ebd381.htm#001.md) turned about upon the
[cummin](../ebd/ebd093.htm#009.md); but the
[fitches](../ebd/ebd135.htm#000.md) are beaten out with a staff, and the
[cummin](../ebd/ebd093.htm#009.md) with a rod.  

<span id="028">28</span> [Bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md)
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md) is bruised; because he will not ever be
[threshing](../ebd/ebd364.htm#009.md) it, nor break it with the
[wheel](../ebd/ebd381.htm#001) of his [cart](../ebd/ebd073.htm#001.md), nor
bruise it with his horsemen.  

<span id="029">29</span> This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts,
which is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.
