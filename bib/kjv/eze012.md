### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> The word of the LORD also came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a
rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to
hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house.  

<span id="003">3</span> Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff
for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove
from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will
consider, though they be a rebellious house.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in
their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in
their sight, as they that go forth into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002).  

<span id="005">5</span> Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and
carry out thereby.  

<span id="006">6</span> In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy
shoulders, and carry it forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy
face, that thou see not the ground: for I have set thee for a sign unto
the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="007">7</span> And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth
my stuff by day, as stuff for [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002), and in
the even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought it forth in
the twilight, and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.  

<span id="008">8</span> And in the morning came the word of the LORD
unto me, saying,  

<span id="009">9</span> Son of man, hath not the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), the rebellious house, said unto thee,
What doest thou?  

<span id="010">10</span> Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
This [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) concerneth the
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),
and all the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) that are among
them.  

<span id="011">11</span> Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so
shall it be done unto them: they shall remove and go into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002).  

<span id="012">12</span> And the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) that is
among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight, and shall go
forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall
cover his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes.  

<span id="013">13</span> My [net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002) also will I
spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009): and I will bring him to
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall
he not see it, though he shall die there.  

<span id="014">14</span> And I will scatter toward every wind all that
are about him to help him, and all his [bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003);
and I will draw out the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) after them.  

<span id="015">15</span> And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I
shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the
countries.  

<span id="016">16</span> But I will leave a few men of them from the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), from the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000), and from the pestilence; that they may
declare all their abominations among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005) whither they come; and they shall know
that I am the LORD.  

<span id="017">17</span> Moreover the word of the LORD came to me,
saying,  

<span id="018">18</span> Son of man, eat thy
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) with quaking, and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) thy water with trembling and with
carefulness;  

<span id="019">19</span> And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith
the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),
and of the land of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); They shall eat their
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) with carefulness, and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) their water with astonishment, that her
land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence
of all them that dwell therein.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid
waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the
LORD.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="022">22</span> Son of man, what is that
[proverb](../ebd/ebd301.htm#002) that ye have in the land of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saying, The days are prolonged, and
every [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000) faileth?  

<span id="023">23</span> Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I
will make this [proverb](../ebd/ebd301.htm#002) to cease, and they shall
no more use it as a [proverb](../ebd/ebd301.htm#002) in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); but say unto them, The days are at
hand, and the effect of every [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000).  

<span id="024">24</span> For there shall be no more any vain
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000) nor flattering
[divination](../ebd/ebd104.htm#009) within the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="025">25</span> For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word
that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged:
for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will
perform it, saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="026">26</span> Again the word of the LORD came to me,
saying.  

<span id="027">27</span> Son of man, behold, they of the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) say, The [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000)
that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times
that are far off.  

<span id="028">28</span> Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord
GOD; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word
which I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.
