<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 32</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Then was kindled the wrath of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#008">Elihu</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd044.htm#003">Barachel</A> the Buzite, of the kindred of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">Ram</A>: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#008">Elihu</A> had waited till Job had spoken, because they were <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#008">elder</A> than he.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#008">Elihu</A> saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#008">Elihu</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd044.htm#003">Barachel</A> the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But there is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> in man: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#006">inspiration</A> of the Almighty giveth them understanding.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Great men are not always <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>: neither do the aged understand judgment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Behold, I waited for your words; I gave <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For I am full of matter, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> within me constraineth me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Behold, my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A> is as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.<BR>
