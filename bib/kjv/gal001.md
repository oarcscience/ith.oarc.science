### King James Version: Galatians Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md), an
[apostle](../ebd/ebd026.htm#008.md), (not of men, neither by man, but by
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), and God
the Father, who raised him from the dead;)  

<span id="002">2</span> And all the brethren which are with me, unto the
churches of [Galatia](../ebd/ebd141.htm#004.md):  

<span id="003">3</span> [Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) be to you and
peace from God the Father, and from our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md),  

<span id="004">4</span> Who gave himself for our sins, that he might
deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God
and our Father:  

<span id="005">5</span> To whom be [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) for
ever and ever. [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him
that called you into the [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) unto another
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md):  

<span id="007">7</span> Which is not another; but there be some that
trouble you, and would pervert the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> But though we, or an
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md),
preach any other [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) unto you than that
which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.  

<span id="009">9</span> As we said before, so say I now again, if any
man preach any other [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) unto you than that
ye have received, let him be accursed.  

<span id="010">10</span> For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek
to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> But I certify you, brethren, that the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) which was preached of me is not after
man.  

<span id="012">12</span> For I neither received it of man, neither was I
taught it, but by the [revelation](../ebd/ebd312.htm#002.md) of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> For ye have heard of my
[conversation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#001.md) in time past in the Jews'
religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and
wasted it:  

<span id="014">14</span> And profited in the Jews' religion above many
my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the
traditions of my fathers.  

<span id="015">15</span> But when it pleased God, who separated me from
my mother's womb, and called me by his [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md),  

<span id="016">16</span> To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach
him among the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md); immediately I conferred
not with [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) and
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md):  

<span id="017">17</span> Neither went I up to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) to them which were apostles before
me; but I went into [Arabia](../ebd/ebd027.htm#009.md), and returned again
unto [Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> Then after three years I went up to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) to see
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md), and abode with him fifteen days.  

<span id="019">19</span> But other of the apostles saw I none, save
[James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md) the Lord's brother.  

<span id="020">20</span> Now the things which I write unto you, behold,
before God, I lie not.  

<span id="021">21</span> Afterwards I came into the regions of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002) and [Cilicia](../ebd/ebd083.htm#003.md);  

<span id="022">22</span> And was unknown by face unto the churches of
Judaea which were in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md):  

<span id="023">23</span> But they had heard only, That he which
persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he
destroyed.  

<span id="024">24</span> And they glorified God in me.
