### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 36

<span id="001">1</span> Then the people of the land took
[Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006.md) the son of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008.md), and made him
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) in his father's stead in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> [Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006.md) was twenty and
three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) put him down at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and condemned the land in an hundred
talents of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) and a
[talent](../ebd/ebd357.htm#009) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) made [Eliakim](../ebd/ebd116.htm#000.md) his
brother [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md),
and turned his name to [Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001.md). And Necho
took [Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006.md) his brother, and carried him to
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> [Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001.md) was twenty
and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years
in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): and he did that which was evil in
the sight of the LORD his God.  

<span id="006">6</span> Against him came up
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), and bound him in fetters, to carry him
to [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) also
carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), and put them in his
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) at [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001.md), and his abominations which he did,
and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of
the kings of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) and
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007): and [Jehoiachin](../ebd/ebd201.htm#000.md)
his son reigned in his stead.  

<span id="009">9</span> [Jehoiachin](../ebd/ebd201.htm#000.md) was eight
years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten
days in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): and he did that which was
evil in the sight of the LORD.  

<span id="010">10</span> And when the year was expired,
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md)
sent, and brought him to [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), with the
goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008.md) his brother
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008.md) was one and
twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of
the LORD his God, and humbled not himself before
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md)
speaking from the mouth of the LORD.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he also rebelled against
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md),
who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md), and hardened his heart from turning unto
the LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the
people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md); and polluted the house of the LORD
which he had hallowed in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them
by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had
compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:  

<span id="016">16</span> But they mocked the messengers of God, and
despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the
LORD arose against his people, till there was no remedy.  

<span id="017">17</span> Therefore he brought upon them the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the [Chaldees](../ebd/ebd076.htm#002.md),
who slew their young men with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) in the
house of their [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md), and had no compassion
upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave
them all into his hand.  

<span id="018">18</span> And all the vessels of the house of God, great
and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures
of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and of his princes; all these he
brought to [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And they burnt the house of God, and brake down
the wall of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and burnt all the
palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels
thereof.  

<span id="020">20</span> And them that had escaped from the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) carried he away to
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md); where they were servants to him and
his sons until the reign of the kingdom of
[Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009.md):  

<span id="021">21</span> To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md), until the land had enjoyed her
sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md), to fulfil threescore and ten years.  

<span id="022">22</span> Now in the first year of
[Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009.md), that the word of the LORD spoken by the
mouth of [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md) might be accomplished, the
LORD stirred up the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of
[Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009.md), that he made a proclamation throughout
all his kingdom, and put it also in [writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005.md),
saying,  

<span id="023">23</span> Thus saith [Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009.md), All
the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) given me; and he hath charged me to
build him an house in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), which is in
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md). Who is there among you of all his
people? The LORD his God be with him, and let him go up.
