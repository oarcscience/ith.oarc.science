</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>, while there is none to deliver.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A>. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#008">Selah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Arise, O LORD, in thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;So shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The LORD shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> the people: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> me, O LORD, according to my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, and according to mine integrity that is in me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#001">reins</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;If he turn not, he will whet his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>; he hath bent his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A>, and made it ready.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</A> against the persecutors.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;He made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;I will praise the LORD according to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.<BR>
