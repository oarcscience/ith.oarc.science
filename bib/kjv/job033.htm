<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 33</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;I am <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A> without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;In a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> of the night, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A> sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;He keepeth back his soul from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>, and his life from perishing by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;So that his life abhorreth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, and his soul dainty meat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;His <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Yea, his soul draweth near unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A>, and his life to the destroyers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;If there be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</A> with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>: I have found a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd307.htm#005">ransom</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;His <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;He will deliver his soul from going into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>, and his life shall see the light.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;To bring back his soul from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>, to be enlightened with the light of the living.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.<BR>
