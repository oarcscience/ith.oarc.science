### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 23

<span id="001">1</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) sent, and
they gathered unto him all the elders of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)
and of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) went up
into the house of the LORD, and all the men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and all the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) with him, and the priests, and the
prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their
ears all the words of the book of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008)
which was found in the house of the LORD.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) stood by a
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007), and made a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) before the LORD, to walk after the
LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes
with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) that were written in this book. And
all the people stood to the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008).  

<span id="004">4</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) commanded
[Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006) the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and the priests of the second order,
and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of the LORD all the vessels that were
made for [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004), and for the
[grove](../ebd/ebd155.htm#008), and for all the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006): and he
burned them without [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) in the fields of
[Kidron](../ebd/ebd218.htm#008), and carried the
[ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000) of them unto
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006).  

<span id="005">5</span> And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the
kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) had ordained to burn
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) in the high places in the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and in the places round about
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005); them also that burned
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) unto [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004), to
the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), and to the
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004), and to the planets, and to all the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="006">6</span> And he brought out the
[grove](../ebd/ebd155.htm#008) from the house of the LORD, without
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), unto the
[brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006) [Kidron](../ebd/ebd218.htm#008), and
burned it at the [brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006)
[Kidron](../ebd/ebd218.htm#008), and stamped it small to powder, and
cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he brake down the houses of the
[sodomites](../ebd/ebd347.htm#006), that were by the house of the LORD,
where the women wove hangings for the [grove](../ebd/ebd155.htm#008).  

<span id="008">8</span> And he brought all the priests out of the cities
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and defiled the high places where the
priests had burned [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002), from
[Geba](../ebd/ebd144.htm#004) to [Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008), and
brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of
the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) the
governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the city.  

<span id="009">9</span> Nevertheless the priests of the high places came
not up to the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of the LORD in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), but they did eat of the unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) among their brethren.  

<span id="010">10</span> And he defiled Topheth, which is in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of the children of
[Hinnom](../ebd/ebd179.htm#002), that no man might make his son or his
daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.  

<span id="011">11</span> And he took away the horses that the kings of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) had given to the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), at the entering in of the house of the
LORD, by the [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003) of Nathanmelech the
[chamberlain](../ebd/ebd076.htm#005), which was in the
[suburbs](../ebd/ebd352.htm#007), and burned the chariots of the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) with fire.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the altars that were on the top of the
upper [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003) of [Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005),
which the kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) had made, and the
altars which [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) had made in the two
courts of the house of the LORD, did the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
beat down, and brake them down from thence, and cast the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) of them into the
[brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006) [Kidron](../ebd/ebd218.htm#008).  

<span id="013">13</span> And the high places that were before
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), which were on the right hand of the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) of corruption, which
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) had builded for
[Ashtoreth](../ebd/ebd034.htm#006) the
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) of the Zidonians, and for
[Chemosh](../ebd/ebd078.htm#007) the
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) of the Moabites, and for Milcom the
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) of the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002), did the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
defile.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he brake in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002)
the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the
bones of men.  

<span id="015">15</span> Moreover the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006)
that was at [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006), and the high place which
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) the son of
[Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003), who made [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), had made, both that
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) and the high place he brake down, and
burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the
[grove](../ebd/ebd155.htm#008).  

<span id="016">16</span> And as [Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) turned
himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007), and sent, and took the bones out of the
sepulchres, and burned them upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), and
polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God
proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then he said, What title is that that I see?
And the men of the city told him, It is the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001) of the man of God, which came from
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and proclaimed these things that thou
hast done against the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006).  

<span id="018">18</span> And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his
bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) that came out of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004).  

<span id="019">19</span> And all the houses also of the high places that
were in the cities of [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004), which the kings
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) had made to provoke the Lord to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), [Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) took
away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006).  

<span id="020">20</span> And he slew all the priests of the high places
that were there upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them, and
returned to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="021">21</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) commanded
all the people, saying, Keep the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005) unto
the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008).  

<span id="022">22</span> Surely there was not holden such a
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005) from the days of the judges that
judged [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), nor in all the days of the kings
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), nor of the kings of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007);  

<span id="023">23</span> But in the eighteenth year of
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008), wherein
this [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005) was holden to the LORD in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="024">24</span> Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and
the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations
that were spied in the land of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), did [Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008)
put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written
in the book that [Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) found in the house of the LORD.  

<span id="025">25</span> And like unto him was there no
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) before him, that turned to the LORD with
all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according
to all the law of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003); neither after him
arose there any like him.  

<span id="026">26</span> Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the
fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) was kindled against
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), because of all the provocations that
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) had provoked him withal.  

<span id="027">27</span> And the LORD said, I will remove
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) also out of my sight, as I have removed
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and will cast off this city
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) which I have
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008), and the house of which I said, My name
shall be there.  

<span id="028">28</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008), and all that he did, are they not
written in the book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003) of the
kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)?  

<span id="029">29</span> In his days Pharaohnechoh
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) went up
against the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) to the river
[Euphrates](../ebd/ebd127.htm#001): and [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) went against him; and he slew him at
[Megiddo](../ebd/ebd246.htm#004), when he had seen him.  

<span id="030">30</span> And his servants carried him in a
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) dead from
[Megiddo](../ebd/ebd246.htm#004), and brought him to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and buried him in his own
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001). And the people of the land took
[Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006) the son of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008), and anointed him, and made him
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) in his father's stead.  

<span id="031">31</span> [Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006) was twenty
and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months
in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005). And his mother's name was
[Hamutal](../ebd/ebd161.htm#009), the daughter of
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) of [Libnah](../ebd/ebd228.htm#004).  

<span id="032">32</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of
the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.  

<span id="033">33</span> And Pharaohnechoh put him in
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003) at [Riblah](../ebd/ebd313.htm#002) in the
land of [Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005), that he might not reign in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005); and put the land to a
[tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006) of an hundred talents of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and a [talent](../ebd/ebd357.htm#009)
of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="034">34</span> And Pharaohnechoh made
[Eliakim](../ebd/ebd116.htm#000) the son of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) in the
room of [Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) his father, and turned his name
to [Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001), and took
[Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006) away: and he came to
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and died there.  

<span id="035">35</span> And [Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) gave the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) to
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005); but he taxed the land to give the
money according to the commandment of [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005):
he exacted the [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and the
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) of the people of the land, of every one
according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaohnechoh.  

<span id="036">36</span> [Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) was twenty
and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years
in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005). And his mother's name was
[Zebudah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#000), the daughter of
[Pedaiah](../ebd/ebd288.htm#001) of [Rumah](../ebd/ebd316.htm#006).  

<span id="037">37</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of
the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.
