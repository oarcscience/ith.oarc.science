### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 54

<span id="001">1</span> Sing, O [barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007.md), thou
that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that
didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate
than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD.  

<span id="002">2</span> Enlarge the place of thy
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md), and let them stretch forth the curtains
of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy
stakes;  

<span id="003">3</span> For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and
on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md), and make the desolate cities to be
inhabited.  

<span id="004">4</span> Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither
be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt
forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of
thy widowhood any more.  

<span id="005">5</span> For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of
hosts is his name; and thy [Redeemer](../ebd/ebd308.htm#008.md) the Holy
One of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); The God of the whole earth shall
he be called.  

<span id="006">6</span> For the LORD hath called thee as a woman
forsaken and grieved in [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), and a wife of
youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.  

<span id="007">7</span> For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but
with great mercies will I gather thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a
moment; but with [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) kindness will I
have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) on thee, saith the LORD thy
[Redeemer](../ebd/ebd308.htm#008.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> For this is as the waters of
[Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002.md) unto me: for as I have sworn that the
waters of [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002.md) should no more go over the
earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke
thee.  

<span id="010">10</span> For the mountains shall depart, and the hills
be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall
the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of my peace be removed, saith the
LORD that hath [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) on thee.  

<span id="011">11</span> O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not
comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy
foundations with sapphires.  

<span id="012">12</span> And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy
gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.  

<span id="013">13</span> And all thy children shall be taught of the
LORD; and great shall be the peace of thy children.  

<span id="014">14</span> In [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) shalt
thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt
not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.  

<span id="015">15</span> Behold, they shall surely gather together, but
not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for
thy sake.  

<span id="016">16</span> Behold, I have created the
[smith](../ebd/ebd346.htm#006.md) that bloweth the coals in the fire, and
that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the
waster to destroy.  

<span id="017">17</span> No weapon that is formed against thee shall
prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou
shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and
their [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) is of me, saith the LORD.
