</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</A> his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</A>; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</A> went with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> went up; and the LORD delivered the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd290.htm#006">Perizzites</A> into their hand: and they slew of them in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd058.htm#000">Bezek</A> ten thousand men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And they found <A HREF="../ebd/ebd009.htm#005">Adonibezek</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd058.htm#000">Bezek</A>: and they fought against him, and they slew the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd290.htm#006">Perizzites</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd009.htm#005">Adonibezek</A> fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd009.htm#005">Adonibezek</A> said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and there he died.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Now the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> had fought against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and set the city on fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And afterward the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> went down to fight against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</A>, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#003">Othniel</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd217.htm#003">Kenaz</A>, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd007.htm#001">Achsah</A> his daughter to wife.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A>; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#003">Caleb</A> said unto her, What wilt thou?<BR>

<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#003">Caleb</A> gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, which lieth in the south of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd028.htm#000">Arad</A>; and they went and dwelt among the people.<BR>

And the name of the city was called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#002">Hormah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Also <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd144.htm#003">Gaza</A> with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#001">Ekron</A> with the coast thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the LORD was with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A>, because they had chariots of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And they gave <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#003">Caleb</A>, as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> said: and he expelled thence the three sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd022.htm#005">Anak</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> sent to descry <A HREF="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</A>. (Now the name of the city before was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd233.htm#006">Luz</A>.)<BR>

<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#007">spies</A> saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>; but they let go the man and all his family.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And the man went into the land of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#006">Hittites</A>, and built a city, and called the name thereof <A HREF="../ebd/ebd233.htm#006">Luz</A>: which is the name thereof unto this day.<BR>
