### King James Version: Nehemiah Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> And all the people gathered themselves together
as one man into the street that was before the water
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008); and they spake unto
[Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006) the scribe to bring the book of the law of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), which the LORD had commanded to
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) brought the law before the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) both of men and women, and all
that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh
month.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he read therein before the street that was
before the water [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) from the morning until
midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand;
and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the
law.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006) the scribe
stood upon a [pulpit](../ebd/ebd302.htm#003) of
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), which they had made for the purpose; and
beside him stood [Mattithiah](../ebd/ebd244.htm#006), and
[Shema](../ebd/ebd334.htm#003), and Anaiah, and
[Urijah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#004), and [Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006),
and [Maaseiah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#007), on his right hand; and on his
left hand, [Pedaiah](../ebd/ebd288.htm#001), and
[Mishael](../ebd/ebd256.htm#006), and [Malchiah](../ebd/ebd239.htm#001),
and [Hashum](../ebd/ebd166.htm#007), and
[Hashbadana](../ebd/ebd166.htm#003), [Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006),
and [Meshullam](../ebd/ebd251.htm#001).  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006) opened the
book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;)
and when he opened it, all the people stood up:  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006) blessed the
LORD, the great God. And all the people answered,
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001), [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001), with
lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the
LORD with their faces to the ground.  

<span id="007">7</span> Also [Jeshua](../ebd/ebd205.htm#003), and
[Bani](../ebd/ebd043.htm#004), and [Sherebiah](../ebd/ebd335.htm#007),
Jamin, [Akkub](../ebd/ebd016.htm#003),
[Shabbethai](../ebd/ebd330.htm#000), [Hodijah](../ebd/ebd180.htm#002),
[Maaseiah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#007), [Kelita](../ebd/ebd217.htm#000),
[Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005), [Jozabad](../ebd/ebd212.htm#002),
[Hanan](../ebd/ebd162.htm#001), [Pelaiah](../ebd/ebd288.htm#005), and
the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people
stood in their place.  

<span id="008">8</span> So they read in the book in the law of God
distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the
reading.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Nehemiah](../ebd/ebd269.htm#007), which is
the [Tirshatha](../ebd/ebd368.htm#001), and
[Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) the
scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the
people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God;
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004) not, nor weep. For all the people wept,
when they heard the words of the law.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005), and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) the
sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for
this day is holy unto our LORD: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the
LORD is your strength.  

<span id="011">11</span> So the Levites stilled all the people, saying,
Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.  

<span id="012">12</span> And all the people went their way to eat, and
to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), and to send portions, and to make
great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared
unto them.  

<span id="013">13</span> And on the second day were gathered together
the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the
Levites, unto [Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006) the scribe, even to
understand the words of the law.  

<span id="014">14</span> And they found written in the law which the
LORD had commanded by [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), that the children
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) should dwell in booths in the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of the seventh month:  

<span id="015">15</span> And that they should publish and proclaim in
all their cities, and in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), saying, Go
forth unto the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007), and fetch
[olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009) branches, and pine branches, and
[myrtle](../ebd/ebd263.htm#004) branches, and palm branches, and
branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.  

<span id="016">16</span> So the people went forth, and brought them, and
made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in
their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street
of the water [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), and in the street of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000).  

<span id="017">17</span> And all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of them that were come again out
of the [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) made booths, and sat under the
booths: for since the days of [Jeshua](../ebd/ebd205.htm#003) the son of
[Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006) unto that day had not the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) done so. And there was very great
gladness.  

<span id="018">18</span> Also day by day, from the first day unto the
last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days; and
on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.
