### King James Version: Titus Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), a servant of God,
and an [apostle](../ebd/ebd026.htm#008) of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000),
according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the
truth which is after [godliness](../ebd/ebd151.htm#007);  

<span id="002">2</span> In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot
lie, promised before the world began;  

<span id="003">3</span> But hath in due times manifested his word
through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the
commandment of God our [Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003);  

<span id="004">4</span> To [Titus](../ebd/ebd368.htm#007), mine own son
after the common faith: [Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000),
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005), and peace, from God the Father and the
Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) our
[Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003).  

<span id="005">5</span> For this cause left I thee in
[Crete](../ebd/ebd092.htm#006), that thou shouldest set in order the
things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had
appointed thee:  

<span id="006">6</span> If any be blameless, the husband of one wife,
having [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) children not accused of riot or
unruly.  

<span id="007">7</span> For a [bishop](../ebd/ebd059.htm#005) must be
blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not
given to [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), no striker, not given to filthy
[lucre](../ebd/ebd232.htm#008);  

<span id="008">8</span> But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men,
sober, just, holy, temperate;  

<span id="009">9</span> Holding [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) the
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) word as he hath been taught, that he
may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the
gainsayers.  

<span id="010">10</span> For there are many unruly and vain talkers and
deceivers, specially they of the
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007):  

<span id="011">11</span> Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole
houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.  

<span id="012">12</span> One of themselves, even a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) of their own, said, The Cretians are
alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.  

<span id="013">13</span> This [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) is true.
Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;  

<span id="014">14</span> Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and
commandments of men, that turn from the truth.  

<span id="015">15</span> Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto
them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their
mind and [conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006) is defiled.  

<span id="016">16</span> They profess that they know God; but in works
they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good
work [reprobate](../ebd/ebd311.htm#003).
