### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 125

<span id="001">1</span> They that trust in the LORD shall be as
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), which
cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.  

<span id="002">2</span> As the mountains are round about
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), so the LORD is round about his
people from henceforth even for ever.  

<span id="003">3</span> For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon
the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto
iniquity.  

<span id="004">4</span> Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to
them that are upright in their hearts.  

<span id="005">5</span> As for such as turn aside unto their crooked
ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but
peace shall be upon [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).
