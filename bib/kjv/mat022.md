### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered and
spake unto them again by parables, and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> The kingdom of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006)
is like unto a certain [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), which made a
marriage for his son,  

<span id="003">3</span> And sent forth his servants to call them that
were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.  

<span id="004">4</span> Again, he sent forth other servants, saying,
Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen
and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the
marriage.  

<span id="005">5</span> But they made light of it, and went their ways,
one to his farm, another to his merchandise:  

<span id="006">6</span> And the remnant took his servants, and entreated
them spitefully, and slew them.  

<span id="007">7</span> But when the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) heard
thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those
murderers, and burned up their city.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is
ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.  

<span id="009">9</span> Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many
as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.  

<span id="010">10</span> So those servants went out into the highways,
and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and
the wedding was furnished with guests.  

<span id="011">11</span> And when the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) came
in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding
garment:  

<span id="012">12</span> And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou
in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then said the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) to
the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him
into outer [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008), there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.  

<span id="014">14</span> For many are called, but few are
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008).  

<span id="015">15</span> Then went the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008), and took counsel how they might
entangle him in his talk.  

<span id="016">16</span> And they sent out unto him their disciples with
the [Herodians](../ebd/ebd176.htm#005), saying, Master, we know that
thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou
for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.  

<span id="017">17</span> Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it
lawful to give [tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006) unto
[Caesar](../ebd/ebd068.htm#002), or not?  

<span id="018">18</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) perceived
their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?  

<span id="019">19</span> Shew me the [tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006)
money. And they brought unto him a [penny](../ebd/ebd289.htm#002).  

<span id="020">20</span> And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and
superscription?  

<span id="021">21</span> They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto
them, Render therefore unto [Caesar](../ebd/ebd068.htm#002) the things
which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.  

<span id="022">22</span> When they had heard these words, they
marvelled, and left him, and went their way.  

<span id="023">23</span> The same day came to him the
[Sadducees](../ebd/ebd318.htm#003), which say that there is no
resurrection, and asked him,  

<span id="024">24</span> Saying, Master, [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003)
said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his
wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.  

<span id="025">25</span> Now there were with us
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) brethren: and the first, when he had
married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his
brother:  

<span id="026">26</span> Likewise the second also, and the third, unto
the seventh.  

<span id="027">27</span> And last of all the woman died also.  

<span id="028">28</span> Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall
she be of the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)? for they all had her.  

<span id="029">29</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered and
said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of
God.  

<span id="030">30</span> For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor
are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="031">31</span> But as touching the resurrection of the dead,
have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,  

<span id="032">32</span> I am the God of
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), and the God of
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006), and the God of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007)? God is not the God of the dead, but of
the living.  

<span id="033">33</span> And when the multitude heard this, they were
astonished at his doctrine.  

<span id="034">34</span> But when the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008)
had heard that he had put the [Sadducees](../ebd/ebd318.htm#003) to
silence, they were gathered together.  

<span id="035">35</span> Then one of them, which was a
[lawyer](../ebd/ebd225.htm#002), asked him a question, tempting him, and
saying,  

<span id="036">36</span> Master, which is the great commandment in the
law?  

<span id="037">37</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto him,
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
soul, and with all thy mind.  

<span id="038">38</span> This is the first and great commandment.  

<span id="039">39</span> And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love
thy neighbour as thyself.  

<span id="040">40</span> On these two commandments hang all the law and
the prophets.  

<span id="041">41</span> While the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008)
were gathered together, [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) asked them,  

<span id="042">42</span> Saying, What think ye of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)? whose son is he? They say unto him, The
son of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="043">43</span> He saith unto them, How then doth
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) in [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) call
him Lord, saying,  

<span id="044">44</span> The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my
right hand, till I make thine enemies thy
[footstool](../ebd/ebd136.htm#009)?  

<span id="045">45</span> If [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) then call him
Lord, how is he his son?  

<span id="046">46</span> And no man was able to answer him a word,
neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.
