### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> So [Abijah](../ebd/ebd003.htm#006.md) slept with
his fathers, and they buried him in the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004): and [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md) his son
reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md) did that which
was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:  

<span id="003">3</span> For he took away the altars of the strange gods,
and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the
groves:  

<span id="004">4</span> And commanded [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) to
seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the
commandment.  

<span id="005">5</span> Also he took away out of all the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) the high places and the images: and the
kingdom was quiet before him.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he built fenced cities in
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md): for the land had rest, and he had no war
in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore he said unto
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), Let us build these cities, and make
about them walls, and [towers](../ebd/ebd371.htm#002.md), gates, and bars,
while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our
God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So
they built and prospered.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md) had an army of
men that bare targets and spears, out of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)
three hundred thousand; and out of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md),
that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all
these were mighty men of valour.  

<span id="009">9</span> And there came out against them
[Zerah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#001.md) the Ethiopian with an
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of a thousand thousand, and three hundred
chariots; and came unto [Mareshah](../ebd/ebd241.htm#009.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> Then [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md) went out
against him, and they set the battle in array in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [Zephathah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#000.md) at
[Mareshah](../ebd/ebd241.htm#009.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md) cried unto the
LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether
with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for
we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD,
thou art our God; let no man prevail against thee.  

<span id="012">12</span> So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000), and before [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md);
and the Ethiopians fled.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md) and the people
that were with him pursued them unto [Gerar](../ebd/ebd146.htm#005.md): and
the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves;
for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md); and they carried away very much spoil.  

<span id="014">14</span> And they smote all the cities round about
[Gerar](../ebd/ebd146.htm#005.md); for the fear of the LORD came upon them:
and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in
them.  

<span id="015">15</span> They smote also the tents of
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), and carried away
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) and camels in abundance, and returned to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).
