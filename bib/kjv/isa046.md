### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 46

<span id="001">1</span> [Bel](../ebd/ebd051.htm#005) boweth down,
[Nebo](../ebd/ebd268.htm#004) stoopeth, their idols were upon the
beasts, and upon the [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002): your carriages
were heavy loaden; they are a [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) to the
weary [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001).  

<span id="002">2</span> They stoop, they [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003)
down together; they could not deliver the
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007), but themselves are gone into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002).  

<span id="003">3</span> Hearken unto me, O house of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), and all the remnant of the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which are borne by me from the
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000), which are carried from the womb:  

<span id="004">4</span> And even to your old age I am he; and even to
hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will
carry, and will deliver you.  

<span id="005">5</span> To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and
compare me, that we may be like?  

<span id="006">6</span> They lavish [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) out of
the [bag](../ebd/ebd041.htm#008), and weigh
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) in the [balance](../ebd/ebd042.htm#007),
and hire a [goldsmith](../ebd/ebd152.htm#003); and he maketh it a god:
they fall down, yea, they [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002).  

<span id="007">7</span> They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him,
and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not
remove: yea, one shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him
out of his trouble.  

<span id="008">8</span> Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it
again to mind, O ye transgressors.  

<span id="009">9</span> Remember the former things of old: for I am God,
and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me,  

<span id="010">10</span> Declaring the end from the beginning, and from
ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall
stand, and I will do all my pleasure:  

<span id="011">11</span> [Calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007) a ravenous
[bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000) from the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000),
the man that executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken
it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do
it.  

<span id="012">12</span> Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far
from [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004):  

<span id="013">13</span> I bring near my
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004); it shall not be far off, and my
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) shall not tarry: and I will place
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) in [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002) for
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) my [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006).
