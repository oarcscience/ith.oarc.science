### King James Version: Zechariah Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> In that day there shall be a
[fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md) opened to the house of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) and to the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) for [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) and
for uncleanness.  

<span id="002">2</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the
LORD of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the
land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the
prophets and the unclean [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) to pass out of
the land.  

<span id="003">3</span> And it shall come to pass, that when any shall
yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say
unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the
LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him
through when he prophesieth.  

<span id="004">4</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the
prophets shall be ashamed every one of his
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md), when he hath prophesied; neither shall
they wear a rough garment to deceive:  

<span id="005">5</span> But he shall say, I am no
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md), I am an
[husbandman](../ebd/ebd185.htm#002.md); for man taught me to keep
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) from my youth.  

<span id="006">6</span> And one shall say unto him, What are these
wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was
wounded in the house of my friends.  

<span id="007">7</span> Awake, O [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), against
my [shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006.md), and against the man that is my
fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006.md), and the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) shall be scattered: and I will turn mine
hand upon the little ones.  

<span id="008">8</span> And it shall come to pass, that in all the land,
saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the
third shall be left therein.  

<span id="009">9</span> And I will bring the third part through the
fire, and will refine them as [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) is
refined, and will try them as [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) is tried:
they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my
people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God.
