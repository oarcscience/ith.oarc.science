### King James Version: Judges Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> Then all the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) went out, and the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) was gathered together as one man,
from [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009) even to
[Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008), with the land of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009), unto the LORD in Mizpeh.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the chief of all the people, even of all the
tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), presented themselves in the
assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="003">3</span> (Now the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) heard that the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Tell us, how was this
wickedness?  

<span id="004">4</span> And the [Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009), the
husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into
[Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008) that belongeth to
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008), I and my
[concubine](../ebd/ebd087.htm#007), to [lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the men of [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008)
rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, and
thought to have slain me: and my [concubine](../ebd/ebd087.htm#007) have
they forced, that she is dead.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I took my
[concubine](../ebd/ebd087.htm#007), and cut her in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002), and sent her throughout all the country
of the inheritance of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): for they have
committed [lewdness](../ebd/ebd228.htm#002) and folly in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="007">7</span> Behold, ye are all children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); give here your advice and counsel.  

<span id="008">8</span> And all the people arose as one man, saying, We
will not any of us go to his [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009), neither will
we any of us turn into his house.  

<span id="009">9</span> But now this shall be the thing which we will do
to [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008); we will go up by lot against it;  

<span id="010">10</span> And we will take ten men of an hundred
throughout all the tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and an
hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch
victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to
[Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008) of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008),
according to all the folly that they have wrought in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="011">11</span> So all the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) were gathered against the city, knit
together as one man.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the tribes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) sent men through all the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008),
saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?  

<span id="013">13</span> Now therefore deliver us the men, the children
of [Belial](../ebd/ebd051.htm#007), which are in
[Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008), that we may put them to death, and put
away evil from [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000). But the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) would not hearken to the voice of
their brethren the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="014">14</span> But the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) gathered themselves together out of
the cities unto [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008), to go out to battle
against the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="015">15</span> And the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) were numbered at that time out of the
cities twenty and six thousand men that drew
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), beside the inhabitants of
[Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008), which were numbered
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) hundred [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008)
men.  

<span id="016">16</span> Among all this people there were
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) hundred [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008)
men lefthanded; every one could [sling](../ebd/ebd346.htm#005) stones at
an hair breadth, and not miss.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),
beside [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008), were numbered four hundred
thousand men that drew [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003): all these were
men of war.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) arose, and went up to the house of God,
and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the
battle against the children of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008)? And
the LORD said, [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) shall go up first.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) rose up in the morning, and encamped
against [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008).  

<span id="020">20</span> And the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
went out to battle against [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008); and the
men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) put themselves in array to fight
against them at [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008).  

<span id="021">21</span> And the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) came forth out of
[Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008), and destroyed down to the ground of the
Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the people the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) encouraged themselves, and set their
battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array
the first day.  

<span id="023">23</span> (And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) went up and wept before the LORD until
even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to
battle against the children of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) my
brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)  

<span id="024">24</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) came near against the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) the second day.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) went
forth against them out of [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008) the second
day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) again eighteen thousand men; all these
drew the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="026">26</span> Then all the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and all the people, went up, and came
unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and
fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace
offerings before the LORD.  

<span id="027">27</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) enquired of the LORD, (for the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of
God was there in those days,  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Phinehas](../ebd/ebd294.htm#003), the son
of [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000), the son of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), stood before it in those days,) saying,
Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) my brother, or shall I cease? And the
LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) set liers
in wait round about [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008).  

<span id="030">30</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) went up against the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) on the third day, and put themselves
in array against [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008), as at other times.  

<span id="031">31</span> And the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) went out against the people, and were
drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and
kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the
house of God, and the other to [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008) in the
field, about thirty men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="032">32</span> And the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) said, They are smitten down before us,
as at the first. But the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.  

<span id="033">33</span> And all the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) rose up out of their place, and put
themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) came forth out of their places, even out
of the meadows of [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008).  

<span id="034">34</span> And there came against
[Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008) ten thousand
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) men out of all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and the battle was sore: but they knew
not that evil was near them.  

<span id="035">35</span> And the LORD smote
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) before
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) destroyed of the Benjamites that day
twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="036">36</span> So the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) saw that they were smitten: for the
men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) gave place to the Benjamites,
because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside
[Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008).  

<span id="037">37</span> And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon
[Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008); and the liers in wait drew themselves
along, and smote all the city with the edge of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="038">38</span> Now there was an appointed sign between the men
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and the liers in wait, that they
should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.  

<span id="039">39</span> And when the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) retired in the battle,
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) began to smite and kill of the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) about thirty persons: for they said,
Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.  

<span id="040">40</span> But when the flame began to arise up out of the
city with a [pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007) of smoke, the Benjamites
looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="041">41</span> And when the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) turned again, the men of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) were amazed: for they saw that evil
was come upon them.  

<span id="042">42</span> Therefore they turned their backs before the
men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) unto the way of the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005); but the battle overtook them; and
them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.  

<span id="043">43</span> Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about,
and chased them, and trode them down with ease over against
[Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008) toward the sunrising.  

<span id="044">44</span> And there fell of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) eighteen thousand men; all these were
men of valour.  

<span id="045">45</span> And they turned and fled toward the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) unto the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) of [Rimmon](../ebd/ebd313.htm#005): and
they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard
after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.  

<span id="046">46</span> So that all which fell that day of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) were twenty and five thousand men that
drew the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003); all these were men of valour.  

<span id="047">47</span> But six hundred men turned and fled to the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) unto the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) [Rimmon](../ebd/ebd313.htm#005), and abode
in the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) [Rimmon](../ebd/ebd313.htm#005)
four months.  

<span id="048">48</span> And the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
turned again upon the children of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008), and
smote them with the edge of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), as well
the men of every city, as the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), and all
that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came
to.
