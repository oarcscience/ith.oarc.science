<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Daniel Chapter 8</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;In the third year of the reign of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#001">Belshazzar</A> a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> appeared unto me, even unto me <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, after that which appeared unto me at the first.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And I saw in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd342.htm#003">Shushan</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A>, which is in the province of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#003">Elam</A>; and I saw in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>, and I was by the river of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd374.htm#004">Ulai</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</A> which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;I saw the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</A> pushing <A HREF="../ebd/ebd380.htm#008">westward</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd275.htm#002">northward</A>, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And as I was considering, behold, an he <A HREF="../ebd/ebd151.htm#001">goat</A> came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd151.htm#001">goat</A> had a notable <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</A> between his eyes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he came to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</A> that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A> of his power.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And I saw him come close unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</A>, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</A>, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</A> to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</A> out of his hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Therefore the he <A HREF="../ebd/ebd151.htm#001">goat</A> waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</A> was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And out of one of them came forth a little <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</A>, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A>, and toward the pleasant land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And it waxed great, even to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>; and it cast down some of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</A> to the ground, and stamped upon them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Yea, he magnified himself even to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>, and by him the daily <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> was taken away, and the place of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A> was cast down.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> was given him against the daily <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> concerning the daily <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> to be trodden under foot?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A> be cleansed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when I, even I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, had seen the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And I heard a man's voice between the banks of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd374.htm#004">Ulai</A>, which called, and said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#006">Gabriel</A>, make this man to understand the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A> sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</A> which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd246.htm#001">Media</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd290.htm#009">Persia</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And the rough <A HREF="../ebd/ebd151.htm#001">goat</A> is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of Grecia: and the great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</A> that is between his eyes is the first <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">Prince</A> of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>; for it shall be for many days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>, but none understood it.<BR>
