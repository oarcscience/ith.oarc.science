### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and
came into his own city.  

<span id="002">2</span> And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of
the [palsy](../ebd/ebd283.htm#004.md), lying on a bed: and
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) seeing their faith said unto the sick of
the [palsy](../ebd/ebd283.htm#004.md); Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be
forgiven thee.  

<span id="003">3</span> And, behold, certain of the
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md) said within themselves, This man
blasphemeth.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) knowing their
thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?  

<span id="005">5</span> For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be
forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?  

<span id="006">6</span> But that ye may know that the Son of man hath
power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the
[palsy](../ebd/ebd283.htm#004),.md) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto
thine house.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he arose, and departed to his house.  

<span id="008">8</span> But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled,
and glorified God, which had given such power unto men.  

<span id="009">9</span> And as [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) passed
forth from thence, he saw a man, named [Matthew](../ebd/ebd244.htm#003.md),
[sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md) at the receipt of
[custom](../ebd/ebd094.htm#008.md): and he saith unto him, Follow me. And
he arose, and followed him.  

<span id="010">10</span> And it came to pass, as
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) sat at meat in the house, behold, many
publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.  

<span id="011">11</span> And when the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md)
saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with
publicans and sinners?  

<span id="012">12</span> But when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) heard
that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a
[physician](../ebd/ebd295.htm#000.md), but they that are sick.  

<span id="013">13</span> But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will
have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md), and not
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md): for I am not come to call the
righteous, but sinners to [repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> Then came to him the disciples of John, saying,
Why do we and the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md)
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) oft, but thy disciples
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) not?  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto
them, Can the children of the bridechamber
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004.md), as long as the bridegroom is with them?
but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them,
and then shall they [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old
garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment,
and the [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) is made worse.  

<span id="017">17</span> Neither do men put new
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) into old bottles: else the bottles break,
and the [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) runneth out, and the bottles
perish: but they put new [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) into new bottles,
and both are preserved.  

<span id="018">18</span> While he spake these things unto them, behold,
there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is
even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) arose, and
followed him, and so did his disciples.  

<span id="020">20</span> And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with
an issue of [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) twelve years, came behind
him, and touched the [hem](../ebd/ebd173.htm#008.md) of his garment:  

<span id="021">21</span> For she said within herself, If I may but touch
his garment, I shall be whole.  

<span id="022">22</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) turned him
about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy
faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that
hour.  

<span id="023">23</span> And when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) came
into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a
noise,  

<span id="024">24</span> He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is
not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.  

<span id="025">25</span> But when the people were put forth, he went in,
and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.  

<span id="026">26</span> And the fame hereof went abroad into all that
land.  

<span id="027">27</span> And when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
departed thence, two [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md) men followed him,
crying, and saying, Thou son of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), have
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) on us.  

<span id="028">28</span> And when he was come into the house, the
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md) men came to him: and
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saith unto them, Believe ye that I am
able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.  

<span id="029">29</span> Then touched he their eyes, saying, According
to your faith be it unto you.  

<span id="030">30</span> And their eyes were opened; and
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) straitly charged them, saying, See that
no man know it.  

<span id="031">31</span> But they, when they were departed, spread
abroad his fame in all that country.  

<span id="032">32</span> As they went out, behold, they brought to him a
[dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002.md) man possessed with a
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> And when the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md) was
cast out, the [dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002.md) spake: and the multitudes
marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="034">34</span> But the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md)
said, He casteth out devils through the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md)
of the devils.  

<span id="035">35</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) went about
all the cities and [villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md), teaching in their
synagogues, and preaching the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) of the
kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the
people.  

<span id="036">36</span> But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved
with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered
abroad, as [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) having no
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006.md).  

<span id="037">37</span> Then saith he unto his disciples, The
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md) truly is plenteous, but the labourers
are few;  

<span id="038">38</span> Pray ye therefore the Lord of the
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md), that he will send forth labourers into
his [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md).
