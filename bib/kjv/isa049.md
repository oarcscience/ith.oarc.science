### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 49

<span id="001">1</span> Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye
people, from far; The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the
[bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004.md) of my mother hath he made mention of my
name.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he hath made my mouth like a sharp
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003); in the [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md)
of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his
[quiver](../ebd/ebd304.htm#000.md) hath he hid me;  

<span id="003">3</span> And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), in whom I will be glorified.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have
spent my strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is
with the LORD, and my work with my God.  

<span id="005">5</span> And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the
womb to be his servant, to bring [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) again to
him, Though [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) be not gathered, yet shall I
be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he said, It is a light thing that thou
shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and to restore the preserved of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): I will also give thee for a light to
the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md), that thou mayest be my
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) unto the end of the earth.  

<span id="007">7</span> Thus saith the LORD, the
[Redeemer](../ebd/ebd308.htm#008) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation
abhorreth, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes
also shall [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md), because of the LORD that is
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md), and the Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and he shall choose thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have
I heard thee, and in a day of [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) have I
helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of the people, to establish the earth,
to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;  

<span id="009">9</span> That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth;
to them that are in [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), Shew yourselves.
They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high
places.  

<span id="010">10</span> They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall
the heat nor [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) smite them: for he that hath
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) on them shall lead them, even by the
springs of water shall he guide them.  

<span id="011">11</span> And I will make all my mountains a way, and my
highways shall be exalted.  

<span id="012">12</span> Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo,
these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of
Sinim.  

<span id="013">13</span> Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and
break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his
people, and will have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) upon his
afflicted.  

<span id="014">14</span> But [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md) said, The
LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.  

<span id="015">15</span> Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she
should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget,
yet will I not forget thee.  

<span id="016">16</span> Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my
hands; thy walls are continually before me.  

<span id="017">17</span> Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers
and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.  

<span id="018">18</span> Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all
these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the
LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament,
and bind them on thee, as a [bride](../ebd/ebd065.htm#001.md) doeth.  

<span id="019">19</span> For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the
land of thy [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md), shall even now be too
narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up
shall be far away.  

<span id="020">20</span> The children which thou shalt have, after thou
hast lost the other, shall say again in thine ears, The place is too
strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath
begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001.md), and removing to and fro? and who hath
brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they
been?  

<span id="022">22</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up
mine hand to the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md), and set up my
standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and
thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.  

<span id="023">23</span> And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and
their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) down to thee with their face toward the
earth, and lick up the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) of thy feet; and
thou shalt know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that
wait for me.  

<span id="024">24</span> Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the
lawful [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001.md) delivered?  

<span id="025">25</span> But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of
the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be
delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I
will save thy children.  

<span id="026">26</span> And I will feed them that oppress thee with
their own [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md); and they shall be drunken with
their own [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), as with sweet
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000): and all [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md)
shall know that I the LORD am thy [Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003.md) and
thy [Redeemer](../ebd/ebd308.htm#008.md), the mighty One of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md).
