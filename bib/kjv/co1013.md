### King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> Though I speak with the tongues of men and of
angels, and have not [charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009.md), I am become as
sounding [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md), or a tinkling cymbal.  

<span id="002">2</span> And though I have the
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005) of [prophecy](../ebd/ebd300.htm#007.md), and
understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all
faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not
[charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009.md), I am nothing.  

<span id="003">3</span> And though I bestow all my goods to feed the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), and though I give my body to be burned,
and have not [charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009.md), it profiteth me
nothing.  

<span id="004">4</span> [Charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009.md) suffereth long,
and is kind; [charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009.md) envieth not;
[charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009.md) vaunteth not itself, is not puffed
up,  

<span id="005">5</span> Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her
own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;  

<span id="006">6</span> Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the
truth;  

<span id="007">7</span> Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth
all things, endureth all things.  

<span id="008">8</span> [Charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009.md) never faileth:
but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be
tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish
away.  

<span id="009">9</span> For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.  

<span id="010">10</span> But when that which is perfect is come, then
that which is in part shall be done away.  

<span id="011">11</span> When I was a child, I spake as a child, I
understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I
put away childish things.  

<span id="012">12</span> For now we see through a glass, darkly; but
then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as
also I am known.  

<span id="013">13</span> And now abideth faith, hope,
[charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009.md), these three; but the greatest of these
is [charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009.md).
