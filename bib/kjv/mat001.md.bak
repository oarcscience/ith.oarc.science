about the time they were carried away to

[Matthan](../ebd/ebd244.htm#001) begat [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md);  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) begat
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) the husband of
[Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md), of whom was born
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), who is called
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> So all the generations from
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) are
fourteen generations; and from [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) until the
carrying away into [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md) are fourteen
generations; and from the carrying away into
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) unto [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
are fourteen generations.  

<span id="018">18</span> Now the [birth](../ebd/ebd059.htm#002.md) of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) was on
this [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md): When as his mother
[Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md) was espoused to
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), before they came together, she was
found with child of the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> Then [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) her
husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick
example, was minded to put her away privily.  

<span id="020">20</span> But while he thought on these things, behold,
the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the LORD appeared unto him in a
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005), saying, [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md),
thou son of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), fear not to take unto thee
[Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md) thy wife: for that which is conceived in
her is of the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt
call his name [JESUS](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md): for he shall save his
people from their sins.  

<span id="022">22</span> Now all this was done, that it might be
fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md), saying,  

<span id="023">23</span> Behold, a [virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009.md) shall
be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name
[Emmanuel](../ebd/ebd120.htm#000.md), which being interpreted is, God with
us.  

<span id="024">24</span> Then [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) being
raised from sleep did as the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the Lord
had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:  

<span id="025">25</span> And knew her not till she had brought forth her
firstborn son: and he called his name [JESUS](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).
