### King James Version: Job Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) hath heard and understood it.  

<span id="002">2</span> What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not
inferior unto you.  

<span id="003">3</span> Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I
desire to reason with God.  

<span id="004">4</span> But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all
physicians of no value.  

<span id="005">5</span> O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and
it should be your wisdom.  

<span id="006">6</span> Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the
pleadings of my lips.  

<span id="007">7</span> Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk
deceitfully for him?  

<span id="008">8</span> Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for
God?  

<span id="009">9</span> Is it good that he should search you out? or as
one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?  

<span id="010">10</span> He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly
accept persons.  

<span id="011">11</span> Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and
his dread fall upon you?  

<span id="012">12</span> Your remembrances are like unto
[ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000.md), your bodies to bodies of
[clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may
speak, and let come on me what will.  

<span id="014">14</span> Wherefore do I take my
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) in my teeth, and put my life in mine
hand?  

<span id="015">15</span> Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but
I will maintain mine own ways before him.  

<span id="016">16</span> He also shall be my
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md): for an
[hypocrite](../ebd/ebd185.htm#006.md) shall not come before him.  

<span id="017">17</span> Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration
with your ears.  

<span id="018">18</span> Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know
that I shall be justified.  

<span id="019">19</span> Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if
I hold my tongue, I shall give up the [ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> Only do not two things unto me: then will I not
hide myself from thee.  

<span id="021">21</span> Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not
thy dread make me afraid.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me
speak, and answer thou me.  

<span id="023">23</span> How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me
to know my transgression and my [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me
for thine enemy?  

<span id="025">25</span> Wilt thou break a [leaf](../ebd/ebd225.htm#004.md)
driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?  

<span id="026">26</span> For thou writest
[bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009.md) things against me, and makest me to
possess the iniquities of my youth.  

<span id="027">27</span> Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and
lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels
of my feet.  

<span id="028">28</span> And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a
garment that is [moth](../ebd/ebd260.htm#005.md) eaten.
