### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> My son, attend unto my wisdom, and
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) thine [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) to my
understanding:  

<span id="002">2</span> That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy
lips may keep knowledge.  

<span id="003">3</span> For the lips of a strange woman drop as an
honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:  

<span id="004">4</span> But her end is [bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009.md)
as [wormwood](../ebd/ebd384.htm#001.md), sharp as a two-edged
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold
on [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her
ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.  

<span id="007">7</span> Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart
not from the words of my mouth.  

<span id="008">8</span> Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh
the door of her house:  

<span id="009">9</span> Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy
years unto the cruel:  

<span id="010">10</span> Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and
thy labours be in the house of a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md);  

<span id="011">11</span> And thou [mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004.md) at the
last, when thy [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) and thy body are
consumed,  

<span id="012">12</span> And say, How have I hated instruction, and my
heart despised reproof;  

<span id="013">13</span> And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers,
nor inclined mine [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) to them that instructed
me!  

<span id="014">14</span> I was almost in all evil in the midst of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) and assembly.  

<span id="015">15</span> [Drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) waters out of
thine own [cistern](../ebd/ebd083.htm#008.md), and running waters out of
thine own well.  

<span id="016">16</span> Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and
rivers of waters in the streets.  

<span id="017">17</span> Let them be only thine own, and not strangers'
with thee.  

<span id="018">18</span> Let thy [fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md) be
blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.  

<span id="019">19</span> Let her be as the loving
[hind](../ebd/ebd179.htm#000) and pleasant [roe](../ebd/ebd315.htm#002.md);
let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always
with her love.  

<span id="020">20</span> And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a
strange woman, and embrace the [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md) of a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md)?  

<span id="021">21</span> For the ways of man are before the eyes of the
LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.  

<span id="022">22</span> His own iniquities shall take the wicked
himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.  

<span id="023">23</span> He shall die without instruction; and in the
greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
