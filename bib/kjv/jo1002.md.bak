### King James Version: 1 John Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> My little children, these things write I unto
you, that ye [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) not. And if any man
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), we have an
[advocate](../ebd/ebd011.htm#002.md) with the Father,
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) the
righteous:  

<span id="002">2</span> And he is the
[propitiation](../ebd/ebd300.htm#009.md) for our sins: and not for our's
only, but also for the sins of the whole world.  

<span id="003">3</span> And hereby we do know that we know him, if we
keep his commandments.  

<span id="004">4</span> He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his
commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.  

<span id="005">5</span> But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the
love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.  

<span id="006">6</span> He that saith he abideth in him ought himself
also so to walk, even as he walked.  

<span id="007">7</span> Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you,
but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old
commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.  

<span id="008">8</span> Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which
thing is true in him and in you: because the
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) is past, and the true light now
shineth.  

<span id="009">9</span> He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his
brother, is in [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) even until now.  

<span id="010">10</span> He that loveth his brother abideth in the
light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.  

<span id="011">11</span> But he that hateth his brother is in
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), and walketh in
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), and knoweth not whither he goeth,
because that [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) hath blinded his eyes.  

<span id="012">12</span> I write unto you, little children, because your
sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.  

<span id="013">13</span> I write unto you, fathers, because ye have
known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men,
because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little
children, because ye have known the Father.  

<span id="014">14</span> I have written unto you, fathers, because ye
have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you,
young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you,
and ye have overcome the wicked one.  

<span id="015">15</span> Love not the world, neither the things that are
in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not
in him.  

<span id="016">16</span> For all that is in the world, the
[lust](../ebd/ebd233.htm#005) of the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), and
the [lust](../ebd/ebd233.htm#005.md) of the eyes, and the pride of life, is
not of the Father, but is of the world.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the world passeth away, and the
[lust](../ebd/ebd233.htm#005.md) thereof: but he that doeth the will of God
abideth for ever.  

<span id="018">18</span> Little children, it is the last time: and as ye
have heard that [antichrist](../ebd/ebd025.htm#000.md) shall come, even now
are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.  

<span id="019">19</span> They went out from us, but they were not of us;
for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us:
but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not
all of us.  

<span id="020">20</span> But ye have an [unction](../ebd/ebd374.htm#006.md)
from the Holy One, and ye know all things.  

<span id="021">21</span> I have not written unto you because ye know not
the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.  

<span id="022">22</span> Who is a liar but he that denieth that
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) is the [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)?
He is [antichrist](../ebd/ebd025.htm#000.md), that denieth the Father and
the Son.  

<span id="023">23</span> Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not
the Father: he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.  

<span id="024">24</span> Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have
heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning
shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the
Father.  

<span id="025">25</span> And this is the promise that he hath promised
us, even eternal life.  

<span id="026">26</span> These things have I written unto you concerning
them that seduce you.  

<span id="027">27</span> But the anointing which ye have received of him
abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same
anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and
even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.  

<span id="028">28</span> And now, little children, abide in him; that,
when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before
him at his coming.  

<span id="029">29</span> If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that
every one that doeth [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) is born of
him.
