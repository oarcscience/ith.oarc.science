### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 28

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass in those days, that the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) gathered their armies together for
warfare, to fight with [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md). And
[Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008.md) said unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go
out with me to battle, thou and thy men.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said to
[Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008.md), Surely thou shalt know what thy servant
can do. And [Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008.md) said to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), Therefore will I make thee keeper of
mine head for ever.  

<span id="003">3</span> Now [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) was dead,
and all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) had lamented him, and buried him
in [Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005.md), even in his own city. And
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) had put away those that had familiar
spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)
gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in
[Shunem](../ebd/ebd342.htm#001): and [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md)
gathered all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) together, and they pitched
in [Gilboa](../ebd/ebd148.htm#008.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And when [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) saw the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), he was afraid, and his heart
greatly trembled.  

<span id="006">6</span> And when [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) enquired
of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by
[Urim](../ebd/ebd375.htm#005.md), nor by prophets.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then said [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) unto his
servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), that I may go to her, and enquire of
her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a
familiar [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) at
[Endor](../ebd/ebd120.htm#006.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) disguised
himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him,
and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine
unto me by the familiar [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), and bring me
him up, whom I shall name unto thee.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou
knowest what [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) hath done, how he hath cut
off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land:
wherefore then layest thou a [snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009.md) for my life,
to cause me to die?  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) sware to her
by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no
[punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005.md) happen to thee for this thing.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto
thee? And he said, Bring me up [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And when the woman saw
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md), she cried with a loud voice: and the
woman spake to [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), saying, Why hast thou
deceived me? for thou art [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said unto
her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), I saw gods ascending out of the earth.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he said unto her, What form is he of? And
she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a
[mantle](../ebd/ebd240.htm#009). And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md)
perceived that it was [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md), and he stooped
with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) said to
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me
up? And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) answered, I am sore distressed;
for the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) make war against me, and
God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets,
nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known
unto me what I shall do.  

<span id="016">16</span> Then said [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md),
Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from
thee, and is become thine enemy?  

<span id="017">17</span> And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by
me: for the LORD hath [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) the kingdom out of
thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md):  

<span id="018">18</span> Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the
LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon
[Amalek](../ebd/ebd018.htm#009.md), therefore hath the LORD done this thing
unto thee this day.  

<span id="019">19</span> Moreover the LORD will also deliver
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) with thee into the hand of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md): and to morrow shalt thou and thy
sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) into
the hand of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> Then [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) fell
straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the
words of [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md): and there was no strength in
him; for he had eaten no [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) all the day, nor
all the night.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the woman came unto
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), and saw that he was sore troubled, and
said unto him, Behold, thine [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md) hath
obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened
unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.  

<span id="022">22</span> Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also
unto the voice of thine [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md), and let me
set a morsel of [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) before thee; and eat,
that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.  

<span id="023">23</span> But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But
his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened
unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the woman had a
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) [calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004.md) in the house;
and she hasted, and killed it, and took [flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001.md),
and kneaded it, and did [bake](../ebd/ebd042.htm#001.md) unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) thereof:  

<span id="025">25</span> And she brought it before
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), and before his servants; and they did
eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.
