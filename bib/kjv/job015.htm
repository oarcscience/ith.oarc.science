<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 15</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then answered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#005">Eliphaz</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#002">Temanite</A>, and said,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Should a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> man utter vain knowledge, and fill his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A> with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> wind?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> before God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#008">elder</A> than thy father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;That thou turnest thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;What is man, that he should be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A>? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A> in his sight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A> passed among them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#003">destroyer</A> shall come upon him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;He believeth not that he shall return out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, and he is waited for of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;He wandereth abroad for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> is ready at his hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> ready to the battle.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;He runneth upon him, even on his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>, upon the thick <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#009">bosses</A> of his bucklers:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> on his flanks.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd290.htm#001">perfection</A> thereof upon the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;He shall not depart out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;It shall be accomplished before his time, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</A> shall not be green.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;He shall shake off his unripe <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#004">grape</A> as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A>, and shall cast off his flower as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A> prepareth deceit.<BR>
