### King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> But [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) was
building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.  

<span id="002">2</span> He built also the house of the
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006) of [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md); the
length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty
cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md) pillars, with
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md) beams upon the pillars.  

<span id="003">3</span> And it was covered with
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md) above upon the beams, that lay on forty
five pillars, fifteen in a row.  

<span id="004">4</span> And there were windows in three rows, and light
was against light in three ranks.  

<span id="005">5</span> And all the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) and
posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in
three ranks.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he made a porch of pillars; the length
thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the
porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick
[beam](../ebd/ebd048.htm#007.md) were before them.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then he made a porch for the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) where he might
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md), even the porch of judgment: and it was
covered with [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md) from one side of the floor
to the other.  

<span id="008">8</span> And his house where he dwelt had another court
within the porch, which was of the like work.
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) made also an house for Pharaoh's
daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.  

<span id="009">9</span> All these were of costly stones, according to
the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even
from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the
great court.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the foundation was of costly stones, even
great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.  

<span id="011">11</span> And above were costly stones, after the
measures of hewed stones, and cedars.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the great court round about was with three
rows of hewed stones, and a row of [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md) beams,
both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of
the house.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) sent and fetched
[Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003) out of [Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> He was a widow's son of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006.md), and
his father was a man of [Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001.md), a worker in
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md): and he was filled with wisdom, and
understanding, and cunning to work all works in
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md). And he came to
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), and
wrought all his work.  

<span id="015">15</span> For he cast two pillars of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md), of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a
line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he made two chapiters of molten
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md), to set upon the tops of the pillars: the
height of the one [chapiter](../ebd/ebd077.htm#004.md) was five cubits, and
the height of the other [chapiter](../ebd/ebd077.htm#004.md) was five
cubits:  

<span id="017">17</span> And nets of checker work, and wreaths of
[chain](../ebd/ebd075.htm#008.md) work, for the chapiters which were upon
the top of the pillars; [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) for the one
[chapiter](../ebd/ebd077.htm#004), and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
for the other [chapiter](../ebd/ebd077.htm#004.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And he made the pillars, and two rows round
about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the
top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other
[chapiter](../ebd/ebd077.htm#004.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And the chapiters that were upon the top of the
pillars were of [lily](../ebd/ebd229.htm#005.md) work in the porch, four
cubits.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the chapiters upon the two pillars had
pomegranates also above, over against the [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000.md)
which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows
round about upon the other [chapiter](../ebd/ebd077.htm#004.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And he set up the pillars in the porch of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md): and he set up the right
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md), and called the name thereof
[Jachin](../ebd/ebd194.htm#004.md): and he set up the left
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md), and called the name thereof
[Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And upon the top of the pillars was
[lily](../ebd/ebd229.htm#005.md) work: so was the work of the pillars
finished.  

<span id="023">23</span> And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the
one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five
cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.  

<span id="024">24</span> And under the brim of it round about there were
knops compassing it, ten in a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md), compassing
the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was
cast.  

<span id="025">25</span> It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward
the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward
the south, and three looking toward the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md):
and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were
inward.  

<span id="026">26</span> And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim
thereof was wrought like the brim of a [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000.md),
with [flowers](../ebd/ebd136.htm#002.md) of lilies: it contained two
thousand [baths](../ebd/ebd047.htm#004.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And he made ten bases of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md); four cubits was the length of one base,
and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of
it.  

<span id="028">28</span> And the work of the bases was on this manner:
they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:  

<span id="029">29</span> And on the borders that were between the ledges
were [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001.md), oxen, and cherubims: and upon the
ledges there was a base above: and beneath the
[lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001.md) and oxen were certain additions made of
thin work.  

<span id="030">30</span> And every base had four brasen wheels, and
plates of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md): and the four corners thereof
had undersetters: under the [laver](../ebd/ebd224.htm#009.md) were
undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.  

<span id="031">31</span> And the mouth of it within the
[chapiter](../ebd/ebd077.htm#004.md) and above was a
[cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md): but the mouth thereof was round after
the work of the base, a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md) and an half: and
also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare,
not round.  

<span id="032">32</span> And under the borders were four wheels; and the
axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a
[wheel](../ebd/ebd381.htm#001) was a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md) and
half a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> And the work of the wheels was like the work of
a [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) [wheel](../ebd/ebd381.htm#001.md): their
axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were
all molten.  

<span id="034">34</span> And there were four undersetters to the four
corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base
itself.  

<span id="035">35</span> And in the top of the base was there a round
compass of half a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006.md) high: and on the top of
the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.  

<span id="036">36</span> For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on
the borders thereof, he graved cherubims,
[lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001.md), and palm trees, according to the
proportion of every one, and additions round about.  

<span id="037">37</span> After this manner he made the ten bases: all of
them had one casting, one measure, and one size.  

<span id="038">38</span> Then made he ten lavers of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003): one [laver](../ebd/ebd224.htm#009.md)
contained forty [baths](../ebd/ebd047.htm#004.md): and every
[laver](../ebd/ebd224.htm#009.md) was four cubits: and upon every one of
the ten bases one [laver](../ebd/ebd224.htm#009.md).  

<span id="039">39</span> And he put five bases on the right side of the
house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the
right side of the house eastward over against the south.  

<span id="040">40</span> And [Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003.md) made the
lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So
[Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003.md) made an end of doing all the work that he
made [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) for
the house of the LORD:  

<span id="041">41</span> The two pillars, and the two bowls of the
chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks,
to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the
pillars;  

<span id="042">42</span> And four hundred pomegranates for the two
networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the
two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;  

<span id="043">43</span> And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the
bases;  

<span id="044">44</span> And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;  

<span id="045">45</span> And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons:
and all these vessels, which [Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003.md) made to
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) for the
house of the LORD, were of bright [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md).  

<span id="046">46</span> In the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md) of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) did the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
cast them, in the [clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004.md) ground between
[Succoth](../ebd/ebd352.htm#008) and [Zarthan](../ebd/ebd387.htm#009.md).  

<span id="047">47</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) left all
the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the
weight of the [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md) found out.  

<span id="048">48</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) made all
the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and the
table of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), whereupon the
[shewbread](../ebd/ebd336.htm#008.md) was,  

<span id="049">49</span> And the candlesticks of pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), five on the right side, and five on the
left, before the [oracle](../ebd/ebd280.htm#000.md), with the
[flowers](../ebd/ebd136.htm#002.md), and the lamps, and the tongs of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md),  

<span id="050">50</span> And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the
basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md); and the hinges of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), both for the
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) of the inner house, the most holy place,
and for the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) of the house, to wit, of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md).  

<span id="051">51</span> So was ended all the work that
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) made for
the house of the LORD. And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) brought in
the things which [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) his father had
dedicated; even the [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and the
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and the vessels, did he put among the
treasures of the house of the LORD.
