### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 97

<span id="001">1</span> The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let
the multitude of isles be glad thereof.  

<span id="002">2</span> Clouds and [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) are
round about him: [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) and judgment are
the [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md) of his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his
enemies round about.  

<span id="004">4</span> His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth
saw, and trembled.  

<span id="005">5</span> The hills melted like
[wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000.md) at the presence of the LORD, at the
presence of the Lord of the whole earth.  

<span id="006">6</span> The heavens declare his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), and all the people see his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Confounded be all they that serve graven images,
that boast themselves of idols: [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) him,
all ye gods.  

<span id="008">8</span> [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md) heard, and was
glad; and the daughters of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) rejoiced
because of thy judgments, O LORD.  

<span id="009">9</span> For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth:
thou art exalted far above all gods.  

<span id="010">10</span> Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth
the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the
wicked.  

<span id="011">11</span> Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness
for the upright in heart.  

<span id="012">12</span> Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give
thanks at the remembrance of his [holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md).
