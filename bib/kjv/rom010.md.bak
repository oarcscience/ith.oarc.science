### King James Version: Romans Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> Brethren, my heart's desire and
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) to God for
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) is, that they might be saved.  

<span id="002">2</span> For I bear them record that they have a
[zeal](../ebd/ebd388.htm#003.md) of God, but not according to knowledge.  

<span id="003">3</span> For they being ignorant of God's
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), and going about to establish
their own [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), have not submitted
themselves unto the [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) of God.  

<span id="004">4</span> For [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) is the end
of the law for [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) to every one that
believeth.  

<span id="005">5</span> For [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) describeth
the [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) which is of the law, That the
man which doeth those things shall live by them.  

<span id="006">6</span> But the [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md)
which is of faith speaketh on this [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md), Say
not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)? (that is, to bring
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) down from above:.md)  

<span id="007">7</span> Or, Who shall descend into the
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md)? (that is, to bring up
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) again from the dead..md)  

<span id="008">8</span> But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even
in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we
preach;  

<span id="009">9</span> That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), and shalt believe in thine heart
that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  

<span id="010">10</span> For with the heart man believeth unto
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md); and with the mouth
[confession](../ebd/ebd088.htm#003.md) is made unto
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> For the [scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005.md)
saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.  

<span id="012">12</span> For there is no difference between the
[Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004) and the [Greek](../ebd/ebd155.htm#004.md): for
the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.  

<span id="013">13</span> For whosoever shall call upon the name of the
Lord shall be saved.  

<span id="014">14</span> How then shall they call on him in whom they
have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have
not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?  

<span id="015">15</span> And how shall they preach, except they be sent?
as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) of peace, and bring glad tidings of good
things!  

<span id="016">16</span> But they have not all obeyed the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003). For [Esaias](../ebd/ebd124.htm#003.md)
saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?  

<span id="017">17</span> So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by
the word of God.  

<span id="018">18</span> But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily,
their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of
the world.  

<span id="019">19</span> But I say, Did not
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) know? First
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) saith, I will provoke you to
[jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008.md) by them that are no people, and by a
foolish nation I will [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) you.  

<span id="020">20</span> But [Esaias](../ebd/ebd124.htm#003.md) is very
bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made
manifest unto them that asked not after me.  

<span id="021">21</span> But to [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) he
saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient
and gainsaying people.
