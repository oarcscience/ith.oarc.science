### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 31

<span id="001">1</span> The words of [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Lemuel](../ebd/ebd227.htm#000), the [prophecy](../ebd/ebd300.htm#007.md)
that his mother taught him.  

<span id="002">2</span> What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and
what, the son of my [vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001.md)?  

<span id="003">3</span> Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways
to that which destroyeth kings.  

<span id="004">4</span> It is not for kings, O
[Lemuel](../ebd/ebd227.htm#000.md), it is not for kings to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md); nor for
princes strong [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md):  

<span id="005">5</span> Lest they [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), and
forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.  

<span id="006">6</span> Give strong [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) unto
him that is ready to perish, and [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) unto
those that be of heavy hearts.  

<span id="007">7</span> Let him [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), and
forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.  

<span id="008">8</span> Open thy mouth for the
[dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002.md) in the cause of all such as are appointed
to [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Open thy mouth, [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md)
righteously, and plead the cause of the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md)
and needy.  

<span id="010">10</span> Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is
far above rubies.  

<span id="011">11</span> The heart of her husband doth safely trust in
her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.  

<span id="012">12</span> She will do him good and not evil all the days
of her life.  

<span id="013">13</span> She seeketh [wool](../ebd/ebd383.htm#005.md), and
[flax](../ebd/ebd135.htm#004.md), and worketh willingly with her hands.  

<span id="014">14</span> She is like the merchants'
[ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003.md); she bringeth her food from afar.  

<span id="015">15</span> She riseth also while it is yet night, and
giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.  

<span id="016">16</span> She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with
the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of her hands she planteth a
vineyard.  

<span id="017">17</span> She girdeth her loins with strength, and
strengtheneth her arms.  

<span id="018">18</span> She perceiveth that her merchandise is good:
her [candle](../ebd/ebd071.htm#000.md) goeth not out by night.  

<span id="019">19</span> She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her
hands hold the [distaff](../ebd/ebd104.htm#008.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> She stretcheth out her hand to the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md); yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the
needy.  

<span id="021">21</span> She is not afraid of the
[snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000.md) for her household: for all her household
are clothed with [scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her
clothing is [silk](../ebd/ebd343.htm#005.md) and purple.  

<span id="023">23</span> Her husband is known in the gates, when he
sitteth among the elders of the land.  

<span id="024">24</span> She maketh fine [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md),
and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the
[merchant](../ebd/ebd249.htm#003.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> Strength and honour are her clothing; and she
shall rejoice in time to come.  

<span id="026">26</span> She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her
tongue is the law of kindness.  

<span id="027">27</span> She looketh well to the ways of her household,
and eateth not the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) of idleness.  

<span id="028">28</span> Her children arise up, and call her blessed;
her husband also, and he praiseth her.  

<span id="029">29</span> Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou
excellest them all.  

<span id="030">30</span> Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a
woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.  

<span id="031">31</span> Give her of the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md)
of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.
