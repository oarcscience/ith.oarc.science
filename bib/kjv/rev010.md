### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> And I saw another mighty
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) come down from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), clothed with a
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001): and a [rainbow](../ebd/ebd305.htm#009)
was upon his head, and his face was as it were the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), and his feet as pillars of fire:  

<span id="002">2</span> And he had in his hand a little book open: and
he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,  

<span id="003">3</span> And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion
roareth: and when he had cried, [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) thunders
uttered their voices.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a
voice from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) saying unto me,
[Seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002) up those things which the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) thunders uttered, and write them not.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) which I
saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006),  

<span id="006">6</span> And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever,
who created [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and the things that therein
are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and
the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:  

<span id="007">7</span> But in the days of the voice of the seventh
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001), when he shall begin to sound, the
[mystery](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006) of God should be finished, as he hath
declared to his servants the prophets.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the voice which I heard from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) spake unto me again, and said, Go and
take the little book which is open in the hand of the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) which standeth upon the sea and upon the
earth.  

<span id="009">9</span> And I went unto the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001), and said unto him, Give me the little
book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000) [bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009), but it
shall be in thy mouth sweet as [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001).  

<span id="010">10</span> And I took the little book out of the angel's
hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001): and as soon as I had eaten it, my
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000) was [bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009).  

<span id="011">11</span> And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again
before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.
