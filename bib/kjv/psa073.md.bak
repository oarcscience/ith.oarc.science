### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 73

<span id="001">1</span> Truly God is good to
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), even to such as are of a
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) heart.  

<span id="002">2</span> But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my
steps had well nigh slipped.  

<span id="003">3</span> For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the
prosperity of the wicked.  

<span id="004">4</span> For there are no [bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003.md)
in their death: but their strength is firm.  

<span id="005">5</span> They are not in trouble as other men; neither
are they plagued like other men.  

<span id="006">6</span> Therefore pride compasseth them about as a
[chain](../ebd/ebd075.htm#008.md); violence covereth them as a garment.  

<span id="007">7</span> Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have
more than heart could wish.  

<span id="008">8</span> They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning
oppression: they speak loftily.  

<span id="009">9</span> They set their mouth against the heavens, and
their tongue walketh through the earth.  

<span id="010">10</span> Therefore his people return hither: and waters
of a full [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000.md) are wrung out to them.  

<span id="011">11</span> And they say, How doth God know? and is there
knowledge in the most High?  

<span id="012">12</span> Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in
the world; they increase in riches.  

<span id="013">13</span> Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and
washed my hands in innocency.  

<span id="014">14</span> For all the day long have I been plagued, and
chastened every morning.  

<span id="015">15</span> If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should
offend against the [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) of thy
children.  

<span id="016">16</span> When I thought to know this, it was too painful
for me;  

<span id="017">17</span> Until I went into the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md) of God; then understood I their
end.  

<span id="018">18</span> Surely thou didst set them in slippery places:
thou castedst them down into [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> How are they brought into desolation, as in a
moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.  

<span id="020">20</span> As a [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md) when one
awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their
image.  

<span id="021">21</span> Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in
my [reins](../ebd/ebd310.htm#001.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) before thee.  

<span id="023">23</span> Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou
hast holden me by my right hand.  

<span id="024">24</span> Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and
afterward receive me to [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> Whom have I in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)
but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.  

<span id="026">26</span> My [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) and my heart
faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.  

<span id="027">27</span> For, lo, they that are far from thee shall
perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.  

<span id="028">28</span> But it is good for me to draw near to God: I
have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.
