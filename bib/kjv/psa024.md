### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> The earth is the LORD's, and the
[fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007.md) thereof; the world, and they that dwell
therein.  

<span id="002">2</span> For he hath founded it upon the seas, and
established it upon the floods.  

<span id="003">3</span> Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or
who shall stand in his holy place?  

<span id="004">4</span> He that hath [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md)
hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity,
nor sworn deceitfully.  

<span id="005">5</span> He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) from the God of his
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> This is the [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md)
of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007). [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift
up, ye [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md)
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009); and the [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) shall come in.  

<span id="008">8</span> Who is this [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md)? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD
mighty in battle.  

<span id="009">9</span> Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them
up, ye [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md)
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009); and the [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) shall come in.  

<span id="010">10</span> Who is this [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md)? The LORD of hosts, he is the
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).
