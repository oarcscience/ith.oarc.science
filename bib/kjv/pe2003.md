### King James Version: 2 Peter Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto
you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:  

<span id="002">2</span> That ye may be mindful of the words which were
spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the
apostles of the Lord and [Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003):  

<span id="003">3</span> Knowing this first, that there shall come in the
last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,  

<span id="004">4</span> And saying, Where is the promise of his coming?
for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from
the beginning of the [creation](../ebd/ebd092.htm#003).  

<span id="005">5</span> For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by
the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of
the water and in the water:  

<span id="006">6</span> Whereby the world that then was, being
overflowed with water, perished:  

<span id="007">7</span> But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by
the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of
judgment and perdition of ungodly men.  

<span id="008">8</span> But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing,
that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years
as one day.  

<span id="009">9</span> The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as
some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing
that any should perish, but that all should come to
[repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008).  

<span id="010">10</span> But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in
the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,
and the [elements](../ebd/ebd115.htm#004) shall melt with fervent heat,
the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.  

<span id="011">11</span> Seeing then that all these things shall be
dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy
[conversation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#001) and
[godliness](../ebd/ebd151.htm#007),  

<span id="012">12</span> Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the
day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and
the [elements](../ebd/ebd115.htm#004) shall melt with fervent heat?  

<span id="013">13</span> Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look
for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="014">14</span> Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for
such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without
spot, and blameless.  

<span id="015">15</span> And account that the longsuffering of our Lord
is [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003); even as our beloved brother
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) also according to the wisdom given unto
him hath written unto you;  

<span id="016">16</span> As also in all his
[epistles](../ebd/ebd124.htm#000), speaking in them of these things; in
which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are
unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto
their own [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004).  

<span id="017">17</span> Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these
things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the
wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.  

<span id="018">18</span> But grow in [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000), and
in the knowledge of our Lord and [Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000). To him
be [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) both now and for ever.
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).
