### King James Version: Mark Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> And he entered again into the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009.md); and there was a man there which had
a withered hand.  

<span id="002">2</span> And they watched him, whether he would heal him
on the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) day; that they might accuse
him.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he saith unto the man which had the withered
hand, Stand forth.  

<span id="004">4</span> And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good
on the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) days, or to do evil? to save
life, or to kill? But they held their peace.  

<span id="005">5</span> And when he had looked round about on them with
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md), being grieved for the hardness of their
hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he
stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md) went
forth, and straightway took counsel with the
[Herodians](../ebd/ebd176.htm#005.md) against him, how they might destroy
him.  

<span id="007">7</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) withdrew
himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md) followed him, and from Judaea,  

<span id="008">8</span> And from [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and
from [Idumaea](../ebd/ebd186.htm#008.md), and from beyond
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md); and they about
[Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001) and [Sidon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#000.md), a
great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto
him.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship
should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng
him.  

<span id="010">10</span> For he had healed many; insomuch that they
pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.  

<span id="011">11</span> And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell
down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he straitly charged them that they should
not make him known.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth
unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he ordained twelve, that they should be
with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,  

<span id="015">15</span> And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to
cast out devils:  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md) he surnamed
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md);  

<span id="017">17</span> And [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md) the son of
[Zebedee](../ebd/ebd388.htm#008.md), and John the brother of
[James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md); and he surnamed them
[Boanerges](../ebd/ebd061.htm#004.md), which is, The sons of
[thunder](../ebd/ebd365.htm#003.md):  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Andrew](../ebd/ebd023.htm#007.md), and
[Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008.md), and
[Bartholomew](../ebd/ebd045.htm#009.md), and
[Matthew](../ebd/ebd244.htm#003), and [Thomas](../ebd/ebd364.htm#005.md),
and [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md) the son of
[Alphaeus](../ebd/ebd018.htm#005.md), and
[Thaddaeus](../ebd/ebd363.htm#001), and [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md)
the [Canaanite](../ebd/ebd070.htm#008.md),  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001.md)
[Iscariot](../ebd/ebd190.htm#000.md), which also betrayed him: and they
went into an house.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the multitude cometh together again, so
that they could not so much as eat [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And when his friends heard of it, they went out
to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md) which
came down from [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) said, He hath
[Beelzebub](../ebd/ebd050.htm#001.md), and by the
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) of the devils casteth he out devils.  

<span id="023">23</span> And he called them unto him, and said unto them
in parables, How can [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md) cast out
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="024">24</span> And if a kingdom be divided against itself,
that kingdom cannot stand.  

<span id="025">25</span> And if a house be divided against itself, that
house cannot stand.  

<span id="026">26</span> And if [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md) rise up
against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.  

<span id="027">27</span> No man can enter into a strong man's house, and
spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he
will spoil his house.  

<span id="028">28</span> Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be
forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they
shall blaspheme:  

<span id="029">29</span> But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md) hath never forgiveness, but is in danger
of eternal [damnation](../ebd/ebd096.htm#008.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> Because they said, He hath an unclean
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> There came then his brethren and his mother,
and, standing without, sent unto him, [calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007.md)
him.  

<span id="032">32</span> And the multitude sat about him, and they said
unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.  

<span id="033">33</span> And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother,
or my brethren?  

<span id="034">34</span> And he looked round about on them which sat
about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!  

<span id="035">35</span> For whosoever shall do the will of God, the
same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.
