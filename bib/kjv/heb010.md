### King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> For the law having a
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) of good things to come, and not the very
image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered
year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.  

<span id="002">2</span> For then would they not have ceased to be
offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no
more [conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006) of sins.  

<span id="003">3</span> But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance
again made of sins every year.  

<span id="004">4</span> For it is not possible that the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of bulls and of goats should take away
sins.  

<span id="005">5</span> Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he
saith, [Sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) and
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) thou wouldest not, but a body hast
thou prepared me:  

<span id="006">6</span> In burnt offerings and sacrifices for
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) thou hast had no pleasure.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the
book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.  

<span id="008">8</span> Above when he said,
[Sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) and [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001)
and burnt offerings and [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) for
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure
therein; which are offered by the law;  

<span id="009">9</span> Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.
He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.  

<span id="010">10</span> By the which will we are sanctified through the
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of the body of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) once for
all.  

<span id="011">11</span> And every [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003)
standeth daily ministering and [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001)
oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:  

<span id="012">12</span> But this man, after he had offered one
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) for sins for ever, sat down on the
right hand of God;  

<span id="013">13</span> From henceforth expecting till his enemies be
made his [footstool](../ebd/ebd136.htm#009).  

<span id="014">14</span> For by one [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) he
hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.  

<span id="015">15</span> Whereof the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005)
also is a [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) to us: for after that he had
said before,  

<span id="016">16</span> This is the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008)
that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put
my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;  

<span id="017">17</span> And their sins and iniquities will I remember
no more.  

<span id="018">18</span> Now where remission of these is, there is no
more [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) for
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="019">19</span> Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter
into the holiest by the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006),  

<span id="020">20</span> By a new and living way, which he hath
consecrated for us, through the [veil](../ebd/ebd377.htm#001), that is
to say, his [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007);  

<span id="021">21</span> And having an high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) over the house of God;  

<span id="022">22</span> Let us draw near with a true heart in full
[assurance](../ebd/ebd035.htm#004) of faith, having our hearts sprinkled
from an evil [conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006), and our bodies washed
with pure water.  

<span id="023">23</span> Let us hold [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) the
profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) that promised;)  

<span id="024">24</span> And let us consider one another to provoke unto
love and to good works:  

<span id="025">25</span> Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves
together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so
much the more, as ye see the day approaching.  

<span id="026">26</span> For if we [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) wilfully
after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth
no more [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) for sins,  

<span id="027">27</span> But a certain fearful looking for of judgment
and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.  

<span id="028">28</span> He that despised Moses' law died without
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) under two or three witnesses:  

<span id="029">29</span> Of how much sorer
[punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005), suppose ye, shall he be thought
worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008),
wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto
the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000)?  

<span id="030">30</span> For we know him that hath said, Vengeance
belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The
Lord shall [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) his people.  

<span id="031">31</span> It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of
the living God.  

<span id="032">32</span> But call to remembrance the former days, in
which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of
[afflictions](../ebd/ebd011.htm#006);  

<span id="033">33</span> Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both
by reproaches and [afflictions](../ebd/ebd011.htm#006); and partly,
whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.  

<span id="034">34</span> For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and
took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye
have in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) a better and an enduring
substance.  

<span id="035">35</span> Cast not away therefore your confidence, which
hath great recompence of reward.  

<span id="036">36</span> For ye have need of patience, that, after ye
have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.  

<span id="037">37</span> For yet a little while, and he that shall come
will come, and will not tarry.  

<span id="038">38</span> Now the just shall live by faith: but if any
man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.  

<span id="039">39</span> But we are not of them who draw back unto
perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.
