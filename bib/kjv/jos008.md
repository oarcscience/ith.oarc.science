### King James Version: Joshua Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD said unto
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), Fear not, neither be thou dismayed:
take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to
[Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md): see, I have given into thy hand the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md), and his
people, and his city, and his land:  

<span id="002">2</span> And thou shalt do to [Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md)
and her [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) as thou didst unto
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008) and her [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md):
only the spoil thereof, and the [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) thereof,
shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an
[ambush](../ebd/ebd020.htm#000.md) for the city behind it.  

<span id="003">3</span> So [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) arose, and
all the people of war, to go up against [Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md): and
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) chose out thirty thousand mighty men of
valour, and sent them away by night.  

<span id="004">4</span> And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall
lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from
the city, but be ye all ready:  

<span id="005">5</span> And I, and all the people that are with me, will
approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out
against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,  

<span id="006">6</span> (For they will come out after us) till we have
drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at
the first: therefore we will flee before them.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then ye shall rise up from the
[ambush](../ebd/ebd020.htm#000.md), and seize upon the city: for the LORD
your God will deliver it into your hand.  

<span id="008">8</span> And it shall be, when ye have taken the city,
that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the
LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.  

<span id="009">9</span> [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) therefore sent
them forth: and they went to lie in [ambush](../ebd/ebd020.htm#000.md), and
abode between [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md) and
[Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md), on the west side of
[Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009): but [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) lodged
that night among the people.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) rose up
early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the
elders of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), before the people to
[Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And all the people, even the people of war that
were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and
pitched on the north side of [Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md): now there was
a [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) between them and
[Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And he took about five thousand men, and set
them to lie in [ambush](../ebd/ebd020.htm#000.md) between
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006) and [Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md), on the
west side of the city.  

<span id="013">13</span> And when they had set the people, even all the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) that was on the north of the city, and
their liers in wait on the west of the city,
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) went that night into the midst of the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And it came to pass, when the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md) saw it,
that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out
against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) to battle, he and all his
people, at a time appointed, before the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md);
but he wist not that there were liers in [ambush](../ebd/ebd020.htm#000.md)
against him behind the city.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) and all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) made as if they were beaten before them,
and fled by the way of the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And all the people that were in
[Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md) were called together to pursue after them:
and they pursued after [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), and were drawn
away from the city.  

<span id="017">17</span> And there was not a man left in
[Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009) or [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md), that
went not out after [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and they left the
city open, and pursued after [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And the LORD said unto
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), Stretch out the spear that is in thy
hand toward [Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md); for I will give it into thine
hand. And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) stretched out the spear that
he had in his hand toward the city.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the [ambush](../ebd/ebd020.htm#000.md) arose
quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out
his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and
set the city on fire.  

<span id="020">20</span> And when the men of [Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md)
looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city
ascended up to [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and they had no power to
flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) turned back upon the pursuers.  

<span id="021">21</span> And when [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) and
all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) saw that the
[ambush](../ebd/ebd020.htm#000.md) had taken the city, and that the smoke
of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of
[Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And the other issued out of the city against
them; so they were in the midst of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), some
on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they
let none of them remain or escape.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md) they took alive, and brought him to
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And it came to pass, when
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) had made an end of slaying all the
inhabitants of [Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md) in the field, in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) wherein they chased them, and when
they were all fallen on the edge of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md),
until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto
[Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md), and smote it with the edge of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> And so it was, that all that fell that day,
both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of
[Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> For [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) drew not
his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had
utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of [Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> Only the [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) and
the spoil of that city [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) took for a prey
unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) burnt
[Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md), and made it an
[heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md) for ever, even a desolation unto this
day.  

<span id="029">29</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009.md) he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as
soon as the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) was down,
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) commanded that they should take his
[carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004.md) down from the tree, and cast it at the
entering of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) of the city, and raise
thereon a great [heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md) of stones, that remaineth
unto this day.  

<span id="030">30</span> Then [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) built an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) unto the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Ebal](../ebd/ebd111.htm#007.md),  

<span id="031">31</span> As [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) the servant
of the LORD commanded the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
as it is written in the book of the law of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), an [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) of
whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md): and they offered thereon burnt offerings
unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.  

<span id="032">32</span> And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of
the law of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), which he wrote in the
presence of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> And all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and
their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) and on that side before the priests the
Levites, which bare the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of the LORD, as well the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md), as he that was born among them; half
of them over against [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Gerizim](../ebd/ebd146.htm#007.md), and half of them over against
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Ebal](../ebd/ebd111.htm#007.md); as
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) the servant of the LORD had commanded
before, that they should [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) the people of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="034">34</span> And afterward he read all the words of the law,
the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book
of the law.  

<span id="035">35</span> There was not a word of all that
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) commanded, which
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) read not before all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), with the women, and the little ones,
and the strangers that were conversant among them.
