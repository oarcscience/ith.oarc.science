<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 7</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;For this Melchisedec, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd319.htm#001">Salem</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> of the most high God, who met <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;To whom also <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, and after that also <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd319.htm#001">Salem</A>, which is, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of peace;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> continually.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#009">patriarch</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> gave the tenth of the spoils.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And verily they that are of the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</A>, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, and blessed him that had the promises.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And as I may so say, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</A> also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;If therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd290.htm#001">perfection</A> were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A>, of which no man gave attendance at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#006">Juda</A>; of which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> spake nothing concerning priesthood.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Who is made, not after the law of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#008">carnal</A> commandment, but after the power of an endless life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For he testifieth, Thou art a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> for ever after the order of Melchisedec.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And inasmuch as not without an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A> he was made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;(For those priests were made without an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A>; but this with an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A> by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;By so much was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#005">surety</A> of a better <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;For such an high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A>, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.<BR>
