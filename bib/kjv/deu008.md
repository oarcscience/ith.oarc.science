### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> All the commandments which I command thee this
day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in
and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.  

<span id="002">2</span> And thou shalt remember all the way which the
LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), to humble thee, and to prove thee,
to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his
commandments, or no.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to
hunger, and fed thee with [manna](../ebd/ebd240.htm#006.md), which thou
knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know
that man doth not live by [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) only, but by
every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.  

<span id="004">4</span> Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did
thy foot swell, these forty years.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that,
as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of
the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.  

<span id="007">7</span> For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good
land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out
of valleys and hills;  

<span id="008">8</span> A land of [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md), and
[barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003.md), and vines, and
[fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001.md) trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil
[olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009), and [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md);  

<span id="009">9</span> A land wherein thou shalt eat
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) without scarceness, thou shalt not lack
any thing in it; a land whose stones are [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md),
and out of whose hills thou mayest dig [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou
shalt [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) the LORD thy God for the good land
which he hath given thee.  

<span id="011">11</span> Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God,
in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes,
which I command thee this day:  

<span id="012">12</span> Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and
hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;  

<span id="013">13</span> And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and
thy [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) and thy
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) is multiplied, and all that thou hast is
multiplied;  

<span id="014">14</span> Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget
the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), from the house of
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md);  

<span id="015">15</span> Who led thee through that great and terrible
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), wherein were fiery serpents, and
[scorpions](../ebd/ebd324.htm#001.md), and
[drought](../ebd/ebd108.htm#005.md), where there was no water; who brought
thee forth water out of the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md) of
[flint](../ebd/ebd135.htm#009.md);  

<span id="016">16</span> Who fed thee in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) with [manna](../ebd/ebd240.htm#006.md),
which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might
prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;  

<span id="017">17</span> And thou say in thine heart, My power and the
might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.  

<span id="018">18</span> But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for
it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) which he sware unto thy fathers, as it
is this day.  

<span id="019">19</span> And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the
LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) them, I testify against you this day
that ye shall surely perish.  

<span id="020">20</span> As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before
your face, so shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the
voice of the LORD your God.
