### King James Version: Luke Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass afterward, that he went
throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad
tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,  

<span id="002">2</span> And certain women, which had been healed of evil
spirits and infirmities, [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md) called
[Magdalene](../ebd/ebd236.htm#005.md), out of whom went
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) devils,  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Joanna](../ebd/ebd207.htm#009.md) the wife of
Chuza Herod's steward, and [Susanna](../ebd/ebd353.htm#007.md), and many
others, which ministered unto him of their substance.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when much people were gathered together, and
were come to him out of every city, he spake by a
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md):  

<span id="005">5</span> A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he
sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls
of the air devoured it.  

<span id="006">6</span> And some fell upon a
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md); and as soon as it was sprung up, it
withered away, because it lacked moisture.  

<span id="007">7</span> And some fell among thorns; and the thorns
sprang up with it, and choked it.  

<span id="008">8</span> And other fell on good ground, and sprang up,
and bare [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) an hundredfold. And when he had
said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.  

<span id="009">9</span> And his disciples asked him, saying, What might
this [parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md) be?  

<span id="010">10</span> And he said, Unto you it is given to know the
mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing
they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.  

<span id="011">11</span> Now the [parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md) is
this: The seed is the word of God.  

<span id="012">12</span> Those by the way side are they that hear; then
cometh the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md), and taketh away the word out
of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.  

<span id="013">13</span> They on the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md) are
they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have
no root, which for a while believe, and in time of
[temptation](../ebd/ebd361.htm#008.md) fall away.  

<span id="014">14</span> And that which fell among thorns are they,
which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and
riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) to [perfection](../ebd/ebd290.htm#001.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> But that on the good ground are they, which in
an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring
forth [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) with patience.  

<span id="016">16</span> No man, when he hath lighted a
[candle](../ebd/ebd071.htm#000.md), covereth it with a vessel, or putteth
it under a bed; but setteth it on a
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001.md), that they which enter in may see
the light.  

<span id="017">17</span> For nothing is secret, that shall not be made
manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come
abroad.  

<span id="018">18</span> Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever
hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be
taken even that which he seemeth to have.  

<span id="019">19</span> Then came to him his mother and his brethren,
and could not come at him for the press.  

<span id="020">20</span> And it was told him by certain which said, Thy
mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.  

<span id="021">21</span> And he answered and said unto them, My mother
and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.  

<span id="022">22</span> Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he
went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go
over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.  

<span id="023">23</span> But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there
came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water,
and were in jeopardy.  

<span id="024">24</span> And they came to him, and awoke him, saying,
Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the
raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.  

<span id="025">25</span> And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And
they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is
this! for he commandeth even the [winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009.md) and
water, and they obey him.  

<span id="026">26</span> And they arrived at the country of the
[Gadarenes](../ebd/ebd140.htm#009.md), which is over against
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And when he went forth to land, there met him
out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no
clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the
[tombs](../ebd/ebd370.htm#001.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> When he saw [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), he
cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What
have I to do with thee, [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), thou Son of God
most high? I beseech thee, [torment](../ebd/ebd370.htm#009.md) me not.  

<span id="029">29</span> (For he had commanded the unclean
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) to come out of the man. For oftentimes
it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and
he brake the [bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003.md), and was driven of the
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md) into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005)..md)  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) asked him,
saying, What is thy name? And he said, [Legion](../ebd/ebd226.htm#008.md):
because many devils were entered into him.  

<span id="031">31</span> And they besought him that he would not command
them to go out into the [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> And there was there an
[herd](../ebd/ebd174.htm#009) of many [swine](../ebd/ebd354.htm#002.md)
feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them
to enter into them. And he suffered them.  

<span id="033">33</span> Then went the devils out of the man, and
entered into the [swine](../ebd/ebd354.htm#002.md): and the
[herd](../ebd/ebd174.htm#009.md) ran violently down a steep place into the
lake, and were choked.  

<span id="034">34</span> When they that fed them saw what was done, they
fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.  

<span id="035">35</span> Then they went out to see what was done; and
came to [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), and found the man, out of whom
the devils were departed, [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md) at the feet
of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), clothed, and in his right mind: and
they were afraid.  

<span id="036">36</span> They also which saw it told them by what means
he that was possessed of the devils was healed.  

<span id="037">37</span> Then the whole multitude of the country of the
[Gadarenes](../ebd/ebd140.htm#009.md) round about besought him to depart
from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the
ship, and returned back again.  

<span id="038">38</span> Now the man out of whom the devils were
departed besought him that he might be with him: but
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) sent him away, saying,  

<span id="039">39</span> Return to thine own house, and shew how great
things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published
throughout the whole city how great things
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) had done unto him.  

<span id="040">40</span> And it came to pass, that, when
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) was returned, the people gladly received
him: for they were all waiting for him.  

<span id="041">41</span> And, behold, there came a man named
[Jairus](../ebd/ebd196.htm#002.md), and he was a ruler of the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009.md): and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and
besought him that he would come into his house:  

<span id="042">42</span> For he had one only daughter, about twelve
years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged
him.  

<span id="043">43</span> And a woman having an issue of
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) twelve years, which had spent all her
living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,  

<span id="044">44</span> Came behind him, and touched the border of his
garment: and immediately her issue of [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md)
stanched.  

<span id="045">45</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said, Who
touched me? When all denied, [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) and they
that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press
thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?  

<span id="046">46</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said,
Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of
me.  

<span id="047">47</span> And when the woman saw that she was not hid,
she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him
before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she
was healed immediately.  

<span id="048">48</span> And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good
comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.  

<span id="049">49</span> While he yet spake, there cometh one from the
ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead;
trouble not the Master.  

<span id="050">50</span> But when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) heard
it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be
made whole.  

<span id="051">51</span> And when he came into the house, he suffered no
man to go in, save [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md), and
[James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md), and John, and the father and the mother
of the maiden.  

<span id="052">52</span> And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said,
Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.  

<span id="053">53</span> And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she
was dead.  

<span id="054">54</span> And he put them all out, and took her by the
hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.  

<span id="055">55</span> And her [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) came
again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.  

<span id="056">56</span> And her parents were astonished: but he charged
them that they should tell no man what was done.
