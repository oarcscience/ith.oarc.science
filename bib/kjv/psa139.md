### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 139

<span id="001">1</span> O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.  

<span id="002">2</span> Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising,
thou understandest my thought afar off.  

<span id="003">3</span> Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and
art acquainted with all my ways.  

<span id="004">4</span> For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O
LORD, thou knowest it altogether.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid
thine hand upon me.  

<span id="006">6</span> Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is
high, I cannot attain unto it.  

<span id="007">7</span> Whither shall I go from thy
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md)? or whither shall I flee from thy
presence?  

<span id="008">8</span> If I ascend up into
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), thou art there: if I make my bed in
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md), behold, thou art there.  

<span id="009">9</span> If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in
the uttermost parts of the sea;  

<span id="010">10</span> Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy
right hand shall hold me.  

<span id="011">11</span> If I say, Surely the
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) shall cover me; even the night shall
be light about me.  

<span id="012">12</span> Yea, the [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md)
hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) and the light are both alike to
thee.  

<span id="013">13</span> For thou hast possessed my
[reins](../ebd/ebd310.htm#001.md): thou hast covered me in my mother's
womb.  

<span id="014">14</span> I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and
wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth
right well.  

<span id="015">15</span> My substance was not hid from thee, when I was
made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the
earth.  

<span id="016">16</span> Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being
unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in
continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.  

<span id="017">17</span> How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O
God! how great is the sum of them!  

<span id="018">18</span> If I should count them, they are more in number
than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.  

<span id="019">19</span> Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart
from me therefore, ye bloody men.  

<span id="020">20</span> For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine
enemies take thy name in vain.  

<span id="021">21</span> Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and
am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?  

<span id="022">22</span> I hate them with perfect
[hatred](../ebd/ebd167.htm#002.md): I count them mine enemies.  

<span id="023">23</span> Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me,
and know my thoughts:  

<span id="024">24</span> And see if there be any wicked way in me, and
lead me in the way [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md).
