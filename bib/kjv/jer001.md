### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> The words of [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md)
the son of [Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006.md), of the priests that were in
[Anathoth](../ebd/ebd023.htm#004.md) in the land of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md):  

<span id="002">2</span> To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) the son of [Amon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#005.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), in the
thirteenth year of his reign.  

<span id="003">3</span> It came also in the days of
[Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001.md) the son of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), unto the end of the eleventh year of
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008.md) the son of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), unto the carrying away of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001.md) in
the fifth month.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="005">5</span> Before I formed thee in the
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000.md) I knew thee; and before thou camest forth
out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) unto the nations.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot
speak: for I am a child.  

<span id="007">7</span> But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a
child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I
command thee thou shalt speak.  

<span id="008">8</span> Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee
to deliver thee, saith the LORD.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my
mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy
mouth.  

<span id="010">10</span> See, I have this day set thee over the nations
and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy,
and to throw down, to build, and to plant.  

<span id="011">11</span> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying, [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006.md), what seest thou? And I said,
I see a rod of an [almond](../ebd/ebd018.htm#001.md) tree.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well
seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the word of the LORD came unto me the
second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot;
and the face thereof is toward the north.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an
evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.  

<span id="015">15</span> For, lo, I will call all the families of the
kingdoms of the north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they
shall set every one his [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) at the entering
of the gates of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and against all the
walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And I will utter my judgments against them
touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) unto other gods, and worshipped the
works of their own hands.  

<span id="017">17</span> Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise,
and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their
faces, lest I confound thee before them.  

<span id="018">18</span> For, behold, I have made thee this day a
defenced city, and an [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md)
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md), and brasen walls against the whole
land, against the kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), against the
princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of
the land.  

<span id="019">19</span> And they shall fight against thee; but they
shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to
deliver thee.
