### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 76

<span id="001">1</span> In [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) is God known:
his name is great in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> In [Salem](../ebd/ebd319.htm#001.md) also is his
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), and his dwelling place in
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> There brake he the
[arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005) of the [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md), the
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001), and the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md),
and the battle. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Thou art more glorious and excellent than the
mountains of prey.  

<span id="005">5</span> The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept
their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.  

<span id="006">6</span> At thy rebuke, O God of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), both the
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md) and horse are cast into a dead sleep.  

<span id="007">7</span> Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may
stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?  

<span id="008">8</span> Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md); the earth feared, and was still,  

<span id="009">9</span> When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek
of the earth. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the
remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.  

<span id="011">11</span> Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all
that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be
feared.  

<span id="012">12</span> He shall cut off the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of princes: he is terrible to the kings
of the earth.
