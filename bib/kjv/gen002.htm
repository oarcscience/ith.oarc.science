</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.<BR>

<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</A> of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.<BR>
