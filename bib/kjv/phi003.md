### King James Version: Philippians Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To
write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you
it is safe.  

<span id="002">2</span> Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware
of the [concision](../ebd/ebd087.htm#006.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> For we are the
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007.md), which
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) God in the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), and rejoice in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), and have
no confidence in the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Though I might also have confidence in the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md). If any other man thinketh that he hath
whereof he might trust in the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), I more:  

<span id="005">5</span> Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md)
of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008), an [Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009.md)
of the [Hebrews](../ebd/ebd171.htm#001.md); as touching the law, a
Pharisee;  

<span id="006">6</span> Concerning [zeal](../ebd/ebd388.htm#003.md),
persecuting the church; touching the
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) which is in the law, blameless.  

<span id="007">7</span> But what things were gain to me, those I counted
loss for [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss
for the excellency of the knowledge of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) my Lord: for whom I have suffered the
loss of all things, and do count them but [dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003.md),
that I may win [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md),  

<span id="009">9</span> And be found in him, not having mine own
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), which is of the law, but that
which is through the faith of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), the
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) which is of God by faith:  

<span id="010">10</span> That I may know him, and the power of his
resurrection, and the [fellowship](../ebd/ebd132.htm#002.md) of his
sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;  

<span id="011">11</span> If by any means I might attain unto the
resurrection of the dead.  

<span id="012">12</span> Not as though I had already attained, either
were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that
for which also I am apprehended of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> Brethren, I count not myself to have
apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are
behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,  

<span id="014">14</span> I press toward the mark for the prize of the
high [calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007.md) of God in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be
thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall
reveal even this unto you.  

<span id="016">16</span> Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained,
let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.  

<span id="017">17</span> Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark
them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.  

<span id="018">18</span> (For many walk, of whom I have told you often,
and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the
[cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000) of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md):  

<span id="019">19</span> Whose end is
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md), whose God is their
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000), and whose [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md)
is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)  

<span id="020">20</span> For our [conversation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#001.md)
is in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md); from whence also we look for the
[Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003.md), the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md):  

<span id="021">21</span> Who shall change our vile body, that it may be
fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby
he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
