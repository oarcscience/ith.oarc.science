### King James Version: John Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> There was a man of the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md), named
[Nicodemus](../ebd/ebd272.htm#005.md), a ruler of the Jews:  

<span id="002">2</span> The same came to [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
by night, and said unto him, [Rabbi](../ebd/ebd304.htm#006.md), we know
that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles
that thou doest, except God be with him.  

<span id="003">3</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered and said
unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again,
he cannot see the kingdom of God.  

<span id="004">4</span> [Nicodemus](../ebd/ebd272.htm#005.md) saith unto
him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time
into his mother's womb, and be born?  

<span id="005">5</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered, Verily,
verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), he cannot enter into the kingdom of
God.  

<span id="006">6</span> That which is born of the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) is [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md); and
that which is born of the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) is
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be
born again.  

<span id="008">8</span> The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou
hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and
whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> [Nicodemus](../ebd/ebd272.htm#005.md) answered and
said unto him, How can these things be?  

<span id="010">10</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered and
said unto him, Art thou a master of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and
knowest not these things?  

<span id="011">11</span> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that
we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> If I have told you earthly things, and ye
believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?  

<span id="013">13</span> And no man hath ascended up to
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), but he that came down from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), even the Son of man which is in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And as [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) lifted up
the [serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009.md) in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), even so must the Son of man be
lifted up:  

<span id="015">15</span> That whosoever believeth in him should not
perish, but have eternal life.  

<span id="016">16</span> For God so loved the world, that he gave his
only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
but have [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) life.  

<span id="017">17</span> For God sent not his Son into the world to
condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  

<span id="018">18</span> He that believeth on him is not condemned: but
he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed
in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  

<span id="019">19</span> And this is the condemnation, that light is
come into the world, and men loved [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md)
rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  

<span id="020">20</span> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light,
neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  

<span id="021">21</span> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light,
that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.  

<span id="022">22</span> After these things came
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) and his disciples into the land of
Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.  

<span id="023">23</span> And John also was baptizing in
[Aenon](../ebd/ebd011.htm#003) near to [Salim](../ebd/ebd319.htm#002.md),
because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.  

<span id="024">24</span> For John was not yet cast into
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> Then there arose a question between some of
John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.  

<span id="026">26</span> And they came unto John, and said unto him,
[Rabbi](../ebd/ebd304.htm#006.md), he that was with thee beyond
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), to whom thou barest
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md), behold, the same baptizeth, and all
men come to him.  

<span id="027">27</span> John answered and said, A man can receive
nothing, except it be given him from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> Ye yourselves bear me
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md), that I said, I am not the
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), but that I am sent before him.  

<span id="029">29</span> He that hath the [bride](../ebd/ebd065.htm#001.md)
is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and
heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this
my joy therefore is fulfilled.  

<span id="030">30</span> He must increase, but I must decrease.  

<span id="031">31</span> He that cometh from above is above all: he that
is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh
from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) is above all.  

<span id="032">32</span> And what he hath seen and heard, that he
testifieth; and no man receiveth his
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> He that hath received his
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md) hath set to his
[seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002.md) that God is true.  

<span id="034">34</span> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of
God: for God giveth not the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) by measure
unto him.  

<span id="035">35</span> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all
things into his hand.  

<span id="036">36</span> He that believeth on the Son hath
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) life: and he that believeth not the
Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.
