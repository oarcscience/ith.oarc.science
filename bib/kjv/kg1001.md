### King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> Now [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) was old and stricken in years; and they
covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.  

<span id="002">2</span> Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there
be sought for my lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) a young
[virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009.md): and let her stand before the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and let her cherish him, and let her lie
in thy [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md), that my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) may get heat.  

<span id="003">3</span> So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all
the coasts of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and found
[Abishag](../ebd/ebd004.htm#004) a [Shunammite](../ebd/ebd342.htm#000.md),
and brought her to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and ministered to him: but the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) knew her not.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then [Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006.md) the son
of [Haggith](../ebd/ebd158.htm#009.md) exalted himself, saying, I will be
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md): and he prepared him chariots and
horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.  

<span id="006">6</span> And his father had not displeased him at any
time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly
man; and his mother bare him after [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And he conferred with
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) the son of
[Zeruiah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#009.md), and with
[Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md):
and they following [Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006.md) helped him.  

<span id="008">8</span> But [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008.md) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and [Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003.md)
the son of [Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md), and
[Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md),
and [Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002), and [Rei](../ebd/ebd310.htm#000.md),
and the mighty men which belonged to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md),
were not with [Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006.md) slew
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) and oxen and [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md)
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) by the [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) of
[Zoheleth](../ebd/ebd395.htm#007.md), which is by Enrogel, and called all
his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) the king's servants:  

<span id="010">10</span> But [Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), and [Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003.md),
and the mighty men, and [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) his brother, he
called not.  

<span id="011">11</span> Wherefore [Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md) spake
unto Bathsheba the mother of [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), saying,
Hast thou not heard that [Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006.md) the son of
[Haggith](../ebd/ebd158.htm#009.md) doth reign, and
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) our lord knoweth it not?  

<span id="012">12</span> Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give
thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy
son [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> Go and get thee in unto
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and say
unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),
swear unto thine [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md), saying, Assuredly
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) thy son shall reign after me, and he
shall sit upon my [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md)? why then doth
[Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006.md) reign?  

<span id="014">14</span> Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), I also will come in after thee, and
confirm thy words.  

<span id="015">15</span> And Bathsheba went in unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) into the [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md):
and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) was very old; and
[Abishag](../ebd/ebd004.htm#004) the [Shunammite](../ebd/ebd342.htm#000.md)
ministered unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And Bathsheba bowed, and did
[obeisance](../ebd/ebd276.htm#006.md) unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001). And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
said, What wouldest thou?  

<span id="017">17</span> And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by
the LORD thy God unto thine [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md), saying,
Assuredly [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) thy son shall reign after me,
and he shall sit upon my [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And now, behold,
[Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006.md) reigneth; and now, my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), thou knowest it not:  

<span id="019">19</span> And he hath slain oxen and
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) and
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) in abundance, and hath called all the
sons of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and
[Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md),
and [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) the captain of the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007): but [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) thy
servant hath he not called.  

<span id="020">20</span> And thou, my lord, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), the eyes of all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell
them who shall sit on the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) after him.  

<span id="021">21</span> Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) shall sleep with his fathers, that I
and my son [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) shall be counted
offenders.  

<span id="022">22</span> And, lo, while she yet talked with the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), [Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) also came in.  

<span id="023">23</span> And they told the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), saying, Behold
[Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md).
And when he was come in before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), he
bowed himself before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) with his face to
the ground.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md) said, My
lord, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), hast thou said,
[Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006.md) shall reign after me, and he shall sit
upon my [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md)?  

<span id="025">25</span> For he is gone down this day, and hath slain
oxen and [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md)
and [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) in abundance, and hath called all the
king's sons, and the captains of the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md), and
[Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md);
and, behold, they eat and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) before him, and
say, God save [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> But me, even me thy servant, and
[Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), and
[Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003.md) the son of
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md), and thy servant
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), hath he not called.  

<span id="027">27</span> Is this thing done by my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and thou hast not shewed it unto thy
servant, who should sit on the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of my
lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) after him?  

<span id="028">28</span> Then [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And
she came into the king's presence, and stood before the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) sware,
and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all
distress,  

<span id="030">30</span> Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), saying, Assuredly
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) thy son shall reign after me, and he
shall sit upon my [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) in my stead; even so
will I certainly do this day.  

<span id="031">31</span> Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the
earth, and did reverence to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and said,
Let my lord [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
live for ever.  

<span id="032">32</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said, Call me
[Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), and
[Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md),
and [Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003.md) the son of
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md). And they came before the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> The [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) also said
unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) my son to ride upon mine own
[mule](../ebd/ebd262.htm#001.md), and bring him down to
[Gihon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#007.md):  

<span id="034">34</span> And let [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008.md) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) and [Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) [anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008.md) him
there [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and blow ye with the trumpet, and say,
God save [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md).  

<span id="035">35</span> Then ye shall come up after him, that he may
come and sit upon my [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md); for he shall be
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) in my stead: and I have appointed him to
be ruler over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) and over
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="036">36</span> And [Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003.md) the son of
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md) answered the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and said, [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md):
the LORD God of my lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) say so too.  

<span id="037">37</span> As the LORD hath been with my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), even so be he with
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), and make his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) greater than the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of my lord [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md).  

<span id="038">38</span> So [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008.md) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and [Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), and [Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003.md)
the son of [Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md), and the Cherethites, and
the [Pelethites](../ebd/ebd289.htm#000.md), went down, and caused
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) to ride upon
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) David's [mule](../ebd/ebd262.htm#001.md), and
brought him to [Gihon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#007.md).  

<span id="039">39</span> And [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008.md) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) took an [horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003.md) of
oil out of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), and anointed
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md). And they blew the trumpet; and all the
people said, God save [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md).  

<span id="040">40</span> And all the people came up after him, and the
people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) with the sound of them.  

<span id="041">41</span> And [Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006.md) and all
the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of
[eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006). And when [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md)
heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the
city being in an uproar?  

<span id="042">42</span> And while he yet spake, behold,
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) the son of
[Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
came; and [Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006.md) said unto him, Come in; for
thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.  

<span id="043">43</span> And [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) answered
and said to [Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006.md), Verily our lord
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) hath made
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="044">44</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) hath sent
with him [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008.md) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and [Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), and [Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003.md)
the son of [Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009.md), and the Cherethites, and
the [Pelethites](../ebd/ebd289.htm#000.md), and they have caused him to
ride upon the king's [mule](../ebd/ebd262.htm#001.md):  

<span id="045">45</span> And [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008.md) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) and [Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) have anointed him
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) in [Gihon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#007.md): and
they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again.
This is the noise that ye have heard.  

<span id="046">46</span> And also [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md)
sitteth on the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of the kingdom.  

<span id="047">47</span> And moreover the king's servants came to
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) our lord [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), saying, God make the name of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) better than thy name, and make his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) greater than thy
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001). And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
bowed himself upon the bed.  

<span id="048">48</span> And also thus said the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), Blessed be the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), which hath given one to sit on my
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) this day, mine eyes even seeing it.  

<span id="049">49</span> And all the guests that were with
[Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006.md) were afraid, and rose up, and went
every man his way.  

<span id="050">50</span> And [Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006.md) feared
because of [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), and arose, and went, and
caught hold on the horns of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md).  

<span id="051">51</span> And it was told
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), saying, Behold,
[Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006) feareth [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md): for, lo, he hath caught hold on the
horns of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), saying, Let
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) swear
unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md).  

<span id="052">52</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) said, If
he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall
to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.  

<span id="053">53</span> So [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) sent, and they brought him down from
the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md). And he came and bowed himself to
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md): and
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) said unto him, Go to thine house.
