### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> And [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md) had seventy
sons in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md). And
[Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md) wrote letters, and sent to
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md), unto the rulers of
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008.md), to the elders, and to them that
brought up Ahab's children, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing
your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and
horses, a fenced city also, and [armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006.md);  

<span id="003">3</span> Look even out the best and meetest of your
master's sons, and set him on his father's
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md), and fight for your master's house.  

<span id="004">4</span> But they were exceedingly afraid, and said,
Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?  

<span id="005">5</span> And he that was over the house, and he that was
over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up of the children,
sent to [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md), saying, We are thy servants, and
will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md): do thou that which is good in thine
eyes.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then he wrote a letter the second time to them,
saying, If ye be mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the
heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008.md) by to morrow this time. Now the king's
sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which
brought them up.  

<span id="007">7</span> And it came to pass, when the letter came to
them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put
their heads in baskets, and sent him them to
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And there came a
[messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005.md), and told him, saying, They have
brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two
heaps at the entering in of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) until the
morning.  

<span id="009">9</span> And it came to pass in the morning, that he went
out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I
conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?  

<span id="010">10</span> Know now that there shall fall unto the earth
nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the
house of [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md): for the LORD hath done that
which he spake by his servant [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> So [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md) slew all that
remained of the house of [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md) in
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008.md), and all his great men, and his
kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he arose and departed, and came to
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md). And as he was at the shearing house in
the way,  

<span id="013">13</span> [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md) met with the
brethren of [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and
said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of
[Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006.md); and we go down to salute the children
of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) and the children of the
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And he said, Take them alive. And they took
them alive, and slew them at the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md) of the
shearing house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.  

<span id="015">15</span> And when he was departed thence, he lighted on
[Jehonadab](../ebd/ebd201.htm#003.md) the son of
[Rechab](../ebd/ebd308.htm#002.md) coming to meet him: and he saluted him,
and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?
And [Jehonadab](../ebd/ebd201.htm#003.md) answered, It is. If it be, give
me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into
the [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And he said, Come with me, and see my
[zeal](../ebd/ebd388.htm#003.md) for the LORD. So they made him ride in his
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And when he came to
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md), he slew all that remained unto
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md), till
he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he
spake to [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md) gathered all
the people together, and said unto them, [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md)
served [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md) a little; but
[Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md) shall serve him much.  

<span id="019">19</span> Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md), all his servants, and all his priests;
let none be wanting: for I have a great
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) to do to
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md); whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not
live. But [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md) did it in subtilty, to the
intent that he might destroy the worshippers of
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md) said,
Proclaim a solemn assembly for [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md). And they
proclaimed it.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md) sent through
all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and all the worshippers of
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md) came, so that there was not a man left
that came not. And they came into the house of
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md); and the house of
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md) was full from one end to another.  

<span id="022">22</span> And he said unto him that was over the vestry,
Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md). And he brought them forth vestments.  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md) went, and
[Jehonadab](../ebd/ebd201.htm#003.md) the son of
[Rechab](../ebd/ebd308.htm#002.md), into the house of
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md), and said unto the worshippers of
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md), Search, and look that there be here with
you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md) only.  

<span id="024">24</span> And when they went in to offer sacrifices and
burnt offerings, [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md) appointed fourscore men
without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands
escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.  

<span id="025">25</span> And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an
end of [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), that [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md)
said to the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md) and to the captains, Go in,
and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of
the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md); and the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md) and the captains cast them out, and went
to the city of the house of [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And they brought forth the images out of the
house of [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md), and burned them.  

<span id="027">27</span> And they brake down the image of
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md), and brake down the house of
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md), and made it a draught house unto this
day.  

<span id="028">28</span> Thus [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md) destroyed
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004) out of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> Howbeit from the sins of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) the son of
[Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003), who made [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md) departed
not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md), and that were in
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> And the LORD said unto
[Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md), Because thou hast done well in executing
that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md) according to all that was in mine heart,
thy children of the fourth [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) shall sit
on the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> But [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md) took no heed
to walk in the law of the LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md), which made
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> In those days the LORD began to cut
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) short: and
[Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003.md) smote them in all the coasts of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md);  

<span id="033">33</span> From [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) eastward,
all the land of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md), the Gadites, and the
Reubenites, and the Manassites, from [Aroer](../ebd/ebd032.htm#001.md),
which is by the river [Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000.md), even
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009) and [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003.md).  

<span id="034">34</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md), and all that he did, and all his might,
are they not written in the book of the
[chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003.md) of the kings of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="035">35</span> And [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md) slept with
his fathers: and they buried him in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md).
And [Jehoahaz](../ebd/ebd200.htm#006.md) his son reigned in his stead.  

<span id="036">36</span> And the time that [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md)
reigned over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) in
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md) was twenty and eight years.
