### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 74

<span id="001">1</span> O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why
doth thine [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) smoke against the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) of thy pasture?  

<span id="002">2</span> Remember thy
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), which thou hast purchased of old;
the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), wherein
thou hast dwelt.  

<span id="003">3</span> Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations;
even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy
congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.  

<span id="005">5</span> A man was famous according as he had lifted up
axes upon the thick trees.  

<span id="006">6</span> But now they break down the carved work thereof
at once with axes and hammers.  

<span id="007">7</span> They have cast fire into thy
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md), they have defiled by casting down
the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.  

<span id="008">8</span> They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them
together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.  

<span id="009">9</span> We see not our signs: there is no more any
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md): neither is there among us any that
knoweth how long.  

<span id="010">10</span> O God, how long shall the
[adversary](../ebd/ebd011.htm#001.md) reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme
thy name for ever?  

<span id="011">11</span> Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right
hand? pluck it out of thy [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> For God is my [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
old, working [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) in the midst of the
earth.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou
brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.  

<span id="014">14</span> Thou brakest the heads of
[leviathan](../ebd/ebd227.htm#007) in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md),
and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> Thou didst cleave the
[fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md) and the
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000.md): thou driedst up mighty rivers.  

<span id="016">16</span> The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou
hast prepared the light and the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Thou hast set all the borders of the earth:
thou hast made summer and winter.  

<span id="018">18</span> Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached,
O LORD, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.  

<span id="019">19</span> O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto
the multitude of the wicked: forget not the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of thy
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) for ever.  

<span id="020">20</span> Have respect unto the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md): for the dark places of the earth are
full of the habitations of cruelty.  

<span id="021">21</span> O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) and needy praise thy name.  

<span id="022">22</span> Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember
how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.  

<span id="023">23</span> Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the
tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.
