### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> The word that came to
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) from the LORD saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Hear ye the words of this
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), and speak unto the men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and to the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005);  

<span id="003">3</span> And say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD God
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); Cursed be the man that obeyeth not
the words of this [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008),  

<span id="004">4</span> Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I
brought them forth out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009),
from the [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004) [furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000),
saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command
you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God:  

<span id="005">5</span> That I may perform the
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) which I have sworn unto your fathers, to
give them a land flowing with [milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000) and
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001), as it is this day. Then answered I, and
said, So be it, O LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these
words in the cities of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and in the
streets of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), saying, Hear ye the words
of this [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), and do them.  

<span id="007">7</span> For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in
the day that I brought them up out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), even unto this day, rising early and
protesting, saying, Obey my voice.  

<span id="008">8</span> Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004), but walked every one in the imagination of
their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), which I commanded them to do: but
they did them not.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found
among the men of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and among the
inhabitants of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="010">10</span> They are turned back to the iniquities of their
forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other
gods to serve them: the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and the
house of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) have broken my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) which I made with their fathers.  

<span id="011">11</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will
bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though
they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then shall the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) go, and cry unto the gods unto whom
they offer [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002): but they shall not save
them at all in the time of their trouble.  

<span id="013">13</span> For according to the number of thy cities were
thy gods, O [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007); and according to the number
of the streets of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) have ye set up
altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) unto [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004).  

<span id="014">14</span> Therefore pray not thou for this people,
neither lift up a cry or [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) for them: for I
will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their
trouble.  

<span id="015">15</span> What hath my beloved to do in mine house,
seeing she hath wrought [lewdness](../ebd/ebd228.htm#002) with many, and
the holy [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) is passed from thee? when thou
doest evil, then thou rejoicest.  

<span id="016">16</span> The LORD called thy name, A green
[olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009) tree, fair, and of goodly
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000): with the noise of a great tumult he hath
kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.  

<span id="017">17</span> For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath
pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and of the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), which they have done against themselves
to provoke me to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) in
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) unto
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004).  

<span id="018">18</span> And the LORD hath given me knowledge of it, and
I know it: then thou shewedst me their doings.  

<span id="019">19</span> But I was like a [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003)
or an [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) that is brought to the slaughter; and
I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us
destroy the tree with the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) thereof, and
let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no
more remembered.  

<span id="020">20</span> But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously,
that triest the [reins](../ebd/ebd310.htm#001) and the heart, let me see
thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause.  

<span id="021">21</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of
[Anathoth](../ebd/ebd023.htm#004), that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy
not in the name of the LORD, that thou die not by our hand:  

<span id="022">22</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold,
I will punish them: the young men shall die by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003); their sons and their daughters shall die
by [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000):  

<span id="023">23</span> And there shall be no remnant of them: for I
will bring evil upon the men of [Anathoth](../ebd/ebd023.htm#004), even
the year of their visitation.
