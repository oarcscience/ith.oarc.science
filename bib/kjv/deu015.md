### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> At the end of every
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) years thou shalt make a release.  

<span id="002">2</span> And this is the manner of the release: Every
creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he
shall not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is
called the LORD's release.  

<span id="003">3</span> Of a [foreigner](../ebd/ebd137.htm#003.md) thou
mayest exact it again: but that which is thine with thy brother thine
hand shall release;  

<span id="004">4</span> Save when there shall be no
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) among you; for the LORD shall greatly
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) thee in the land which the LORD thy God
giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it:  

<span id="005">5</span> Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of
the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I
command thee this day.  

<span id="006">6</span> For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he
promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not
[borrow](../ebd/ebd062.htm#007.md); and thou shalt reign over many nations,
but they shall not reign over thee.  

<span id="007">7</span> If there be among you a
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) man of one of thy brethren within any of
thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not
harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) brother:  

<span id="008">8</span> But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him,
and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he
wanteth.  

<span id="009">9</span> Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked
heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and
thine eye be evil against thy [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) brother, and
thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) unto thee.  

<span id="010">10</span> Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart
shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this
thing the LORD thy God shall [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) thee in all
thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.  

<span id="011">11</span> For the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) shall
never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou
shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), and to thy needy, in thy land.  

<span id="012">12</span> And if thy brother, an
[Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009.md) man, or an
[Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009.md) woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee
six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from
thee.  

<span id="013">13</span> And when thou sendest him out free from thee,
thou shalt not let him go away empty:  

<span id="014">14</span> Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy
flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith
the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.  

<span id="015">15</span> And thou shalt remember that thou wast a
bondman in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and the LORD thy
God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to day.  

<span id="016">16</span> And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will
not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because
he is well with thee;  

<span id="017">17</span> Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it
through his [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) unto the door, and he shall be
thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do
likewise.  

<span id="018">18</span> It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou
sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired
servant to thee, in serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) thee in all that thou doest.  

<span id="019">19</span> All the firstling males that come of thy
[herd](../ebd/ebd174.htm#009.md) and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto
the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003.md), nor shear the firstling of thy
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year
by year in the place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy
household.  

<span id="021">21</span> And if there be any
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md) therein, as if it be lame, or
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md), or have any ill
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md), thou shalt not
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) it unto the LORD thy God.  

<span id="022">22</span> Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean
and the [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) person shall eat it alike, as the
roebuck, and as the [hart](../ebd/ebd165.htm#004.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> Only thou shalt not eat the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) thereof; thou shalt pour it upon the
ground as water.
