### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> And God spake all these words, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee
out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), out of the house of
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> Thou shalt have no other gods before me.  

<span id="004">4</span> Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image,
or any likeness of any thing that is in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)
above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under
the earth.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thou shalt not [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) down
thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous
God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the
third and fourth [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) of them that hate
me;  

<span id="006">6</span> And shewing [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) unto
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md) of them that love me, and keep my
commandments.  

<span id="007">7</span> Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God
in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name
in vain.  

<span id="008">8</span> Remember the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md)
day, to keep it holy.  

<span id="009">9</span> Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy
work:  

<span id="010">10</span> But the seventh day is the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt
not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant,
nor thy maidservant, nor thy [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), nor thy
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) that is within thy gates:  

<span id="011">11</span> For in six days the LORD made
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) and earth, the sea, and all that in them
is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) day, and hallowed it.  

<span id="012">12</span> Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days
may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou shalt not kill.  

<span id="014">14</span> Thou shalt not commit
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> Thou shalt not steal.  

<span id="016">16</span> Thou shalt not bear false
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) against thy neighbour.  

<span id="017">17</span> Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house,
thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his
maidservant, nor his [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007.md), nor his
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md), nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.  

<span id="018">18</span> And all the people saw the thunderings, and the
lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and
when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.  

<span id="019">19</span> And they said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Speak thou with us, and we will hear:
but let not God speak with us, lest we die.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said unto
the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear
may be before your faces, that ye [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) not.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the people stood afar off, and
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) drew near unto the thick
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) where God was.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Thus thou shalt say unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), Ye have seen that I have talked with
you from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> Ye shall not make with me gods of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), neither shall ye make unto you gods of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> An [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) of earth thou
shalt make unto me, and shalt [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) thereon
thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), and thine oxen: in all places where I
record my name I will come unto thee, and I will
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) thee.  

<span id="025">25</span> And if thou wilt make me an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), thou
shalt not build it of hewn [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md): for if thou
lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.  

<span id="026">26</span> Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), that thy nakedness be not discovered
thereon.
