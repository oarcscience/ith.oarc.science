### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 30

<span id="001">1</span> Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD,
that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but
not of my [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), that they may add
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006):  

<span id="002">2</span> That walk to go down into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and have not asked at my mouth; to
strengthen themselves in the strength of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), and to trust in the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009)!  

<span id="003">3</span> Therefore shall the strength of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) be your shame, and the trust in the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) your
confusion.  

<span id="004">4</span> For his princes were at
[Zoan](../ebd/ebd395.htm#003), and his ambassadors came to
[Hanes](../ebd/ebd163.htm#000).  

<span id="005">5</span> They were all ashamed of a people that could not
profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a
reproach.  

<span id="006">6</span> The [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) of the
beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence
come the young and old lion, the [viper](../ebd/ebd377.htm#008) and
fiery flying [serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009), they will carry their
riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the
bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them.  

<span id="007">7</span> For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no
purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to
sit still.  

<span id="008">8</span> Now go, write it before them in a table, and
note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and
ever:  

<span id="009">9</span> That this is a rebellious people, lying
children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD:  

<span id="010">10</span> Which say to the seers, See not; and to the
prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth
things, prophesy deceits:  

<span id="011">11</span> Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the
path, cause the Holy One of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to cease
from before us.  

<span id="012">12</span> Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Because ye despise this word, and trust
in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:  

<span id="013">13</span> Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a
[breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005) ready to fall,
[swelling](../ebd/ebd354.htm#001) out in a high wall, whose breaking
cometh suddenly at an instant.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he shall break it as the breaking of the
potters' vessel that is broken in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002); he
shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it
a sherd to take fire from the [hearth](../ebd/ebd170.htm#002), or to
take water withal out of the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007).  

<span id="015">15</span> For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); In returning and rest shall ye be
saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye
would not.  

<span id="016">16</span> But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses;
therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore
shall they that pursue you be swift.  

<span id="017">17</span> One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one;
at the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a
[beacon](../ebd/ebd048.htm#004) upon the top of a mountain, and as an
[ensign](../ebd/ebd121.htm#008) on an hill.  

<span id="018">18</span> And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may
be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) upon you: for the LORD is a God of
judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.  

<span id="019">19</span> For the people shall dwell in
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002) at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005):
thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice
of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.  

<span id="020">20</span> And though the Lord give you the
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) of adversity, and the water of
affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any
more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:  

<span id="021">21</span> And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee,
saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand,
and when ye turn to the left.  

<span id="022">22</span> Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven
images of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and the ornament of thy
molten images of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001): thou shalt cast them
away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.  

<span id="023">23</span> Then shall he give the
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the
ground withal; and [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) of the increase of the
earth, and it shall be [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) and plenteous: in
that day shall thy [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) feed in large
pastures.  

<span id="024">24</span> The oxen likewise and the young asses that
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) the ground shall eat
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) provender, which hath been winnowed with
the shovel and with the [fan](../ebd/ebd131.htm#001).  

<span id="025">25</span> And there shall be upon every high mountain,
and upon every high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the
great slaughter, when the [towers](../ebd/ebd371.htm#002) fall.  

<span id="026">26</span> Moreover the light of the
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004) shall be as the light of the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), and the light of the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) shall be sevenfold, as the light of
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up
the [breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005) of his people, and healeth the
stroke of their wound.  

<span id="027">27</span> Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far,
burning with his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), and the
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) thereof is heavy: his lips are full of
indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:  

<span id="028">28</span> And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall
reach to the midst of the [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000), to sift the
nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a
[bridle](../ebd/ebd065.htm#002) in the jaws of the people, causing them
to err.  

<span id="029">29</span> Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a
holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a
[pipe](../ebd/ebd296.htm#000) to come into the mountain of the LORD, to
the mighty One of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="030">30</span> And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to
be heard, and shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the
indignation of his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), and with the flame of
a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.  

<span id="031">31</span> For through the voice of the LORD shall the
Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod.  

<span id="032">32</span> And in every place where the grounded staff
shall pass, which the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets
and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.  

<span id="033">33</span> For [Tophet](../ebd/ebd370.htm#007) is ordained
of old; yea, for the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) it is prepared; he
hath made it [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008) and large: the pile thereof
is fire and much [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003); the breath of the LORD,
like a stream of [brimstone](../ebd/ebd065.htm#005), doth kindle it.
