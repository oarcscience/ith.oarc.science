### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 106

<span id="001">1</span> Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD;
for he is good: for his [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) endureth for
ever.  

<span id="002">2</span> Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who
can shew forth all his praise?  

<span id="003">3</span> Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that
doeth [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) at all times.  

<span id="004">4</span> Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou
bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003);  

<span id="005">5</span> That I may see the good of thy
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008), that I may rejoice in the gladness of
thy nation, that I may [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) with thine
inheritance.  

<span id="006">6</span> We have sinned with our fathers, we have
committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.  

<span id="007">7</span> Our fathers understood not thy wonders in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009); they remembered not the multitude of thy
mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.  

<span id="008">8</span> Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake,
that he might make his mighty power to be known.  

<span id="009">9</span> He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried
up: so he led them through the depths, as through the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005).  

<span id="010">10</span> And he saved them from the hand of him that
hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the waters covered their enemies: there was
not one of them left.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then believed they his words; they sang his
praise.  

<span id="013">13</span> They soon forgat his works; they waited not for
his counsel:  

<span id="014">14</span> But lusted exceedingly in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), and tempted God in the
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000).  

<span id="015">15</span> And he gave them their request; but sent
leanness into their soul.  

<span id="016">16</span> They envied [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) also
in the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002), and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001)
the saint of the LORD.  

<span id="017">17</span> The earth opened and swallowed up
[Dathan](../ebd/ebd098.htm#002) and covered the company of
[Abiram](../ebd/ebd004.htm#003).  

<span id="018">18</span> And a fire was kindled in their company; the
flame burned up the wicked.  

<span id="019">19</span> They made a [calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004) in
[Horeb](../ebd/ebd181.htm#009), and worshipped the molten image.  

<span id="020">20</span> Thus they changed their
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) into the similitude of an
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) that eateth
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005).  

<span id="021">21</span> They forgat God their
[saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003), which had done great things in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009);  

<span id="022">22</span> Wondrous works in the land of
[Ham](../ebd/ebd160.htm#003), and terrible things by the Red sea.  

<span id="023">23</span> Therefore he said that he would destroy them,
had not [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) his
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) stood before him in the
[breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005), to turn away his wrath, lest he should
destroy them.  

<span id="024">24</span> Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they
believed not his word:  

<span id="025">25</span> But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not
unto the voice of the LORD.  

<span id="026">26</span> Therefore he lifted up his hand against them,
to overthrow them in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005):  

<span id="027">27</span> To overthrow their seed also among the nations,
and to scatter them in the lands.  

<span id="028">28</span> They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and
ate the sacrifices of the dead.  

<span id="029">29</span> Thus they provoked him to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) with their inventions: and the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) brake in upon them.  

<span id="030">30</span> Then stood up
[Phinehas](../ebd/ebd294.htm#003), and executed judgment: and so the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) was stayed.  

<span id="031">31</span> And that was counted unto him for
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) unto all generations for
evermore.  

<span id="032">32</span> They angered him also at the waters of strife,
so that it went ill with [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) for their
sakes:  

<span id="033">33</span> Because they provoked his
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), so that he spake unadvisedly with his
lips.  

<span id="034">34</span> They did not destroy the nations, concerning
whom the LORD commanded them:  

<span id="035">35</span> But were mingled among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), and learned their works.  

<span id="036">36</span> And they served their idols: which were a
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009) unto them.  

<span id="037">37</span> Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their
daughters unto devils,  

<span id="038">38</span> And shed innocent
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), even the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000)
of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the
idols of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005): and the land was polluted with
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000).  

<span id="039">39</span> Thus were they defiled with their own works,
and went a whoring with their own inventions.  

<span id="040">40</span> Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled
against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.  

<span id="041">41</span> And he gave them into the hand of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005); and they that hated them ruled over
them.  

<span id="042">42</span> Their enemies also oppressed them, and they
were brought into subjection under their hand.  

<span id="043">43</span> Many times did he deliver them; but they
provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their
iniquity.  

<span id="044">44</span> Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when
he heard their cry:  

<span id="045">45</span> And he remembered for them his
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), and repented according to the
multitude of his mercies.  

<span id="046">46</span> He made them also to be pitied of all those
that carried them captives.  

<span id="047">47</span> Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from
among the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), to give thanks unto thy holy
name, and to triumph in thy praise.  

<span id="048">48</span> Blessed be the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) from
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) to
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007): and let all the people say,
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001). Praise ye the LORD.
