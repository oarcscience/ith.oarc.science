### King James Version: Hosea Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> The word of the LORD that came unto
[Hosea](../ebd/ebd183.htm#003.md), the son of
[Beeri](../ebd/ebd050.htm#004.md), in the days of
[Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004), [Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000.md),
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005), and [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md),
kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and in the days of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) the son of
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000), [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> The beginning of the word of the LORD by
[Hosea](../ebd/ebd183.htm#003.md). And the LORD said to
[Hosea](../ebd/ebd183.htm#003.md), Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms
and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom,
departing from the LORD.  

<span id="003">3</span> So he went and took
[Gomer](../ebd/ebd152.htm#006.md) the daughter of
[Diblaim](../ebd/ebd103.htm#003.md); which conceived, and bare him a son.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the LORD said unto him, Call his name
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008.md); for yet a little while, and I will
avenge the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008.md) upon the house of
[Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md), and will cause to cease the kingdom of
the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And it shall come to pass at that day, that I
will break the [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), in the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md)
of [Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And she conceived again, and bare a daughter.
And God said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) upon the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); but I will utterly take them away.  

<span id="007">7</span> But I will have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md)
upon the house of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and will save them by
the LORD their God, and will not save them by
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003), nor by [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), nor
by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.  

<span id="008">8</span> Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she
conceived, and bare a son.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are
not my people, and I will not be your God.  

<span id="010">10</span> Yet the number of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) shall be as the sand of the sea, which
cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the
place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall
be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then shall the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) be gathered together, and appoint
themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great
shall be the day of [Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008.md).
