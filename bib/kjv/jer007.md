### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> The word that came to
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) from the LORD, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Stand in the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of
the LORD's house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word
of the LORD, all ye of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), that enter in at
these gates to [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) the LORD.  

<span id="003">3</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Amend your ways and your doings, and I
will cause you to dwell in this place.  

<span id="004">4</span> Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of the LORD, The
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of the LORD, The
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of the LORD, are these.  

<span id="005">5</span> For if ye throughly amend your ways and your
doings; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his
neighbour;  

<span id="006">6</span> If ye oppress not the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), the fatherless, and the widow, and
shed not innocent [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) in this place, neither
walk after other gods to your hurt:  

<span id="007">7</span> Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in
the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.  

<span id="008">8</span> Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot
profit.  

<span id="009">9</span> Will ye steal, [murder](../ebd/ebd262.htm#002),
and commit [adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009), and swear falsely, and
burn [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) unto
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004), and walk after other gods whom ye know
not;  

<span id="010">10</span> And come and stand before me in this house,
which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these
abominations?  

<span id="011">11</span> Is this house, which is called by my name,
become a [den](../ebd/ebd101.htm#007) of robbers in your eyes? Behold,
even I have seen it, saith the LORD.  

<span id="012">12</span> But go ye now unto my place which was in
[Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008), where I set my name at the first, and
see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="013">13</span> And now, because ye have done all these works,
saith the LORD, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but
ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not;  

<span id="014">14</span> Therefore will I do unto this house, which is
called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to
you and to your fathers, as I have done to
[Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008).  

<span id="015">15</span> And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have
cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000).  

<span id="016">16</span> Therefore pray not thou for this people,
neither lift up cry nor [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) for them,
neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.  

<span id="017">17</span> Seest thou not what they do in the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and in the streets of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005)?  

<span id="018">18</span> The children gather
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and the fathers kindle the fire, and the
women [knead](../ebd/ebd221.htm#005) their
[dough](../ebd/ebd106.htm#006), to make cakes to the
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and
to pour out [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) offerings unto other gods,
that they may provoke me to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002).  

<span id="019">19</span> Do they provoke me to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002)? saith the LORD: do they not provoke
themselves to the confusion of their own faces?  

<span id="020">20</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, mine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) and my [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002)
shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), and upon the trees of the field, and
upon the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of the ground; and it shall
burn, and shall not be quenched.  

<span id="021">21</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); Put your burnt offerings unto your
sacrifices, and eat [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007).  

<span id="022">22</span> For I spake not unto your fathers, nor
commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), concerning burnt offerings or
sacrifices:  

<span id="023">23</span> But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey
my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye
in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto
you.  

<span id="024">24</span> But they hearkened not, nor inclined their
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004), but walked in the counsels and in the
imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.  

<span id="025">25</span> Since the day that your fathers came forth out
of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) unto this day I have even
sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and
sending them:  

<span id="026">26</span> Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined
their [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004), but hardened their
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000): they did worse than their fathers.  

<span id="027">27</span> Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto
them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them;
but they will not answer thee.  

<span id="028">28</span> But thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation
that obeyeth not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth
correction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.  

<span id="029">29</span> Cut off thine hair, O
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and cast it away, and take up a
[lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005) on high places; for the LORD hath
rejected and forsaken the [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) of his
wrath.  

<span id="030">30</span> For the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) have done evil in my sight, saith the
LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by
my name, to pollute it.  

<span id="031">31</span> And they have built the high places of
[Tophet](../ebd/ebd370.htm#007), which is in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of the son of
[Hinnom](../ebd/ebd179.htm#002), to burn their sons and their daughters
in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my
heart.  

<span id="032">32</span> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the
LORD, that it shall no more be called [Tophet](../ebd/ebd370.htm#007),
nor the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of the son of
[Hinnom](../ebd/ebd179.htm#002), but the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008)
of slaughter: for they shall bury in [Tophet](../ebd/ebd370.htm#007),
till there be no place.  

<span id="033">33</span> And the carcases of this people shall be meat
for the fowls of the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and for the beasts
of the earth; and none shall fray them away.  

<span id="034">34</span> Then will I cause to cease from the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and from the streets of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), the voice of mirth, and the voice of
gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the
[bride](../ebd/ebd065.htm#001): for the land shall be desolate.
