### King James Version: Micah Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and ye princes of the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); Is it not for you to know judgment?  

<span id="002">2</span> Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck
off their skin from off them, and their [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md)
from off their bones;  

<span id="003">3</span> Who also eat the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md)
of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their
bones, and chop them in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md), as for the pot,
and as [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) within the caldron.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will
not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as
they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that
make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he
that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.  

<span id="006">6</span> Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall
not have a [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md); and it shall be dark unto
you, that ye shall not divine; and the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md)
shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the
diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is
no answer of God.  

<span id="008">8</span> But truly I am full of power by the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the LORD, and of judgment, and of
might, to declare unto [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) his transgression,
and to [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) his
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and princes of the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), that abhor judgment, and pervert all
equity.  

<span id="010">10</span> They build up [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md)
with [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), and
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) with iniquity.  

<span id="011">11</span> The heads thereof
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) for reward, and the priests thereof teach
for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean
upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among us? none evil can come
upon us.  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore shall [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md)
for your sake be plowed as a field, and
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) shall become heaps, and the mountain
of the house as the high places of the
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006.md).
