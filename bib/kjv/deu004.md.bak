### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Now therefore hearken, O
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), unto the statutes and unto the
judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go
in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.  

<span id="002">2</span> Ye shall not add unto the word which I command
you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the
commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.  

<span id="003">3</span> Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of
Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath
destroyed them from among you.  

<span id="004">4</span> But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God
are alive every one of you this day.  

<span id="005">5</span> Behold, I have taught you statutes and
judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in
the land whither ye go to possess it.  

<span id="006">6</span> Keep therefore and do them; for this is your
wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall
hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) and understanding people.  

<span id="007">7</span> For what nation is there so great, who hath God
so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call
upon him for?  

<span id="008">8</span> And what nation is there so great, that hath
statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before
you this day?  

<span id="009">9</span> Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul
diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and
lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them
thy sons, and thy sons' sons;  

<span id="010">10</span> Specially the day that thou stoodest before the
LORD thy God in [Horeb](../ebd/ebd181.htm#009.md), when the LORD said unto
me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words,
that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon
the earth, and that they may teach their children.  

<span id="011">11</span> And ye came near and stood under the mountain;
and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), with [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md),
clouds, and thick [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of
the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only
ye heard a voice.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he declared unto you his
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md), which he commanded you to perform,
even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) of [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach
you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye
go over to possess it.  

<span id="015">15</span> Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves;
for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto
you in [Horeb](../ebd/ebd181.htm#009.md) out of the midst of the fire:  

<span id="016">16</span> Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a
graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or
female,  

<span id="017">17</span> The likeness of any
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) that is on the earth, the likeness of any
winged fowl that flieth in the air,  

<span id="018">18</span> The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the
ground, the likeness of any [fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005.md) that is in the
waters beneath the earth:  

<span id="019">19</span> And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and when thou seest the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), and the [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004.md), and
the [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md), even all the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md),
shouldest be driven to [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) them, and serve
them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the
whole [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you
forth out of the [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md)
[furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000.md), even out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), to be unto him a people of inheritance,
as ye are this day.  

<span id="021">21</span> Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your
sakes, and sware that I should not go over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), and that I should not go in unto that
good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:  

<span id="022">22</span> But I must die in this land, I must not go over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md): but ye shall go over, and possess that
good land.  

<span id="023">23</span> Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of the LORD your God, which he made
with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing,
which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.  

<span id="024">24</span> For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even
a jealous God.  

<span id="025">25</span> When thou shalt beget children, and children's
children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt
yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and
shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md):  

<span id="026">26</span> I call [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) and
earth to [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) against you this day, that ye
shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) to possess it; ye shall not prolong your
days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.  

<span id="027">27</span> And the LORD shall scatter you among the
nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), whither the LORD shall lead you.  

<span id="028">28</span> And there ye shall serve gods, the work of
men's hands, [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) and
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), which neither see, nor hear, nor eat,
nor smell.  

<span id="029">29</span> But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy
God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with
all thy soul.  

<span id="030">30</span> When thou art in
[tribulation](../ebd/ebd372.htm#005.md), and all these things are come upon
thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and
shalt be obedient unto his voice;  

<span id="031">31</span> (For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he
will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of thy fathers which he sware unto
them.  

<span id="032">32</span> For ask now of the days that are past, which
were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and
ask from the one side of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) unto the other,
whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath
been heard like it?  

<span id="033">33</span> Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking
out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?  

<span id="034">34</span> Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation
from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by
wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm,
and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for
you in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) before your eyes?  

<span id="035">35</span> Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest
know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him.  

<span id="036">36</span> Out of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) he made
thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he
shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst
of the fire.  

<span id="037">37</span> And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he
chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his
mighty power out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md);  

<span id="038">38</span> To drive out nations from before thee greater
and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land
for an inheritance, as it is this day.  

<span id="039">39</span> Know therefore this day, and consider it in
thine heart, that the LORD he is God in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)
above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.  

<span id="040">40</span> Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his
commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with
thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy
days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.  

<span id="041">41</span> Then [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) severed
three cities on this side [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) toward the
sunrising;  

<span id="042">42</span> That the slayer might flee thither, which
should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and
that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:  

<span id="043">43</span> Namely, [Bezer](../ebd/ebd058.htm#001.md) in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), in the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md) country, of the Reubenites; and
[Ramoth](../ebd/ebd307.htm#002) in [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md), of
the Gadites; and [Golan](../ebd/ebd152.htm#000.md) in
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003.md), of the Manassites.  

<span id="044">44</span> And this is the law which
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) set before the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):  

<span id="045">45</span> These are the testimonies, and the statutes,
and the judgments, which [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) spake unto the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), after they came forth out
of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="046">46</span> On this side [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md),
in the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) over against Bethpeor, in the
land of [Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md), who dwelt at
[Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009), whom [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md)
and the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) smote, after they
were come forth out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md):  

<span id="047">47</span> And they possessed his land, and the land of
[Og](../ebd/ebd277.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003.md), two kings of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md), which were on this side
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) toward the sunrising;  

<span id="048">48</span> From [Aroer](../ebd/ebd032.htm#001.md), which is
by the bank of the river [Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000.md), even unto
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Sion](../ebd/ebd345.htm#003.md), which is
[Hermon](../ebd/ebd175.htm#006.md),  

<span id="049">49</span> And all the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md) on
this side [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) eastward, even unto the sea of
the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md), under the springs of
[Pisgah](../ebd/ebd296.htm#004.md).
