### King James Version: Hosea Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> When [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) spake
trembling, he exalted himself in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); but
when he offended in [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md), he died.  

<span id="002">2</span> And now they [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) more
and more, and have made them molten images of their
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and idols according to their own
understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them,
Let the men that [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md)
[kiss](../ebd/ebd221.htm#000.md) the calves.  

<span id="003">3</span> Therefore they shall be as the morning
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md) and as the early
[dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008.md) that passeth away, as the
[chaff](../ebd/ebd075.htm#007.md) that is driven with the whirlwind out of
the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.  

<span id="004">4</span> Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and thou shalt know no god but me: for
there is no [saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003.md) beside me.  

<span id="005">5</span> I did know thee in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), in the land of great
[drought](../ebd/ebd108.htm#005.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> According to their pasture, so were they filled;
they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they
forgotten me.  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a
[leopard](../ebd/ebd227.htm#002.md) by the way will I observe them:  

<span id="008">8</span> I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of
her whelps, and will rend the [caul](../ebd/ebd074.htm#003.md) of their
heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) shall tear them.  

<span id="009">9</span> O [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), thou hast
destroyed thyself; but in me is thine help.  

<span id="010">10</span> I will be thy [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md):
where is any other that may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges
of whom thou saidst, Give me a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) and
princes?  

<span id="011">11</span> I gave thee a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) in
mine [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md), and took him away in my wrath.  

<span id="012">12</span> The iniquity of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md) is bound up; his
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) is hid.  

<span id="013">13</span> The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come
upon him: he is an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place
of the breaking forth of children.  

<span id="014">14</span> I will [ransom](../ebd/ebd307.htm#005.md) them
from the power of the [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md); I will redeem them
from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md), I will be thy
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md):
[repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008.md) shall be hid from mine eyes.  

<span id="015">15</span> Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) wind shall come, the wind of the LORD
shall come up from the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), and his
spring shall become dry, and his [fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md) shall
be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.  

<span id="016">16</span> [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md) shall become
desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md): their infants shall be dashed in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md), and their women with child shall be
ripped up.
