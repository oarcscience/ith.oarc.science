### King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> So all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) were
reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they were written in the book of
the kings of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) and
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), who were carried away to
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md) for their transgression.  

<span id="002">2</span> Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their
possessions in their cities were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites,
and the Nethinims.  

<span id="003">3</span> And in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) dwelt

<span id="013">13</span> And their brethren, heads of the house of their
fathers, a thousand and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) hundred and
threescore; very able men for the work of the service of the house of
God.  

<span id="014">14</span> And of the Levites;
[Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005.md) the son of Hasshub, the son of
Azrikam, the son of [Hashabiah](../ebd/ebd166.htm#001.md), of the sons of

<span id="015">15</span> And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and

[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md), the son of
[Elkanah](../ebd/ebd118.htm#005.md), that dwelt in the
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md) of the Netophathites.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the porters were,
[Shallum](../ebd/ebd330.htm#008), and [Akkub](../ebd/ebd016.htm#003.md),
and [Talmon](../ebd/ebd358.htm#002.md), and
[Ahiman](../ebd/ebd014.htm#003.md), and their brethren:
[Shallum](../ebd/ebd330.htm#008.md) was the chief;  

<span id="018">18</span> Who hitherto waited in the king's
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) eastward: they were porters in the
companies of the children of [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Shallum](../ebd/ebd330.htm#008.md) the son of
[Kore](../ebd/ebd222.htm#005.md), the son of Ebiasaph, the son of
[Korah](../ebd/ebd222.htm#003.md), and his brethren, of the house of his
father, the [Korahites](../ebd/ebd222.htm#004.md), were over the work of
the service, keepers of the gates of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md): and their fathers, being over the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of the LORD, were keepers of the entry.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Phinehas](../ebd/ebd294.htm#003.md) the son
of [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000.md) was the ruler over them in time
past, and the LORD was with him.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006.md) the son
of [Meshelemiah](../ebd/ebd250.htm#009.md) was
[porter](../ebd/ebd299.htm#000.md) of the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> All these which were
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) to be porters in the gates were two
hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy in their
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003), whom [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
and [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) the [seer](../ebd/ebd326.htm#000.md)
did ordain in their set office.  

<span id="023">23</span> So they and their children had the oversight of
the gates of the house of the LORD, namely, the house of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md), by wards.  

<span id="024">24</span> In four quarters were the porters, toward the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md), west, north, and south.  

<span id="025">25</span> And their brethren, which were in their
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md), were to come after
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days from time to time with them.  

<span id="026">26</span> For these Levites, the four chief porters, were
in their set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the
house of God.  

<span id="027">27</span> And they lodged round about the house of God,
because the charge was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning
pertained to them.  

<span id="028">28</span> And certain of them had the charge of the
ministering vessels, that they should bring them in and out by
[tale](../ebd/ebd357.htm#008.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> Some of them also were appointed to oversee the
vessels, and all the instruments of the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md), and the fine
[flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001), and the [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md),
and the oil, and the [frankincense](../ebd/ebd138.htm#004.md), and the
[spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005.md).  

<span id="030">30</span> And some of the sons of the priests made the
[ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007.md) of the
[spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Mattithiah](../ebd/ebd244.htm#006.md), one of
the Levites, who was the firstborn of [Shallum](../ebd/ebd330.htm#008.md)
the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made in the
pans.  

<span id="032">32</span> And other of their brethren, of the sons of the
[Kohathites](../ebd/ebd222.htm#002.md), were over the
[shewbread](../ebd/ebd336.htm#008.md), to prepare it every
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> And these are the singers, chief of the fathers
of the Levites, who remaining in the chambers were free: for they were
employed in that work day and night.  

<span id="034">34</span> These chief fathers of the Levites were chief
throughout their generations; these dwelt at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="035">35</span> And in [Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002.md) dwelt
the father of [Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002.md),
[Jehiel](../ebd/ebd200.htm#003.md), whose wife's name was
[Maachah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#004.md):  

<span id="036">36</span> And his firstborn son
[Abdon](../ebd/ebd001.htm#002), then [Zur](../ebd/ebd396.htm#005.md), and
[Kish](../ebd/ebd220.htm#007), and [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md), and
[Ner](../ebd/ebd270.htm#007), and [Nadab](../ebd/ebd264.htm#008.md).  

<span id="037">37</span> And [Gedor](../ebd/ebd145.htm#003.md), and
[Ahio](../ebd/ebd014.htm#007), and [Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006.md),
and [Mikloth](../ebd/ebd254.htm#005.md).  

<span id="038">38</span> And [Mikloth](../ebd/ebd254.htm#005.md) begat
Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their brethren at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), over against their brethren.  

<span id="039">39</span> And [Ner](../ebd/ebd270.htm#007.md) begat
[Kish](../ebd/ebd220.htm#007); and [Kish](../ebd/ebd220.htm#007.md) begat
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002); and [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) begat
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md), and Malchishua, and
[Abinadab](../ebd/ebd004.htm#001.md), and
[Eshbaal](../ebd/ebd124.htm#009.md).  

<span id="040">40</span> And the son of
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) was Meribbaal: and Meribbaal begat
[Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005.md).  

<span id="041">41</span> And the sons of [Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005.md)
were, Pithon, and [Melech](../ebd/ebd247.htm#005.md), and Tahrea, and
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005.md).  

<span id="042">42</span> And [Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005.md) begat Jarah;
and Jarah begat [Alemeth](../ebd/ebd016.htm#008.md), and
[Azmaveth](../ebd/ebd038.htm#000), and [Zimri](../ebd/ebd393.htm#009.md);
and [Zimri](../ebd/ebd393.htm#009.md) begat
[Moza](../ebd/ebd261.htm#007.md);  

<span id="043">43</span> And [Moza](../ebd/ebd261.htm#007.md) begat Binea;
and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, [Azel](../ebd/ebd037.htm#009.md) his
son.  

<span id="044">44</span> And [Azel](../ebd/ebd037.htm#009.md) had six sons,
whose names are these, Azrikam, Bocheru, and
[Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md), and Sheariah, and
[Obadiah](../ebd/ebd276.htm#001), and [Hanan](../ebd/ebd162.htm#001.md):
these were the sons of [Azel](../ebd/ebd037.htm#009.md).
