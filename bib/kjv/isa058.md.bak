### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 58

<span id="001">1</span> Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a
trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) their sins.  

<span id="002">2</span> Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my
ways, as a nation that did [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), and
forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of
[justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007.md); they take delight in approaching to
God.  

<span id="003">3</span> Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou
seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no
knowledge? Behold, in the day of your [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) ye
find pleasure, and exact all your labours.  

<span id="004">4</span> Behold, ye [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) for
strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall
not [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) as ye do this day, to make your voice
to be heard on high.  

<span id="005">5</span> Is it such a [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) that
I have [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md)? a day for a man to afflict his
soul? is it to [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md) down his head as a
[bulrush](../ebd/ebd066.htm#004.md), and to spread
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001) and [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000.md)
under him? wilt thou call this a [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md), and an
acceptable day to the LORD?  

<span id="006">6</span> Is not this the [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md)
that I have [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md)? to loose the
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003.md) of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens,
and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md)?  

<span id="007">7</span> Is it not to deal thy
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) to the hungry, and that thou bring the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) that are cast out to thy house? when thou
seest the [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003.md), that thou cover him; and that
thou hide not thyself from thine own [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md)?  

<span id="008">8</span> Then shall thy light break forth as the morning,
and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) shall go before thee; the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the LORD shall be thy
[rereward](../ebd/ebd311.htm#004.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer;
thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the
midst of thee the [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md), the putting forth of
the finger, and speaking vanity;  

<span id="010">10</span> And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry,
and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity,
and thy [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) be as the noon day:  

<span id="011">11</span> And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and
satisfy thy soul in [drought](../ebd/ebd108.htm#005.md), and make
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered
garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.  

<span id="012">12</span> And they that shall be of thee shall build the
old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many
generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the
[breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005.md), The restorer of paths to dwell in.  

<span id="013">13</span> If thou turn away thy foot from the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md), from doing thy pleasure on my holy
day; and call the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) a delight, the holy
of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways,
nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:  

<span id="014">14</span> Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD;
and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and
feed thee with the heritage of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) thy
father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.
