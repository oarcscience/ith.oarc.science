### King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> For we know that if our earthly house of this
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) were dissolved, we have a building
of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.  

<span id="002">2</span> For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be
clothed upon with our house which is from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md):  

<span id="003">3</span> If so be that being clothed we shall not be
found [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> For we that are in this
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) do groan, being burdened: not for
that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be
swallowed up of life.  

<span id="005">5</span> Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame
thing is God, who also hath given unto us the
[earnest](../ebd/ebd110.htm#006.md) of the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Therefore we are always confident, knowing that,
whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:  

<span id="007">7</span> (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)  

<span id="008">8</span> We are confident, I say, and willing rather to
be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.  

<span id="009">9</span> Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or
absent, we may be accepted of him.  

<span id="010">10</span> For we must all appear before the judgment seat
of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md); that every one may receive the
things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be
good or bad.  

<span id="011">11</span> Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we
persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are
made manifest in your consciences.  

<span id="012">12</span> For we commend not ourselves again unto you,
but give you occasion to [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) on our behalf,
that ye may have somewhat to answer them which
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) in appearance, and not in heart.  

<span id="013">13</span> For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to
God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.  

<span id="014">14</span> For the love of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
constraineth us; because we thus [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md), that if
one died for all, then were all dead:  

<span id="015">15</span> And that he died for all, that they which live
should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for
them, and rose again.  

<span id="016">16</span> Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md): yea, though we have known
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) after the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), yet now henceforth know we him no
more.  

<span id="017">17</span> Therefore if any man be in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), he is a new
[creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004.md): old things are passed away; behold,
all things are become new.  

<span id="018">18</span> And all things are of God, who hath reconciled
us to himself by [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), and hath given to us the ministry of
[reconciliation](../ebd/ebd308.htm#004.md);  

<span id="019">19</span> To wit, that God was in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), reconciling the world unto himself, not
imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word
of [reconciliation](../ebd/ebd308.htm#004.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> Now then we are ambassadors for
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), as though God did beseech you by us: we
pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.  

<span id="021">21</span> For he hath made him to be
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) for us, who knew no
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md); that we might be made the
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) of God in him.
