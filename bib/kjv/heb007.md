### King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> For this Melchisedec,
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Salem](../ebd/ebd319.htm#001.md),
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) of the most high God, who met
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) returning from the slaughter of the
kings, and blessed him;  

<span id="002">2</span> To whom also [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md)
gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md),
and after that also [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Salem](../ebd/ebd319.htm#001), which is, [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
of peace;  

<span id="003">3</span> Without father, without mother, without descent,
having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto
the Son of God; abideth a [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) continually.  

<span id="004">4</span> Now consider how great this man was, unto whom
even the [patriarch](../ebd/ebd286.htm#009.md)
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) gave the tenth of the spoils.  

<span id="005">5</span> And verily they that are of the sons of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006.md), who receive the office of the priesthood,
have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law,
that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md):  

<span id="006">6</span> But he whose descent is not counted from them
received tithes of [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), and blessed him
that had the promises.  

<span id="007">7</span> And without all contradiction the less is
blessed of the better.  

<span id="008">8</span> And here men that die receive tithes; but there
he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.  

<span id="009">9</span> And as I may so say,
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006.md) also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes
in [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> For he was yet in the loins of his father, when
Melchisedec met him.  

<span id="011">11</span> If therefore
[perfection](../ebd/ebd290.htm#001.md) were by the Levitical priesthood,
(for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there
that another [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) should rise after the order
of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md)?  

<span id="012">12</span> For the priesthood being changed, there is made
of necessity a change also of the law.  

<span id="013">13</span> For he of whom these things are spoken
pertaineth to another [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md), of which no man
gave attendance at the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of
[Juda](../ebd/ebd212.htm#006); of which [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md)
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) spake nothing concerning priesthood.  

<span id="015">15</span> And it is yet far more evident: for that after
the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md),  

<span id="016">16</span> Who is made, not after the law of a
[carnal](../ebd/ebd072.htm#008.md) commandment, but after the power of an
endless life.  

<span id="017">17</span> For he testifieth, Thou art a
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) for ever after the order of
Melchisedec.  

<span id="018">18</span> For there is verily a disannulling of the
commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness
thereof.  

<span id="019">19</span> For the law made nothing perfect, but the
bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.  

<span id="020">20</span> And inasmuch as not without an
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md) he was made
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md):  

<span id="021">21</span> (For those priests were made without an
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md); but this with an
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md) by him that said unto him, The Lord sware
and will not repent, Thou art a [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) for ever
after the order of Melchisedec:)  

<span id="022">22</span> By so much was [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
made a [surety](../ebd/ebd353.htm#005.md) of a better
[testament](../ebd/ebd362.htm#007.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And they truly were many priests, because they
were not suffered to continue by reason of death:  

<span id="024">24</span> But this man, because he continueth ever, hath
an unchangeable priesthood.  

<span id="025">25</span> Wherefore he is able also to save them to the
uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make
intercession for them.  

<span id="026">26</span> For such an high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) became us, who is holy, harmless,
undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;  

<span id="027">27</span> Who needeth not daily, as those high priests,
to offer up [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md), first for his own sins,
and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up
himself.  

<span id="028">28</span> For the law maketh men high priests which have
infirmity; but the word of the [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md), which was
since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.
