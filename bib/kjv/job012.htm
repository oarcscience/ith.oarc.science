<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 12</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And Job answered and said,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#007">lamp</A> despised in the thought of him that is at ease.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Doth not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> try words? and the mouth taste his meat?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;He looseth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#001">bond</A> of kings, and girdeth their loins with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;He discovereth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A> things out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, and bringeth out to light the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> where there is no way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.<BR>
