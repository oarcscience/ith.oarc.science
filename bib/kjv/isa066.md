### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 66

<span id="001">1</span> Thus saith the LORD, The
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) is my [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md),
and the earth is my [footstool](../ebd/ebd136.htm#009.md): where is the
house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest?  

<span id="002">2</span> For all those things hath mine hand made, and
all those things have been, saith the LORD: but to this man will I look,
even to him that is [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) and of a contrite
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), and trembleth at my word.  

<span id="003">3</span> He that killeth an [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007.md)
is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a
[lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md), as if he cut off a dog's
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md); he that offereth an oblation, as if he
offered swine's [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md); he that burneth
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md), as if he blessed an
[idol](../ebd/ebd186.htm#006.md). Yea, they have
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) their own ways, and their soul
delighteth in their abominations.  

<span id="004">4</span> I also will choose their delusions, and will
bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer;
when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and
chose that in which I delighted not.  

<span id="005">5</span> Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at
his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's
sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy,
and they shall be ashamed.  

<span id="006">6</span> A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), a voice of the LORD that rendereth
recompence to his enemies.  

<span id="007">7</span> Before she travailed, she brought forth; before
her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.  

<span id="008">8</span> Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such
things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a
nation be born at once? for as soon as [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md)
travailed, she brought forth her children.  

<span id="009">9</span> Shall I bring to the
[birth](../ebd/ebd059.htm#002.md), and not cause to bring forth? saith the
LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy God.  

<span id="010">10</span> Rejoice ye with
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and be glad with her, all ye that
love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004.md) for her:  

<span id="011">11</span> That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the
breasts of her consolations; that ye may [milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000.md)
out, and be delighted with the abundance of her
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend
peace to her like a river, and the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) like a flowing stream: then shall ye
suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees.  

<span id="013">13</span> As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I
comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice,
and your bones shall flourish like an [herb](../ebd/ebd174.htm#008.md): and
the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, and his
indignation toward his enemies.  

<span id="015">15</span> For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and
with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) with [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md), and
his rebuke with flames of fire.  

<span id="016">16</span> For by fire and by his
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) will the LORD plead with all
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md): and the slain of the LORD shall be
many.  

<span id="017">17</span> They that sanctify themselves, and purify
themselves in the [gardens](../ebd/ebd143.htm#001.md) behind one tree in
the midst, [eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006.md) swine's
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), and the
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md), and the
[mouse](../ebd/ebd261.htm#005.md), shall be consumed together, saith the
LORD.  

<span id="018">18</span> For I know their works and their thoughts: it
shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall
come, and see my [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And I will set a sign among them, and I will
send those that escape of them unto the nations, to
[Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002), [Pul](../ebd/ebd302.htm#002.md), and
[Lud](../ebd/ebd232.htm#009.md), that draw the
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003), to [Tubal](../ebd/ebd373.htm#005.md), and
[Javan](../ebd/ebd198.htm#005.md), to the isles afar off, that have not
heard my fame, neither have seen my [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md); and
they shall declare my [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) among the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And they shall bring all your brethren for an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) unto the LORD out of all nations upon
horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift
beasts, to my holy mountain [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), saith
the LORD, as the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) bring an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) in a [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md)
vessel into the house of the LORD.  

<span id="021">21</span> And I will also take of them for priests and
for Levites, saith the LORD.  

<span id="022">22</span> For as the new heavens and the new earth, which
I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed
and your name remain.  

<span id="023">23</span> And it shall come to pass, that from one new
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004.md) to another, and from one
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) to another, shall all
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) come to [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md)
before me, saith the LORD.  

<span id="024">24</span> And they shall go forth, and look upon the
carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their
[worm](../ebd/ebd384.htm#000.md) shall not die, neither shall their fire be
quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).
