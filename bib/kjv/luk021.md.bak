### King James Version: Luke Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting
their gifts into the [treasury](../ebd/ebd372.htm#000.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he saw also a certain
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) widow casting in thither two mites.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that
this [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) widow hath cast in more than they
all:  

<span id="004">4</span> For all these have of their abundance cast in
unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the
living that she had.  

<span id="005">5</span> And as some spake of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), how it was adorned with goodly stones
and gifts, he said,  

<span id="006">6</span> As for these things which ye behold, the days
will come, in the which there shall not be left one
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) upon another, that shall not be thrown
down.  

<span id="007">7</span> And they asked him, saying, Master, but when
shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things
shall come to pass?  

<span id="008">8</span> And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived:
for many shall come in my name, saying, I am
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md); and the time draweth near: go ye not
therefore after them.  

<span id="009">9</span> But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions,
be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end
is not by and by.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise
against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:  

<span id="011">11</span> And great earthquakes shall be in divers
places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs
shall there be from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> But before all these, they shall lay their
hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues,
and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's
sake.  

<span id="013">13</span> And it shall turn to you for a
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to
meditate before what ye shall answer:  

<span id="015">15</span> For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which
all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.  

<span id="016">16</span> And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and
brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause
to be put to death.  

<span id="017">17</span> And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's
sake.  

<span id="018">18</span> But there shall not an hair of your head
perish.  

<span id="019">19</span> In your patience possess ye your souls.  

<span id="020">20</span> And when ye shall see
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) compassed with armies, then know that
the desolation thereof is nigh.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the
mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let
not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.  

<span id="022">22</span> For these be the days of vengeance, that all
things which are written may be fulfilled.  

<span id="023">23</span> But woe unto them that are with child, and to
them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in
the land, and wrath upon this people.  

<span id="024">24</span> And they shall fall by the edge of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), and shall be led away
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001.md) into all nations: and
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) shall be trodden down of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md), until the times of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md) be fulfilled.  

<span id="025">25</span> And there shall be signs in the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), and in the [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004.md),
and in the [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md); and upon the earth distress
of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;  

<span id="026">26</span> Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for
looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers
of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) shall be shaken.  

<span id="027">27</span> And then shall they see the Son of man coming
in a [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md) with power and great
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> And when these things begin to come to pass,
then look up, and lift up your heads; for your
[redemption](../ebd/ebd308.htm#009.md) draweth nigh.  

<span id="029">29</span> And he spake to them a
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md); Behold the
[fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001.md) tree, and all the trees;  

<span id="030">30</span> When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of
your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand.  

<span id="031">31</span> So likewise ye, when ye see these things come
to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.  

<span id="032">32</span> Verily I say unto you, This
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) shall not pass away, till all be
fulfilled.  

<span id="033">33</span> [Heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) and earth shall
pass away: but my words shall not pass away.  

<span id="034">34</span> And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time
your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares
of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.  

<span id="035">35</span> For as a [snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009.md) shall
it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.  

<span id="036">36</span> Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye
may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to
pass, and to stand before the Son of man.  

<span id="037">37</span> And in the day time he was teaching in the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md); and at night he went out, and abode in
the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) that is called the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) of Olives.  

<span id="038">38</span> And all the people came early in the morning to
him in the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), for to hear him.
