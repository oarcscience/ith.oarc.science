### King James Version: Ezra Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> Now after these things, in the reign of
[Artaxerxes](../ebd/ebd032.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009), [Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006) the son
of [Seraiah](../ebd/ebd328.htm#003), the son of
[Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005), the son of
[Hilkiah](../ebd/ebd178.htm#006),  

<span id="002">2</span> The son of [Shallum](../ebd/ebd330.htm#008), the
son of [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008), the son of
[Ahitub](../ebd/ebd015.htm#001),  

<span id="003">3</span> The son of [Amariah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#002), the
son of [Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005), the son of
[Meraioth](../ebd/ebd248.htm#009),  

<span id="004">4</span> The son of Zerahiah, the son of
[Uzzi](../ebd/ebd376.htm#003), the son of Bukki,  

<span id="005">5</span> The son of [Abishua](../ebd/ebd004.htm#006), the
son of [Phinehas](../ebd/ebd294.htm#003), the son of
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000), the son of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) the chief
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003):  

<span id="006">6</span> This [Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006) went up from
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001); and he was a ready scribe in the law
of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), which the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) had given: and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) granted him all his request, according to
the hand of the LORD his God upon him.  

<span id="007">7</span> And there went up some of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and of the priests, and the Levites,
and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), in the seventh year of
[Artaxerxes](../ebd/ebd032.htm#006) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="008">8</span> And he came to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) in the fifth month, which was in the
seventh year of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="009">9</span> For upon the first day of the first month began
he to go up from [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and on the first day
of the fifth month came he to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),
according to the good hand of his God upon him.  

<span id="010">10</span> For [Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006) had prepared
his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) statutes and judgments.  

<span id="011">11</span> Now this is the copy of the letter that the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Artaxerxes](../ebd/ebd032.htm#006) gave
unto [Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),
the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD,
and of his statutes to [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="012">12</span> [Artaxerxes](../ebd/ebd032.htm#006),
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of kings, unto
[Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), a
scribe of the law of the God of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), perfect
peace, and at such a time.  

<span id="013">13</span> I make a decree, that all they of the people of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and of his priests and Levites, in my
realm, which are minded of their own freewill to go up to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), go with thee.  

<span id="014">14</span> Forasmuch as thou art sent of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and of his [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
counsellors, to enquire concerning [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), according to the law of thy God
which is in thine hand;  

<span id="015">15</span> And to carry the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), which
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) and his counsellors have freely
offered unto the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), whose
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007) is in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),  

<span id="016">16</span> And all the [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) that thou canst find in all the province
of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), with the freewill
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of the people, and of the priests,
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) willingly for the house of their God
which is in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005):  

<span id="017">17</span> That thou mayest buy speedily with this money
bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) offerings, and offer them upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of the house of your God which is in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="018">18</span> And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to
thy brethren, to do with the rest of the [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000)
and the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), that do after the will of your
God.  

<span id="019">19</span> The vessels also that are given thee for the
service of the house of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="020">20</span> And whatsoever more shall be needful for the
house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it
out of the king's treasure house.  

<span id="021">21</span> And I, even I
[Artaxerxes](../ebd/ebd032.htm#006) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001),
do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river, that
whatsoever [Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), the scribe of the law of the God of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), shall require of you, it be done
speedily,  

<span id="022">22</span> Unto an hundred talents of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and to an hundred measures of
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000), and to an hundred
[baths](../ebd/ebd047.htm#004) of [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), and to
an hundred [baths](../ebd/ebd047.htm#004) of oil, and
[salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008) without prescribing how much.  

<span id="023">23</span> Whatsoever is commanded by the God of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), let it be diligently done for the house
of the God of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006): for why should there be
wrath against the realm of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) and his
sons?  

<span id="024">24</span> Also we certify you, that touching any of the
priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this
house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose
[toll](../ebd/ebd370.htm#000), [tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006), or
[custom](../ebd/ebd094.htm#008), upon them.  

<span id="025">25</span> And thou, [Ezra](../ebd/ebd129.htm#006), after
the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine hand, set magistrates and
judges, which may [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) all the people that are
beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye
them that know them not.  

<span id="026">26</span> And whosoever will not do the law of thy God,
and the law of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), let judgment be
executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment,
or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.  

<span id="027">27</span> Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which
hath put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house
of the LORD which is in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005):  

<span id="028">28</span> And hath extended
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) unto me before the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and his counsellors, and before all the
king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my
God was upon me, and I gathered together out of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) chief men to go up with me.
