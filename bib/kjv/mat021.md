### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> And when they drew nigh unto
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and were come to Bethphage, unto the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) of Olives, then sent
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) two disciples,  

<span id="002">2</span> Saying unto them, Go into the village over
against you, and straightway ye shall find an
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md) tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and
bring them unto me.  

<span id="003">3</span> And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say,
The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.  

<span id="004">4</span> All this was done, that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md), saying,  

<span id="005">5</span> Tell ye the daughter of
[Sion](../ebd/ebd345.htm#003), Behold, thy [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
cometh unto thee, meek, and [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md) upon an
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md), and a colt the foal of an
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And the disciples went, and did as
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) commanded them,  

<span id="007">7</span> And brought the [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md),
and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.  

<span id="008">8</span> And a very great multitude spread their garments
in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in
the way.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the multitudes that went before, and that
followed, cried, saying, [Hosanna](../ebd/ebd183.htm#001.md) to the son of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md): Blessed is he that cometh in the name of
the Lord; [Hosanna](../ebd/ebd183.htm#001.md) in the highest.  

<span id="010">10</span> And when he was come into
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), all the city was moved, saying, Who
is this?  

<span id="011">11</span> And the multitude said, This is
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) of
[Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007) of [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) went into
the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) of God, and cast out all them that
sold and bought in the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), and overthrew
the [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006.md) of the moneychangers, and the seats
of them that sold doves,  

<span id="013">13</span> And said unto them, It is written, My house
shall be called the house of [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md); but ye
have made it a [den](../ebd/ebd101.htm#007.md) of thieves.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md) and the
lame came to him in the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md); and he healed
them.  

<span id="015">15</span> And when the chief priests and
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md) saw the wonderful things that he did,
and the children crying in the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), and
saying, [Hosanna](../ebd/ebd183.htm#001.md) to the son of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md); they were sore displeased,  

<span id="016">16</span> And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say?
And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saith unto them, Yea; have ye never
read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected
praise?  

<span id="017">17</span> And he left them, and went out of the city into
[Bethany](../ebd/ebd054.htm#007.md); and he lodged there.  

<span id="018">18</span> Now in the morning as he returned into the
city, he hungered.  

<span id="019">19</span> And when he saw a [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001.md)
tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves
only, and said unto it, Let no [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) grow on
thee henceforward for ever. And presently the
[fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001.md) tree withered away.  

<span id="020">20</span> And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled,
saying, How soon is the [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001.md) tree withered
away!  

<span id="021">21</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered and
said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not,
ye shall not only do this which is done to the
[fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001.md) tree, but also if ye shall say unto this
mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be
done.  

<span id="022">22</span> And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md), believing, ye shall receive.  

<span id="023">23</span> And when he was come into the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), the chief priests and the elders of the
people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority
doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered and
said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in
like [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) will tell you by what authority I do
these things.  

<span id="025">25</span> The baptism of John, whence was it? from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), or of men? And they reasoned with
themselves, saying, If we shall say, From
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md); he will say unto us, Why did ye not
then believe him?  

<span id="026">26</span> But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the
people; for all hold John as a [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And they answered
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), and said, We cannot tell. And he said
unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.  

<span id="028">28</span> But what think ye? A certain man had two sons;
and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my
vineyard.  

<span id="029">29</span> He answered and said, I will not: but afterward
he repented, and went.  

<span id="030">30</span> And he came to the second, and said likewise.
And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.  

<span id="031">31</span> Whether of them twain did the will of his
father? They say unto him, The first. [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the
harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.  

<span id="032">32</span> For John came unto you in the way of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), and ye believed him not: but the
publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it,
repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.  

<span id="033">33</span> Hear another [parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md):
There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it
round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it
out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:  

<span id="034">34</span> And when the time of the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) drew near, he sent his servants to the
husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.  

<span id="035">35</span> And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat
one, and killed another, and stoned another.  

<span id="036">36</span> Again, he sent other servants more than the
first: and they did unto them likewise.  

<span id="037">37</span> But last of all he sent unto them his son,
saying, They will reverence my son.  

<span id="038">38</span> But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said
among themselves, This is the [heir](../ebd/ebd171.htm#007.md); come, let
us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.  

<span id="039">39</span> And they caught him, and cast him out of the
vineyard, and slew him.  

<span id="040">40</span> When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh,
what will he do unto those husbandmen?  

<span id="041">41</span> They say unto him, He will miserably destroy
those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen,
which shall render him the fruits in their
[seasons](../ebd/ebd325.htm#003.md).  

<span id="042">42</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saith unto them,
Did ye never read in the scriptures, The [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md)
which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner:
this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?  

<span id="043">43</span> Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God
shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits
thereof.  

<span id="044">44</span> And whosoever shall fall on this
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) shall be broken: but on whomsoever it
shall fall, it will [grind](../ebd/ebd155.htm#006.md) him to powder.  

<span id="045">45</span> And when the chief priests and
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md) had heard his parables, they
perceived that he spake of them.  

<span id="046">46</span> But when they sought to lay hands on him, they
feared the multitude, because they took him for a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md).
