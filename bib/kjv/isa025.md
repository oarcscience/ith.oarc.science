### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 25

<span id="001">1</span> O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I
will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels
of old are faithfulness and truth.  

<span id="002">2</span> For thou hast made of a city an
[heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000); of a defenced city a ruin: a
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008) of strangers to be no city; it shall
never be built.  

<span id="003">3</span> Therefore shall the strong people
[glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005) thee, the city of the terrible nations
shall fear thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> For thou hast been a strength to the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006), a strength to the needy in his distress,
a refuge from the storm, a [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) from the
heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the
wall.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as
the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) of a [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001): the
[branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002) of the terrible ones shall be brought
low.  

<span id="006">6</span> And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts
make unto all people a [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) things, a [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of
wines on the [lees](../ebd/ebd226.htm#005), of
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) things full of marrow, of wines on the
[lees](../ebd/ebd226.htm#005) well refined.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he will destroy in this mountain the face of
the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all
nations.  

<span id="008">8</span> He will [swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009) up
death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all
faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the
earth: for the LORD hath spoken it.  

<span id="009">9</span> And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is
our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD;
we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003).  

<span id="010">10</span> For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD
rest, and [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005) shall be trodden down under him,
even as [straw](../ebd/ebd352.htm#000) is trodden down for the
dunghill.  

<span id="011">11</span> And he shall spread forth his hands in the
midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim:
and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their
hands.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls
shall he bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008).
