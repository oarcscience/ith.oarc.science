### King James Version: Esther Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Now it came to pass on the third day, that
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) put on her royal
[apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000), and stood in the inner court of the
king's house, over against the king's house: and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) sat upon his royal
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) in the royal house, over against the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the house.  

<span id="002">2</span> And it was so, when the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) saw [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) the
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007) standing in the court, that she obtained
favour in his sight: and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) held out to
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) the golden
[sceptre](../ebd/ebd323.htm#006) that was in his hand. So
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) drew near, and touched the top of the
[sceptre](../ebd/ebd323.htm#006).  

<span id="003">3</span> Then said the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) unto
her, What wilt thou, [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007)
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006)? and what is thy request? it shall be
even given thee to the half of the kingdom.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) answered, If
it seem good unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), let the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) and [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) come
this day unto the [banquet](../ebd/ebd043.htm#006) that I have prepared
for him.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said,
Cause [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) to make haste, that he may do as
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) hath said. So the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) and [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) came to
the [banquet](../ebd/ebd043.htm#006) that
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) had prepared.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said unto
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) at the [banquet](../ebd/ebd043.htm#006)
of [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), What is thy petition? and it shall be
granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom
it shall be performed.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then answered [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006),
and said, My petition and my request is;  

<span id="008">8</span> If I have found favour in the sight of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and if it please the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) to grant my petition, and to perform my
request, let the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) and
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) come to the
[banquet](../ebd/ebd043.htm#006) that I shall prepare for them, and I
will do to morrow as the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) hath said.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then went [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) forth
that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) saw [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005) in
the king's [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), that he stood not up, nor
moved for him, he was full of indignation against
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005).  

<span id="010">10</span> Nevertheless [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004)
refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his
friends, and [Zeresh](../ebd/ebd391.htm#006) his wife.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) told them of
the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of his riches, and the multitude of
his children, and all the things wherein the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) had promoted him, and how he had advanced
him above the princes and servants of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="012">12</span> [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) said moreover,
Yea, [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007)
did let no man come in with the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) unto the
[banquet](../ebd/ebd043.htm#006) that she had prepared but myself; and
to morrow am I invited unto her also with the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="013">13</span> Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I
see [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005) the [Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004)
[sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009) at the king's
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008).  

<span id="014">14</span> Then said [Zeresh](../ebd/ebd391.htm#006) his
wife and all his friends unto him, Let a
[gallows](../ebd/ebd142.htm#005) be made of fifty cubits high, and to
morrow speak thou unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) that
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005) may be hanged thereon: then go thou in
merrily with the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) unto the
[banquet](../ebd/ebd043.htm#006). And the thing pleased
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004); and he caused the
[gallows](../ebd/ebd142.htm#005) to be made.
