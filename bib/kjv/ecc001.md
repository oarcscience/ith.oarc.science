### King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> The words of the Preacher, the son of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="002">2</span> Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity
of vanities; all is vanity.  

<span id="003">3</span> What profit hath a man of all his labour which
he taketh under the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001)?  

<span id="004">4</span> One [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) passeth
away, and another [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) cometh: but the
earth abideth for ever.  

<span id="005">5</span> The [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) also ariseth,
and the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) goeth down, and hasteth to his
place where he arose.  

<span id="006">6</span> The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth
about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind
returneth again according to his circuits.  

<span id="007">7</span> All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is
not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they
return again.  

<span id="008">8</span> All things are full of labour; man cannot utter
it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) filled with hearing.  

<span id="009">9</span> The thing that hath been, it is that which shall
be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no
new thing under the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001).  

<span id="010">10</span> Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See,
this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.  

<span id="011">11</span> There is no remembrance of former things;
neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with
those that shall come after.  

<span id="012">12</span> I the Preacher was
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="013">13</span> And I gave my heart to seek and search out by
wisdom concerning all things that are done under
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006): this sore travail hath God given to the
sons of man to be exercised therewith.  

<span id="014">14</span> I have seen all the works that are done under
the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001); and, behold, all is vanity and
vexation of [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009).  

<span id="015">15</span> That which is crooked cannot be made straight:
and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.  

<span id="016">16</span> I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I
am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that
have been before me in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): yea, my heart
had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.  

<span id="017">17</span> And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know
[madness](../ebd/ebd236.htm#002) and folly: I perceived that this also
is vexation of [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009).  

<span id="018">18</span> For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that
increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
