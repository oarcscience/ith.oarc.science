### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> The word that [Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007)
the son of [Amoz](../ebd/ebd021.htm#008) saw concerning
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="002">2</span> And it shall come to pass in the last days, that
the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the
mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall
flow unto it.  

<span id="003">3</span> And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and
let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007); and he will teach us of his ways, and we
will walk in his paths: for out of [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002) shall
go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="004">4</span> And he shall [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005)
among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat
their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation
shall not lift up [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) against nation, neither
shall they learn war any more.  

<span id="005">5</span> O house of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), come
ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the
house of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), because they be replenished
from the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000), and are soothsayers like the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), and they please themselves in the
children of strangers.  

<span id="007">7</span> Their land also is full of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001),
neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of
horses, neither is there any end of their chariots:  

<span id="008">8</span> Their land also is full of idols; they
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) the work of their own hands, that which
their own fingers have made:  

<span id="009">9</span> And the mean man boweth down, and the great man
humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.  

<span id="010">10</span> Enter into the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001),
and hide thee in the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008), for fear of the
LORD, and for the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of his majesty.  

<span id="011">11</span> The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and
the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be
exalted in that day.  

<span id="012">12</span> For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon
every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up;
and he shall be brought low:  

<span id="013">13</span> And upon all the cedars of
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001), that are high and lifted up, and upon
all the oaks of [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003),  

<span id="014">14</span> And upon all the high mountains, and upon all
the hills that are lifted up,  

<span id="015">15</span> And upon every high tower, and upon every
fenced wall,  

<span id="016">16</span> And upon all the [ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003)
of [Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002), and upon all pleasant pictures.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down,
and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall
be exalted in that day.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the idols he shall utterly abolish.  

<span id="019">19</span> And they shall go into the holes of the rocks,
and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake
terribly the earth.  

<span id="020">20</span> In that day a man shall cast his idols of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and his idols of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), which they made each one for himself to
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002), to the moles and to the bats;  

<span id="021">21</span> To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into
the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake
terribly the earth.  

<span id="022">22</span> Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his
nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of ?
