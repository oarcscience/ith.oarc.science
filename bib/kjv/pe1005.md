### King James Version: 1 Peter Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> The elders which are among you I exhort, who am
also an [elder](../ebd/ebd114.htm#008.md), and a
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) of the sufferings of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), and also a partaker of the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) that shall be revealed:  

<span id="002">2</span> Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking
the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy
[lucre](../ebd/ebd232.htm#008.md), but of a ready mind;  

<span id="003">3</span> Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but
being ensamples to the flock.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when the chief
[Shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006.md) shall appear, ye shall receive a
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) that
fadeth not away.  

<span id="005">5</span> Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the
[elder](../ebd/ebd114.htm#008.md). Yea, all of you be subject one to
another, and be clothed with [humility](../ebd/ebd184.htm#007.md): for God
resisteth the proud, and giveth [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) to the
humble.  

<span id="006">6</span> Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty
hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:  

<span id="007">7</span> Casting all your care upon him; for he careth
for you.  

<span id="008">8</span> Be sober, be vigilant; because your
[adversary](../ebd/ebd011.htm#001) the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md),
as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:  

<span id="009">9</span> Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that
the same [afflictions](../ebd/ebd011.htm#006.md) are accomplished in your
brethren that are in the world.  

<span id="010">10</span> But the God of all
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md), who hath called us unto his eternal
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) by [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), after that ye have suffered a while,
make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.  

<span id="011">11</span> To him be [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) and
dominion for ever and ever. [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> By Silvanus, a
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md) brother unto you, as I suppose, I have
written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of God wherein ye stand.  

<span id="013">13</span> The church that is at
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), elected together with you, saluteth
you; and so doth [Marcus](../ebd/ebd241.htm#008.md) my son.  

<span id="014">14</span> Greet ye one another with a
[kiss](../ebd/ebd221.htm#000) of [charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009.md). Peace
be with you all that are in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006). [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).
