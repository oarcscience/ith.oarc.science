### King James Version: Jonah Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> Now the word of the LORD came unto
[Jonah](../ebd/ebd210.htm#007.md) the son of
[Amittai](../ebd/ebd020.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Arise, go to [Nineveh](../ebd/ebd273.htm#006.md),
that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up
before me.  

<span id="003">3</span> But [Jonah](../ebd/ebd210.htm#007.md) rose up to
flee unto [Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002.md) from the presence of the
LORD, and went down to [Joppa](../ebd/ebd211.htm#002.md); and he found a
ship going to [Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002.md): so he paid the fare
thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto
[Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002.md) from the presence of the LORD.  

<span id="004">4</span> But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea,
and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to
be broken.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every
man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into
the sea, to lighten it of them. But [Jonah](../ebd/ebd210.htm#007.md) was
gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) asleep.  

<span id="006">6</span> So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto
him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be
that God will think upon us, that we perish not.  

<span id="007">7</span> And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and
let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us.
So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon
[Jonah](../ebd/ebd210.htm#007.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee,
for whose cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and
whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?  

<span id="009">9</span> And he said unto them, I am an
[Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009.md); and I fear the LORD, the God of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), which hath made the sea and the dry
land.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said
unto him. Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from
the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto
thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was
tempestuous.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me
forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that
for my sake this great tempest is upon you.  

<span id="013">13</span> Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to
the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous
against them.  

<span id="014">14</span> Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said,
We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this
man's life, and lay not upon us innocent [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md):
for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee.  

<span id="015">15</span> So they look up [Jonah](../ebd/ebd210.htm#007.md),
and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.  

<span id="016">16</span> Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and
offered a [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) unto the LORD, and made
[vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Now the LORD had prepared a great
[fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005) to [swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009.md) up
[Jonah](../ebd/ebd210.htm#007). And [Jonah](../ebd/ebd210.htm#007.md) was
in the [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000.md) of the
[fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005.md) three days and three nights.
