### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> And there came two angels to
[Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004) at even; and Lot sat in the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004): and Lot
seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face
toward the ground;  

<span id="002">2</span> And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I
pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your
feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said,
Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he pressed upon them greatly; and they
turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000), and did [bake](../ebd/ebd042.htm#001)
unleavened [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and they did eat.  

<span id="004">4</span> But before they lay down, the men of the city,
even the men of [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004), compassed the house
round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:  

<span id="005">5</span> And they called unto Lot, and said unto him,
Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto
us, that we may know them.  

<span id="006">6</span> And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut
the door after him,  

<span id="007">7</span> And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so
wickedly.  

<span id="008">8</span> Behold now, I have two daughters which have not
known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to
them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for
therefore came they under the [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) of my
roof.  

<span id="009">9</span> And they said, Stand back. And they said again,
This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005): now will we deal worse with thee, than
with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near
to break the door.  

<span id="010">10</span> But the men put forth their hand, and pulled
Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.  

<span id="011">11</span> And they smote the men that were at the door of
the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied
themselves to find the door.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any
besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever
thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:  

<span id="013">13</span> For we will destroy this place, because the cry
of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath
sent us to destroy it.  

<span id="014">14</span> And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in
law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this
place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that
mocked unto his sons in law.  

<span id="015">15</span> And when the morning arose, then the angels
hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which
are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.  

<span id="016">16</span> And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon
his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two
daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth,
and set him without the city.  

<span id="017">17</span> And it came to pass, when they had brought them
forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee,
neither stay thou in all the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002); escape to
the mountain, lest thou be consumed.  

<span id="018">18</span> And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:  

<span id="019">19</span> Behold now, thy servant hath found
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005), which thou hast shewed unto me in saving
my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me,
and I die:  

<span id="020">20</span> Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and
it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?)
and my soul shall live.  

<span id="021">21</span> And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee
concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the
which thou hast spoken.  

<span id="022">22</span> Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do
anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was
called [Zoar](../ebd/ebd395.htm#004).  

<span id="023">23</span> The [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) was risen upon
the earth when Lot entered into [Zoar](../ebd/ebd395.htm#004).  

<span id="024">24</span> Then the LORD rained upon
[Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004) and upon
[Gomorrah](../ebd/ebd152.htm#007) [brimstone](../ebd/ebd065.htm#005) and
fire from the LORD out of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006);  

<span id="025">25</span> And he overthrew those cities, and all the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002), and all the inhabitants of the cities,
and that which grew upon the ground.  

<span id="026">26</span> But his wife looked back from behind him, and
she became a [pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007) of
[salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008).  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) gat up
early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:  

<span id="028">28</span> And he looked toward
[Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004) and [Gomorrah](../ebd/ebd152.htm#007),
and toward all the land of the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002), and
beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a
[furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000).  

<span id="029">29</span> And it came to pass, when God destroyed the
cities of the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002), that God remembered
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), and sent Lot out of the midst of the
overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.  

<span id="030">30</span> And Lot went up out of
[Zoar](../ebd/ebd395.htm#004), and dwelt in the mountain, and his two
daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in
[Zoar](../ebd/ebd395.htm#004): and he dwelt in a
[cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006), he and his two daughters.  

<span id="031">31</span> And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our
father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us
after the manner of all the earth:  

<span id="032">32</span> Come, let us make our father
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), and we
will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.  

<span id="033">33</span> And they made their father
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) that night:
and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not
when she lay down, nor when she arose.  

<span id="034">34</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the
firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my
father: let us make him [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009)
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) this night also; and go thou in, and lie
with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.  

<span id="035">35</span> And they made their father
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) that night
also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when
she lay down, nor when she arose.  

<span id="036">36</span> Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child
by their father.  

<span id="037">37</span> And the first born bare a son, and called his
name [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005): the same is the father of the
Moabites unto this day.  

<span id="038">38</span> And the younger, she also bare a son, and
called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) unto this day.
