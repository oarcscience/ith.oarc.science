<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Hosea Chapter 7</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;When I would have healed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, then the iniquity of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> was discovered, and the wickedness of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;They make the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;They are all adulterers, as an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#005">oven</A> heated by the baker, who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd106.htm#006">dough</A>, until it be leavened.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;In the day of our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> the princes have made him sick with bottles of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>; he stretched out his hand with scorners.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For they have made ready their heart like an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#005">oven</A>, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;They are all hot as an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#005">oven</A>, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, he hath mixed himself among the people; <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#009">cake</A> not turned.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the pride of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> also is like a silly <A HREF="../ebd/ebd106.htm#007">dove</A> without heart: they call to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, they go to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;When they shall go, I will spread my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</A> upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>; I will chastise them, as their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> hath heard.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A> unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, and they rebel against me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A>: their princes shall fall by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
