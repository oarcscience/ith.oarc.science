### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 32

<span id="001">1</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) went on his
way, and the angels of God met him.  

<span id="002">2</span> And when [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) saw
them, he said, This is God's [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md): and he
called the name of that place [Mahanaim](../ebd/ebd237.htm#005.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) sent
messengers before him to [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) his brother unto
the land of [Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004.md), the country of
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye
speak unto my lord [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md); Thy servant
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) saith thus, I have sojourned with
[Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md), and stayed there until now:  

<span id="005">5</span> And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and
menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I
may find [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) in thy sight.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the messengers returned to
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), saying, We came to thy brother
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md), and also he cometh to meet thee, and four
hundred men with him.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) was greatly
afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and
the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003.md);  

<span id="008">8</span> And said, If [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) come
to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left
shall escape.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) said, O God
of my father [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), and God of my father
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md), the LORD which saidst unto me, Return
unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:  

<span id="010">10</span> I am not worthy of the least of all the
mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant;
for with my staff I passed over this [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md);
and now I am become two [bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my
brother, from the hand of [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md): for I fear him,
lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.  

<span id="012">12</span> And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good,
and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for
multitude.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he lodged there that same night; and took
of that which came to his hand a present for
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) his brother;  

<span id="014">14</span> Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two
hundred ewes, and twenty rams,  

<span id="015">15</span> Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty
[kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000.md), and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten
foals.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he delivered them into the hand of his
servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass
over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he commanded the foremost, saying, When
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee,
saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these
before thee?  

<span id="018">18</span> Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant
Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md): and, behold, also he is behind us.  

<span id="019">19</span> And so commanded he the second, and the third,
and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak
unto [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md), when ye find him.  

<span id="020">20</span> And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) is behind us. For he said, I will appease
him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his
face; peradventure he will accept of me.  

<span id="021">21</span> So went the present over before him: and
himself lodged that night in the company.  

<span id="022">22</span> And he rose up that night, and took his two
wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over
the [ford](../ebd/ebd137.htm#001) [Jabbok](../ebd/ebd193.htm#006.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And he took them, and sent them over the
[brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006.md), and sent over that he had.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) was left
alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the
day.  

<span id="025">25</span> And when he saw that he prevailed not against
him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh
was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.  

<span id="026">26</span> And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh.
And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) me.  

<span id="027">27</span> And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he
said, [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> And he said, Thy name shall be called no more
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), but [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): for
as a [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) hast thou power with God and with
men, and hast prevailed.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) asked him,
and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it
that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) called the
name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life
is preserved.  

<span id="031">31</span> And as he passed over
[Penuel](../ebd/ebd289.htm#005) the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) rose
upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.  

<span id="032">32</span> Therefore the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) eat not of the sinew which shrank, which
is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the
hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.
