### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 47

<span id="001">1</span> Afterward he brought me again unto the door of
the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the
[threshold](../ebd/ebd365.htm#000.md) of the house eastward: for the
forefront of the house stood toward the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md),
and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at
the south side of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Then brought he me out of the way of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) [northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002.md), and
led me about the way without unto the utter
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) by the way that looketh eastward; and,
behold, there ran out waters on the right side.  

<span id="003">3</span> And when the man that had the line in his hand
went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me
through the waters; the waters were to the ankles.  

<span id="004">4</span> Again he measured a thousand, and brought me
through the waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a
thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the loins.  

<span id="005">5</span> Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a
river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to
swim in, a river that could not be passed over.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen
this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the
river.  

<span id="007">7</span> Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of
the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then said he unto me, These waters issue out
toward the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) country, and go down into the
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000.md), and go into the sea: which being
brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed.  

<span id="009">9</span> And it shall come to pass, that every thing that
liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live:
and there shall be a very great multitude of
[fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005.md), because these waters shall come thither:
for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the river
cometh.  

<span id="010">10</span> And it shall come to pass, that the fishers
shall stand upon it from [Engedi](../ebd/ebd120.htm#009.md) even unto
Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their
[fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005.md) shall be according to their kinds, as the
[fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005.md) of the great sea, exceeding many.  

<span id="011">11</span> But the miry places thereof and the marishes
thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to
[salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this
side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose
[leaf](../ebd/ebd225.htm#004.md) shall not fade, neither shall the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth
new [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) according to his months, because
their waters they issued out of the [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md):
and the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) thereof shall be for meat, and
the [leaf](../ebd/ebd225.htm#004.md) thereof for medicine.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; This shall be the
border, whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md)
shall have two portions.  

<span id="014">14</span> And ye shall inherit it, one as well as
another: concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your
fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.  

<span id="015">15</span> And this shall be the border of the land toward
the north side, from the great sea, the way of
[Hethlon](../ebd/ebd177.htm#002.md), as men go to
[Zedad](../ebd/ebd389.htm#007.md);  

<span id="016">16</span> [Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005.md), Berothah,
Sibraim, which is between the border of
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md) and the border of
[Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005.md); Hazarhatticon, which is by the coast of
[Hauran](../ebd/ebd167.htm#007.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan,
the border of [Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md), and the north
[northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002.md), and the border of
[Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005.md). And this is the north side.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) side ye
shall measure from [Hauran](../ebd/ebd167.htm#007.md), and from
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md), and from
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md), and from the land of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) by [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md), from
the border unto the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) sea. And this is the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) side.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the south side southward, from
[Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003.md) even to the waters of strife in
[Kadesh](../ebd/ebd215.htm#003.md), the river to the great sea. And this is
the south side southward.  

<span id="020">20</span> The west side also shall be the great sea from
the border, till a man come over against
[Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005.md). This is the west side.  

<span id="021">21</span> So shall ye divide this land unto you according
to the tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide
it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn
among you, which shall beget children among you: and they shall be unto
you as born in the country among the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); they shall have inheritance with you
among the tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And it shall come to pass, that in what
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md)
sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord
GOD.
