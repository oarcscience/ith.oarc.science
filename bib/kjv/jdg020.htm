</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> went up against the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A> on the third day, and put themselves in array against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</A>, as at other times.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A> went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</A> in the field, about thirty men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A> said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And all the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And there came against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</A> ten thousand <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> men out of all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And the LORD smote <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A> before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: and the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;So the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A> saw that they were smitten: for the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</A>; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;Now there was an appointed sign between the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And when the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> retired in the battle, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A> began to smite and kill of the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</A> of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And when the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> turned again, the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A> were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;Therefore they turned their backs before the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> unto the way of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trode them down with ease over against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</A> toward the sunrising.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And there fell of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A> eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;And they turned and fled toward the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#005">Rimmon</A>: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;So that all which fell that day of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A> were twenty and five thousand men that drew the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>; all these were men of valour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;But six hundred men turned and fled to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#005">Rimmon</A>, and abode in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#005">Rimmon</A> four months.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;And the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> turned again upon the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>, and smote them with the edge of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, as well the men of every city, as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.<BR>
