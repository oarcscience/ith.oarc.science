### King James Version: Job Chapter 23

<span id="001">1</span> Then Job answered and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> Even to day is my complaint
[bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009): my stroke is heavier than my
groaning.  

<span id="003">3</span> Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I
might come even to his seat!  

<span id="004">4</span> I would order my cause before him, and fill my
mouth with arguments.  

<span id="005">5</span> I would know the words which he would answer me,
and understand what he would say unto me.  

<span id="006">6</span> Will he plead against me with his great power?
No; but he would put strength in me.  

<span id="007">7</span> There the righteous might dispute with him; so
should I be delivered for ever from my [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005).  

<span id="008">8</span> Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and
backward, but I cannot perceive him:  

<span id="009">9</span> On the left hand, where he doth work, but I
cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot
see him:  

<span id="010">10</span> But he knoweth the way that I take: when he
hath tried me, I shall come forth as [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="011">11</span> My foot hath held his steps, his way have I
kept, and not declined.  

<span id="012">12</span> Neither have I gone back from the commandment
of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my
necessary food.  

<span id="013">13</span> But he is in one mind, and who can turn him?
and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.  

<span id="014">14</span> For he performeth the thing that is appointed
for me: and many such things are with him.  

<span id="015">15</span> Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I
consider, I am afraid of him.  

<span id="016">16</span> For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty
troubleth me:  

<span id="017">17</span> Because I was not cut off before the
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008), neither hath he covered the
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) from my face.
