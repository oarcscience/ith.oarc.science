<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Judges Chapter 14</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</A> went down to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd366.htm#006">Timnath</A>, and saw a woman in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd366.htm#006">Timnath</A> of the daughters of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd366.htm#006">Timnath</A> of the daughters of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>: now therefore get her for me to wife.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>? And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</A> said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>: for at that time the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> had dominion over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then went <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</A> down, and his father and his mother, to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd366.htm#006">Timnath</A>, and came to the vineyards of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd366.htm#006">Timnath</A>: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> him as he would have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</A> well.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#004">carcase</A> of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#004">carcase</A> of the lion.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And he took thereof in his hands, and went on <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</A>, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</A> out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#004">carcase</A> of the lion.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;So his father went down unto the woman: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</A> made there a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A>; for so used the young men to do.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</A> said unto them, I will now put forth a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#003">riddle</A> unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> days of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A>, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#003">riddle</A>, that we may hear it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#003">riddle</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#003">riddle</A>, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#003">riddle</A> unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And she wept before him the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> days, while their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#003">riddle</A> to the children of her people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> went down, What is sweeter than <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</A>? And what is stronger than a lion?  and he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#006">heifer</A>, ye had not found out my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#003">riddle</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#001">Ashkelon</A>, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#003">riddle</A>. And his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.<BR>
