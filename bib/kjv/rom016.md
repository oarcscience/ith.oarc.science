### King James Version: Romans Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> I commend unto you
[Phebe](../ebd/ebd293.htm#000) our sister, which is a servant of the
church which is at [Cenchrea](../ebd/ebd075.htm#001):  

<span id="002">2</span> That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh
saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of
you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.  

<span id="003">3</span> Greet [Priscilla](../ebd/ebd300.htm#005) and
[Aquila](../ebd/ebd027.htm#006) my helpers in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006):  

<span id="004">4</span> Who have for my life laid down their own necks:
unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001).  

<span id="005">5</span> Likewise greet the church that is in their
house. Salute my well-beloved [Epaenetus](../ebd/ebd122.htm#002), who is
the firstfruits of [Achaia](../ebd/ebd006.htm#004) unto
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="006">6</span> Greet [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009), who
bestowed much labour on us.  

<span id="007">7</span> Salute [Andronicus](../ebd/ebd023.htm#008) and
[Junia](../ebd/ebd214.htm#004), my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who
are of note among the apostles, who also were in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) before me.  

<span id="008">8</span> Greet [Amplias](../ebd/ebd022.htm#000) my
beloved in the Lord.  

<span id="009">9</span> Salute Urbane, our helper in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), and [Stachys](../ebd/ebd350.htm#004) my
beloved.  

<span id="010">10</span> Salute [Apelles](../ebd/ebd025.htm#009)
approved in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000). Salute them which are of
Aristobulus' household.  

<span id="011">11</span> Salute [Herodion](../ebd/ebd176.htm#007) my
[kinsman](../ebd/ebd219.htm#006). Greet them that be of the household of
[Narcissus](../ebd/ebd267.htm#001), which are in the Lord.  

<span id="012">12</span> Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the
Lord. Salute the beloved [Persis](../ebd/ebd291.htm#000), which laboured
much in the Lord.  

<span id="013">13</span> Salute [Rufus](../ebd/ebd316.htm#004)
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) in the Lord, and his mother and mine.  

<span id="014">14</span> Salute Asyncritus,
[Phlegon](../ebd/ebd294.htm#004), [Hermas](../ebd/ebd175.htm#003),
[Patrobas](../ebd/ebd287.htm#000), [Hermes](../ebd/ebd175.htm#004), and
the brethren which are with them.  

<span id="015">15</span> Salute Philologus, and
[Julia](../ebd/ebd214.htm#002), [Nereus](../ebd/ebd270.htm#008), and his
sister, and [Olympas](../ebd/ebd278.htm#002), and all the saints which
are with them.  

<span id="016">16</span> Salute one another with an holy
[kiss](../ebd/ebd221.htm#000). The churches of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) salute you.  

<span id="017">17</span> Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which
cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have
learned; and avoid them.  

<span id="018">18</span> For they that are such serve not our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), but
their own [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000); and by good words and fair
speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.  

<span id="019">19</span> For your obedience is come abroad unto all men.
I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) unto that which is good, and simple
concerning evil.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the God of peace shall bruise
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000) under your feet shortly. The
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) be with
you. [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).  

<span id="021">21</span> [Timotheus](../ebd/ebd367.htm#001) my
workfellow, and [Lucius](../ebd/ebd232.htm#007), and
[Jason](../ebd/ebd198.htm#002), and [Sosipater](../ebd/ebd348.htm#008),
my kinsmen, salute you.  

<span id="022">22</span> I [Tertius](../ebd/ebd362.htm#005), who wrote
this epistle, salute you in the Lord.  

<span id="023">23</span> [Gaius](../ebd/ebd141.htm#003) mine
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007), and of the whole church, saluteth you.
[Erastus](../ebd/ebd124.htm#001) the
[chamberlain](../ebd/ebd076.htm#005) of the city saluteth you, and
[Quartus](../ebd/ebd303.htm#005) a brother.  

<span id="024">24</span> The [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) be with
you all. [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).  

<span id="025">25</span> Now to him that is of power to stablish you
according to my [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003), and the preaching of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000),
according to the [revelation](../ebd/ebd312.htm#002) of the
[mystery](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006), which was kept secret since the world
began,  

<span id="026">26</span> But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures
of the prophets, according to the commandment of the
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) God, made known to all nations for
the obedience of faith:  

<span id="027">27</span> To God only [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), be
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) through [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) for ever.
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).
