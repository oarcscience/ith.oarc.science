### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> At the same time came the disciples unto
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), saying, Who is the greatest in the
kingdom of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)?  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) called a
little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,  

<span id="003">3</span> And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be
converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the
kingdom of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this
little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And whoso shall receive one such little child in
my name receiveth me.  

<span id="006">6</span> But whoso shall offend one of these little ones
which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged
about his [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md), and that he were drowned in the
depth of the sea.  

<span id="007">7</span> Woe unto the world because of offences! for it
must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the
offence cometh!  

<span id="008">8</span> Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee,
cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter
into life [halt](../ebd/ebd160.htm#002.md) or maimed, rather than having
two hands or two feet to be cast into
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) fire.  

<span id="009">9</span> And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and
cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one
eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md) fire.  

<span id="010">10</span> Take heed that ye despise not one of these
little ones; for I say unto you, That in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)
their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> For the Son of man is come to save that which
was lost.  

<span id="012">12</span> How think ye? if a man have an hundred
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), and one of them be gone astray, doth he
not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh
that which is gone astray?  

<span id="013">13</span> And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto
you, he rejoiceth more of that [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), than of
the ninety and nine which went not astray.  

<span id="014">14</span> Even so it is not the will of your Father which
is in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), that one of these little ones
should perish.  

<span id="015">15</span> Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against
thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall
hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.  

<span id="016">16</span> But if he will not hear thee, then take with
thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every
word may be established.  

<span id="017">17</span> And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it
unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto
thee as an [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) man and a
[publican](../ebd/ebd301.htm#009.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind
on earth shall be bound in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md): and
whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall
agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be
done for them of my Father which is in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> For where two or three are gathered together in
my name, there am I in the midst of them.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then came [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) to
him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) against me, and I forgive him? till
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times?  

<span id="022">22</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saith unto him,
I say not unto thee, Until [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times: but,
Until seventy times [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> Therefore is the kingdom of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) likened unto a certain
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), which would take account of his
servants.  

<span id="024">24</span> And when he had begun to reckon, one was
brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.  

<span id="025">25</span> But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord
commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he
had, and payment to be made.  

<span id="026">26</span> The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped
him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.  

<span id="027">27</span> Then the lord of that servant was moved with
compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the
[debt](../ebd/ebd099.htm#009.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> But the same servant went out, and found one of
his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands
on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.  

<span id="029">29</span> And his fellowservant fell down at his feet,
and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee
all.  

<span id="030">30</span> And he would not: but went and cast him into
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md), till he should pay the
[debt](../ebd/ebd099.htm#009.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> So when his fellowservants saw what was done,
they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was
done.  

<span id="032">32</span> Then his lord, after that he had called him,
said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that
[debt](../ebd/ebd099.htm#009.md), because thou desiredst me:  

<span id="033">33</span> Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on
thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?  

<span id="034">34</span> And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to
the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.  

<span id="035">35</span> So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also
unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their
trespasses.
