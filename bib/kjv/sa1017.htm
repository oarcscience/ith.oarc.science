</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#008">Eliab</A> his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> was kindled against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.<BR>

<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And when the words were heard which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> spake, they rehearsed them before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>: and he sent for him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, Thy servant kept his father's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</A> out of the flock:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#000">beard</A>, and smote him, and slew him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.

</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> armed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> with his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</A>, and he put an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#004">helmet</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A> upon his head; also he armed him with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</A> of mail.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> girded his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> upon his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</A>, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> put them off him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A>, and put them in a shepherd's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#008">bag</A> which he had, even in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#004">scrip</A>; and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#005">sling</A> was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And the Philistine came on and drew near unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>; and the man that bare the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</A> went before him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And when the Philistine looked about, and saw <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;And the Philistine said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> by his gods.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And the Philistine said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, Come to me, and I will give thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and with a spear, and with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</A>: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, whom thou hast defied.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew nigh to meet <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> put his hand in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#008">bag</A>, and took thence a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#002">forehead</A>, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> sunk into his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#002">forehead</A>; and he fell upon his face to the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> prevailed over the Philistine with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#005">sling</A> and with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> in the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;Therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> saw their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#008">champion</A> was dead, they fled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;And the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> arose, and shouted, and pursued the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>, until thou come to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A>, and to the gates of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#001">Ekron</A>. And the wounded of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> fell down by the way to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#008">Shaaraim</A>, even unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</A>, and unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#001">Ekron</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="053">53</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> returned from chasing after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>, and they spoiled their tents.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="054">54</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>; but he put his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</A> in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>.<BR>

And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A> said, As thy soul liveth, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, I cannot tell.<BR>
