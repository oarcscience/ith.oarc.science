### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, when the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) sat in his house, and the LORD had given
him rest round about from all his enemies;  

<span id="002">2</span> That the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said unto
[Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md),
See now, I dwell in an house of [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md), but the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God dwelleth within curtains.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md) said to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), Go, do all that is in thine heart; for
the LORD is with thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> And it came to pass that night, that the word of
the LORD came unto [Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md), saying,  

<span id="005">5</span> Go and tell my servant
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me
an house for me to dwell in?  

<span id="006">6</span> Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the
time that I brought up the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), even to this day, but have walked
in a [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) and in a
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> In all the places wherein I have walked with all
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) spake I a word with any
of the tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), whom I commanded to
feed my people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), saying, Why build ye not
me an house of [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md)?  

<span id="008">8</span> Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took
thee from the sheepcote, from following the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), to be ruler over my people, over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):  

<span id="009">9</span> And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest,
and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee
a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the
earth.  

<span id="010">10</span> Moreover I will appoint a place for my people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and will plant them, that they may
dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the
children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,  

<span id="011">11</span> And as since the time that I commanded judges
to be over my people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and have caused
thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he
will make thee an house.  

<span id="012">12</span> And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt
sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall
proceed out of thy [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004.md), and I will establish
his kingdom.  

<span id="013">13</span> He shall build an house for my name, and I will
stablish the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of his kingdom for ever.  

<span id="014">14</span> I will be his father, and he shall be my son.
If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with
the [stripes](../ebd/ebd352.htm#005.md) of the children of men:  

<span id="015">15</span> But my [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) shall not
depart away from him, as I took it from [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md),
whom I put away before thee.  

<span id="016">16</span> And thine house and thy kingdom shall be
established for ever before thee: thy [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md)
shall be established for ever.  

<span id="017">17</span> According to all these words, and according to
all this [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md), so did
[Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002.md) speak unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> Then went [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) in, and sat before the LORD, and he said,
Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me
hitherto?  

<span id="019">19</span> And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O
Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great
while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?  

<span id="020">20</span> And what can [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) say
more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.  

<span id="021">21</span> For thy word's sake, and according to thine own
heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know
them.  

<span id="022">22</span> Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there
is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to
all that we have heard with our ears.  

<span id="023">23</span> And what one nation in the earth is like thy
people, even like [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), whom God went to
redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for
you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which
thou redeemedst to thee from [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), from the
nations and their gods?  

<span id="024">24</span> For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) to be a people unto thee for ever: and
thou, LORD, art become their God.  

<span id="025">25</span> And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast
spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it
for ever, and do as thou hast said.  

<span id="026">26</span> And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying,
The LORD of hosts is the God over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and
let the house of thy servant [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) be
established before thee.  

<span id="027">27</span> For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I
will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart
to pray this [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) unto thee.  

<span id="028">28</span> And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy
words be true, and thou hast promised this
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md) unto thy servant:  

<span id="029">29</span> Therefore now let it please thee to
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) the house of thy servant, that it may
continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and
with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.
