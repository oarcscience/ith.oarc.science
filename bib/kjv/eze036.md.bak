### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 36

<span id="001">1</span> Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the
mountains of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and say, Ye mountains of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), hear the word of the LORD:  

<span id="002">2</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the enemy hath
said against you, [Aha](../ebd/ebd013.htm#001.md), even the ancient high
places are ours in possession:  

<span id="003">3</span> Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord
GOD; Because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every
side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), and ye are taken up in the lips of
talkers, and are an infamy of the people:  

<span id="004">4</span> Therefore, ye mountains of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus
saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers,
and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are
forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) that are round about;  

<span id="005">5</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the
fire of my [jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008.md) have I spoken against the
residue of the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), and against all Idumea,
which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all
their heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey.  

<span id="006">6</span> Prophesy therefore concerning the land of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and say unto the mountains, and to the
hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
Behold, I have spoken in my [jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008.md) and in my
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md), because ye have borne the shame of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md):  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have lifted
up mine hand, Surely the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) that are about
you, they shall bear their shame.  

<span id="008">8</span> But ye, O mountains of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), ye shall shoot forth your branches, and
yield your [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) to my people of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); for they are at hand to come.  

<span id="009">9</span> For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto
you, and ye shall be tilled and sown:  

<span id="010">10</span> And I will multiply men upon you, all the house
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), even all of it: and the cities shall
be inhabited, and the wastes shall be builded:  

<span id="011">11</span> And I will multiply upon you man and
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md); and they shall increase and bring
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md): and I will settle you after your old
estates, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings: and ye
shall know that I am the LORD.  

<span id="012">12</span> Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my
people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); and they shall possess thee, and
thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth
bereave them of men.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say unto
you, Thou land devourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations:  

<span id="014">14</span> Therefore thou shalt devour men no more,
neither bereave thy nations any more, saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="015">15</span> Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the
shame of the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) any more, neither shalt
thou bear the reproach of the people any more, neither shalt thou cause
thy nations to fall any more, saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="016">16</span> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="017">17</span> Son of man, when the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) dwelt in their own land, they defiled it
by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the
uncleanness of a removed woman.  

<span id="018">18</span> Wherefore I poured my
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md) upon them for the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) that they had shed upon the land, and for
their idols wherewith they had polluted it:  

<span id="019">19</span> And I scattered them among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), and they were dispersed through the
countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged
them.  

<span id="020">20</span> And when they entered unto the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), whither they went, they profaned my
holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the LORD, and
are gone forth out of his land.  

<span id="021">21</span> But I had pity for mine holy name, which the
house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) had profaned among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), whither they went.  

<span id="022">22</span> Therefore say unto the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not this
for your sakes, O house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), but for mine
holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), whither ye went.  

<span id="023">23</span> And I will sanctify my great name, which was
profaned among the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), which ye have
profaned in the midst of them; and the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md)
shall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be
sanctified in you before their eyes.  

<span id="024">24</span> For I will take you from among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), and gather you out of all countries,
and will bring you into your own land.  

<span id="025">25</span> Then will I sprinkle
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) water upon you, and ye shall be
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md): from all your filthiness, and from all
your idols, will I cleanse you.  

<span id="026">26</span> A new heart also will I give you, and a new
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) will I put within you: and I will take
away the stony heart out of your [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), and I
will give you an heart of [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And I will put my
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) within you, and cause you to walk in my
statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.  

<span id="028">28</span> And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to
your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.  

<span id="029">29</span> I will also save you from all your
uncleannesses: and I will call for the [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md),
and will increase it, and lay no [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md) upon
you.  

<span id="030">30</span> And I will multiply the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of the tree, and the increase of the
field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md) among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and
your doings that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own
sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.  

<span id="032">32</span> Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord
GOD, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways,
O house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I
shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you
to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded.  

<span id="034">34</span> And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas
it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by.  

<span id="035">35</span> And they shall say, This land that was desolate
is become like the garden of [Eden](../ebd/ebd112.htm#009.md); and the
waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are
inhabited.  

<span id="036">36</span> Then the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) that
are left round about you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined
places, and plant that that was desolate: I the LORD have spoken it, and
I will do it.  

<span id="037">37</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be
enquired of by the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), to do it
for them; I will increase them with men like a flock.  

<span id="038">38</span> As the holy flock, as the flock of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) in her solemn feasts; so shall the
waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I am
the LORD.
