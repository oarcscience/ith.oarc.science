### King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> And when the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md) of
[Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006.md) heard of the fame of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) concerning the name of the LORD, she
came to prove him with hard questions.  

<span id="002">2</span> And she came to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) with a very great train, with camels
that bare [spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005.md), and very much
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and precious stones: and when she was
come to [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), she communed with him of all
that was in her heart.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) told her
all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), which he told her not.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md) of
[Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006.md) had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the
house that he had built,  

<span id="005">5</span> And the meat of his table, and the
[sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md) of his servants, and the attendance of
his ministers, and their [apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000.md), and his
cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the
LORD; there was no more [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) in her.  

<span id="006">6</span> And she said to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), It was a true report that I heard in mine
own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.  

<span id="007">7</span> Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came,
and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy
wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.  

<span id="008">8</span> Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants,
which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.  

<span id="009">9</span> Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in
thee, to set thee on the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): because the LORD loved
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) for ever, therefore made he thee
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), to do judgment and
[justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And she gave the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
an hundred and twenty talents of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and of
[spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005.md) very great store, and precious stones:
there came no more such abundance of [spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005.md) as
these which the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md) of
[Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006) gave to [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And the navy also of
[Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003.md), that brought
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) from [Ophir](../ebd/ebd279.htm#007.md),
brought in from [Ophir](../ebd/ebd279.htm#007.md) great plenty of
[almug](../ebd/ebd018.htm#003.md) trees, and precious stones.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) made of
the [almug](../ebd/ebd018.htm#003.md) trees pillars for the house of the
LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers:
there came no such [almug](../ebd/ebd018.htm#003.md) trees, nor were seen
unto this day.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) gave unto the
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007) of [Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006.md) all her
desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) gave her of his royal bounty. So she
turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.  

<span id="014">14</span> Now the weight of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md)
that came to [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) in one year was six
hundred threescore and six talents of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md),  

<span id="015">15</span> Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of
the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of
[Arabia](../ebd/ebd027.htm#009.md), and of the governors of the country.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) made two hundred targets of beaten
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md): six hundred shekels of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) went to one
[target](../ebd/ebd359.htm#001.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And he made three hundred shields of beaten
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001); three [pound](../ebd/ebd299.htm#008.md) of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) went to one
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001): and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
put them in the house of the [forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006.md) of
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> Moreover the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) made
a great [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of
[ivory](../ebd/ebd192.htm#000.md), and overlaid it with the best
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> The [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) had six
steps, and the top of the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) was round
behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat,
and two [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001.md) stood beside the stays.  

<span id="020">20</span> And twelve [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001.md) stood
there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not
the like made in any kingdom.  

<span id="021">21</span> And all [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) Solomon's
drinking vessels were of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and all the
vessels of the house of the [forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006.md) of
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md) were of pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md); none were of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md): it was nothing accounted of in the days
of [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> For the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) had at
sea a navy of [Tharshish](../ebd/ebd363.htm#003.md) with the navy of
[Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003.md): once in three years came the navy of
[Tharshish](../ebd/ebd363.htm#003.md), bringing
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md),
[ivory](../ebd/ebd192.htm#000.md), and apes, and peacocks.  

<span id="023">23</span> So [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) exceeded all the kings of the earth for
riches and for wisdom.  

<span id="024">24</span> And all the earth sought to
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), to hear his wisdom, which God had put
in his heart.  

<span id="025">25</span> And they brought every man his present, vessels
of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and vessels of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and garments, and
[armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006), and [spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005.md),
horses, and mules, a rate year by year.  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) gathered
together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred
chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities
for chariots, and with the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) made
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) to be in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) as stones, and cedars made he to be
as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) had horses
brought out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008) [yarn](../ebd/ebd384.htm#006.md): the king's
merchants received the [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md)
[yarn](../ebd/ebd384.htm#006.md) at a price.  

<span id="029">29</span> And a [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md) came up
and went out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) for six hundred shekels
of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and an horse for an hundred and
fifty: and so for all the kings of the
[Hittites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#006.md), and for the kings of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md), did they bring them out by their
means.
