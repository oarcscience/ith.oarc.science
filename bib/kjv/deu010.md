### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) of [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) like
unto the first, and come up unto me into the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md), and make thee an
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And I will write on the
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006.md) the words that were in the first
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006.md) which thou brakest, and thou shalt put
them in the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And I made an [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of
[shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md), and
hewed two [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006.md) of
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) like unto the first, and went up into the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md), having the two
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006.md) in mine hand.  

<span id="004">4</span> And he wrote on the
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006.md), according to the first
[writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005.md), the ten commandments, which the LORD
spake unto you in the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) out of the midst of
the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me.  

<span id="005">5</span> And I turned myself and came down from the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md), and put the
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) in the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md)
which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) took their
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001) from [Beeroth](../ebd/ebd050.htm#006.md)
of the children of [Jaakan](../ebd/ebd192.htm#003.md) to
[Mosera](../ebd/ebd260.htm#001): there [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md)
died, and there he was buried; and [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000.md) his
son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.  

<span id="007">7</span> From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and
from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.  

<span id="008">8</span> At that time the LORD separated the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006.md), to bear
the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of the LORD, to stand before the LORD
to [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007.md) unto him, and to
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) in his name, unto this day.  

<span id="009">9</span> Wherefore [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006.md) hath no
part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD is his inheritance,
according as the LORD thy God promised him.  

<span id="010">10</span> And I stayed in the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md), according to the first time, forty days
and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, and
the LORD would not destroy thee.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md) before the people, that they may go in
and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto
them.  

<span id="012">12</span> And now, [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), what
doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to
walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God
with all thy heart and with all thy soul,  

<span id="013">13</span> To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his
statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?  

<span id="014">14</span> Behold, the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) and
the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) of heavens is the LORD's thy God,
the earth also, with all that therein is.  

<span id="015">15</span> Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to
love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all
people, as it is this day.  

<span id="016">16</span> Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your
heart, and be no more stiffnecked.  

<span id="017">17</span> For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord
of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not
persons, nor taketh reward:  

<span id="018">18</span> He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless
and widow, and loveth the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md), in giving
him food and raiment.  

<span id="019">19</span> Love ye therefore the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md): for ye were strangers in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt
thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.  

<span id="021">21</span> He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath
done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have
seen.  

<span id="022">22</span> Thy fathers went down into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) with threescore and ten persons; and now
the LORD thy God hath made thee as the [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) for multitude.
