### King James Version: 1 Timothy Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> Let as many servants as are under the
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009.md) count their own masters worthy of all
honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.  

<span id="002">2</span> And they that have believing masters, let them
not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service,
because they are [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md) and beloved,
partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.  

<span id="003">3</span> If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to
wholesome words, even the words of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), and to
the doctrine which is according to [godliness](../ebd/ebd151.htm#007.md);  

<span id="004">4</span> He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about
questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings,
evil surmisings,  

<span id="005">5</span> Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and
destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is
[godliness](../ebd/ebd151.htm#007.md): from such withdraw thyself.  

<span id="006">6</span> But [godliness](../ebd/ebd151.htm#007.md) with
[contentment](../ebd/ebd089.htm#000.md) is great gain.  

<span id="007">7</span> For we brought nothing into this world, and it
is certain we can carry nothing out.  

<span id="008">8</span> And having food and raiment let us be therewith
content.  

<span id="009">9</span> But they that will be rich fall into
[temptation](../ebd/ebd361.htm#008.md) and a
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009.md), and into many foolish and hurtful lusts,
which [drown](../ebd/ebd108.htm#006.md) men in
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md) and perdition.  

<span id="010">10</span> For the love of money is the root of all evil:
which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and
pierced themselves through with many sorrows.  

<span id="011">11</span> But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and
follow after [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md),
[godliness](../ebd/ebd151.htm#007.md), faith, love, patience,
[meekness](../ebd/ebd246.htm#003.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on
eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good
profession before many witnesses.  

<span id="013">13</span> I give thee charge in the sight of God, who
quickeneth all things, and before [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a
good [confession](../ebd/ebd088.htm#003.md);  

<span id="014">14</span> That thou keep this commandment without spot,
unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md):  

<span id="015">15</span> Which in his times he shall shew, who is the
blessed and only Potentate, the [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of kings,
and Lord of lords;  

<span id="016">16</span> Who only hath
[immortality](../ebd/ebd187.htm#009.md), dwelling in the light which no man
can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour
and power [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md).
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Charge them that are rich in this world, that
they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living
God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;  

<span id="018">18</span> That they do good, that they be rich in good
works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;  

<span id="019">19</span> Laying up in store for themselves a good
foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal
life.  

<span id="020">20</span> O [Timothy](../ebd/ebd367.htm#002.md), keep that
which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings,
and oppositions of science falsely so called:  

<span id="021">21</span> Which some professing have erred concerning the
faith. [Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) be with thee.
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).
