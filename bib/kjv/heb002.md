### King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> Therefore we ought to give the more
[earnest](../ebd/ebd110.htm#006.md) heed to the things which we have heard,
lest at any time we should let them slip.  

<span id="002">2</span> For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast,
and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of
reward;  

<span id="003">3</span> How shall we escape, if we neglect so great
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md); which at the first began to be
spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;  

<span id="004">4</span> God also bearing them
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md), both with signs and wonders, and with
divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md),
according to his own will?  

<span id="005">5</span> For unto the angels hath he not put in
subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.  

<span id="006">6</span> But one in a certain place testified, saying,
What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou
visitest him?  

<span id="007">7</span> Thou madest him a little lower than the angels;
thou crownedst him with [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) and honour, and
didst set him over the works of thy hands:  

<span id="008">8</span> Thou hast put all things in subjection under his
feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing
that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under
him.  

<span id="009">9</span> But we see [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), who
was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death,
crowned with [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) and honour; that he by the
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of God should taste death for every
man.  

<span id="010">10</span> For it became him, for whom are all things, and
by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), to make the captain of their
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) perfect through sufferings.  

<span id="011">11</span> For both he that sanctifieth and they who are
sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call
them brethren,  

<span id="012">12</span> Saying, I will declare thy name unto my
brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.  

<span id="013">13</span> And again, I will put my trust in him. And
again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.  

<span id="014">14</span> Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) and [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), he
also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might
destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md);  

<span id="015">15</span> And deliver them who through fear of death were
all their lifetime subject to [bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> For verily he took not on him the nature of
angels; but he took on him the seed of
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be
made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
in things pertaining to God, to make
[reconciliation](../ebd/ebd308.htm#004.md) for the sins of the people.  

<span id="018">18</span> For in that he himself hath suffered being
tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.
