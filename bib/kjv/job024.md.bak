### King James Version: Job Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> Why, seeing times are not hidden from the
Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?  

<span id="002">2</span> Some remove the landmarks; they violently take
away flocks, and feed thereof.  

<span id="003">3</span> They drive away the [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md)
of the fatherless, they take the widow's [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007.md) for
a [pledge](../ebd/ebd297.htm#005.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> They turn the needy out of the way: the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) of the earth hide themselves together.  

<span id="005">5</span> Behold, as wild asses in the
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000.md), go they forth to their work; rising
betimes for a prey: the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) yieldeth
food for them and for their children.  

<span id="006">6</span> They reap every one his
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md) in the field: and they gather the vintage
of the wicked.  

<span id="007">7</span> They cause the [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003.md) to
[lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002.md) without clothing, that they have no
covering in the cold.  

<span id="008">8</span> They are wet with the showers of the mountains,
and embrace the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md) for want of a shelter.  

<span id="009">9</span> They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and
take a [pledge](../ebd/ebd297.htm#005.md) of the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> They cause him to go
[naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003.md) without clothing, and they take away the
sheaf from the hungry;  

<span id="011">11</span> Which make oil within their walls, and tread
their winepresses, and suffer thirst.  

<span id="012">12</span> Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of
the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.  

<span id="013">13</span> They are of those that rebel against the light;
they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.  

<span id="014">14</span> The murderer rising with the light killeth the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) and needy, and in the night is as a
thief.  

<span id="015">15</span> The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the
twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.  

<span id="016">16</span> In the dark they dig through houses, which they
had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.  

<span id="017">17</span> For the morning is to them even as the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) of death: if one know them, they are in
the terrors of the [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) of death.  

<span id="018">18</span> He is swift as the waters; their portion is
cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.  

<span id="019">19</span> [Drought](../ebd/ebd108.htm#005.md) and heat
consume the [snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000.md) waters: so doth the
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md) those which have sinned.  

<span id="020">20</span> The womb shall forget him; the
[worm](../ebd/ebd384.htm#000.md) shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no
more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.  

<span id="021">21</span> He evil entreateth the
[barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007.md) that beareth not: and doeth not good to
the widow.  

<span id="022">22</span> He draweth also the mighty with his power: he
riseth up, and no man is sure of life.  

<span id="023">23</span> Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon
he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.  

<span id="024">24</span> They are exalted for a little while, but are
gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and
cut off as the tops of the ears of [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> And if it be not so now, who will make me a
liar, and make my speech nothing worth?
