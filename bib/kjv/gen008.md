### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> And God remembered
[Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002), and every living thing, and all the
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) that was with him in the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000): and God made a wind to pass over the
earth, and the waters asswaged;  

<span id="002">2</span> The fountains also of the
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008) and the windows of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) were stopped, and the
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) was
restrained;  

<span id="003">3</span> And the waters returned from off the earth
continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters
were abated.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) rested in
the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the
mountains of [Ararat](../ebd/ebd028.htm#005).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the waters decreased continually until the
tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the
tops of the mountains seen.  

<span id="006">6</span> And it came to pass at the end of forty days,
that [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002) opened the window of the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) which he had made:  

<span id="007">7</span> And he sent forth a
[raven](../ebd/ebd307.htm#008), which went forth to and fro, until the
waters were dried up from off the earth.  

<span id="008">8</span> Also he sent forth a
[dove](../ebd/ebd106.htm#007) from him, to see if the waters were abated
from off the face of the ground;  

<span id="009">9</span> But the [dove](../ebd/ebd106.htm#007) found no
rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000), for the waters were on the face of the
whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in
unto him into the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000).  

<span id="010">10</span> And he stayed yet other
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days; and again he sent forth the
[dove](../ebd/ebd106.htm#007) out of the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000);  

<span id="011">11</span> And the [dove](../ebd/ebd106.htm#007) came in
to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an
[olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009) [leaf](../ebd/ebd225.htm#004) pluckt off:
so [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002) knew that the waters were abated from
off the earth.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he stayed yet other
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days; and sent forth the
[dove](../ebd/ebd106.htm#007); which returned not again unto him any
more.  

<span id="013">13</span> And it came to pass in the six hundredth and
first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters
were dried up from off the earth: and [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002)
removed the covering of the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000), and looked,
and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.  

<span id="014">14</span> And in the second month, on the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) and twentieth day of the month, was the
earth dried.  

<span id="015">15</span> And God spake unto
[Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002), saying,  

<span id="016">16</span> Go forth of the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000),
thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.  

<span id="017">17</span> Bring forth with thee every living thing that
is with thee, of all [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), both of fowl, and
of [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002), and of every creeping thing that
creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth,
and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002) went forth,
and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:  

<span id="019">19</span> Every [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), every
creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth,
after their kinds, went forth out of the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000).  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002) builded an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) unto the LORD; and took of every
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), and of
every [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) fowl, and offered burnt offerings
on the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006).  

<span id="021">21</span> And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the
LORD said in his heart, I will not again [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003)
the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart
is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing
living, as I have done.  

<span id="022">22</span> While the earth remaineth, seedtime and
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008), and cold and heat, and summer and
winter, and day and night shall not cease.
