### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> And [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) returned
to his house in peace to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007.md) the son of
[Hanani](../ebd/ebd162.htm#003) the [seer](../ebd/ebd326.htm#000.md) went
out to meet him, and said to [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md), Shouldest thou help the ungodly,
and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee from
before the LORD.  

<span id="003">3</span> Nevertheless there are good things found in
thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast
prepared thine heart to seek God.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md) dwelt
at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): and he went out again through the
people from [Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008.md) to
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), and
brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he set judges in the land throughout all the
fenced cities of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), city by city,  

<span id="006">6</span> And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do:
for ye [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) not for man, but for the LORD, who
is with you in the judgment.  

<span id="007">7</span> Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon
you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our
God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.  

<span id="008">8</span> Moreover in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md)
did [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md) set of the Levites, and of the
priests, and of the chief of the fathers of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), for the judgment of the LORD, and for
controversies, when they returned to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in
the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.  

<span id="010">10</span> And what cause soever shall come to you of your
brethren that dwell in your cities, between
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) and [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md),
between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn
them that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come upon
you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass.  

<span id="011">11</span> And, behold, [Amariah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#002.md)
the chief [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) is over you in all matters of
the LORD; and [Zebadiah](../ebd/ebd388.htm#005.md) the son of
[Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md), the ruler of the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), for all the king's matters: also the
Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD
shall be with the good.
