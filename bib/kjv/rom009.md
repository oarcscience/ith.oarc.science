### King James Version: Romans Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> I say the truth in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), I lie not, my
[conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006) also bearing me
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) in the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005),  

<span id="002">2</span> That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow
in my heart.  

<span id="003">3</span> For I could wish that myself were accursed from
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) for my brethren, my kinsmen according to
the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007):  

<span id="004">4</span> Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the
[adoption](../ebd/ebd010.htm#000), and the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006), and the covenants, and the giving of the
law, and the service of God, and the promises;  

<span id="005">5</span> Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning
the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) came,
who is over all, God blessed for ever. [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).  

<span id="006">6</span> Not as though the word of God hath taken none
effect. For they are not all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which are
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000):  

<span id="007">7</span> Neither, because they are the seed of
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), are they all children: but, In
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006) shall thy seed be called.  

<span id="008">8</span> That is, They which are the children of the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), these are not the children of God: but
the children of the promise are counted for the seed.  

<span id="009">9</span> For this is the word of promise, At this time
will I come, and [Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003) shall have a son.  

<span id="010">10</span> And not only this; but when Rebecca also had
conceived by one, even by our father [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006);  

<span id="011">11</span> (For the children being not yet born, neither
having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to
election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)  

<span id="012">12</span> It was said unto her, The
[elder](../ebd/ebd114.htm#008) shall serve the younger.  

<span id="013">13</span> As it is written,
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) have I loved, but
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005) have I hated.  

<span id="014">14</span> What shall we say then? Is there
unrighteousness with God? God forbid.  

<span id="015">15</span> For he saith to [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003),
I will have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) on whom I will have
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005), and I will have compassion on whom I
will have compassion.  

<span id="016">16</span> So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of
him that runneth, but of God that sheweth
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005).  

<span id="017">17</span> For the [scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005)
saith unto [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), Even for this same purpose
have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my
name might be declared throughout all the earth.  

<span id="018">18</span> Therefore hath he
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) on whom he will have
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005), and whom he will he hardeneth.  

<span id="019">19</span> Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet
find fault? For who hath resisted his will?  

<span id="020">20</span> Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest
against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast
thou made me thus?  

<span id="021">21</span> Hath not the potter power over the
[clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004), of the same lump to make one vessel unto
honour, and another unto dishonour?  

<span id="022">22</span> What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to
make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of
wrath fitted to [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004):  

<span id="023">23</span> And that he might make known the riches of his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) on the vessels of
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005), which he had afore prepared unto
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006),  

<span id="024">24</span> Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews
only, but also of the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001)?  

<span id="025">25</span> As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my
people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not
beloved.  

<span id="026">26</span> And it shall come to pass, that in the place
where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be
called the children of the living God.  

<span id="027">27</span> [Esaias](../ebd/ebd124.htm#003) also crieth
concerning [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Though the number of the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) be as the sand of the sea, a
remnant shall be saved:  

<span id="028">28</span> For he will finish the work, and cut it short
in [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004): because a short work will the
Lord make upon the earth.  

<span id="029">29</span> And as [Esaias](../ebd/ebd124.htm#003) said
before, Except the Lord of [Sabaoth](../ebd/ebd317.htm#002) had left us
a seed, we had been as [Sodoma](../ebd/ebd347.htm#005), and been made
like unto Gomorrha.  

<span id="030">30</span> What shall we say then? That the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001), which followed not after
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), have attained to
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), even the
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) which is of faith.  

<span id="031">31</span> But [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which
followed after the law of [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), hath
not attained to the law of [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="032">32</span> Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith,
but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that
stumblingstone;  

<span id="033">33</span> As it is written, Behold, I lay in
[Sion](../ebd/ebd345.htm#003) a stumblingstone and
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) of offence: and whosoever believeth on him
shall not be ashamed.
