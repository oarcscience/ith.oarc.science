### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 34

<span id="001">1</span> The word which came unto
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) from the LORD, when
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and all his army, and all the kingdoms
of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and against all the cities thereof,
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Thus saith the LORD, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); Go and speak to
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and tell him, Thus saith the LORD;
Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and
he shall burn it with fire:  

<span id="003">3</span> And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but
shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall
behold the eyes of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and he shall speak with thee mouth to
mouth, and thou shalt go to [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001).  

<span id="004">4</span> Yet hear the word of the LORD, O
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007); Thus saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt
not die by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003):  

<span id="005">5</span> But thou shalt die in peace: and with the
burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so
shall they burn odours for thee; and they will lament thee, saying, Ah
lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) spake all these words unto
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),  

<span id="007">7</span> When the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
Babylon's army fought against [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and
against all the cities of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) that were left,
against [Lachish](../ebd/ebd222.htm#009), and against
[Azekah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#008): for these defenced cities remained of
the cities of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="008">8</span> This is the word that came unto
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) from the LORD, after that the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) had made
a [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with all the people which were at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), to proclaim liberty unto them;  

<span id="009">9</span> That every man should let his manservant, and
every man his maidservant, being an [Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009) or
an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, to wit,
of a [Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004) his brother.  

<span id="010">10</span> Now when all the princes, and all the people,
which had entered into the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), heard that
every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go
free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they
obeyed, and let them go.  

<span id="011">11</span> But afterward they turned, and caused the
servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and
brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore the word of the LORD came to
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) from the LORD, saying,  

<span id="013">13</span> Thus saith the LORD, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); I made a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with your fathers in the day that I
brought them forth out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009),
out of the house of bondmen, saying,  

<span id="014">14</span> At the end of [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
years let ye go every man his brother an
[Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009), which hath been sold unto thee; and
when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from
thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004).  

<span id="015">15</span> And ye were now turned, and had done right in
my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had
made a [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) before me in the house which is
called by my name:  

<span id="016">16</span> But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused
every man his servant, and every man his
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008), whom he had set at liberty at their
pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you
for servants and for handmaids.  

<span id="017">17</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not
hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and
every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith
the LORD, to the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), to the pestilence, and
to the [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000); and I will make you to be
removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.  

<span id="018">18</span> And I will give the men that have transgressed
my [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), which have not performed the words
of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) which they had made before me,
when they cut the [calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004) in twain, and passed
between the parts thereof,  

<span id="019">19</span> The princes of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007),
and the princes of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), the eunuchs, and
the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the
parts of the [calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004);  

<span id="020">20</span> I will even give them into the hand of their
enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead
bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and to the beasts of the earth.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and his
princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of
them that seek their life, and into the hand of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of Babylon's army, which are gone up from
you.  

<span id="022">22</span> Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and
cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and
take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) a desolation without an inhabitant.
