### King James Version: Judges Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> In those days there was no
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and in
those days the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of the Danites sought them
an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all their inheritance had
not fallen unto them among the tribes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the children of [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md)
sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from
[Zorah](../ebd/ebd396.htm#002.md), and from
[Eshtaol](../ebd/ebd125.htm#002.md), to spy out the land, and to search it;
and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), to the
house of [Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005.md), they lodged there.  

<span id="003">3</span> When they were by the house of
[Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005.md), they knew the voice of the young man the
[Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009.md): and they turned in thither, and said
unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place?
and what hast thou here?  

<span id="004">4</span> And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth
[Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005.md) with me, and hath hired me, and I am his
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray
thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be
prosperous.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) said
unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way wherein ye go.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then the five men departed, and came to
[Laish](../ebd/ebd223.htm#001.md), and saw the people that were therein,
how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and
secure; and there was no [magistrate](../ebd/ebd236.htm#008.md) in the
land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from
the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.  

<span id="008">8</span> And they came unto their brethren to
[Zorah](../ebd/ebd396.htm#002) and [Eshtaol](../ebd/ebd125.htm#002.md): and
their brethren said unto them, What say ye?  

<span id="009">9</span> And they said, Arise, that we may go up against
them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are
ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land.  

<span id="010">10</span> When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure,
and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place
where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.  

<span id="011">11</span> And there went from thence of the family of the
Danites, out of [Zorah](../ebd/ebd396.htm#002.md) and out of
[Eshtaol](../ebd/ebd125.htm#002.md), six hundred men appointed with weapons
of war.  

<span id="012">12</span> And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim,
in [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md): wherefore they called that place
Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, it is behind Kirjathjearim.  

<span id="013">13</span> And they passed thence unto
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), and
came unto the house of [Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> Then answered the five men that went to spy out
the country of [Laish](../ebd/ebd223.htm#001.md), and said unto their
brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an
[ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008), and [teraphim](../ebd/ebd362.htm#002.md),
and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye
have to do.  

<span id="015">15</span> And they turned thitherward, and came to the
house of the young man the [Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009.md), even unto
the house of [Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005.md), and saluted him.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the six hundred men appointed with their
weapons of war, which were of the children of
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md), stood by the entering of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And the five men that went to spy out the land
went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the
[ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md), and the
[teraphim](../ebd/ebd362.htm#002.md), and the molten image: and the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) stood in the entering of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) with the six hundred men that were
appointed with weapons of war.  

<span id="018">18</span> And these went into Micah's house, and fetched
the carved image, the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md), and the
[teraphim](../ebd/ebd362.htm#002.md), and the molten image. Then said the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) unto them, What do ye?  

<span id="019">19</span> And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay
thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md): is it better for thee to be a
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) unto the house of one man, or that thou
be a [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) unto a
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) and a family in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="020">20</span> And the priest's heart was glad, and he took
the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008.md), and the
[teraphim](../ebd/ebd362.htm#002.md), and the graven image, and went in the
midst of the people.  

<span id="021">21</span> So they turned and departed, and put the little
ones and the [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) and the
[carriage](../ebd/ebd073.htm#000.md) before them.  

<span id="022">22</span> And when they were a good way from the house of
[Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005.md), the men that were in the houses near to
Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And they cried unto the children of
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md). And they turned their faces, and said unto
[Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005.md), What aileth thee, that thou comest with
such a company?  

<span id="024">24</span> And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I
made, and the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), and ye are gone away: and
what have I more? and what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth
thee?  

<span id="025">25</span> And the children of
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md) said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard
among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with
the lives of thy household.  

<span id="026">26</span> And the children of
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md) went their way: and when
[Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005.md) saw that they were too strong for him, he
turned and went back unto his house.  

<span id="027">27</span> And they took the things which
[Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005.md) had made, and the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) which he had, and came unto
[Laish](../ebd/ebd223.htm#001.md), unto a people that were at quiet and
secure: and they smote them with the edge of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md), and burnt the city with fire.  

<span id="028">28</span> And there was no deliverer, because it was far
from [Zidon](../ebd/ebd393.htm#000.md), and they had no business with any
man; and it was in the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) that lieth by
Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.  

<span id="029">29</span> And they called the name of the city
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md), after the name of
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md) their father, who was born unto
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): howbeit the name of the city was
[Laish](../ebd/ebd223.htm#001.md) at the first.  

<span id="030">30</span> And the children of
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md) set up the graven image: and
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md), the son of
[Gershom](../ebd/ebd146.htm#008.md), the son of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002.md), he and his sons were priests to the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md) until the
day of the [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md) of the land.  

<span id="031">31</span> And they set them up Micah's graven image,
which he made, all the time that the house of God was in
[Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008.md).
