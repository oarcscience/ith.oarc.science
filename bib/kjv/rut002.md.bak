### King James Version: Ruth Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> And [Naomi](../ebd/ebd266.htm#004.md) had a
[kinsman](../ebd/ebd219.htm#006.md) of her husband's, a mighty man of
wealth, of the family of [Elimelech](../ebd/ebd117.htm#002.md); and his
name was [Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Ruth](../ebd/ebd316.htm#008.md) the Moabitess
said unto [Naomi](../ebd/ebd266.htm#004.md), Let me now go to the field,
and [glean](../ebd/ebd150.htm#003) ears of [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md)
after him in whose sight I shall find [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md).
And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.  

<span id="003">3</span> And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field
after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field
belonging unto [Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006.md), who was of the kindred of
[Elimelech](../ebd/ebd117.htm#002.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And, behold, [Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006.md) came
from [Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005.md), and said unto the reapers, The
LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) thee.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then said [Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006.md) unto his
servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?  

<span id="006">6</span> And the servant that was set over the reapers
answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with
[Naomi](../ebd/ebd266.htm#004.md) out of the country of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md):  

<span id="007">7</span> And she said, I pray you, let me
[glean](../ebd/ebd150.htm#003.md) and gather after the reapers among the
sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until
now, that she tarried a little in the house.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then said [Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006.md) unto
[Ruth](../ebd/ebd316.htm#008.md), Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to
[glean](../ebd/ebd150.htm#003.md) in another field, neither go from hence,
but abide here [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) by my maidens:  

<span id="009">9</span> Let thine eyes be on the field that they do
reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they
shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels,
and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) of that which the young men have
drawn.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to
the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take
knowledge of me, seeing I am a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md)?  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006.md) answered and
said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done
unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou
hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and
art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.  

<span id="012">12</span> The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward
be given thee of the LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), under
whose wings thou art come to trust.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight,
my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken
friendly unto thine [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md), though I be not
like unto one of thine handmaidens.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006.md) said unto
her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), and dip thy morsel in the
[vinegar](../ebd/ebd377.htm#006.md). And she sat beside the reapers: and he
reached her parched [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md), and she did eat, and
was sufficed, and left.  

<span id="015">15</span> And when she was risen up to
[glean](../ebd/ebd150.htm#003), [Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006.md) commanded
his young men, saying, Let her [glean](../ebd/ebd150.htm#003.md) even among
the sheaves, and reproach her not:  

<span id="016">16</span> And let fall also some of the handfuls of
purpose for her, and leave them, that she may
[glean](../ebd/ebd150.htm#003.md) them, and rebuke her not.  

<span id="017">17</span> So she gleaned in the field until even, and
beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an
[ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003) of [barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And she took it up, and went into the city: and
her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and
gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.  

<span id="019">19</span> And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast
thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did
take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she
had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is
[Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Naomi](../ebd/ebd266.htm#004.md) said unto
her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off
his kindness to the living and to the dead. And
[Naomi](../ebd/ebd266.htm#004.md) said unto her, The man is near of kin
unto us, one of our next kinsmen.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Ruth](../ebd/ebd316.htm#008.md) the Moabitess
said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) by my young men, until they have ended all
my [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Naomi](../ebd/ebd266.htm#004.md) said unto
[Ruth](../ebd/ebd316.htm#008.md) her daughter in law, It is good, my
daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in
any other field.  

<span id="023">23</span> So she kept [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) by
the maidens of [Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006.md) to
[glean](../ebd/ebd150.htm#003.md) unto the end of
[barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003) [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md) and of
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000) [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md); and
dwelt with her mother in law.
