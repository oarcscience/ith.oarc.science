### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 25

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass in the ninth year of his
reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md) came, he, and all his
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md), against
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and pitched against it; and they
built forts against it round about.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year
of [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And on the ninth day of the fourth month the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md) prevailed in the city, and there was no
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) for the people of the land.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the city was broken up, and all the men of
war fled by night by the way of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md)
between two walls, which is by the king's garden: (now the
[Chaldees](../ebd/ebd076.htm#002) were against the city round about:.md)
and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) went the way toward the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the army of the
[Chaldees](../ebd/ebd076.htm#002.md) pursued after the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and overtook him in the plains of
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md): and all his army were scattered from
him.  

<span id="006">6</span> So they took the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),
and brought him up to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) to [Riblah](../ebd/ebd313.htm#002.md); and
they gave judgment upon him.  

<span id="007">7</span> And they slew the sons of
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008.md) before his eyes, and put out the eyes
of [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008.md), and bound him with fetters of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md), and carried him to
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of
the month, which is the nineteenth year of [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), came
[Nebuzaradan](../ebd/ebd268.htm#008.md), captain of the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md), a servant of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), unto
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md):  

<span id="009">9</span> And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the
king's house, and all the houses of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md),
and every great man's house burnt he with fire.  

<span id="010">10</span> And all the army of the
[Chaldees](../ebd/ebd076.htm#002.md), that were with the captain of the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md), brake down the walls of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) round about.  

<span id="011">11</span> Now the rest of the people that were left in
the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), with
the remnant of the multitude, did [Nebuzaradan](../ebd/ebd268.htm#008.md)
the captain of the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md) carry away.  

<span id="012">12</span> But the captain of the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md) left of the door of the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) of the land to be vinedressers and
husbandmen.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the pillars of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md) that were in the house of the LORD, and
the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the
[Chaldees](../ebd/ebd076.htm#002.md) break in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md), and carried the
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md) of them to
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And the pots, and the shovels, and the
snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md) wherewith they ministered, took they
away.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the firepans, and the bowls, and such
things as were of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), in
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md),
in [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), the captain of the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md) took away.  

<span id="016">16</span> The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) had made for the house of the LORD; the
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md) of all these vessels was without
weight.  

<span id="017">17</span> The height of the one
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md) was eighteen cubits, and the
[chapiter](../ebd/ebd077.htm#004.md) upon it was
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md): and the height of the
[chapiter](../ebd/ebd077.htm#004.md) three cubits; and the wreathen work,
and pomegranates upon the [chapiter](../ebd/ebd077.htm#004.md) round about,
all of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md): and like unto these had the
second [pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md) with wreathen work.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the captain of the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009) took [Seraiah](../ebd/ebd328.htm#003.md) the
chief [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), and
[Zephaniah](../ebd/ebd390.htm#008.md) the second
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), and the three keepers of the door:  

<span id="019">19</span> And out of the city he took an officer that was
set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's
presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md), which mustered the people of the land,
and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the
city:  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Nebuzaradan](../ebd/ebd268.htm#008.md)
captain of the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009.md) took these, and brought
them to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) to [Riblah](../ebd/ebd313.htm#002.md):  

<span id="021">21</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md) smote them, and slew them at
[Riblah](../ebd/ebd313.htm#002.md) in the land of
[Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005). So [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) was
carried away out of their land.  

<span id="022">22</span> And as for the people that remained in the land
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), whom
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md) had left, even over them he made
[Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009.md) the son of
[Ahikam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#001.md), the son of
[Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004.md), ruler.  

<span id="023">23</span> And when all the captains of the armies, they
and their men, heard that the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md) had made
[Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009.md) governor, there came to
[Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009) to [Mizpah](../ebd/ebd258.htm#000.md),
even [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md) the son of
[Nethaniah](../ebd/ebd271.htm#004), and [Johanan](../ebd/ebd208.htm#009.md)
the son of Careah, and [Seraiah](../ebd/ebd328.htm#003.md) the son of
[Tanhumeth](../ebd/ebd358.htm#006.md) the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the
son of a Maachathite, they and their men.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009.md) sware to
them, and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not to be the servants
of the [Chaldees](../ebd/ebd076.htm#002.md): dwell in the land, and serve
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md);
and it shall be well with you.  

<span id="025">25</span> But it came to pass in the seventh month, that
[Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md) the son of
[Nethaniah](../ebd/ebd271.htm#004.md), the son of
[Elishama](../ebd/ebd118.htm#001.md), of the seed royal, came, and ten men
with him, and smote [Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009.md), that he died, and
the Jews and the [Chaldees](../ebd/ebd076.htm#002.md) that were with him at
[Mizpah](../ebd/ebd258.htm#000.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And all the people, both small and great, and
the captains of the armies, arose, and came to
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): for they were afraid of the
[Chaldees](../ebd/ebd076.htm#002.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And it came to pass in the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) and thirtieth year of the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md) of
[Jehoiachin](../ebd/ebd201.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), in the twelfth month, on the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) and twentieth day of the month, that
Evilmerodach [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md) in the year that he began to reign did
lift up the head of [Jehoiachin](../ebd/ebd201.htm#000.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) out of
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md);  

<span id="028">28</span> And he spake kindly to him, and set his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) above the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of the kings that were with him in
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md);  

<span id="029">29</span> And changed his [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md)
garments: and he did eat [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) continually
before him all the days of his life.  

<span id="030">30</span> And his allowance was a continual allowance
given him of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), a daily rate for every
day, all the days of his life.
