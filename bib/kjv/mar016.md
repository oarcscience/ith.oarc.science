### King James Version: Mark Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> And when the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md)
was past, [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md)
[Magdalene](../ebd/ebd236.htm#005), and [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md)
the mother of [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007.md), and
[Salome](../ebd/ebd319.htm#007.md), had bought sweet
[spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005.md), that they might come and
[anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008.md) him.  

<span id="002">2</span> And very early in the morning the first day of
the week, they came unto the [sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md) at the
rising of the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And they said among themselves, Who shall
[roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004) us away the [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md)
from the door of the [sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md)?  

<span id="004">4</span> And when they looked, they saw that the
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) was rolled away: for it was very great.  

<span id="005">5</span> And entering into the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md), they saw a young man
[sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md) on the right side, clothed in a long
white garment; and they were affrighted.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye
seek [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) of
[Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007.md), which was crucified: he is risen; he
is not here: behold the place where they laid him.  

<span id="007">7</span> But go your way, tell his disciples and
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) that he goeth before you into
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md): there shall ye see him, as he said
unto you.  

<span id="008">8</span> And they went out quickly, and fled from the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md); for they trembled and were amazed:
neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.  

<span id="009">9</span> Now when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) was
risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to
[Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009) [Magdalene](../ebd/ebd236.htm#005.md), out of
whom he had cast [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) devils.  

<span id="010">10</span> And she went and told them that had been with
him, as they mourned and wept.  

<span id="011">11</span> And they, when they had heard that he was
alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.  

<span id="012">12</span> After that he appeared in another form unto two
of them, as they walked, and went into the country.  

<span id="013">13</span> And they went and told it unto the residue:
neither believed they them.  

<span id="014">14</span> Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they
sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of
heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was
risen.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he said unto them, Go ye into all the
world, and preach the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) to every
[creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> He that believeth and is baptized shall be
saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.  

<span id="017">17</span> And these signs shall follow them that believe;
In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new
tongues;  

<span id="018">18</span> They shall take up serpents; and if they
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them;
they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.  

<span id="019">19</span> So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he
was received up into [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and sat on the
right hand of God.  

<span id="020">20</span> And they went forth, and preached every where,
the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs
following. [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).
