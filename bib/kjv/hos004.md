### King James Version: Hosea Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): for the LORD hath a controversy with
the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005), nor knowledge of God in the land.  

<span id="002">2</span> By swearing, and lying, and killing, and
[stealing](../ebd/ebd352.htm#001), and committing
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009), they break out, and
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) toucheth
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000).  

<span id="003">3</span> Therefore shall the land
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004), and every one that dwelleth therein
shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006); yea, the fishes of the sea also shall
be taken away.  

<span id="004">4</span> Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for
thy people are as they that strive with the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003).  

<span id="005">5</span> Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) also shall fall with thee in the night,
and I will destroy thy mother.  

<span id="006">6</span> My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge:
because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou
shalt be no [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) to me: seeing thou hast
forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.  

<span id="007">7</span> As they were increased, so they sinned against
me: therefore will I change their [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) into
shame.  

<span id="008">8</span> They eat up the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) of
my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.  

<span id="009">9</span> And there shall be, like people, like
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003): and I will punish them for their ways,
and reward them their doings.  

<span id="010">10</span> For they shall eat, and not have enough: they
shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left
off to take heed to the LORD.  

<span id="011">11</span> Whoredom and [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) and
new [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) take away the heart.  

<span id="012">12</span> My people ask counsel at their stocks, and
their staff declareth unto them: for the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009)
of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from
under their God.  

<span id="013">13</span> They [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) upon
the tops of the mountains, and burn [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002)
upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) thereof is good: therefore your
daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009).  

<span id="014">14</span> I will not punish your daughters when they
commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009): for themselves are separated with
whores, and they [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) with harlots:
therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.  

<span id="015">15</span> Though thou, [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),
play the [harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005), yet let not
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) offend; and come not ye unto
[Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001), neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor
swear, The LORD liveth.  

<span id="016">16</span> For [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) slideth
back as a backsliding [heifer](../ebd/ebd171.htm#006): now the LORD will
feed them as a [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003) in a large place.  

<span id="017">17</span> [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) is joined to
idols: let him alone.  

<span id="018">18</span> Their [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) is sour:
they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers with shame do love,
Give ye.  

<span id="019">19</span> The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and
they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
