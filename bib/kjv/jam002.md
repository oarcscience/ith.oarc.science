### King James Version: James Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), the Lord
of [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006), with respect of persons.  

<span id="002">2</span> For if there come unto your assembly a man with
a [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) [ring](../ebd/ebd313.htm#007), in goodly
[apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000), and there come in also a
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) man in vile raiment;  

<span id="003">3</span> And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay
clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to
the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006), Stand thou there, or sit here under
my [footstool](../ebd/ebd136.htm#009):  

<span id="004">4</span> Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are
become judges of evil thoughts?  

<span id="005">5</span> Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) of
this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath
promised to them that love him?  

<span id="006">6</span> But ye have despised the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006). Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you
before the judgment seats?  

<span id="007">7</span> Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the
which ye are called?  

<span id="008">8</span> If ye fulfil the royal law according to the
[scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005), Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself, ye do well:  

<span id="009">9</span> But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), and are convinced of the law as
transgressors.  

<span id="010">10</span> For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet
offend in one point, he is guilty of all.  

<span id="011">11</span> For he that said, Do not commit
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009), said also, Do not kill. Now if thou
commit no [adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009), yet if thou kill, thou art
become a transgressor of the law.  

<span id="012">12</span> So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be
judged by the law of liberty.  

<span id="013">13</span> For he shall have judgment without
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005), that hath shewed no
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005); and [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005)
rejoiceth against judgment.  

<span id="014">14</span> What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man
say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?  

<span id="015">15</span> If a brother or sister be
[naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003), and destitute of daily food,  

<span id="016">16</span> And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace,
be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things
which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?  

<span id="017">17</span> Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead,
being alone.  

<span id="018">18</span> Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have
works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my
faith by my works.  

<span id="019">19</span> Thou believest that there is one God; thou
doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.  

<span id="020">20</span> But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith
without works is dead?  

<span id="021">21</span> Was not [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) our
father justified by works, when he had offered
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006) his son upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006)?  

<span id="022">22</span> Seest thou how faith wrought with his works,
and by works was faith made perfect?  

<span id="023">23</span> And the [scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005) was
fulfilled which saith, [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) believed God,
and it was imputed unto him for [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004):
and he was called the Friend of God.  

<span id="024">24</span> Ye see then how that by works a man is
justified, and not by faith only.  

<span id="025">25</span> Likewise also was not
[Rahab](../ebd/ebd305.htm#006) the [harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005)
justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent
them out another way?  

<span id="026">26</span> For as the body without the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) is dead, so faith without works is dead
also.
