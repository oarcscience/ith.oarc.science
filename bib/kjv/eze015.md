### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Son of man, what is the
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004) tree more than any tree, or than a
[branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002) which is among the trees of the
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006)?  

<span id="003">3</span> Shall [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) be taken
thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel
thereon?  

<span id="004">4</span> Behold, it is cast into the fire for
[fuel](../ebd/ebd139.htm#002); the fire devoureth both the ends of it,
and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work?  

<span id="005">5</span> Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no
work: how much less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire
hath devoured it, and it is burned?  

<span id="006">6</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004) tree among the trees of the
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006), which I have given to the fire for
[fuel](../ebd/ebd139.htm#002), so will I give the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="007">7</span> And I will set my face against them; they shall
go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall
know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.  

<span id="008">8</span> And I will make the land desolate, because they
have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.
