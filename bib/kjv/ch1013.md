### King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) consulted
with the captains of [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md) and hundreds,
and with every leader.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said unto all
the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), If it seem good unto you, and that it
be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every
where, that are left in all the land of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities
and [suburbs](../ebd/ebd352.htm#007.md), that they may gather themselves
unto us:  

<span id="003">3</span> And let us bring again the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of our God to us: for we enquired not at it
in the days of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md) said that they would do so: for
the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.  

<span id="005">5</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) gathered all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) together, from
[Shihor](../ebd/ebd337.htm#004) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) even
unto the entering of [Hemath](../ebd/ebd174.htm#000.md), to bring the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God from Kirjathjearim.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) went up, and
all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), to [Baalah](../ebd/ebd038.htm#005.md),
that is, to Kirjathjearim, which belonged to
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), to bring up thence the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the
cherubims, whose name is called on it.  

<span id="007">7</span> And they carried the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God in a new
[cart](../ebd/ebd073.htm#001.md) out of the house of
[Abinadab](../ebd/ebd004.htm#001): and [Uzza](../ebd/ebd376.htm#000.md) and
[Ahio](../ebd/ebd014.htm#007) drave the [cart](../ebd/ebd073.htm#001.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) and all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) played before God with all their might,
and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with
timbrels, and with [cymbals](../ebd/ebd095.htm#001.md), and with
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And when they came unto the threshingfloor of
[Chidon](../ebd/ebd080.htm#001), [Uzza](../ebd/ebd376.htm#000.md) put forth
his hand to hold the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md); for the oxen
stumbled.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) of the
LORD was kindled against [Uzza](../ebd/ebd376.htm#000.md), and he smote
him, because he put his hand to the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md): and
there he died before God.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) was
displeased, because the LORD had made a [breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005.md)
upon [Uzza](../ebd/ebd376.htm#000.md): wherefore that place is called
Perezuzza to this day.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) was afraid
of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God home to me?  

<span id="013">13</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) brought not
the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) home to himself to the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), but carried it aside into the house of
Obededom the [Gittite](../ebd/ebd149.htm#009.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God
remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the
LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.
