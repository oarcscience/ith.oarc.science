<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Galatians Chapter 1</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>, an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd026.htm#008">apostle</A>, (not of men, neither by man, but by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#004">Galatia</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">Grace</A> be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;To whom be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> for ever and ever. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> unto another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But though we, or an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, preach any other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;But I certify you, brethren, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> which was preached of me is not after man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd312.htm#002">revelation</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For ye have heard of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd089.htm#001">conversation</A> in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>; immediately I conferred not with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Neither went I up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> to them which were apostles before me; but I went into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#009">Arabia</A>, and returned again unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then after three years I went up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> to see <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, and abode with him fifteen days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;But other of the apostles saw I none, save <A HREF="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</A> the Lord's brother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Afterwards I came into the regions of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#003">Cilicia</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And they glorified God in me.<BR>
