### King James Version: Ezra Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Then the prophets, Haggai the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), and [Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006.md)
the son of [Iddo](../ebd/ebd186.htm#005.md), prophesied unto the Jews that
were in [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) and
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) in the name of the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), even unto them.  

<span id="002">2</span> Then rose up [Zerubbabel](../ebd/ebd391.htm#008.md)
the son of [Shealtiel](../ebd/ebd332.htm#003.md), and
[Jeshua](../ebd/ebd205.htm#003.md) the son of Jozadak, and began to build
the house of God which is at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): and
with them were the prophets of God helping them.  

<span id="003">3</span> At the same time came to them
[Tatnai](../ebd/ebd359.htm#006.md), governor on this side the river, and
Shetharboznai and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath
commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?  

<span id="004">4</span> Then said we unto them after this manner, What
are the names of the men that make this building?  

<span id="005">5</span> But the eye of their God was upon the elders of
the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came
to [Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007.md): and then they returned answer by
letter concerning this matter.  

<span id="006">6</span> The copy of the letter that
[Tatnai](../ebd/ebd359.htm#006.md), governor on this side the river, and
Shetharboznai and his companions the
[Apharsachites](../ebd/ebd026.htm#000.md), which were on this side the
river, sent unto [Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md):  

<span id="007">7</span> They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written
thus; Unto [Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), all peace.  

<span id="008">8</span> Be it known unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), that we went into the province of
[Judea](../ebd/ebd213.htm#004.md), to the house of the great God, which is
builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this
work goeth [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) on, and prospereth in their
hands.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then asked we those elders, and said unto them
thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these
walls?  

<span id="010">10</span> We asked their names also, to certify thee,
that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.  

<span id="011">11</span> And thus they returned us answer, saying, We
are the servants of the God of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) and
earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which
a great [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
builded and set up.  

<span id="012">12</span> But after that our fathers had provoked the God
of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) unto wrath, he gave them into the
hand of [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), the
Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> But in the first year of
[Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) the same [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006.md) made a decree to build this house of
God.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the vessels also of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) and [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) of the
house of God, which [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) took out of
the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) that was in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and brought them into the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md),
those did [Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) take out of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md), and
they were delivered unto one, whose name was
[Sheshbazzar](../ebd/ebd336.htm#003.md), whom he had made governor;  

<span id="015">15</span> And said unto him, Take these vessels, go,
carry them into the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) that is in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and let the house of God be builded
in his place.  

<span id="016">16</span> Then came the same
[Sheshbazzar](../ebd/ebd336.htm#003.md), and laid the foundation of the
house of God which is in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md): and since
that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not
finished.  

<span id="017">17</span> Now therefore, if it seem good to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), let there be search made in the king's
treasure house, which is there at [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md),
whether it be so, that a decree was made of
[Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) to
build this house of God at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and let
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) send his pleasure to us concerning
this matter.
