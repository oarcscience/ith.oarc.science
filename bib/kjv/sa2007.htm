<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 7</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;That the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, See now, I dwell in an house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A>, but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of God dwelleth within curtains.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</A> said to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the LORD is with thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</A>, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Go and tell my servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, even to this day, but have walked in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A> and in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> spake I a word with any of the tribes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, whom I commanded to feed my people <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, saying, Why build ye not me an house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, to be ruler over my people, over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Moreover I will appoint a place for my people <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A>, and I will establish his kingdom.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of his kingdom for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#005">stripes</A> of the children of men:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> shall not depart away from him, as I took it from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, whom I put away before thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> shall be established for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;According to all these words, and according to all this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>, so did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</A> speak unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then went <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And what can <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, from the nations and their gods?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: and let the house of thy servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> be established before thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A> unto thy servant:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Therefore now let it please thee to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.<BR>
