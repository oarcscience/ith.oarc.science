### King James Version: Luke Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set
forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely
believed among us,  

<span id="002">2</span> Even as they delivered them unto us, which from
the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;  

<span id="003">3</span> It seemed good to me also, having had perfect
understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in
order, most excellent [Theophilus](../ebd/ebd363.htm#008.md),  

<span id="004">4</span> That thou mightest know the certainty of those
things, wherein thou hast been instructed.  

<span id="005">5</span> THERE was in the days of Herod, the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of Judaea, a certain
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) named
[Zacharias](../ebd/ebd386.htm#006.md), of the course of
[Abia](../ebd/ebd002.htm#002.md): and his wife was of the daughters of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and her name was
[Elisabeth](../ebd/ebd117.htm#008.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And they were both righteous before God, walking
in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.  

<span id="007">7</span> And they had no child, because that
[Elisabeth](../ebd/ebd117.htm#008) was [barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007.md),
and they both were now well stricken in years.  

<span id="008">8</span> And it came to pass, that while he executed the
priest's office before God in the order of his course,  

<span id="009">9</span> According to the [custom](../ebd/ebd094.htm#008.md)
of the priest's office, his lot was to burn
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) when he went into the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) of the Lord.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the whole multitude of the people were
praying without at the time of [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And there appeared unto him an
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the Lord standing on the right side of
the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) of
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And when [Zacharias](../ebd/ebd386.htm#006.md) saw
him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.  

<span id="013">13</span> But the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) said
unto him, Fear not, [Zacharias](../ebd/ebd386.htm#006.md): for thy
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) is heard; and thy wife
[Elisabeth](../ebd/ebd117.htm#008.md) shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt
call his name John.  

<span id="014">14</span> And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many
shall rejoice at his [birth](../ebd/ebd059.htm#002.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord,
and shall [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) neither
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) nor strong [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md);
and he shall be filled with the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md),
even from his mother's womb.  

<span id="016">16</span> And many of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) shall he turn to the Lord their God.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he shall go before him in the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) and power of
[Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002.md), to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a
people prepared for the Lord.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Zacharias](../ebd/ebd386.htm#006.md) said
unto the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md), Whereby shall I know this? for
I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md)
answering said unto him, I am [Gabriel](../ebd/ebd140.htm#006.md), that
stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to
shew thee these glad tidings.  

<span id="020">20</span> And, behold, thou shalt be
[dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002.md), and not able to speak, until the day that
these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words,
which shall be fulfilled in their season.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the people waited for
[Zacharias](../ebd/ebd386.htm#006.md), and marvelled that he tarried so
long in the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And when he came out, he could not speak unto
them: and they perceived that he had seen a
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000) in the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md):
for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.  

<span id="023">23</span> And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days
of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.  

<span id="024">24</span> And after those days his wife
[Elisabeth](../ebd/ebd117.htm#008.md) conceived, and hid herself five
months, saying,  

<span id="025">25</span> Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days
wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.  

<span id="026">26</span> And in the sixth month the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) [Gabriel](../ebd/ebd140.htm#006.md) was sent
from God unto a city of [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md), named
[Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007.md),  

<span id="027">27</span> To a [virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009.md) espoused
to a man whose name was [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md), of the house of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md); and the virgin's name was
[Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) came in
unto her, and said, [Hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002.md), thou that art highly
favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.  

<span id="029">29</span> And when she saw him, she was troubled at his
saying, and cast in her mind what manner of
[salutation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#002.md) this should be.  

<span id="030">30</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) said
unto her, Fear not, [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md): for thou hast found
favour with God.  

<span id="031">31</span> And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb,
and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name
[JESUS](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> He shall be great, and shall be called the Son
of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of his father
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md):  

<span id="033">33</span> And he shall reign over the house of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) for ever; and of his kingdom there shall
be no end.  

<span id="034">34</span> Then said [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md) unto
the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md), How shall this be, seeing I know not
a man?  

<span id="035">35</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) answered
and said unto her, The Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md) shall come
upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore
also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son
of God.  

<span id="036">36</span> And, behold, thy cousin
[Elisabeth](../ebd/ebd117.htm#008.md), she hath also conceived a son in her
old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called
[barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007.md).  

<span id="037">37</span> For with God nothing shall be impossible.  

<span id="038">38</span> And [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md) said, Behold
the [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md) of the Lord; be it unto me
according to thy word. And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) departed
from her.  

<span id="039">39</span> And [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md) arose in
those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of
[Juda](../ebd/ebd212.htm#006.md);  

<span id="040">40</span> And entered into the house of
[Zacharias](../ebd/ebd386.htm#006.md), and saluted
[Elisabeth](../ebd/ebd117.htm#008.md).  

<span id="041">41</span> And it came to pass, that, when
[Elisabeth](../ebd/ebd117.htm#008.md) heard the
[salutation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#002) of [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md),
the [babe](../ebd/ebd040.htm#009.md) leaped in her womb; and
[Elisabeth](../ebd/ebd117.htm#008.md) was filled with the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md):  

<span id="042">42</span> And she spake out with a loud voice, and said,
Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of thy womb.  

<span id="043">43</span> And whence is this to me, that the mother of my
Lord should come to me?  

<span id="044">44</span> For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy
[salutation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#002.md) sounded in mine ears, the
[babe](../ebd/ebd040.htm#009.md) leaped in my womb for joy.  

<span id="045">45</span> And blessed is she that believed: for there
shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the
Lord.  

<span id="046">46</span> And [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md) said, My soul
doth magnify the Lord,  

<span id="047">47</span> And my [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) hath
rejoiced in God my [Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003.md).  

<span id="048">48</span> For he hath regarded the low estate of his
handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me
blessed.  

<span id="049">49</span> For he that is mighty hath done to me great
things; and holy is his name.  

<span id="050">50</span> And his [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) is on
them that fear him from [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) to
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md).  

<span id="051">51</span> He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath
scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.  

<span id="052">52</span> He hath put down the mighty from their seats,
and exalted them of low degree.  

<span id="053">53</span> He hath filled the hungry with good things; and
the rich he hath sent empty away.  

<span id="054">54</span> He hath holpen his servant
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), in remembrance of his
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md);  

<span id="055">55</span> As he spake to our fathers, to
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), and to his seed for ever.  

<span id="056">56</span> And [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009.md) abode with
her about three months, and returned to her own house.  

<span id="057">57</span> Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should
be delivered; and she brought forth a son.  

<span id="058">58</span> And her neighbours and her cousins heard how
the Lord had shewed great [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) upon her; and
they rejoiced with her.  

<span id="059">59</span> And it came to pass, that on the eighth day
they came to circumcise the child; and they called him
[Zacharias](../ebd/ebd386.htm#006.md), after the name of his father.  

<span id="060">60</span> And his mother answered and said, Not so; but
he shall be called John.  

<span id="061">61</span> And they said unto her, There is none of thy
kindred that is called by this name.  

<span id="062">62</span> And they made signs to his father, how he would
have him called.  

<span id="063">63</span> And he asked for a
[writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005.md) table, and wrote, saying, His name is
John. And they marvelled all.  

<span id="064">64</span> And his mouth was opened immediately, and his
tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God.  

<span id="065">65</span> And fear came on all that dwelt round about
them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill
country of Judaea.  

<span id="066">66</span> And all they that heard them laid them up in
their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand
of the Lord was with him.  

<span id="067">67</span> And his father
[Zacharias](../ebd/ebd386.htm#006.md) was filled with the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md), and prophesied, saying,  

<span id="068">68</span> Blessed be the Lord God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); for he hath visited and redeemed his
people,  

<span id="069">69</span> And hath raised up an
[horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003) of [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) for
us in the house of his servant [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md);  

<span id="070">70</span> As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets,
which have been since the world began:  

<span id="071">71</span> That we should be saved from our enemies, and
from the hand of all that hate us;  

<span id="072">72</span> To perform the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md)
promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md);  

<span id="073">73</span> The [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md) which he
sware to our father [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md),  

<span id="074">74</span> That he would grant unto us, that we being
delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,  

<span id="075">75</span> In [holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md) and
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) before him, all the days of our
life.  

<span id="076">76</span> And thou, child, shalt be called the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) of the Highest: for thou shalt go
before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;  

<span id="077">77</span> To give knowledge of
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) unto his people by the remission of
their sins,  

<span id="078">78</span> Through the tender
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) of our God; whereby the
[dayspring](../ebd/ebd098.htm#009.md) from on high hath visited us,  

<span id="079">79</span> To give light to them that sit in
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) and in the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) of death, to guide our feet into the way
of peace.  

<span id="080">80</span> And the child grew, and waxed strong in
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), and was in the deserts till the day of
his shewing unto [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).
