### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but
he that hateth reproof is brutish.  

<span id="002">2</span> A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a
man of wicked devices will he condemn.  

<span id="003">3</span> A man shall not be established by wickedness:
but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.  

<span id="004">4</span> A virtuous woman is a
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) to her husband: but she that maketh
ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.  

<span id="005">5</span> The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the
counsels of the wicked are deceit.  

<span id="006">6</span> The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md): but the mouth of the upright shall
deliver them.  

<span id="007">7</span> The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the
house of the righteous shall stand.  

<span id="008">8</span> A man shall be commended according to his
wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.  

<span id="009">9</span> He that is despised, and hath a servant, is
better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> A righteous man regardeth the life of his
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md): but the tender mercies of the wicked are
cruel.  

<span id="011">11</span> He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied
with [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md): but he that followeth vain persons
is void of understanding.  

<span id="012">12</span> The wicked desireth the
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002.md) of evil men: but the root of the righteous
yieldeth [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> The wicked is snared by the transgression of
his lips: but the just shall come out of trouble.  

<span id="014">14</span> A man shall be satisfied with good by the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of his mouth: and the recompence of a
man's hands shall be rendered unto him.  

<span id="015">15</span> The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but
he that hearkeneth unto counsel is [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> A fool's wrath is presently known: but a
prudent man covereth shame.  

<span id="017">17</span> He that speaketh truth sheweth forth
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md): but a false
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) deceit.  

<span id="018">18</span> There is that speaketh like the piercings of a
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md): but the tongue of the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) is health.  

<span id="019">19</span> The [lip](../ebd/ebd230.htm#002.md) of truth shall
be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment.  

<span id="020">20</span> Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine
evil: but to the counsellors of peace is joy.  

<span id="021">21</span> There shall no evil happen to the just: but the
wicked shall be filled with mischief.  

<span id="022">22</span> Lying lips are
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md) to the LORD: but they that deal
truly are his delight.  

<span id="023">23</span> A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the
heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.  

<span id="024">24</span> The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but
the slothful shall be under [tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop:
but a good word maketh it glad.  

<span id="026">26</span> The righteous is more excellent than his
neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them.  

<span id="027">27</span> The slothful man roasteth not that which he
took in [hunting](../ebd/ebd184.htm#008.md): but the substance of a
diligent man is precious.  

<span id="028">28</span> In the way of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) is life: and in the pathway
thereof there is no death.
