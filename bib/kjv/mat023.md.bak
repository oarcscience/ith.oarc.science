### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 23

<span id="001">1</span> Then spake [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) to the
multitude, and to his disciples,  

<span id="002">2</span> Saying The [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md) and
the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md) sit in Moses' seat:  

<span id="003">3</span> All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe,
that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and
do not.  

<span id="004">4</span> For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be
borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not
move them with one of their fingers.  

<span id="005">5</span> But all their works they do for to be seen of
men: they make broad their [phylacteries](../ebd/ebd294.htm#009.md), and
enlarge the borders of their garments,  

<span id="006">6</span> And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the
chief seats in the synagogues,  

<span id="007">7</span> And greetings in the markets, and to be called
of men, [Rabbi](../ebd/ebd304.htm#006.md),
[Rabbi](../ebd/ebd304.htm#006.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> But be not ye called
[Rabbi](../ebd/ebd304.htm#006.md): for one is your Master, even
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md); and all ye are brethren.  

<span id="009">9</span> And call no man your father upon the earth: for
one is your Father, which is in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> Neither be ye called masters: for one is your
Master, even [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> But he that is greatest among you shall be your
servant.  

<span id="012">12</span> And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be
abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.  

<span id="013">13</span> But woe unto you,
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) and [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md),
hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) against men: for ye neither go in
yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.  

<span id="014">14</span> Woe unto you, [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md)
and [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md), hypocrites! for ye devour
widows' houses, and for a pretence make long
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md): therefore ye shall receive the greater
[damnation](../ebd/ebd096.htm#008.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> Woe unto you, [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md)
and [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md), hypocrites! for ye compass sea
and land to make one [proselyte](../ebd/ebd301.htm#001.md), and when he is
made, ye make him twofold more the child of
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md) than yourselves.  

<span id="016">16</span> Woe unto you, ye [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md)
guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), it is nothing; but whosoever shall
swear by the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), he is a
[debtor](../ebd/ebd100.htm#000.md)!  

<span id="017">17</span> Ye fools and [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md):
for whether is greater, the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), or the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) that sanctifieth the
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md)?  

<span id="018">18</span> And, Whosoever shall swear by the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by
the [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005.md) that is upon it, he is guilty.  

<span id="019">19</span> Ye fools and [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md):
for whether is greater, the [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005.md), or the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) that sanctifieth the
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005.md)?  

<span id="020">20</span> Whoso therefore shall swear by the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md), sweareth by it, and by all things
thereon.  

<span id="021">21</span> And whoso shall swear by the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), sweareth by it, and by him that
dwelleth therein.  

<span id="022">22</span> And he that shall swear by
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), sweareth by the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) of God, and by him that sitteth
thereon.  

<span id="023">23</span> Woe unto you, [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md)
and [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md), hypocrites! for ye pay
[tithe](../ebd/ebd368.htm#005) of [mint](../ebd/ebd256.htm#001.md) and
[anise](../ebd/ebd024.htm#005) and [cummin](../ebd/ebd093.htm#009.md), and
have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment,
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md), and faith: these ought ye to have done,
and not to leave the other undone.  

<span id="024">24</span> Ye [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md) guides, which
strain at a [gnat](../ebd/ebd150.htm#009.md), and
[swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009) a [camel](../ebd/ebd070.htm#000.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> Woe unto you, [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md)
and [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md), hypocrites! for ye make
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) the outside of the
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000.md) and of the platter, but within they are
full of extortion and excess.  

<span id="026">26</span> Thou [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md) Pharisee,
cleanse first that which is within the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000.md) and
platter, that the outside of them may be [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md)
also.  

<span id="027">27</span> Woe unto you, [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md)
and [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md), hypocrites! for ye are like unto
whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within
full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.  

<span id="028">28</span> Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto
men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.  

<span id="029">29</span> Woe unto you, [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md)
and [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md), hypocrites! because ye build the
[tombs](../ebd/ebd370.htm#001.md) of the prophets, and
[garnish](../ebd/ebd143.htm#006.md) the sepulchres of the righteous,  

<span id="030">30</span> And say, If we had been in the days of our
fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of the prophets.  

<span id="031">31</span> Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that
ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.  

<span id="032">32</span> Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.  

<span id="033">33</span> Ye serpents, ye
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) of vipers, how can ye escape the
[damnation](../ebd/ebd096.htm#008) of [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md)?  

<span id="034">34</span> Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets,
and [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) men, and
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md): and some of them ye shall kill and
crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and
persecute them from city to city:  

<span id="035">35</span> That upon you may come all the righteous
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) shed upon the earth, from the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of righteous
[Abel](../ebd/ebd001.htm#004) unto the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of
[Zacharias](../ebd/ebd386.htm#006.md) son of
[Barachias](../ebd/ebd044.htm#004.md), whom ye slew between the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) and the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md).  

<span id="036">36</span> Verily I say unto you, All these things shall
come upon this [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md).  

<span id="037">37</span> O [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md),
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), thou that killest the prophets, and
stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered
thy children together, even as a [hen](../ebd/ebd174.htm#002.md) gathereth
her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!  

<span id="038">38</span> Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.  

<span id="039">39</span> For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me
henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of
the Lord.
