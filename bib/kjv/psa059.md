### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 59

<span id="001">1</span> Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend
me from them that rise up against me.  

<span id="002">2</span> Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and
save me from bloody men.  

<span id="003">3</span> For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the
mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), O LORD.  

<span id="004">4</span> They run and prepare themselves without my
fault: awake to help me, and behold.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), awake to visit all the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md): be not merciful to any wicked
transgressors. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> They return at evening: they make a noise like a
dog, and go round about the city.  

<span id="007">7</span> Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords
are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?  

<span id="008">8</span> But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou
shalt have all the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) in derision.  

<span id="009">9</span> Because of his strength will I wait upon thee:
for God is my defence.  

<span id="010">10</span> The God of my [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md)
shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies.  

<span id="011">11</span> Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter
them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> For the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) of their
mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride:
and for cursing and lying which they speak.  

<span id="013">13</span> Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they
may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) unto the ends of the earth.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And at evening let them return; and let them
make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.  

<span id="015">15</span> Let them wander up and down for meat, and
grudge if they be not satisfied.  

<span id="016">16</span> But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing
aloud of thy [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) in the morning: for thou
hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.  

<span id="017">17</span> Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God
is my defence, and the God of my [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md).
