### King James Version: Acts Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Now [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) and John went
up together into the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) at the hour of
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md), being the ninth hour.  

<span id="002">2</span> And a certain man lame from his mother's womb
was carried, whom they laid daily at the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md)
of the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) which is called Beautiful, to ask
[alms](../ebd/ebd018.htm#002.md) of them that entered into the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md);  

<span id="003">3</span> Who seeing [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) and
John about to go into the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) asked an
[alms](../ebd/ebd018.htm#002.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md), fastening
his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive
something of them.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) said,
[Silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) have I
none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) of
[Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007.md) rise up and walk.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he took him by the right hand, and lifted
him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered
with them into the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), walking, and
leaping, and praising God.  

<span id="009">9</span> And all the people saw him walking and praising
God:  

<span id="010">10</span> And they knew that it was he which sat for
[alms](../ebd/ebd018.htm#002.md) at the Beautiful
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md):
and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had
happened unto him.  

<span id="011">11</span> And as the lame man which was healed held
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) and John, all the people ran together
unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.  

<span id="012">12</span> And when [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) saw it,
he answered unto the people, Ye men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by
our own power or [holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md) we had made this man
to walk?  

<span id="013">13</span> The God of [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md),
and of [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md), and of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), the God of our fathers, hath glorified
his Son [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md); whom ye delivered up, and denied
him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.  

<span id="014">14</span> But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and
desired a murderer to be granted unto you;  

<span id="015">15</span> And killed the [Prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md)
of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.  

<span id="016">16</span> And his name through faith in his name hath
made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by
him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.  

<span id="017">17</span> And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance
ye did it, as did also your rulers.  

<span id="018">18</span> But those things, which God before had shewed
by the mouth of all his prophets, that [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.  

<span id="019">19</span> Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that
your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come
from the presence of the Lord.  

<span id="020">20</span> And he shall send
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), which
before was preached unto you:  

<span id="021">21</span> Whom the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) must
receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath
spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.  

<span id="022">22</span> For [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) truly said
unto the fathers, A [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) shall the Lord your
God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear
in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.  

<span id="023">23</span> And it shall come to pass, that every soul,
which will not hear that [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md), shall be
destroyed from among the people.  

<span id="024">24</span> Yea, and all the prophets from
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) and those that follow after, as many as
have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.  

<span id="025">25</span> Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) which God made with our fathers,
saying unto [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), And in thy seed shall all
the kindreds of the earth be blessed.  

<span id="026">26</span> Unto you first God, having raised up his Son
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), sent him to
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) you, in turning away every one of you
from his iniquities.
