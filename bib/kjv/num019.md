### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001),
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD
hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that they bring thee a red
[heifer](../ebd/ebd171.htm#006) without spot, wherein is no
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007), and upon which never came
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009):  

<span id="003">3</span> And ye shall give her unto
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),
that he may bring her forth without the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002),
and one shall slay her before his face:  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall take of her
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) with his finger, and sprinkle of her
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) directly before the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
times:  

<span id="005">5</span> And one shall burn the
[heifer](../ebd/ebd171.htm#006) in his sight; her skin, and her
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), and her [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000),
with her [dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003), shall he burn:  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
take [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and
[hyssop](../ebd/ebd185.htm#007), and [scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005),
and cast it into the midst of the burning of the
[heifer](../ebd/ebd171.htm#006).  

<span id="007">7</span> Then the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007)
in water, and afterward he shall come into the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002), and the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003)
shall be unclean until the even.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes
in water, and bathe his [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) in water, and
shall be unclean until the even.  

<span id="009">9</span> And a man that is [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005)
shall gather up the [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000) of the
[heifer](../ebd/ebd171.htm#006), and lay them up without the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) in a [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) place,
and it shall be kept for the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) for a water of
separation: it is a [purification](../ebd/ebd302.htm#007) for
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="010">10</span> And he that gathereth the
[ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000) of the [heifer](../ebd/ebd171.htm#006)
shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be
unto the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and unto the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) that sojourneth among them, for a
statute for ever.  

<span id="011">11</span> He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall
be unclean [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days.  

<span id="012">12</span> He shall purify himself with it on the third
day, and on the seventh day he shall be [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005):
but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he
shall not be [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005).  

<span id="013">13</span> Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man
that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the LORD; and that soul shall be
cut off from [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): because the water of
separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his
uncleanness is yet upon him.  

<span id="014">14</span> This is the law, when a man dieth in a
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009): all that come into the
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009), and all that is in the
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009), shall be unclean
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days.  

<span id="015">15</span> And every open vessel, which hath no covering
bound upon it, is unclean.  

<span id="016">16</span> And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) in the open fields, or a dead body, or a
bone of a man, or a [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008), shall be unclean
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days.  

<span id="017">17</span> And for an unclean person they shall take of
the [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000) of the burnt
[heifer](../ebd/ebd171.htm#006) of [purification](../ebd/ebd302.htm#007)
for [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), and running water shall be put thereto
in a vessel:  

<span id="018">18</span> And a [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) person
shall take [hyssop](../ebd/ebd185.htm#007), and dip it in the water, and
sprinkle it upon the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009), and upon all the
vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched
a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008):  

<span id="019">19</span> And the [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) person
shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh
day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his
clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) at even.  

<span id="020">20</span> But the man that shall be unclean, and shall
not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), because he hath defiled the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005) of the LORD: the water of separation
hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.  

<span id="021">21</span> And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them,
that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes;
and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until
even.  

<span id="022">22</span> And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth
shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until
even.
