### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 66

<span id="001">1</span> Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:  

<span id="002">2</span> Sing forth the honour of his name: make his
praise glorious.  

<span id="003">3</span> Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy
works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit
themselves unto thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> All the earth shall
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) thee, and shall sing unto thee; they
shall sing to thy name. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in
his doing toward the children of men.  

<span id="006">6</span> He turned the sea into dry land: they went
through the [flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000.md) on foot: there did we rejoice
in him.  

<span id="007">7</span> He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold
the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> O [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) our God, ye
people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:  

<span id="009">9</span> Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth
not our feet to be moved.  

<span id="010">10</span> For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast
tried us, as [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) is tried.  

<span id="011">11</span> Thou broughtest us into the
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002.md); thou laidst affliction upon our loins.  

<span id="012">12</span> Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we
went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a
wealthy place.  

<span id="013">13</span> I will go into thy house with burnt offerings:
I will pay thee my [vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001.md),  

<span id="014">14</span> Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath
spoken, when I was in trouble.  

<span id="015">15</span> I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of
fatlings, with the [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002.md) of rams; I will
offer bullocks with goats. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will
declare what he hath done for my soul.  

<span id="017">17</span> I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was
extolled with my tongue.  

<span id="018">18</span> If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will
not hear me:  

<span id="019">19</span> But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended
to the voice of my [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000), nor his [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md)
from me.
