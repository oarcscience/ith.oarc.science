### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> And if his oblation be a
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of peace
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), if he offer it of the
[herd](../ebd/ebd174.htm#009); whether it be a male or female, he shall
offer it without [blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007) before the LORD.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and kill it at the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004): and Aaron's sons the priests
shall sprinkle the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) round about.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he shall offer of the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of the peace
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001)
made by fire unto the LORD; the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) that
covereth the inwards, and all the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) that is
upon the inwards,  

<span id="004">4</span> And the two kidneys, and the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) that is on them, which is by the flanks,
and the [caul](../ebd/ebd074.htm#003) above the
[liver](../ebd/ebd230.htm#004), with the kidneys, it shall he take
away.  

<span id="005">5</span> And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) upon the burnt
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002), which is upon the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) that is on the fire: it is an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) made by fire, of a sweet savour unto
the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> And if his [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) for
a [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of peace
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) unto the LORD be of the flock; male or

<span id="007">7</span> If he offer a [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003) for
his [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), then shall he offer it before the
LORD.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and kill it before the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004): and Aaron's sons shall sprinkle
the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) thereof round about upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006).  

<span id="009">9</span> And he shall offer of the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of the peace
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001)
made by fire unto the LORD; the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) thereof,
and the whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) that covereth the inwards, and all the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) that is upon the inwards,  

<span id="010">10</span> And the two kidneys, and the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) that is upon them, which is by the flanks,
and the [caul](../ebd/ebd074.htm#003) above the
[liver](../ebd/ebd230.htm#004), with the kidneys, it shall he take
away.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
burn it upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006): it is the food of the
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) made by fire unto the LORD.  

<span id="012">12</span> And if his [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) be
a [goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001), then he shall offer it before the
LORD.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it,
and kill it before the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the

[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) shall sprinkle the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) thereof upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) round about.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he shall offer thereof his
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), even an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) made by fire unto the LORD; the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) that covereth the inwards, and all the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) that is upon the inwards,

burn them upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006): it is the food of the
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) made by fire for a sweet savour: all
the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) is the LORD's.  

<span id="017">17</span> It shall be a perpetual statute for your
generations throughout all your [dwellings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#001), that
ye eat neither [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) nor
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000).
