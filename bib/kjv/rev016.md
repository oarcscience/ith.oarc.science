### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> And I heard a great voice out of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) saying to the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) angels, Go your ways, and pour out the
vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the first went, and poured out his vial upon
the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which
had the mark of the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), and upon them which
worshipped his image.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the second [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001)
poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of a dead man: and every living soul died
in the sea.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the third [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001)
poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they
became [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000).  

<span id="005">5</span> And I heard the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001)
of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and
shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.  

<span id="006">6</span> For they have shed the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of saints and prophets, and thou hast
given them [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009); for they are worthy.  

<span id="007">7</span> And I heard another out of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and
righteous are thy judgments.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the fourth [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001)
poured out his vial upon the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001); and power was
given unto him to scorch men with fire.  

<span id="009">9</span> And men were scorched with great heat, and
blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and
they repented not to give him [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006).  

<span id="010">10</span> And the fifth [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001)
poured out his vial upon the seat of the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001);
and his kingdom was full of [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008); and they
gnawed their tongues for pain,  

<span id="011">11</span> And blasphemed the God of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) because of their pains and their sores,
and repented not of their deeds.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the sixth [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001)
poured out his vial upon the great river
[Euphrates](../ebd/ebd127.htm#001); and the water thereof was dried up,
that the way of the kings of the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) might be
prepared.  

<span id="013">13</span> And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come
out of the mouth of the [dragon](../ebd/ebd107.htm#000), and out of the
mouth of the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), and out of the mouth of the
false [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008).  

<span id="014">14</span> For they are the spirits of devils, working
miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole
world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.  

<span id="015">15</span> Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that
watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk
[naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003), and they see his shame.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he gathered them together into a place
called in the [Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009) tongue
[Armageddon](../ebd/ebd031.htm#003).  

<span id="017">17</span> And the seventh [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001)
poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of
the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006),
from the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001), saying, It is done.  

<span id="018">18</span> And there were voices, and thunders, and
lightnings; and there was a great [earthquake](../ebd/ebd110.htm#009),
such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an
[earthquake](../ebd/ebd110.htm#009), and so great.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the great city was divided into three
parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) came in remembrance before God, to give
unto her the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) of the
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) of the fierceness of his wrath.  

<span id="020">20</span> And every [island](../ebd/ebd190.htm#009) fled
away, and the mountains were not found.  

<span id="021">21</span> And there fell upon men a great
[hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002) out of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006),
every [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) about the weight of a
[talent](../ebd/ebd357.htm#009): and men blasphemed God because of the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) of the [hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002);
for the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) thereof was exceeding great.
