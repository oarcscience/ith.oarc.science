### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> A false [balance](../ebd/ebd042.htm#007) is
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) to the LORD: but a just weight is
his delight.  

<span id="002">2</span> When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with
the lowly is wisdom.  

<span id="003">3</span> The integrity of the upright shall guide them:
but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.  

<span id="004">4</span> Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) delivereth from death.  

<span id="005">5</span> The [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) of
the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own
wickedness.  

<span id="006">6</span> The [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) of
the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in
their own naughtiness.  

<span id="007">7</span> When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall
perish: and the hope of unjust men perisheth.  

<span id="008">8</span> The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and
the wicked cometh in his stead.  

<span id="009">9</span> An [hypocrite](../ebd/ebd185.htm#006) with his
mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be
delivered.  

<span id="010">10</span> When it goeth well with the righteous, the city
rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, there is shouting.  

<span id="011">11</span> By the blessing of the upright the city is
exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.  

<span id="012">12</span> He that is void of wisdom despiseth his
neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.  

<span id="013">13</span> A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is
of a [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009)
concealeth the matter.  

<span id="014">14</span> Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in
the multitude of counsellors there is safety.  

<span id="015">15</span> He that is [surety](../ebd/ebd353.htm#005) for
a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) shall smart for it: and he that
hateth suretiship is sure.  

<span id="016">16</span> A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong
men retain riches.  

<span id="017">17</span> The merciful man doeth good to his own soul:
but he that is cruel troubleth his own [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007).  

<span id="018">18</span> The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him
that soweth [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) shall be a sure
reward.  

<span id="019">19</span> As [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004)
tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own
death.  

<span id="020">20</span> They that are of a froward heart are
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) to the LORD: but such as are
upright in their way are his delight.  

<span id="021">21</span> Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not
be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.  

<span id="022">22</span> As a jewel of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) in
a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion.  

<span id="023">23</span> The desire of the righteous is only good: but
the expectation of the wicked is wrath.  

<span id="024">24</span> There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth;
and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to
poverty.  

<span id="025">25</span> The liberal soul shall be made
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005): and he that watereth shall be watered also
himself.  

<span id="026">26</span> He that withholdeth
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006), the people shall
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) him: but blessing shall be upon the head
of him that selleth it.  

<span id="027">27</span> He that diligently seeketh good procureth
favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.  

<span id="028">28</span> He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; but
the righteous shall flourish as a [branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002).  

<span id="029">29</span> He that troubleth his own house shall inherit
the wind: and the fool shall be servant to the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) of heart.  

<span id="030">30</span> The [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of the
righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004).  

<span id="031">31</span> Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in
the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.
