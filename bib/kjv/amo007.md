### King James Version: Amos Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and,
behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of
the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's
mowings.  

<span id="002">2</span> And it came to pass, that when they had made an
end of [eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006) the
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005) of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD,
forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007)
arise? for he is small.  

<span id="003">3</span> The LORD repented for this: It shall not be,
saith the LORD.  

<span id="004">4</span> Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and,
behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the
great [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008), and did eat up a part.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee:
by whom shall [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) arise? for he is small.  

<span id="006">6</span> The LORD repented for this: This also shall not
be, saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="007">7</span> Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the LORD stood
upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the LORD said unto me,
[Amos](../ebd/ebd021.htm#007), what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline.
Then said the LORD, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my
people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): I will not again pass by them
any more:  

<span id="009">9</span> And the high places of
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006) shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall be laid waste; and I will rise
against the house of [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="010">10</span> Then [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) of [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006) sent
to [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saying, [Amos](../ebd/ebd021.htm#007)
hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): the land is not able to bear all his
words.  

<span id="011">11</span> For thus [Amos](../ebd/ebd021.htm#007) saith,
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) shall die by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
shall surely be led away [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) out of their
own land.  

<span id="012">12</span> Also [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007) said unto
[Amos](../ebd/ebd021.htm#007), O thou [seer](../ebd/ebd326.htm#000), go,
flee thee away into the land of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and
there eat [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and prophesy there:  

<span id="013">13</span> But prophesy not again any more at
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006): for it is the king's
[chapel](../ebd/ebd077.htm#003), and it is the king's court.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then answered [Amos](../ebd/ebd021.htm#007),
and said to [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007), I was no
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), neither was I a prophet's son; but I
was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000):  

<span id="015">15</span> And the LORD took me as I followed the flock,
and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="016">16</span> Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD:
Thou sayest, Prophesy not against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and
drop not thy word against the house of [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006).  

<span id="017">17</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall
be an [harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005) in the city, and thy sons and thy
daughters shall fall by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and thy land
shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall surely go into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) forth of his land.
