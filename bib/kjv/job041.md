### King James Version: Job Chapter 41

<span id="001">1</span> Canst thou draw out
[leviathan](../ebd/ebd227.htm#007.md) with an
[hook](../ebd/ebd181.htm#004.md)? or his tongue with a
[cord](../ebd/ebd090.htm#000.md) which thou lettest down?  

<span id="002">2</span> Canst thou put an [hook](../ebd/ebd181.htm#004.md)
into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a
[thorn](../ebd/ebd364.htm#006.md)?  

<span id="003">3</span> Will he make many supplications unto thee? will
he speak soft words unto thee?  

<span id="004">4</span> Will he make a [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md)
with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?  

<span id="005">5</span> Wilt thou play with him as with a
[bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000.md)? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?  

<span id="006">6</span> Shall the companions make a
[banquet](../ebd/ebd043.htm#006.md) of him? shall they part him among the
merchants?  

<span id="007">7</span> Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or
his head with [fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005.md) spears?  

<span id="008">8</span> Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do
no more.  

<span id="009">9</span> Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not
one be cast down even at the sight of him?  

<span id="010">10</span> None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who
then is able to stand before me?  

<span id="011">11</span> Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him?
whatsoever is under the whole [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) is mine.  

<span id="012">12</span> I will not conceal his parts, nor his power,
nor his comely proportion.  

<span id="013">13</span> Who can discover the face of his garment? or
who can come to him with his double [bridle](../ebd/ebd065.htm#002.md)?  

<span id="014">14</span> Who can open the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md)
of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.  

<span id="015">15</span> His scales are his pride, shut up together as
with a close [seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> One is so near to another, that no air can come
between them.  

<span id="017">17</span> They are joined one to another, they stick
together, that they cannot be sundered.  

<span id="018">18</span> By his neesings a light doth shine, and his
eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.  

<span id="019">19</span> Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks
of fire leap out.  

<span id="020">20</span> Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a
seething pot or caldron.  

<span id="021">21</span> His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth
out of his mouth.  

<span id="022">22</span> In his [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md) remaineth
strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.  

<span id="023">23</span> The flakes of his
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) are joined together: they are firm in
themselves; they cannot be moved.  

<span id="024">24</span> His heart is as firm as a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md); yea, as hard as a piece of the nether
millstone.  

<span id="025">25</span> When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are
afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.  

<span id="026">26</span> The [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) of him that
layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the [dart](../ebd/ebd097.htm#009.md),
nor the [habergeon](../ebd/ebd156.htm#006.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> He esteemeth [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md) as
[straw](../ebd/ebd352.htm#000), and [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md) as
rotten [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are
turned with him into stubble.  

<span id="029">29</span> Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at
the shaking of a spear.  

<span id="030">30</span> Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp
pointed things upon the mire.  

<span id="031">31</span> He maketh the [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) to
[boil](../ebd/ebd061.htm#008.md) like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot
of [ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> He maketh a path to shine after him; one would
think the [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) to be hoary.  

<span id="033">33</span> Upon earth there is not his like, who is made
without fear.  

<span id="034">34</span> He beholdeth all high things: he is a
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over all the children of pride.
