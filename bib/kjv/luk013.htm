<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 13</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;He spake also this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A>; A certain man had a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</A> tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> thereon, and found none.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> on this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</A> tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#003">dung</A> it:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And if it bear <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A>, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And, behold, there was a woman which had a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> lift up herself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And the ruler of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A> answered with indignation, because that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> had healed on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou <A HREF="../ebd/ebd185.htm#006">hypocrite</A>, doth not each one of you on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> loose his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> or his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A> from the stall, and lead him away to watering?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And ought not this woman, being a daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, whom <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A> hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#001">bond</A> on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;It is like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#003">grain</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd262.htm#009">mustard</A> seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;It is like <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</A>, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And he went through the cities and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</A>, teaching, and journeying toward <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Strive to enter in at the strait <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd221.htm#008">knock</A> at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</A> in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And they shall come from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A>, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;The same day there came certain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A>, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd138.htm#003">fox</A>, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> perish out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#002">hen</A> doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.<BR>
