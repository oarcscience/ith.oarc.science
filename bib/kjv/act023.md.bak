### King James Version: Acts Chapter 23

<span id="001">1</span> And [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md), earnestly
beholding the [council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004.md), said, Men and brethren,
I have lived in all good [conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006.md) before God
until this day.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
[Ananias](../ebd/ebd023.htm#001.md) commanded them that stood by him to
smite him on the mouth.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then said [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) unto
him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) me after the law, and commandest me to be
smitten contrary to the law?  

<span id="004">4</span> And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's
high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)?  

<span id="005">5</span> Then said [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md), I wist
not, brethren, that he was the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md): for
it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.  

<span id="006">6</span> But when [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) perceived
that the one part were [Sadducees](../ebd/ebd318.htm#003.md), and the other
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md), he cried out in the
[council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004.md), Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the
son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called
in question.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when he had so said, there arose a
dissension between the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md) and the
[Sadducees](../ebd/ebd318.htm#003.md): and the multitude was divided.  

<span id="008">8</span> For the [Sadducees](../ebd/ebd318.htm#003.md) say
that there is no resurrection, neither [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md),
nor [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md): but the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008.md) confess both.  

<span id="009">9</span> And there arose a great cry: and the
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md) that were of the Pharisees' part arose,
and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) or an [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md)
hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.  

<span id="010">10</span> And when there arose a great dissension, the
chief captain, fearing lest [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) should have
been pulled in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md) of them, commanded the
soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to
bring him into the [castle](../ebd/ebd073.htm#008.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And the night following the Lord stood by him,
and said, Be of good cheer, [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md): for as thou
hast testified of me in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), so must thou
bear [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) also at
[Rome](../ebd/ebd315.htm#007.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded
together, and bound themselves under a [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md),
saying that they would neither eat nor [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md)
till they had killed [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And they were more than forty which had made
this conspiracy.  

<span id="014">14</span> And they came to the chief priests and elders,
and said, We have bound ourselves under a great
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md), that we will eat nothing until we have
slain [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> Now therefore ye with the
[council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004.md) signify to the chief captain that he
bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something
more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready
to kill him.  

<span id="016">16</span> And when Paul's sister's son heard of their
lying in wait, he went and entered into the
[castle](../ebd/ebd073.htm#008.md), and told
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Then [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) called one
of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the
chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.  

<span id="018">18</span> So he took him, and brought him to the chief
captain, and said, [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) the prisoner called me
unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath
something to say unto thee.  

<span id="019">19</span> Then the chief captain took him by the hand,
and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast
to tell me?  

<span id="020">20</span> And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire
thee that thou wouldest bring down [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) to
morrow into the [council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004.md), as though they would
enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.  

<span id="021">21</span> But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie
in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves
with an [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000.md), that they will neither eat nor
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) till they have killed him: and now are
they ready, looking for a promise from thee.  

<span id="022">22</span> So the chief captain then let the young man
depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed
these things to me.  

<span id="023">23</span> And he called unto him two centurions, saying,
Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to
[Caesarea](../ebd/ebd068.htm#003.md), and horsemen threescore and ten, and
spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;  

<span id="024">24</span> And provide them beasts, that they may set
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) on, and bring him safe unto
[Felix](../ebd/ebd132.htm#001.md) the governor.  

<span id="025">25</span> And he wrote a letter after this manner:  

<span id="026">26</span> [Claudius](../ebd/ebd084.htm#003.md) Lysias unto
the most excellent governor [Felix](../ebd/ebd132.htm#001.md) sendeth
greeting.  

<span id="027">27</span> This man was taken of the Jews, and should have
been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having
understood that he was a Roman.  

<span id="028">28</span> And when I would have known the cause wherefore
they accused him, I brought him forth into their
[council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004.md):  

<span id="029">29</span> Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of
their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of
bonds.  

<span id="030">30</span> And when it was told me how that the Jews laid
wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to
his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him.
Farewell.  

<span id="031">31</span> Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them,
took [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md), and brought him by night to
[Antipatris](../ebd/ebd025.htm#004.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with
him, and returned to the [castle](../ebd/ebd073.htm#008.md):  

<span id="033">33</span> Who, when they came to
[Caesarea](../ebd/ebd068.htm#003.md) and delivered the epistle to the
governor, presented [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002.md) also before him.  

<span id="034">34</span> And when the governor had read the letter, he
asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of
[Cilicia](../ebd/ebd083.htm#003.md);  

<span id="035">35</span> I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers
are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment
hall.
