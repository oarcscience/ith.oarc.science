### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> Then [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) said, Hear
ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow about this time
shall a measure of fine [flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001.md) be sold for a
[shekel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#009.md), and two measures of
[barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003) for a [shekel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#009.md),
in the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Then a lord on whose hand the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) leaned answered the man of God, and said,
Behold, if the LORD would make windows in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), might this thing be? And he said,
Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.  

<span id="003">3</span> And there were four leprous men at the entering
in of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md): and they said one to another,
Why sit we here until we die?  

<span id="004">4</span> If we say, We will enter into the city, then the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md) is in the city, and we shall die there:
and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us
fall unto the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of the Syrians: if they save
us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.  

<span id="005">5</span> And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md) of the Syrians: and when they were come to
the uttermost part of the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md) of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md), behold, there was no man there.  

<span id="006">6</span> For the LORD had made the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of the Syrians to hear a noise of
chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md): and they said one to another, Lo, the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) hath
hired against us the kings of the [Hittites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#006.md), and
the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.  

<span id="007">7</span> Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight,
and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md) as it was, and fled for their life.  

<span id="008">8</span> And when these lepers came to the uttermost part
of the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md), they went into one
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md), and did eat and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), and carried thence
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and
raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md), and carried thence also, and went and hid
it.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then they said one to another, We do not well:
this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry
till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore
come, that we may go and tell the king's household.  

<span id="010">10</span> So they came and called unto the
[porter](../ebd/ebd299.htm#000.md) of the city: and they told them, saying,
We came to the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md) of the Syrians, and,
behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied,
and asses tied, and the tents as they were.  

<span id="011">11</span> And he called the porters; and they told it to
the king's house within.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) arose in
the night, and said unto his servants, I will now shew you what the
Syrians have done to us. They know that we be hungry; therefore are they
gone out of the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md) to hide themselves in the
field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them
alive, and get into the city.  

<span id="013">13</span> And one of his servants answered and said, Let
some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left
in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) that are left in it: behold, I say, they
are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and
let us send and see.  

<span id="014">14</span> They took therefore two
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008.md) horses; and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) sent after the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.  

<span id="015">15</span> And they went after them unto
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md): and, lo, all the way was full of
garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste.
And the messengers returned, and told the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And the people went out, and spoiled the tents
of the Syrians. So a measure of fine [flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001.md) was
sold for a [shekel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#009.md), and two measures of
[barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003) for a [shekel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#009.md),
according to the word of the LORD.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) appointed
the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md): and the people trode upon him in the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md), and he died, as the man of God had said,
who spake when the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) came down to him.  

<span id="018">18</span> And it came to pass as the man of God had
spoken to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), saying, Two measures of
[barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003) for a [shekel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#009.md),
and a measure of fine [flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001.md) for a
[shekel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#009.md), shall be to morrow about this time in
the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md):  

<span id="019">19</span> And that lord answered the man of God, and
said, Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), might such a thing be? And he said,
Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.  

<span id="020">20</span> And so it fell out unto him: for the people
trode upon him in the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md), and he died.
