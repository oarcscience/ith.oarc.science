### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched
up the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD, and brought it into the
house of [Abinadab](../ebd/ebd004.htm#001.md) in the hill, and sanctified
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000.md) his son to keep the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD.  

<span id="002">2</span> And it came to pass, while the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time was
long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) lamented after the LORD.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) spake unto
all the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), saying, If ye do
return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange
gods and [Ashtaroth](../ebd/ebd034.htm#004.md) from among you, and prepare
your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you
out of the hand of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Then the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) did put away
[Baalim](../ebd/ebd039.htm#007) and [Ashtaroth](../ebd/ebd034.htm#004.md),
and served the LORD only.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) said, Gather
all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you
unto the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew
water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and
said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) judged the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) in Mizpeh.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) heard that the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) were gathered together to Mizpeh, the
lords of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) went up against
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md). And when the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) heard it, they were afraid of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) said to [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md),
Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out
of the hand of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) took a
sucking [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md), and offered it for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) wholly unto the LORD: and
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) cried unto the LORD for
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); and the LORD heard him.  

<span id="010">10</span> And as [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) was
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) up the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) drew near to battle against
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): but the LORD thundered with a great
[thunder](../ebd/ebd365.htm#003.md) on that day upon the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), and discomfited them; and they
were smitten before [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), and smote them, until they came
under Bethcar.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) took a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), and set it between Mizpeh and
[Shen](../ebd/ebd335.htm#001.md), and called the name of it Ebenezer,
saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us.  

<span id="013">13</span> So the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)
were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and the hand of the LORD was against
the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) all the days of
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And the cities which the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) had taken from
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) were restored to
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), from [Ekron](../ebd/ebd114.htm#001.md)
even unto [Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009.md); and the coasts thereof did
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) deliver out of the hands of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md). And there was peace between
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) and the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) judged
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) all the days of his life.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he went from year to year in
[circuit](../ebd/ebd083.htm#006) to [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md), and
[Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md), and Mizpeh, and judged
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) in all those places.  

<span id="017">17</span> And his return was to
[Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005.md); for there was his house; and there he
judged [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); and there he built an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006.md) unto the LORD.
