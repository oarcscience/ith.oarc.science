### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 65

<span id="001">1</span> Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in
[Sion](../ebd/ebd345.htm#003.md): and unto thee shall the vow be
performed.  

<span id="002">2</span> O thou that hearest
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md), unto thee shall all
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) come.  

<span id="003">3</span> Iniquities prevail against me: as for our
transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.  

<span id="004">4</span> Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and
causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall
be satisfied with the [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md) of thy house,
even of thy holy [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> By terrible things in
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) wilt thou answer us, O God of our
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md); who art the confidence of all the
ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:  

<span id="006">6</span> Which by his strength setteth
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) the mountains; being girded with power:  

<span id="007">7</span> Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise
of their waves, and the tumult of the people.  

<span id="008">8</span> They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are
afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and
evening to rejoice.  

<span id="009">9</span> Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou
greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou
preparest them [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md), when thou hast so provided
for it.  

<span id="010">10</span> Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly:
thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers:
thou blessest the springing thereof.  

<span id="011">11</span> Thou crownest the year with thy
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md); and thy paths drop fatness.  

<span id="012">12</span> They drop upon the pastures of the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md): and the little hills rejoice on
every side.  

<span id="013">13</span> The pastures are clothed with flocks; the
valleys also are covered over with [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md); they
shout for joy, they also sing.
