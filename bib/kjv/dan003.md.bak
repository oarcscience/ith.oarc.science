### King James Version: Daniel Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) made an image of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), whose height was threescore cubits, and
the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) of [Dura](../ebd/ebd109.htm#007.md), in the
province of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Then [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) sent to gather together the princes, the
governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the
counsellors, the [sheriffs](../ebd/ebd336.htm#000.md), and all the rulers
of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) had set up.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then the princes, the governors, and captains,
the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the
[sheriffs](../ebd/ebd336.htm#000.md), and all the rulers of the provinces,
were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) had set up; and they stood before the
image that [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) had set up.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is
commanded, O people, nations, and languages,  

<span id="005">5</span> That at what time ye hear the sound of the
[cornet](../ebd/ebd090.htm#009), [flute](../ebd/ebd136.htm#003.md),
[harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001), [sackbut](../ebd/ebd318.htm#000.md),
[psaltery](../ebd/ebd301.htm#006), [dulcimer](../ebd/ebd109.htm#000.md),
and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) the golden image that
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) hath set up:  

<span id="006">6</span> And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall
the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery
[furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore at that time, when all the people
heard the sound of the [cornet](../ebd/ebd090.htm#009.md),
[flute](../ebd/ebd136.htm#003), [harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001.md),
[sackbut](../ebd/ebd318.htm#000), [psaltery](../ebd/ebd301.htm#006.md), and
all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages,
fell down and worshipped the golden image that
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) had set up.  

<span id="008">8</span> Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came
near, and accused the Jews.  

<span id="009">9</span> They spake and said to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md), O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), live for ever.  

<span id="010">10</span> Thou, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), hast
made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the
[cornet](../ebd/ebd090.htm#009), [flute](../ebd/ebd136.htm#003.md),
[harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001), [sackbut](../ebd/ebd318.htm#000.md),
[psaltery](../ebd/ebd301.htm#006.md), and
[dulcimer](../ebd/ebd109.htm#000.md), and all kinds of musick, shall fall
down and [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) the golden image:  

<span id="011">11</span> And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth,
that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery
[furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over
the affairs of the province of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md),
[Shadrach](../ebd/ebd330.htm#003), [Meshach](../ebd/ebd250.htm#007.md), and
[Abednego](../ebd/ebd001.htm#003.md); these men, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), have not regarded thee: they serve not
thy gods, nor [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) the golden image which
thou hast set up.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) in
his rage and [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md) commanded to bring
[Shadrach](../ebd/ebd330.htm#003), [Meshach](../ebd/ebd250.htm#007.md), and
[Abednego](../ebd/ebd001.htm#003.md). Then they brought these men before
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) spake
and said unto them, Is it true, O [Shadrach](../ebd/ebd330.htm#003.md),
[Meshach](../ebd/ebd250.htm#007), and [Abednego](../ebd/ebd001.htm#003.md),
do not ye serve my gods, nor [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) the golden
image which I have set up?  

<span id="015">15</span> Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear
the sound of the [cornet](../ebd/ebd090.htm#009.md),
[flute](../ebd/ebd136.htm#003), [harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001.md),
[sackbut](../ebd/ebd318.htm#000), [psaltery](../ebd/ebd301.htm#006.md), and
[dulcimer](../ebd/ebd109.htm#000.md), and all kinds of musick, ye fall down
and [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) the image which I have made; well:
but if ye [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) not, ye shall be cast the
same hour into the midst of a burning fiery
[furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000.md); and who is that God that shall deliver
you out of my hands?  

<span id="016">16</span> [Shadrach](../ebd/ebd330.htm#003.md),
[Meshach](../ebd/ebd250.htm#007), and [Abednego](../ebd/ebd001.htm#003.md),
answered and said to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), O
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md), we are not careful to answer
thee in this matter.  

<span id="017">17</span> If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to
deliver us from the burning fiery [furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000.md), and
he will deliver us out of thine hand, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> But if not, be it known unto thee, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), that we will not serve thy gods, nor
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) the golden image which thou hast set
up.  

<span id="019">19</span> Then was
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) full of
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md), and the form of his visage was changed
against [Shadrach](../ebd/ebd330.htm#003.md),
[Meshach](../ebd/ebd250.htm#007), and [Abednego](../ebd/ebd001.htm#003.md):
therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the
[furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000) one [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
times more than it was wont to be heated.  

<span id="020">20</span> And he commanded the most mighty men that were
in his army to bind [Shadrach](../ebd/ebd330.htm#003.md),
[Meshach](../ebd/ebd250.htm#007), and [Abednego](../ebd/ebd001.htm#003.md),
and to cast them into the burning fiery
[furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> Then these men were bound in their coats, their
hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the
midst of the burning fiery [furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> Therefore because the king's commandment was
urgent, and the [furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000.md) exceeding hot, the
flames of the fire slew those men that took up
[Shadrach](../ebd/ebd330.htm#003), [Meshach](../ebd/ebd250.htm#007.md), and
[Abednego](../ebd/ebd001.htm#003.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And these three men,
[Shadrach](../ebd/ebd330.htm#003), [Meshach](../ebd/ebd250.htm#007.md), and
[Abednego](../ebd/ebd001.htm#003.md), fell down bound into the midst of the
burning fiery [furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> Then [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md)
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) was astonied, and rose up in haste,
and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men
bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), True, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose,
walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of
the fourth is like the Son of God.  

<span id="026">26</span> Then [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md)
came near to the mouth of the burning fiery
[furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000.md), and spake, and said,
[Shadrach](../ebd/ebd330.htm#003), [Meshach](../ebd/ebd250.htm#007.md), and
[Abednego](../ebd/ebd001.htm#003.md), ye servants of the most high God,
come forth, and come hither. Then [Shadrach](../ebd/ebd330.htm#003.md),
[Meshach](../ebd/ebd250.htm#007), and [Abednego](../ebd/ebd001.htm#003.md),
came forth of the midst of the fire.  

<span id="027">27</span> And the princes, governors, and captains, and
the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon
whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head
singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had
passed on them.  

<span id="028">28</span> Then [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md)
spake, and said, Blessed be the God of
[Shadrach](../ebd/ebd330.htm#003), [Meshach](../ebd/ebd250.htm#007.md), and
[Abednego](../ebd/ebd001.htm#003.md), who hath sent his
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md), and delivered his servants that trusted
in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that
they might not serve nor [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) any god,
except their own God.  

<span id="029">29</span> Therefore I make a decree, That every people,
nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of
[Shadrach](../ebd/ebd330.htm#003), [Meshach](../ebd/ebd250.htm#007.md), and
[Abednego](../ebd/ebd001.htm#003.md), shall be cut in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md), and their houses shall be made a
dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this
sort.  

<span id="030">30</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) promoted
[Shadrach](../ebd/ebd330.htm#003), [Meshach](../ebd/ebd250.htm#007.md), and
[Abednego](../ebd/ebd001.htm#003.md), in the province of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md).
