### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> And it was told [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md),
Behold, the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) weepeth and mourneth for
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the victory that day was turned into
mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) was grieved for his son.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the people gat them by stealth that day into
the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.  

<span id="004">4</span> But the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) covered
his face, and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) cried with a loud voice,
O my son [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md), O
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md), my son, my son!  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md) came into the
house to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and said, Thou hast shamed
this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy
life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of
thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;  

<span id="006">6</span> In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest
thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest
neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md) had lived, and all we had died this
day, then it had pleased thee well.  

<span id="007">7</span> Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak
comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not
forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be
worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until
now.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) arose,
and sat in the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md). And they told unto all the
people, saying, Behold, the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) doth sit in
the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md). And all the people came before the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001): for [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) had
fled every man to his [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And all the people were at strife throughout all
the tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), saying, The
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) saved us out of the hand of our enemies,
and he delivered us out of the hand of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md); and now he is fled out of the land
for [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008.md), whom we
anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a
word of bringing the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) back?  

<span id="011">11</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) sent to [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008.md)
and to [Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005.md) the priests, saying, Speak unto
the elders of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), saying, Why are ye the
last to bring the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) back to his house?
seeing the speech of all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) is come to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), even to his house.  

<span id="012">12</span> Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md): wherefore then are ye the last to bring
back the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)?  

<span id="013">13</span> And say ye to [Amasa](../ebd/ebd019.htm#003.md),
Art thou not of my bone, and of my [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md)? God
do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) before me continually in the room of
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And he bowed the heart of all the men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), even as the heart of one man; so that
they sent this word unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), Return thou,
and all thy servants.  

<span id="015">15</span> So the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) returned,
and came to [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md). And
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) came to [Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md),
to go to meet the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), to conduct the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002.md) the son of
[Gera](../ebd/ebd146.htm#003.md), a Benjamite, which was of
[Bahurim](../ebd/ebd041.htm#009.md), hasted and came down with the men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) to meet [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And there were a thousand men of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md) with him, and
[Ziba](../ebd/ebd392.htm#003.md) the servant of the house of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), and his fifteen sons and his twenty
servants with him; and they went over [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md)
before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And there went over a ferry boat to carry over
the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And
[Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002) the son of [Gera](../ebd/ebd146.htm#003.md)
fell down before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), as he was come over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md);  

<span id="019">19</span> And said unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me,
neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day
that my lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) went out of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), that the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) should take it to his heart.  

<span id="020">20</span> For thy servant doth know that I have sinned:
therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) to go down to meet my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> But [Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005.md) the son of
[Zeruiah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#009.md) answered and said, Shall not
[Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002.md) be put to death for this, because he
cursed the LORD's anointed?  

<span id="022">22</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said, What
have I to do with you, ye sons of [Zeruiah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#009.md), that
ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to
death this day in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)? for do not I know
that I am this day [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="023">23</span> Therefore the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
said unto [Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002.md), Thou shalt not die. And the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) sware unto him.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Mephibosheth](../ebd/ebd248.htm#006.md) the
son of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) came down to meet the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and had neither dressed his feet, nor
trimmed his [beard](../ebd/ebd049.htm#000.md), nor washed his clothes, from
the day the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) departed until the day he came
again in peace.  

<span id="025">25</span> And it came to pass, when he was come to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) to meet the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), that the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me,
[Mephibosheth](../ebd/ebd248.htm#006.md)?  

<span id="026">26</span> And he answered, My lord, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), my servant deceived me: for thy servant
said, I will saddle me an [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md), that I may ride
thereon, and go to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md); because thy
servant is lame.  

<span id="027">27</span> And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md); but my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) is as an [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of
God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.  

<span id="028">28</span> For all of my father's house were but dead men
before my lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md): yet didst thou set thy
servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore
have I yet to cry any more unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)?  

<span id="029">29</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said unto
him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and
[Ziba](../ebd/ebd392.htm#003.md) divide the land.  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Mephibosheth](../ebd/ebd248.htm#006.md) said
unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), Yea, let him take all, forasmuch
as my lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) is come again in peace unto
his own house.  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Barzillai](../ebd/ebd046.htm#002.md) the
Gileadite came down from [Rogelim](../ebd/ebd315.htm#003.md), and went over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) with the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md),
to conduct him over [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> Now [Barzillai](../ebd/ebd046.htm#002.md) was a
very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of sustenance while he lay at
[Mahanaim](../ebd/ebd237.htm#005.md); for he was a very great man.  

<span id="033">33</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) said unto
[Barzillai](../ebd/ebd046.htm#002.md), Come thou over with me, and I will
feed thee with me in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="034">34</span> And [Barzillai](../ebd/ebd046.htm#002.md) said
unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), How long have I to live, that I
should go up with the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) unto
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md)?  

<span id="035">35</span> I am this day fourscore years old: and can I
discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what
I [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md)? can I hear any more the voice of
singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet
a [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007.md) unto my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)?  

<span id="036">36</span> Thy servant will go a little way over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) with the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md):
and why should the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) recompense it me with
such a reward?  

<span id="037">37</span> Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again,
that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md) of my father and of my mother. But behold
thy servant [Chimham](../ebd/ebd080.htm#009.md); let him go over with my
lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md); and do to him what shall seem
good unto thee.  

<span id="038">38</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) answered,
[Chimham](../ebd/ebd080.htm#009.md) shall go over with me, and I will do to
him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt
require of me, that will I do for thee.  

<span id="039">39</span> And all the people went over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md). And when the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) was come over, the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) kissed [Barzillai](../ebd/ebd046.htm#002.md),
and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.  

<span id="040">40</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) went on
to [Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001), and [Chimham](../ebd/ebd080.htm#009.md)
went on with him: and all the people of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)
conducted the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and also half the people of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="041">41</span> And, behold, all the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) came to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and said unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), Why have our brethren the men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) stolen thee away, and have brought the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and his household, and all David's men
with him, over [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md)?  

<span id="042">42</span> And all the men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) answered the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), Because the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye
angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath
he given us any [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005.md)?  

<span id="043">43</span> And the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
answered the men of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and said, We have
ten parts in the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and we have also more
right in [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) than ye: why then did ye despise
us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)? And the words of the men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) were fiercer than the words of the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).
