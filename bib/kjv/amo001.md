### King James Version: Amos Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> The words of [Amos](../ebd/ebd021.htm#007), who
was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in the days of
[Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and in the days of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) the son of
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), two years before the
[earthquake](../ebd/ebd110.htm#009).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he said, The LORD will roar from
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), and utter his voice from
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005); and the habitations of the shepherds
shall [mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004), and the top of
[Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006) shall wither.  

<span id="003">3</span> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007), and for four, I will not turn away
the [punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005) thereof; because they have
threshed [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009) with
[threshing](../ebd/ebd364.htm#009) instruments of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004):  

<span id="004">4</span> But I will send a fire into the house of
[Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003), which shall devour the palaces of
Benhadad.  

<span id="005">5</span> I will break also the bar of
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007), and cut off the inhabitant from the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) of [Aven](../ebd/ebd036.htm#009), and him
that holdeth the [sceptre](../ebd/ebd323.htm#006) from the house of
[Eden](../ebd/ebd112.htm#009): and the people of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002) shall go into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) unto [Kir](../ebd/ebd219.htm#007),
saith the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of
[Gaza](../ebd/ebd144.htm#003), and for four, I will not turn away the
[punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005) thereof; because they carried away
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) the whole
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002), to deliver them up to
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001):  

<span id="007">7</span> But I will send a fire on the wall of
[Gaza](../ebd/ebd144.htm#003), which shall devour the palaces thereof:  

<span id="008">8</span> And I will cut off the inhabitant from
[Ashdod](../ebd/ebd033.htm#006), and him that holdeth the
[sceptre](../ebd/ebd323.htm#006) from [Ashkelon](../ebd/ebd034.htm#001),
and I will turn mine hand against [Ekron](../ebd/ebd114.htm#001): and
the remnant of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) shall perish,
saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="009">9</span> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of
Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away the
[punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005) thereof; because they delivered up
the whole [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) to
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001), and remembered not the brotherly
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008):  

<span id="010">10</span> But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus,
which shall devour the palaces thereof.  

<span id="011">11</span> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions
of [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001), and for four, I will not turn away the
[punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005) thereof; because he did pursue his
brother with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and did cast off all
pity, and his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) did tear perpetually, and
he kept his wrath for ever:  

<span id="012">12</span> But I will send a fire upon
[Teman](../ebd/ebd361.htm#001), which shall devour the palaces of
[Bozrah](../ebd/ebd063.htm#009).  

<span id="013">13</span> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions
of the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002), and for four, I will
not turn away the [punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005) thereof; because
they have ripped up the women with child of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009), that they might enlarge their border:  

<span id="014">14</span> But I will kindle a fire in the wall of
[Rabbah](../ebd/ebd304.htm#005), and it shall devour the palaces
thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day
of the whirlwind:  

<span id="015">15</span> And their [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) shall
go into [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002), he and his princes together,
saith the LORD.
