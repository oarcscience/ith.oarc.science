### King James Version: Acts Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> But a certain man named
[Ananias](../ebd/ebd023.htm#001), with [Sapphira](../ebd/ebd322.htm#001.md)
his wife, sold a possession,  

<span id="002">2</span> And kept back part of the price, his wife also
being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the
apostles' feet.  

<span id="003">3</span> But [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) said,
[Ananias](../ebd/ebd023.htm#001.md), why hath
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md) filled thine heart to lie to the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md), and to keep back part of the price of
the land?  

<span id="004">4</span> Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and
after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou
conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but
unto God.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Ananias](../ebd/ebd023.htm#001.md) hearing
these words fell down, and gave up the [ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md):
and great fear came on all them that heard these things.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the young men arose, wound him up, and
carried him out, and buried him.  

<span id="007">7</span> And it was about the space of three hours after,
when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) answered unto
her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea,
for so much.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) said unto
her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the Lord? behold, the feet of them
which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee
out.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and
yielded up the [ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md): and the young men came
in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her
husband.  

<span id="011">11</span> And great fear came upon all the church, and
upon as many as heard these things.  

<span id="012">12</span> And by the hands of the apostles were many
signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one
accord in Solomon's porch.  

<span id="013">13</span> And of the rest durst no man join himself to
them: but the people magnified them.  

<span id="014">14</span> And believers were the more added to the Lord,
multitudes both of men and women.)  

<span id="015">15</span> Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into
the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) of [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md)
passing by might overshadow some of them.  

<span id="016">16</span> There came also a multitude out of the cities
round about unto [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), bringing sick
folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were
healed every one.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the
[sect](../ebd/ebd325.htm#008.md) of the
[Sadducees](../ebd/ebd318.htm#003),.md) and were filled with indignation,  

<span id="018">18</span> And laid their hands on the apostles, and put
them in the common [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> But the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
Lord by night opened the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md)
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md), and brought them forth, and said,  

<span id="020">20</span> Go, stand and speak in the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) to the people all the words of this
life.  

<span id="021">21</span> And when they heard that, they entered into the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) early in the morning, and taught. But
the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) came, and they that were with
him, and called the [council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004.md) together, and all
the [senate](../ebd/ebd327.htm#002.md) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and sent to the
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md) to have them brought.  

<span id="022">22</span> But when the officers came, and found them not
in the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md), they returned and told,  

<span id="023">23</span> Saying, The [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md)
truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without
before the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md): but when we had opened, we
found no man within.  

<span id="024">24</span> Now when the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) and the captain of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) and the chief priests heard these
things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.  

<span id="025">25</span> Then came one and told them, saying, Behold,
the men whom ye put in [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md) are standing in
the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), and teaching the people.  

<span id="026">26</span> Then went the captain with the officers, and
brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they
should have been stoned.  

<span id="027">27</span> And when they had brought them, they set them
before the [council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004.md): and the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) asked them,  

<span id="028">28</span> Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye
should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) with your doctrine, and intend to
bring this man's [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) upon us.  

<span id="029">29</span> Then [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) and the
other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than
men.  

<span id="030">30</span> The God of our fathers raised up
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.  

<span id="031">31</span> Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be
a [Prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) and a
[Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003.md), for to give
[repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008) to [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
and forgiveness of sins.  

<span id="032">32</span> And we are his witnesses of these things; and
so is also the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md), whom God hath given
to them that obey him.  

<span id="033">33</span> When they heard that, they were cut to the
heart, and took counsel to slay them.  

<span id="034">34</span> Then stood there up one in the
[council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004.md), a Pharisee, named
[Gamaliel](../ebd/ebd142.htm#006.md), a doctor of the law, had in
reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth
a little space;  

<span id="035">35</span> And said unto them, Ye men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), take heed to yourselves what ye intend
to do as touching these men.  

<span id="036">36</span> For before these days rose up
[Theudas](../ebd/ebd364.htm#001.md), boasting himself to be somebody; to
whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was
slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to
nought.  

<span id="037">37</span> After this man rose up
[Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001) of [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md) in
the days of the [taxing](../ebd/ebd359.htm#009.md), and drew away much
people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him,
were dispersed.  

<span id="038">38</span> And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men,
and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will
come to nought:  

<span id="039">39</span> But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it;
lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.  

<span id="040">40</span> And to him they agreed: and when they had
called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should
not speak in the name of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), and let them
go.  

<span id="041">41</span> And they departed from the presence of the
[council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004.md), rejoicing that they were counted
worthy to suffer shame for his name.  

<span id="042">42</span> And daily in the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), and in every house, they ceased not to
teach and preach [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).
