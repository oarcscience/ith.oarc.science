### King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> Dead flies cause the
[ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007.md) of the
[apothecary](../ebd/ebd026.htm#009.md) to send forth a stinking savour: so
doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour.  

<span id="002">2</span> A [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) man's heart is
at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.  

<span id="003">3</span> Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the
way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a
fool.  

<span id="004">4</span> If the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the
ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth
great offences.  

<span id="005">5</span> There is an evil which I have seen under the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md), as an error which proceedeth from the
ruler:  

<span id="006">6</span> Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit
in low place.  

<span id="007">7</span> I have seen servants upon horses, and princes
walking as servants upon the earth.  

<span id="008">8</span> He that diggeth a [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md)
shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009.md) shall bite him.  

<span id="009">9</span> Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith;
and he that cleaveth [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) shall be endangered
thereby.  

<span id="010">10</span> If the [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md) be blunt,
and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but
wisdom is profitable to direct.  

<span id="011">11</span> Surely the [serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009.md)
will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.  

<span id="012">12</span> The words of a [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md)
man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will
[swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009.md) up himself.  

<span id="013">13</span> The beginning of the words of his mouth is
foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous
[madness](../ebd/ebd236.htm#002.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell
what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?  

<span id="015">15</span> The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of
them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.  

<span id="016">16</span> Woe to thee, O land, when thy
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) is a child, and thy princes eat in the
morning!  

<span id="017">17</span> Blessed art thou, O land, when thy
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat
in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!  

<span id="018">18</span> By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and
through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.  

<span id="019">19</span> A [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) is made for
laughter, and [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) maketh merry: but money
answereth all things.  

<span id="020">20</span> [Curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) not the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), no not in thy thought; and
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a
[bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000.md) of the air shall carry the voice, and that
which hath wings shall tell the matter.
