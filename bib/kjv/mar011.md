### King James Version: Mark Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> And when they came nigh to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), unto Bethphage and
[Bethany](../ebd/ebd054.htm#007), at the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,  

<span id="002">2</span> And saith unto them, Go your way into the
village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall
find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.  

<span id="003">3</span> And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say
ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him
hither.  

<span id="004">4</span> And they went their way, and found the colt tied
by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.  

<span id="005">5</span> And certain of them that stood there said unto
them, What do ye, loosing the colt?  

<span id="006">6</span> And they said unto them even as
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) had commanded: and they let them go.  

<span id="007">7</span> And they brought the colt to
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), and cast their garments on him; and he
sat upon him.  

<span id="008">8</span> And many spread their garments in the way: and
others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.  

<span id="009">9</span> And they that went before, and they that
followed, cried, saying, [Hosanna](../ebd/ebd183.htm#001); Blessed is he
that cometh in the name of the Lord:  

<span id="010">10</span> Blessed be the kingdom of our father
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), that cometh in the name of the Lord:
[Hosanna](../ebd/ebd183.htm#001) in the highest.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) entered into
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and into the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004): and when he had looked round about upon
all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto
[Bethany](../ebd/ebd054.htm#007) with the twelve.  

<span id="012">12</span> And on the morrow, when they were come from
[Bethany](../ebd/ebd054.htm#007), he was hungry:  

<span id="013">13</span> And seeing a [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001) tree
afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing
thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the
time of figs was not yet.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered and
said unto it, No man eat [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of thee
hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.  

<span id="015">15</span> And they come to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): and [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
went into the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), and began to cast out
them that sold and bought in the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), and
overthrew the [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) of the moneychangers, and
the seats of them that sold doves;  

<span id="016">16</span> And would not suffer that any man should carry
any vessel through the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004).  

<span id="017">17</span> And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not
written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000)? but ye have made it a
[den](../ebd/ebd101.htm#007) of thieves.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) and
chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they
feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.  

<span id="019">19</span> And when even was come, he went out of the
city.  

<span id="020">20</span> And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw
the [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001) tree dried up from the roots.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002)
[calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007) to remembrance saith unto him, Master,
behold, the [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001) tree which thou cursedst is
withered away.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answering
saith unto them, Have faith in God.  

<span id="023">23</span> For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall
say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea;
and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things
which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.  

<span id="024">24</span> Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye
desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have
them.  

<span id="025">25</span> And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have
ought against any: that your Father also which is in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) may forgive you your trespasses.  

<span id="026">26</span> But if ye do not forgive, neither will your
Father which is in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) forgive your
trespasses.  

<span id="027">27</span> And they come again to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): and as he was walking in the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), there come to him the chief priests,
and the [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003), and the elders,  

<span id="028">28</span> And say unto him, By what authority doest thou
these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered and
said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and
I will tell you by what authority I do these things.  

<span id="030">30</span> The baptism of John, was it from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), or of men? answer me.  

<span id="031">31</span> And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If
we shall say, From [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006); he will say, Why
then did ye not believe him?  

<span id="032">32</span> But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the
people: for all men counted John, that he was a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) indeed.  

<span id="033">33</span> And they answered and said unto
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), We cannot tell. And
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answering saith unto them, Neither do I
tell you by what authority I do these things.
