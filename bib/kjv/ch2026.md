### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 26

<span id="001">1</span> Then all the people of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) took [Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004), who
was sixteen years old, and made him [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) in the
room of his father [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007).  

<span id="002">2</span> He built Eloth, and restored it to
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), after that the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) slept with his fathers.  

<span id="003">3</span> Sixteen years old was
[Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004) when he began to reign, and he reigned
fifty and two years in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005). His mother's
name also was [Jecoliah](../ebd/ebd199.htm#005) of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="004">4</span> And he did that which was right in the sight of
the LORD, according to all that his father
[Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007) did.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he sought God in the days of
[Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006), who had understanding in the visions
of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he went forth and warred against the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), and brake down the wall of
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009), and the wall of
[Jabneh](../ebd/ebd194.htm#002), and the wall of
[Ashdod](../ebd/ebd033.htm#006), and built cities about
[Ashdod](../ebd/ebd033.htm#006), and among the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002).  

<span id="007">7</span> And God helped him against the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), and against the Arabians that
dwelt in Gurbaal, and the [Mehunims](../ebd/ebd246.htm#009).  

<span id="008">8</span> And the Ammonites gave gifts to
[Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004): and his name spread abroad even to the
entering in of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009); for he strengthened
himself exceedingly.  

<span id="009">9</span> Moreover [Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004) built
[towers](../ebd/ebd371.htm#002) in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) at
the corner [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), and at the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), and at
the turning of the wall, and fortified them.  

<span id="010">10</span> Also he built [towers](../ebd/ebd371.htm#002)
in the [desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000), and digged many wells: for he
had much [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002), both in the low country, and
in the plains: husbandmen also, and [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004)
dressers in the mountains, and in [Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006): for
he loved husbandry.  

<span id="011">11</span> Moreover [Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004) had an
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of fighting men, that went out to war by
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003), according to the number of their account
by the hand of [Jeiel](../ebd/ebd203.htm#000) the scribe and
[Maaseiah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#007) the ruler, under the hand of
[Hananiah](../ebd/ebd162.htm#004), one of the king's captains.  

<span id="012">12</span> The whole number of the chief of the fathers of
the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred.  

<span id="013">13</span> And under their hand was an army, three hundred
thousand and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) thousand and five hundred,
that made war with mighty power, to help the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) against the enemy.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004) prepared
for them throughout all the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) shields, and
spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast
stones.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he made in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) [engines](../ebd/ebd121.htm#000),
invented by cunning men, to be on the [towers](../ebd/ebd371.htm#002)
and upon the [bulwarks](../ebd/ebd066.htm#005), to shoot
[arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005) and great stones withal. And his name
spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.  

<span id="016">16</span> But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up
to his [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004): for he transgressed against
the LORD his God, and went into the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of
the LORD to burn [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002).  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) went in after him, and with him
fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:  

<span id="018">18</span> And they withstood
[Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and
said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee,
[Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004), to burn
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) unto the LORD, but to the priests the
sons of [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), that are consecrated to burn
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002): go out of the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005); for thou hast trespassed; neither
shall it be for thine honour from the LORD God.  

<span id="019">19</span> Then [Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004) was wroth,
and had a [censer](../ebd/ebd075.htm#002) in his hand to burn
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002): and while he was wroth with the
priests, the [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003) even rose up in his
[forehead](../ebd/ebd137.htm#002) before the priests in the house of the
LORD, from beside the [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002)
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006).  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005) the chief
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and all the priests, looked upon him,
and, behold, he was leprous in his [forehead](../ebd/ebd137.htm#002),
and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out,
because the LORD had smitten him.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) was a leper unto the day of his death, and
dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the
house of the LORD: and [Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000) his son was over
the king's house, judging the people of the land.  

<span id="022">22</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004), first and last, did
[Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008),
the son of [Amoz](../ebd/ebd021.htm#008), write.  

<span id="023">23</span> So [Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004) slept with
his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the
[burial](../ebd/ebd066.htm#008) which belonged to the kings; for they
said, He is a leper: and [Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000) his son reigned
in his stead.
