### King James Version: Esther Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> After these things, when the wrath of
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md) was
appeased, he remembered [Vashti](../ebd/ebd376.htm#009.md), and what she
had done, and what was decreed against her.  

<span id="002">2</span> Then said the king's servants that ministered
unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md):  

<span id="003">3</span> And let the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may
gather together all the fair young virgins unto
[Shushan](../ebd/ebd342.htm#003) the [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md), to
the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's
[chamberlain](../ebd/ebd076.htm#005.md), keeper of the women; and let their
things for [purification](../ebd/ebd302.htm#007.md) be given them:  

<span id="004">4</span> And let the maiden which pleaseth the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) be [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md) instead
of [Vashti](../ebd/ebd376.htm#009.md). And the thing pleased the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md); and he did so.  

<span id="005">5</span> Now in [Shushan](../ebd/ebd342.htm#003.md) the
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md) there was a certain
[Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004.md), whose name was
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md), the son of
[Jair](../ebd/ebd196.htm#001.md), the son of
[Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002.md), the son of
[Kish](../ebd/ebd220.htm#007.md), a Benjamite;  

<span id="006">6</span> Who had been carried away from
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) with the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md) which had been carried away with
Jeconiah [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), whom
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001.md) had
carried away.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he brought up
[Hadassah](../ebd/ebd157.htm#006.md), that is,
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md), his uncle's daughter: for she had
neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md), when her father and mother were dead,
took for his own daughter.  

<span id="008">8</span> So it came to pass, when the king's commandment
and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together
unto [Shushan](../ebd/ebd342.htm#003.md) the
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008.md), to the custody of
[Hegai](../ebd/ebd171.htm#005), that [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md) was
brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of
[Hegai](../ebd/ebd171.htm#005.md), keeper of the women.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained
kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for
[purification](../ebd/ebd302.htm#007.md), with such things as belonged to
her, and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) maidens, which were meet to be
given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids
unto the best place of the house of the women.  

<span id="010">10</span> [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md) had not shewed
her people nor her kindred: for [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md) had
charged her that she should not shew it.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md) walked
every day before the court of the women's house, to know how
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md) did, and what should become of her.  

<span id="012">12</span> Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md), after
that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women,
(for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six
months with oil of [myrrh](../ebd/ebd263.htm#003.md), and six months with
sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)  

<span id="013">13</span> Then thus came every maiden unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md); whatsoever she desired was given her to
go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.  

<span id="014">14</span> In the evening she went, and on the morrow she
returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of
[Shaashgaz](../ebd/ebd329.htm#009.md), the king's
[chamberlain](../ebd/ebd076.htm#005.md), which kept the concubines: she
came in unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) no more, except the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) delighted in her, and that she were called
by name.  

<span id="015">15</span> Now when the turn of
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md), the daughter of
[Abihail](../ebd/ebd003.htm#003.md) the uncle of
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md), who had taken her for his daughter,
was come to go in unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), she required
nothing but what [Hegai](../ebd/ebd171.htm#005.md) the king's
[chamberlain](../ebd/ebd076.htm#005.md), the keeper of the women,
appointed. And [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md) obtained favour in the
sight of all them that looked upon her.  

<span id="016">16</span> So [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md) was taken
unto [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md)
into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month
[Tebeth](../ebd/ebd360.htm#000.md), in the seventh year of his reign.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) loved
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md) above all the women, and she obtained
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) and favour in his sight more than all the
virgins; so that he set the royal [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) upon
her head, and made her [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md) instead of
[Vashti](../ebd/ebd376.htm#009.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) made a
great [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) unto all his princes and his
servants, even Esther's [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md); and he made a
release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And when the virgins were gathered together the
second time, then [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md) sat in the king's
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md) had not yet
shewed her kindred nor her people; as [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md)
had charged her: for [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md) did the commandment
of [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md), like as when she was brought up
with him.  

<span id="021">21</span> In those days, while
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md) sat in the king's
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md), two of the king's chamberlains,
[Bigthan](../ebd/ebd058.htm#005) and [Teresh](../ebd/ebd362.htm#004.md), of
those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And the thing was known to
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005.md), who told it unto
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md); and
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006.md) certified the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) thereof in Mordecai's name.  

<span id="023">23</span> And when inquisition was made of the matter, it
was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was
written in the book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003.md) before
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).
