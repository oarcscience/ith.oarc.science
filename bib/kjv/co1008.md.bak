### King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> Now as touching things offered unto idols, we
know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but
[charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009.md) edifieth.  

<span id="002">2</span> And if any man think that he knoweth any thing,
he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.  

<span id="003">3</span> But if any man love God, the same is known of
him.  

<span id="004">4</span> As concerning therefore the
[eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006.md) of those things that are offered in
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) unto idols, we know that an
[idol](../ebd/ebd186.htm#006.md) is nothing in the world, and that there is
none other God but one.  

<span id="005">5</span> For though there be that are called gods,
whether in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) or in earth, (as there be
gods many, and lords many,)  

<span id="006">6</span> But to us there is but one God, the Father, of
whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), by whom
are all things, and we by him.  

<span id="007">7</span> Howbeit there is not in every man that
knowledge: for some with [conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006.md) of the
[idol](../ebd/ebd186.htm#006.md) unto this hour eat it as a thing offered
unto an [idol](../ebd/ebd186.htm#006.md); and their
[conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006.md) being weak is defiled.  

<span id="008">8</span> But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither,
if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the
worse.  

<span id="009">9</span> But take heed lest by any means this liberty of
your's become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.  

<span id="010">10</span> For if any man see thee which hast knowledge
sit at meat in the idol's [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), shall not the
[conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006.md) of him which is weak be emboldened
to eat those things which are offered to idols;  

<span id="011">11</span> And through thy knowledge shall the weak
brother perish, for whom [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) died?  

<span id="012">12</span> But when ye [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) so
against the brethren, and wound their weak
[conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006), ye [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
against [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I
will eat no [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) while the world standeth,
lest I make my brother to offend.
