<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 3</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> of Judaea,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> is at hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For this is he that was spoken of by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</A>, saying, The voice of one crying in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</A> about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then went out to him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and all Judaea, and all the region round about <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And were baptized of him in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>, confessing their sins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But when he saw many of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</A> come to his baptism, he said unto them, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A> of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Bring forth therefore fruits meet for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And think not to say within yourselves, We have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And now also the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd037.htm#003">axe</A> is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> is hewn down, and cast into the fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;I indeed baptize you with water unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</A>. but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>, and with fire:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Whose <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#001">fan</A> is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</A> into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#005">garner</A>; but he will burn up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#007">chaff</A> with unquenchable fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then cometh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A> unto John, to be baptized of him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>. Then he suffered him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of God descending like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd106.htm#007">dove</A>, and lighting upon him:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And lo a voice from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.<BR>
