### King James Version: Job Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> Then answered [Zophar](../ebd/ebd396.htm#000.md)
the [Naamathite](../ebd/ebd264.htm#000.md), and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and
for this I make haste.  

<span id="003">3</span> I have heard the check of my reproach, and the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of my understanding causeth me to
answer.  

<span id="004">4</span> Knowest thou not this of old, since man was
placed upon earth,  

<span id="005">5</span> That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and
the joy of the [hypocrite](../ebd/ebd185.htm#006.md) but for a moment?  

<span id="006">6</span> Though his excellency
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) up to the heavens, and his head reach
unto the clouds;  

<span id="007">7</span> Yet he shall perish for ever like his own
[dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003.md): they which have seen him shall say, Where
is he?  

<span id="008">8</span> He shall [fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004.md) away as a
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md), and shall not be found: yea, he shall be
chased away as a [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md) of the night.  

<span id="009">9</span> The eye also which saw him shall see him no
more; neither shall his place any more behold him.  

<span id="010">10</span> His children shall seek to please the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), and his hands shall restore their
goods.  

<span id="011">11</span> His bones are full of the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) of his youth, which shall lie down with him
in the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though
he hide it under his tongue;  

<span id="013">13</span> Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but
keep it still within his mouth:  

<span id="014">14</span> Yet his meat in his
[bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004.md) is turned, it is the
[gall](../ebd/ebd142.htm#000.md) of asps within him.  

<span id="015">15</span> He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall
vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> He shall suck the
[poison](../ebd/ebd297.htm#009.md) of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay
him.  

<span id="017">17</span> He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the
brooks of [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001.md) and
[butter](../ebd/ebd067.htm#002.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> That which he laboured for shall he restore,
and shall not [swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009.md) it down: according to his
substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.  

<span id="019">19</span> Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md); because he hath violently taken away an
house which he builded not;  

<span id="020">20</span> Surely he shall not feel quietness in his
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000.md), he shall not save of that which he
desired.  

<span id="021">21</span> There shall none of his meat be left; therefore
shall no man look for his goods.  

<span id="022">22</span> In the [fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007.md) of his
sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come
upon him.  

<span id="023">23</span> When he is about to fill his
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000.md), God shall cast the
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002.md) of his wrath upon him, and shall
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) it upon him while he is
[eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> He shall flee from the
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md) weapon, and the
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) of [steel](../ebd/ebd351.htm#000.md) shall
strike him through.  

<span id="025">25</span> It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea,
the glittering [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) cometh out of his
[gall](../ebd/ebd142.htm#000.md): terrors are upon him.  

<span id="026">26</span> All [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) shall be
hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall
go ill with him that is left in his
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> The [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) shall
reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.  

<span id="028">28</span> The increase of his house shall depart, and his
goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.  

<span id="029">29</span> This is the portion of a wicked man from God,
and the heritage appointed unto him by God.
