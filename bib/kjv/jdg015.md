### King James Version: Judges Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> But it came to pass within a while after, in the
time of [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000) [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md),
that [Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000.md) visited his wife with a kid; and he
said, I will go in to my wife into the [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md).
But her father would not suffer him to go in.  

<span id="002">2</span> And her father said, I verily thought that thou
hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not
her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of
her.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000.md) said
concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), though I do them a displeasure.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000.md) went and
caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to
tail, and put a [firebrand](../ebd/ebd133.htm#007.md) in the midst between
two tails.  

<span id="005">5</span> And when he had set the brands on fire, he let
them go into the standing [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md) of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), and burnt up both the shocks, and
also the standing [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md), with the vineyards and
olives.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)
said, Who hath done this? And they answered,
[Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000.md), the son in law of the
[Timnite](../ebd/ebd366.htm#009.md), because he had taken his wife, and
given her to his companion. And the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)
came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000.md) said unto
them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after
that I will cease.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he smote them hip and thigh with a great
slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) [Etam](../ebd/ebd125.htm#008.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> Then the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)
went up, and pitched in [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and spread
themselves in [Lehi](../ebd/ebd226.htm#009.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And the men of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)
said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind
[Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000.md) are we come up, to do to him as he hath
done to us.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then three thousand men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) went to the top of the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) [Etam](../ebd/ebd125.htm#008.md), and said to
[Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000.md), Knowest thou not that the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) are rulers over us? what is this
that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me,
so have I done unto them.  

<span id="012">12</span> And they said unto him, We are come down to
bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md). And
[Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000.md) said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye
will not fall upon me yourselves.  

<span id="013">13</span> And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we
will bind thee [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md), and deliver thee into
their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with
two new cords, and brought him up from the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And when he came unto
[Lehi](../ebd/ebd226.htm#009), the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)
shouted against him: and the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) of the LORD
came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as
[flax](../ebd/ebd135.htm#004.md) that was burnt with fire, and his
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003.md) loosed from off his hands.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he found a new jawbone of an
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md), and put forth his hand, and took it, and
slew a thousand men therewith.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000.md) said, With
the jawbone of an [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md), heaps upon heaps, with
the jaw of an [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md) have I slain a thousand
men.  

<span id="017">17</span> And it came to pass, when he had made an end of
speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that
place Ramathlehi.  

<span id="018">18</span> And he was sore athirst, and called on the
LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of
thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of
the uncircumcised?  

<span id="019">19</span> But God clave an hollow place that was in the
jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had
[drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007), his [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) came
again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore,
which is in [Lehi](../ebd/ebd226.htm#009.md) unto this day.  

<span id="020">20</span> And he judged [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
in the days of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) twenty years.
