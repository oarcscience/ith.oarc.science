### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> And the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)
took the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God, and brought it from
Ebenezer unto [Ashdod](../ebd/ebd033.htm#006.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> When the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)
took the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God, they brought it into the
house of [Dagon](../ebd/ebd096.htm#000.md), and set it by
[Dagon](../ebd/ebd096.htm#000.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And when they of [Ashdod](../ebd/ebd033.htm#006.md)
arose early on the morrow, behold, [Dagon](../ebd/ebd096.htm#000.md) was
fallen upon his face to the earth before the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD. And they took
[Dagon](../ebd/ebd096.htm#000.md), and set him in his place again.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when they arose early on the morrow morning,
behold, [Dagon](../ebd/ebd096.htm#000.md) was fallen upon his face to the
ground before the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD; and the head
of [Dagon](../ebd/ebd096.htm#000.md) and both the palms of his hands were
cut off upon the [threshold](../ebd/ebd365.htm#000.md); only the stump of
[Dagon](../ebd/ebd096.htm#000.md) was left to him.  

<span id="005">5</span> Therefore neither the priests of
[Dagon](../ebd/ebd096.htm#000.md), nor any that come into Dagon's house,
tread on the [threshold](../ebd/ebd365.htm#000.md) of
[Dagon](../ebd/ebd096.htm#000) in [Ashdod](../ebd/ebd033.htm#006.md) unto
this day.  

<span id="006">6</span> But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of
[Ashdod](../ebd/ebd033.htm#006.md), and he destroyed them, and smote them
with emerods, even [Ashdod](../ebd/ebd033.htm#006.md) and the coasts
thereof.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when the men of
[Ashdod](../ebd/ebd033.htm#006.md) saw that it was so, they said, The
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) shall not abide with us: for his hand is
sore upon us, and upon [Dagon](../ebd/ebd096.htm#000.md) our god.  

<span id="008">8</span> They sent therefore and gathered all the lords
of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) unto them, and said, What
shall we do with the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)? And they answered, Let the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) be carried about unto
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009.md). And they carried the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) about thither.  

<span id="009">9</span> And it was so, that, after they had carried it
about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md): and he smote the men of the city,
both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.  

<span id="010">10</span> Therefore they sent the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of God to [Ekron](../ebd/ebd114.htm#001.md).
And it came to pass, as the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of God came to
[Ekron](../ebd/ebd114.htm#001.md), that the Ekronites cried out, saying,
They have brought about the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) to us, to slay us and our people.  

<span id="011">11</span> So they sent and gathered together all the
lords of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), and said, Send away
the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and let it go again to his own place,
that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md) throughout all the city; the hand
of God was very heavy there.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the men that died not were smitten with the
emerods: and the cry of the city went up to
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).
