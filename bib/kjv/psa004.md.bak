### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Hear me when I call, O God of my
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md): thou hast enlarged me when I was
in distress; have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) upon me, and hear my
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) into shame? how long will ye love vanity,
and seek after [leasing](../ebd/ebd225.htm#008.md)?
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> But know that the LORD hath set apart him that
is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.  

<span id="004">4</span> Stand in awe, and [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> Offer the sacrifices of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md), and put your trust in the
LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> There be many that say, Who will shew us any
good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.  

<span id="007">7</span> Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in
the time that their [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md) and their
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) increased.  

<span id="008">8</span> I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for
thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.
