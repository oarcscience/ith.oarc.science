### King James Version: Acts Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, that after we were gotten
from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto
[Coos](../ebd/ebd089.htm#005), and the day following unto
[Rhodes](../ebd/ebd313.htm#001), and from thence unto
[Patara](../ebd/ebd286.htm#006):  

<span id="002">2</span> And finding a ship sailing over unto
[Phenicia](../ebd/ebd293.htm#002), we went aboard, and set forth.  

<span id="003">3</span> Now when we had discovered
[Cyprus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#003), we left it on the left hand, and sailed
into [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002), and landed at
[Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001): for there the ship was to unlade her
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007).  

<span id="004">4</span> And finding disciples, we tarried there
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days: who said to
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) through the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), that he should not go up to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="005">5</span> And when we had accomplished those days, we
departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with
wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on
the shore, and prayed.  

<span id="006">6</span> And when we had taken our leave one of another,
we took ship; and they returned home again.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when we had finished our course from
[Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001), we came to
[Ptolemais](../ebd/ebd301.htm#007), and saluted the brethren, and abode
with them one day.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the next day we that were of Paul's company
departed, and came unto [Caesarea](../ebd/ebd068.htm#003): and we
entered into the house of [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008) the
[evangelist](../ebd/ebd127.htm#004), which was one of the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005); and abode with him.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the same man had four daughters, virgins,
which did prophesy.  

<span id="010">10</span> And as we tarried there many days, there came
down from Judaea a certain [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), named
[Agabus](../ebd/ebd011.htm#007).  

<span id="011">11</span> And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's
[girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005), and bound his own hands and feet, and
said, Thus saith the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005), So shall the
Jews at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) bind the man that owneth this
[girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005), and shall deliver him into the hands of
the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001).  

<span id="012">12</span> And when we heard these things, both we, and
they of that place, besought him not to go up to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="013">13</span> Then [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) answered,
What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be
bound only, but also to die at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) for
the name of the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="014">14</span> And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased,
saying, The will of the Lord be done.  

<span id="015">15</span> And after those days we took up our carriages,
and went up to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="016">16</span> There went with us also certain of the
disciples of [Caesarea](../ebd/ebd068.htm#003), and brought with them
one [Mnason](../ebd/ebd258.htm#004) of [Cyprus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#003),
an old [disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003), with whom we should
[lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002).  

<span id="017">17</span> And when we were come to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), the brethren received us gladly.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the day following
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) went in with us unto
[James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007); and all the elders were present.  

<span id="019">19</span> And when he had saluted them, he declared
particularly what things God had wrought among the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) by his ministry.  

<span id="020">20</span> And when they heard it, they glorified the
Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008) of Jews there are which believe; and
they are all zealous of the law:  

<span id="021">21</span> And they are informed of thee, that thou
teachest all the Jews which are among the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) to forsake
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying that they ought not to circumcise
their children, neither to walk after the customs.  

<span id="022">22</span> What is it therefore? the multitude must needs
come together: for they will hear that thou art come.  

<span id="023">23</span> Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have
four men which have a vow on them;  

<span id="024">24</span> Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be
at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know
that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are
nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the
law.  

<span id="025">25</span> As touching the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) which believe, we have written and
concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep
themselves from things offered to idols, and from
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and from strangled, and from
[fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008).  

<span id="026">26</span> Then [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) took the
men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), to signify the accomplishment of the
days of [purification](../ebd/ebd302.htm#007), until that an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) should be offered for every one of
them.  

<span id="027">27</span> And when the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
days were almost ended, the Jews which were of
[Asia](../ebd/ebd034.htm#008), when they saw him in the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), stirred up all the people, and laid
hands on him,  

<span id="028">28</span> Crying out, Men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), help: This is the man, that teacheth
all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and
further brought Greeks also into the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004),
and hath polluted this holy place.  

<span id="029">29</span> (For they had seen before with him in the city
[Trophimus](../ebd/ebd373.htm#000) an Ephesian, whom they supposed that
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) had brought into the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004).)  

<span id="030">30</span> And all the city was moved, and the people ran
together: and they took [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), and drew him out
of the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004): and forthwith the
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009) were shut.  

<span id="031">31</span> And as they went about to kill him, tidings
came unto the chief captain of the band, that all
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) was in an uproar.  

<span id="032">32</span> Who immediately took soldiers and centurions,
and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the
soldiers, they left beating of [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002).  

<span id="033">33</span> Then the chief captain came near, and took him,
and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was,
and what he had done.  

<span id="034">34</span> And some cried one thing, some another, among
the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult,
he commanded him to be carried into the
[castle](../ebd/ebd073.htm#008).  

<span id="035">35</span> And when he came upon the stairs, so it was,
that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.  

<span id="036">36</span> For the multitude of the people followed after,
crying, Away with him.  

<span id="037">37</span> And as [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) was to be
led into the [castle](../ebd/ebd073.htm#008), he said unto the chief
captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak
[Greek](../ebd/ebd155.htm#004)?  

<span id="038">38</span> Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these
days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) four thousand men that were
murderers?  

<span id="039">39</span> But [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) said, I am a
man which am a [Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004) of
[Tarsus](../ebd/ebd359.htm#003), a city in
[Cilicia](../ebd/ebd083.htm#003), a citizen of no mean city: and, I
beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.  

<span id="040">40</span> And when he had given him licence,
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the
hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake
unto them in the [Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009) tongue, saying,
