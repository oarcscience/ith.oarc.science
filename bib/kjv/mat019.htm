<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 19</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> had finished these sayings, he departed from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Wherefore they are no more twain, but one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;They say unto him, Why did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> then command to give a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A> of divorcement, and to put her away?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;He saith unto them, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A>, and shall marry another, committeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A>: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;He saith unto him, Which? <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said, Thou shalt do no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd262.htm#002">murder</A>, Thou shalt not commit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A>, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>, and thou shalt have treasure in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>: and come and follow me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And again I say unto you, It is easier for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#000">camel</A> to go through the eye of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#003">needle</A>, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Then answered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#004">regeneration</A> when the Son of man shall sit in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.<BR>
