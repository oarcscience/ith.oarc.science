</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;A <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;If the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;There is an evil which I have seen under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;He that diggeth a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A> shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</A> shall bite him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A> shall be endangered thereby.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;If the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A> be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Surely the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</A> will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;The words of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#009">swallow</A> up himself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#002">madness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Woe to thee, O land, when thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Blessed art thou, O land, when thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;A <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> is made for laughter, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> maketh merry: but money answereth all things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">Curse</A> not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, no not in thy thought; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#000">bird</A> of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.<BR>
