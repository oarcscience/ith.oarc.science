### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Go in unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md): for I have hardened his heart, and the
heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him:  

<span id="002">2</span> And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy
son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and my signs which I have done among
them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) came in unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD
God of the [Hebrews](../ebd/ebd171.htm#001.md), How long wilt thou refuse
to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.  

<span id="004">4</span> Else, if thou refuse to let my people go,
behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast:  

<span id="005">5</span> And they shall cover the face of the earth, that
one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of
that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the
[hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002.md), and shall eat every tree which groweth
for you out of the field:  

<span id="006">6</span> And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses
of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither
thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they
were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out
from [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long
shall this man be a [snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009.md) unto us? let the men
go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) is destroyed?  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) were brought again unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md): and he said unto them, Go, serve the
LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said, We will
go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our
daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must
hold a [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) unto the LORD.  

<span id="010">10</span> And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with
you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is
before you.  

<span id="011">11</span> Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the
LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's
presence.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Stretch out thine hand over the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) for the locusts, that they may come up
upon the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and eat every
[herb](../ebd/ebd174.htm#008.md) of the land, even all that the
[hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002.md) hath left.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) stretched
forth his rod over the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and the
LORD brought an [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) wind upon the land all
that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) wind brought the locusts.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the [locust](../ebd/ebd231.htm#000.md) went up
over all the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and rested in all
the coasts of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): very grievous were they;
before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall
be such.  

<span id="015">15</span> For they covered the face of the whole earth,
so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every
[herb](../ebd/ebd174.htm#008.md) of the land, and all the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of the trees which the
[hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002.md) had left: and there remained not any green
thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land
of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> Then [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) called
for [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) in
haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against
you.  

<span id="017">17</span> Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) only this once, and intreat the LORD your
God, that he may take away from me this death only.  

<span id="018">18</span> And he went out from
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md), and intreated the LORD.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind,
which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there
remained not one [locust](../ebd/ebd231.htm#000.md) in all the coasts of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that
he would not let the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) go.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), Stretch out thine hand toward
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), that there may be
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) over the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), even [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md)
which may be felt.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) stretched
forth his hand toward [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md); and there was a
thick [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) in all the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) three days:  

<span id="023">23</span> They saw not one another, neither rose any from
his place for three days: but all the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) had light in their
[dwellings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#001.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) called
unto [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), and said, Go ye, serve the LORD;
only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also
go with you.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said, Thou
must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) unto the LORD our God.  

<span id="026">26</span> Our [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) also shall
go with us; there shall not an [hoof](../ebd/ebd181.htm#003.md) be left
behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know
not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.  

<span id="027">27</span> But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he
would not let them go.  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) said unto
him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in
that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) said, Thou
hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.
