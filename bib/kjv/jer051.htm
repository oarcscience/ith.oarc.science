<P><a name="056">56</A>&nbsp;Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="057">57</A>&nbsp;And I will make <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</A> her princes, and her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A>, whose name is the LORD of hosts.<BR>
