### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 46

<span id="001">1</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; The
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the inner court that looketh toward the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) shall be shut the six working days; but on
the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) it shall be opened, and in the day
of the new [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004) it shall be opened.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) shall
enter by the way of the porch of that [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008)
without, and shall stand by the [post](../ebd/ebd299.htm#001) of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), and the priests shall prepare his burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) and his peace offerings, and he shall
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) at the
[threshold](../ebd/ebd365.htm#000) of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008):
then he shall go forth; but the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) shall not
be shut until the evening.  

<span id="003">3</span> Likewise the people of the land shall
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) at the door of this
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the
new moons.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001)
that the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) shall offer unto the LORD in
the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day shall be six lambs without
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007), and a [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003)
without [blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001)
shall be an [ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003) for a
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003), and the meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) for the lambs as he shall be able to
give, and an hin of oil to an [ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003).  

<span id="006">6</span> And in the day of the new
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004) it shall be a young
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) without
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007), and six lambs, and a
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003): they shall be without
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007).  

<span id="007">7</span> And he shall prepare a meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), an [ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003) for
a [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003), and an
[ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003) for a [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003), and
for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil
to an [ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003).  

<span id="008">8</span> And when the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004)
shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), and he shall go forth by the way
thereof.  

<span id="009">9</span> But when the people of the land shall come
before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of
the north [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) to
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) shall go out by the way of the south
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008); and he that entereth by the way of the
south [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) shall go forth by the way of the
north [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008): he shall not return by the way of
the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) whereby he came in, but shall go forth
over against it.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) in the
midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth,
shall go forth.  

<span id="011">11</span> And in the feasts and in the solemnities the
meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) shall be an
[ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003) to a [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003),
and an [ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003) to a [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003),
and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an
[ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003).  

<span id="012">12</span> Now when the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004)
shall prepare a voluntary burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) or
peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then open him the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) that looketh toward the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000), and he shall prepare his burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) and his peace offerings, as he did on
the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day: then he shall go forth; and
after his going forth one shall shut the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008).  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) unto the LORD of a
[lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003) of the first year without
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007): thou shalt prepare it every morning.  

<span id="014">14</span> And thou shalt prepare a meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) for it every morning, the sixth part
of an [ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003), and the third part of an hin of
oil, to temper with the fine [flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001); a meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) continually by a perpetual ordinance
unto the LORD.  

<span id="015">15</span> Thus shall they prepare the
[lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003), and the meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and the oil, every morning for a
continual burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001).  

<span id="016">16</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) give a [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005)
unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it
shall be their possession by inheritance.  

<span id="017">17</span> But if he give a [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005)
of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the
year of liberty; after it shall return to the
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004): but his inheritance shall be his sons'
for them.  

<span id="018">18</span> Moreover the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004)
shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression, to thrust them
out of their possession; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of
his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his
possession.  

<span id="019">19</span> After he brought me through the entry, which
was at the side of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), into the holy
chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold,
there was a place on the two sides [westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008).  

<span id="020">20</span> Then said he unto me, This is the place where
the priests shall [boil](../ebd/ebd061.htm#008) the trespass
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) and the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), where they shall
[bake](../ebd/ebd042.htm#001) the meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001); that they bear them not out into the
utter court, to sanctify the people.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then he brought me forth into the utter court,
and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in
every corner of the court there was a court.  

<span id="022">22</span> In the four corners of the court there were
courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners
were of one measure.  

<span id="023">23</span> And there was a row of building round about in
them, round about them four, and it was made with boiling places under
the rows round about.  

<span id="024">24</span> Then said he unto me, These are the places of
them that [boil](../ebd/ebd061.htm#008), where the ministers of the
house shall [boil](../ebd/ebd061.htm#008) the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of the people.
