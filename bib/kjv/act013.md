### King James Version: Acts Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> Now there were in the church that was at
[Antioch](../ebd/ebd025.htm#001) certain prophets and teachers; as
[Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005), and [Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002)
that was called [Niger](../ebd/ebd272.htm#009), and
[Lucius](../ebd/ebd232.htm#007) of [Cyrene](../ebd/ebd095.htm#004), and
[Manaen](../ebd/ebd240.htm#001), which had been brought up with Herod
the [tetrarch](../ebd/ebd363.htm#000), and
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002).  

<span id="002">2</span> As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the
Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005) said, Separate me
[Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005) and [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) for
the work whereunto I have called them.  

<span id="003">3</span> And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid
their hands on them, they sent them away.  

<span id="004">4</span> So they, being sent forth by the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005), departed unto
[Seleucia](../ebd/ebd326.htm#009); and from thence they sailed to
[Cyprus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#003).  

<span id="005">5</span> And when they were at
[Salamis](../ebd/ebd318.htm#008), they preached the word of God in the
synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007).  

<span id="006">6</span> And when they had gone through the isle unto
[Paphos](../ebd/ebd284.htm#002), they found a certain
[sorcerer](../ebd/ebd348.htm#006), a false
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), a [Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004), whose
name was Barjesus:  

<span id="007">7</span> Which was with the
[deputy](../ebd/ebd101.htm#008) of the country, Sergius Paulus, a
prudent man; who called for [Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005) and
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), and desired to hear the word of God.  

<span id="008">8</span> But [Elymas](../ebd/ebd119.htm#004) the
[sorcerer](../ebd/ebd348.htm#006) (for so is his name by interpretation)
withstood them, seeking to turn away the [deputy](../ebd/ebd101.htm#008)
from the faith.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), (who also is
called [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002),) filled with the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005), set his eyes on him.  

<span id="010">10</span> And said, O full of all subtilty and all
mischief, thou child of the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007), thou enemy
of all [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), wilt thou not cease to
pervert the right ways of the Lord?  

<span id="011">11</span> And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon
thee, and thou shalt be [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009), not seeing the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) for a season. And immediately there fell on
him a mist and a [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008); and he went about
seeking some to lead him by the hand.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then the [deputy](../ebd/ebd101.htm#008), when
he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the
Lord.  

<span id="013">13</span> Now when [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) and his
company loosed from [Paphos](../ebd/ebd284.htm#002), they came to
[Perga](../ebd/ebd290.htm#003) in [Pamphylia](../ebd/ebd283.htm#008):
and John departing from them returned to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="014">14</span> But when they departed from
[Perga](../ebd/ebd290.htm#003), they came to
[Antioch](../ebd/ebd025.htm#001) in [Pisidia](../ebd/ebd296.htm#005),
and went into the [synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009) on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day, and sat down.  

<span id="015">15</span> And after the reading of the law and the
prophets the rulers of the [synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009) sent unto
them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation
for the people, say on.  

<span id="016">16</span> Then [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) stood up,
and beckoning with his hand said, Men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and ye that fear God, give audience.  

<span id="017">17</span> The God of this people of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) chose our fathers, and exalted the
people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and with an high arm brought he them out
of it.  

<span id="018">18</span> And about the time of forty years suffered he
their manners in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005).  

<span id="019">19</span> And when he had destroyed
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) nations in the land of Chanaan, he
divided their land to them by lot.  

<span id="020">20</span> And after that he gave unto them judges about
the space of four hundred and fifty years, until
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008).  

<span id="021">21</span> And afterward they desired a
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001): and God gave unto them
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) the son of Cis, a man of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008), by
the space of forty years.  

<span id="022">22</span> And when he had removed him, he raised up unto
them [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) to be their
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001); to whom also he gave their
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008), and said, I have found
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) the son of
[Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005), a man after mine own heart, which shall
fulfil all my will.  

<span id="023">23</span> Of this man's seed hath God according to his
promise raised unto [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) a
[Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003), [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006):  

<span id="024">24</span> When John had first preached before his coming
the baptism of [repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008) to all the people of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="025">25</span> And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom
think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me,
whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.  

<span id="026">26</span> Men and brethren, children of the stock of
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), and whosoever among you feareth God,
to you is the word of this [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) sent.  

<span id="027">27</span> For they that dwell at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and their rulers, because they knew
him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day, they have fulfilled them in
condemning him.  

<span id="028">28</span> And though they found no cause of death in him,
yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.  

<span id="029">29</span> And when they had fulfilled all that was
written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001).  

<span id="030">30</span> But God raised him from the dead:  

<span id="031">31</span> And he was seen many days of them which came up
with him from [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008) to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), who are his witnesses unto the
people.  

<span id="032">32</span> And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that
the promise which was made unto the fathers,  

<span id="033">33</span> God hath fulfilled the same unto us their
children, in that he hath raised up [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this
day have I begotten thee.  

<span id="034">34</span> And as concerning that he raised him up from
the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), I will give you the sure mercies of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="035">35</span> Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou
shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  

<span id="036">36</span> For [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), after he
had served his own [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) by the will of
God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:  

<span id="037">37</span> But he, whom God raised again, saw no
corruption.  

<span id="038">38</span> Be it known unto you therefore, men and
brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of
sins:  

<span id="039">39</span> And by him all that believe are justified from
all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003).  

<span id="040">40</span> Beware therefore, lest that come upon you,
which is spoken of in the prophets;  

<span id="041">41</span> Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish:
for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) believe, though a man declare it unto
you.  

<span id="042">42</span> And when the Jews were gone out of the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009), the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) besought that these words might be
preached to them the next [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003).  

<span id="043">43</span> Now when the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) was broken up, many of the Jews
and religious proselytes followed [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) and
[Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005): who, speaking to them, persuaded them
to continue in the [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) of God.  

<span id="044">44</span> And the next [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003)
day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.  

<span id="045">45</span> But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were
filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), contradicting and blaspheming.  

<span id="046">46</span> Then [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) and
[Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005) waxed bold, and said, It was necessary
that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye
put it from you, and [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) yourselves unworthy
of [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) life, lo, we turn to the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001).  

<span id="047">47</span> For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I
have set thee to be a light of the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001),
that thou shouldest be for [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) unto the
ends of the earth.  

<span id="048">48</span> And when the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001)
heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as
many as were ordained to eternal life believed.  

<span id="049">49</span> And the word of the Lord was published
throughout all the region.  

<span id="050">50</span> But the Jews stirred up the devout and
honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised
[persecution](../ebd/ebd290.htm#007) against
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) and [Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005), and
expelled them out of their coasts.  

<span id="051">51</span> But they shook off the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) of their feet against them, and came unto
[Iconium](../ebd/ebd186.htm#003).  

<span id="052">52</span> And the disciples were filled with joy, and
with the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005).
