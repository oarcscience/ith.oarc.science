### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> Now [Sarai](../ebd/ebd322.htm#004.md) Abram's wife
bare him no children: and she had an [handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008.md),
an Egyptian, whose name was [Hagar](../ebd/ebd158.htm#005.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Sarai](../ebd/ebd322.htm#004.md) said unto
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md), Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me
from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may
obtain children by her. And [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md) hearkened to
the voice of [Sarai](../ebd/ebd322.htm#004.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Sarai](../ebd/ebd322.htm#004.md) Abram's wife
took [Hagar](../ebd/ebd158.htm#005.md) her maid the Egyptian, after
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md) had dwelt ten years in the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md), and gave her to her husband
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md) to be his wife.  

<span id="004">4</span> And he went in unto
[Hagar](../ebd/ebd158.htm#005.md), and she conceived: and when she saw that
she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Sarai](../ebd/ebd322.htm#004.md) said unto
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md), My wrong be upon thee: I have given my
maid into thy [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md); and when she saw that she
had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) between me and thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> But [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md) said unto
[Sarai](../ebd/ebd322.htm#004.md), Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do to
her as it pleaseth thee. And when [Sarai](../ebd/ebd322.htm#004.md) dealt
hardly with her, she fled from her face.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
LORD found her by a [fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md) of water in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), by the
[fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000.md) in the way to
[Shur](../ebd/ebd342.htm#002.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And he said, [Hagar](../ebd/ebd158.htm#005.md),
Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she
said, I flee from the face of my mistress
[Sarai](../ebd/ebd322.htm#004.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her
hands.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall
not be numbered for multitude.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child and shalt bear a son,
and shalt call his name [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md); because the
LORD hath heard thy affliction.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he will be a wild man; his hand will be
against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell
in the presence of all his brethren.  

<span id="013">13</span> And she called the name of the LORD that spake
unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after
him that seeth me?  

<span id="014">14</span> Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi;
behold, it is between [Kadesh](../ebd/ebd215.htm#003.md) and
[Bered](../ebd/ebd053.htm#004.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Hagar](../ebd/ebd158.htm#005.md) bare
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004) a son: and [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md)
called his son's name, which [Hagar](../ebd/ebd158.htm#005.md) bare,
[Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md) was
fourscore and six years old, when [Hagar](../ebd/ebd158.htm#005.md) bare
[Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005) to [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004.md).
