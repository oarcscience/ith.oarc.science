</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the pride of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> doth testify to his face: therefore shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> fall in their iniquity: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> also shall fall with them.<BR>
