### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 89

<span id="001">1</span> I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever:
with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.  

<span id="002">2</span> For I have said, [Mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005)
shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the
very heavens.  

<span id="003">3</span> I have made a [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008)
with my [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008), I have sworn unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) my servant,  

<span id="004">4</span> Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up
thy [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) to all generations.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O
LORD: thy faithfulness also in the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004)
of the saints.  

<span id="006">6</span> For who in the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006)
can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be
likened unto the LORD?  

<span id="007">7</span> God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of
the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.  

<span id="008">8</span> O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like
unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?  

<span id="009">9</span> Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the
waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.  

<span id="010">10</span> Thou hast broken [Rahab](../ebd/ebd305.htm#006)
in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002), as one that is slain; thou hast
scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.  

<span id="011">11</span> The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine:
as for the world and the [fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007) thereof, thou
hast founded them.  

<span id="012">12</span> The north and the south thou hast created them:
[Tabor](../ebd/ebd356.htm#007) and [Hermon](../ebd/ebd175.htm#006) shall
rejoice in thy name.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and
high is thy right hand.  

<span id="014">14</span> [Justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007) and judgment
are the [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007) of thy
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001): [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) and
truth shall go before thy face.  

<span id="015">15</span> Blessed is the people that know the joyful
sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.  

<span id="016">16</span> In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and
in thy [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) shall they be exalted.  

<span id="017">17</span> For thou art the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006)
of their strength: and in thy favour our [horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003)
shall be exalted.  

<span id="018">18</span> For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) is our
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="019">19</span> Then thou spakest in
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000) to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid
help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) out of the people.  

<span id="020">20</span> I have found [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) my
servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:  

<span id="021">21</span> With whom my hand shall be established: mine
arm also shall strengthen him.  

<span id="022">22</span> The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son
of wickedness afflict him.  

<span id="023">23</span> And I will beat down his foes before his face,
and [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) them that hate him.  

<span id="024">24</span> But my faithfulness and my
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) shall be with him: and in my name shall
his [horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003) be exalted.  

<span id="025">25</span> I will set his hand also in the sea, and his
right hand in the rivers.  

<span id="026">26</span> He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my
God, and the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) of my
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003).  

<span id="027">27</span> Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than
the kings of the earth.  

<span id="028">28</span> My [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) will I keep
for him for evermore, and my [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) shall
stand [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) with him.  

<span id="029">29</span> His seed also will I make to endure for ever,
and his [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) as the days of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="030">30</span> If his children forsake my law, and walk not in
my judgments;  

<span id="031">31</span> If they break my statutes, and keep not my
commandments;  

<span id="032">32</span> Then will I visit their transgression with the
rod, and their iniquity with [stripes](../ebd/ebd352.htm#005).  

<span id="033">33</span> Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not
utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.  

<span id="034">34</span> My [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) will I not
break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.  

<span id="035">35</span> Once have I sworn by my
[holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006) that I will not lie unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="036">36</span> His seed shall endure for ever, and his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) as the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001)
before me.  

<span id="037">37</span> It shall be established for ever as the
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004), and as a
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006). [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="038">38</span> But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast
been wroth with thine anointed.  

<span id="039">39</span> Thou hast made void the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of thy servant: thou hast profaned his
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) by casting it to the ground.  

<span id="040">40</span> Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast
brought his strong holds to ruin.  

<span id="041">41</span> All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a
reproach to his neighbours.  

<span id="042">42</span> Thou hast set up the right hand of his
adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.  

<span id="043">43</span> Thou hast also turned the edge of his
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and hast not made him to stand in the
battle.  

<span id="044">44</span> Thou hast made his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) to cease, and cast his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) down to the ground.  

<span id="045">45</span> The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou
hast covered him with shame. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="046">46</span> How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for
ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?  

<span id="047">47</span> Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast
thou made all men in vain?  

<span id="048">48</span> What man is he that liveth, and shall not see
death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008)? [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="049">49</span> Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses,
which thou swarest unto [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) in thy truth?  

<span id="050">50</span> Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants;
how I do bear in my [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008) the reproach of all
the mighty people;  

<span id="051">51</span> Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O
LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.  

<span id="052">52</span> Blessed be the LORD for evermore.
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001), and [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).
