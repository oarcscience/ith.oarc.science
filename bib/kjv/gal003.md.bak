### King James Version: Galatians Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you,
that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) hath been
evidently set forth, crucified among you?  

<span id="002">2</span> This only would I learn of you, Received ye the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) by the works of the law, or by the
hearing of faith?  

<span id="003">3</span> Are ye so foolish? having begun in the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), are ye now made perfect by the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md)?  

<span id="004">4</span> Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it
be yet in vain.  

<span id="005">5</span> He therefore that ministereth to you the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), and worketh miracles among you, doeth
he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?  

<span id="006">6</span> Even as [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md)
believed God, and it was accounted to him for
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Know ye therefore that they which are of faith,
the same are the children of [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And the [scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005.md),
foreseeing that God would justify the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md)
through faith, preached before the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md) unto
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), saying, In thee shall all nations be
blessed.  

<span id="009">9</span> So then they which be of faith are blessed with
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> For as many as are of the works of the law are
under the [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md): for it is written, Cursed is
every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the
book of the law to do them.  

<span id="011">11</span> But that no man is justified by the law in the
sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the law is not of faith: but, The man that
doeth them shall live in them.  

<span id="013">13</span> [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) hath redeemed
us from the [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) of the law, being made a
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md) for us: for it is written, Cursed is
every one that hangeth on a tree:  

<span id="014">14</span> That the blessing of
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) might come on the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) through [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md); that we might receive the promise of
the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) through faith.  

<span id="015">15</span> Brethren, I speak after the manner of men;
Though it be but a man's [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md), yet if it be
confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.  

<span id="016">16</span> Now to [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) and his
seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but
as of one, And to thy seed, which is [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And this I say, that the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md), that was confirmed before of God in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), the law, which was four hundred and
thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of
none effect.  

<span id="018">18</span> For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no
more of promise: but God gave it to [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md) by
promise.  

<span id="019">19</span> Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added
because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise
was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a
[mediator](../ebd/ebd246.htm#002.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> Now a [mediator](../ebd/ebd246.htm#002.md) is not
a [mediator](../ebd/ebd246.htm#002.md) of one, but God is one.  

<span id="021">21</span> Is the law then against the promises of God?
God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given
life, verily [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) should have been by
the law.  

<span id="022">22</span> But the [scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005.md) hath
concluded all under [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), that the promise by
faith of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
might be given to them that believe.  

<span id="023">23</span> But before faith came, we were kept under the
law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.  

<span id="024">24</span> Wherefore the law was our
[schoolmaster](../ebd/ebd323.htm#009.md) to bring us unto
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), that we might be justified by faith.  

<span id="025">25</span> But after that faith is come, we are no longer
under a [schoolmaster](../ebd/ebd323.htm#009.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> For ye are all the children of God by faith in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> For as many of you as have been baptized into
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) have put on
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> There is neither [Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004.md)
nor [Greek](../ebd/ebd155.htm#004.md), there is neither
[bond](../ebd/ebd062.htm#001.md) nor free, there is neither male nor
female: for ye are all one in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's
seed, and heirs according to the promise.
