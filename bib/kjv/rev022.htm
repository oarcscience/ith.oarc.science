</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And there shall be no more <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A>: but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of God and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</A> shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And there shall be no night there; and they need no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#000">candle</A>, neither light of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, These sayings are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</A> of this book.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> before the feet of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> which shewed me these things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And he saith unto me, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">Seal</A> not the sayings of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</A> of this book: for the time is at hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;I am Alpha and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd278.htm#004">Omega</A>, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.<BR>

<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> have sent mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and the bright and morning star.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#001">bride</A> say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</A> of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</A>, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</A>. Even so, come, Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
