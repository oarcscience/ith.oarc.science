### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) said unto
all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), Behold, I have hearkened unto your
voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over you.  

<span id="002">2</span> And now, behold, the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) walketh before you: and I am old and
grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before
you from my childhood unto this day.  

<span id="003">3</span> Behold, here I am:
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) against me before the LORD, and before
his anointed: whose [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007.md) have I taken? or whose
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md) have I taken? or whom have I defrauded?
whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any
[bribe](../ebd/ebd064.htm#009) to [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009.md) mine
eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.  

<span id="004">4</span> And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor
oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he said unto them, The LORD is
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) against you, and his anointed is
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) this day, that ye have not found ought
in my hand. And they answered, He is [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) said unto
the people, It is the LORD that advanced [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md)
and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), and that brought your fathers up out
of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Now therefore stand still, that I may reason
with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he
did to you and to your fathers.  

<span id="008">8</span> When [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) was come
into [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and your fathers cried unto the
LORD, then the LORD sent [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md), which brought forth your fathers out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and made them dwell in this place.  

<span id="009">9</span> And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold
them into the hand of [Sisera](../ebd/ebd345.htm#007.md), captain of the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of [Hazor](../ebd/ebd169.htm#006.md), and
into the hand of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), and into the
hand of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md), and they fought against them.  

<span id="010">10</span> And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have
sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served
[Baalim](../ebd/ebd039.htm#007) and [Ashtaroth](../ebd/ebd034.htm#004.md):
but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve
thee.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the LORD sent
[Jerubbaal](../ebd/ebd204.htm#002), and [Bedan](../ebd/ebd049.htm#007.md),
and [Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002.md), and
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md), and delivered you out of the hand of
your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe.  

<span id="012">12</span> And when ye saw that
[Nahash](../ebd/ebd265.htm#003) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of the
children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002.md) came against you, ye said
unto me, Nay; but a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) shall reign over us:
when the LORD your God was your [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> Now therefore behold the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) whom ye have
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md), and whom ye have desired! and, behold,
the LORD hath set a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over you.  

<span id="014">14</span> If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and
obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then
shall both ye and also the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) that reigneth
over you continue following the LORD your God:  

<span id="015">15</span> But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD,
but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of
the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.  

<span id="016">16</span> Now therefore stand and see this great thing,
which the LORD will do before your eyes.  

<span id="017">17</span> Is it not [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md)
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md) to day? I will call unto the LORD, and
he shall send [thunder](../ebd/ebd365.htm#003.md) and
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md); that ye may perceive and see that your
wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in
asking you a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> So [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) called unto
the LORD; and the LORD sent [thunder](../ebd/ebd365.htm#003.md) and
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) that day: and all the people greatly
feared the LORD and [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And all the people said unto
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md), Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy
God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to
ask us a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) said unto
the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not
aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;  

<span id="021">21</span> And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go
after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.  

<span id="022">22</span> For the LORD will not forsake his people for
his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his
people.  

<span id="023">23</span> Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) against the LORD in ceasing to pray for
you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:  

<span id="024">24</span> Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with
all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.  

<span id="025">25</span> But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be
consumed, both ye and your [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).
