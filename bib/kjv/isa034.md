### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 34

<span id="001">1</span> Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye
people: let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all
things that come forth of it.  

<span id="002">2</span> For the indignation of the LORD is upon all
nations, and his [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) upon all their armies: he
hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.  

<span id="003">3</span> Their slain also shall be cast out, and their
stink shall come up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be
melted with their [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000).  

<span id="004">4</span> And all the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) shall be dissolved, and the heavens
shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) shall fall down, as the
[leaf](../ebd/ebd225.htm#004) falleth off from the
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004), and as a falling
[fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001) from the [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001)
tree.  

<span id="005">5</span> For my [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) shall be
bathed in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006): behold, it shall come down
upon Idumea, and upon the people of my [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003),
to judgment.  

<span id="006">6</span> The [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) of the LORD
is filled with [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), it is made
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) with fatness, and with the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of lambs and goats, with the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) in [Bozrah](../ebd/ebd063.htm#009),
and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the unicorns shall come down with them, and
the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and their [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008)
made [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) with fatness.  

<span id="008">8</span> For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, and
the year of recompences for the controversy of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002).  

<span id="009">9</span> And the streams thereof shall be turned into
[pitch](../ebd/ebd296.htm#008), and the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008)
thereof into [brimstone](../ebd/ebd065.htm#005), and the land thereof
shall become burning [pitch](../ebd/ebd296.htm#008).  

<span id="010">10</span> It shall not be quenched night nor day; the
smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) to
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) it shall lie waste; none shall pass
through it for ever and ever.  

<span id="011">11</span> But the [cormorant](../ebd/ebd090.htm#005) and
the [bittern](../ebd/ebd060.htm#000) shall possess it; the
[owl](../ebd/ebd281.htm#006) also and the [raven](../ebd/ebd307.htm#008)
shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of
confusion, and the stones of emptiness.  

<span id="012">12</span> They shall call the nobles thereof to the
kingdom, but none shall be there, and all her princes shall be
nothing.  

<span id="013">13</span> And thorns shall come up in her palaces,
nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007) of dragons, and a court for owls.  

<span id="014">14</span> The wild beasts of the
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000) shall also meet with the wild beasts of
the [island](../ebd/ebd190.htm#009), and the
[satyr](../ebd/ebd323.htm#001) shall cry to his fellow; the screech
[owl](../ebd/ebd281.htm#006) also shall rest there, and find for herself
a place of rest.  

<span id="015">15</span> There shall the great
[owl](../ebd/ebd281.htm#006) make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and
gather under her [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002): there shall the
vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.  

<span id="016">16</span> Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read:
no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it
hath commanded, and his [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) it hath gathered
them.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand
hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) to
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) shall they dwell therein.
