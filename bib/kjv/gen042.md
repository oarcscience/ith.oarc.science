### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 42

<span id="001">1</span> Now when [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) saw that
there was [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) said unto
his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?  

<span id="002">2</span> And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009): get you
down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not
die.  

<span id="003">3</span> And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="004">4</span> But [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008), Joseph's
brother, [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) sent not with his brethren; for
he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the sons of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
came to buy [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) among those that came: for the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) was in the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005).  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) was the
governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the
land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him
with their faces to the earth.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) saw his
brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and
spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they
said, From the land of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005) to buy food.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) knew his
brethren, but they knew not him.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) remembered
the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are
[spies](../ebd/ebd349.htm#007); to see the nakedness of the land ye are
come.  

<span id="010">10</span> And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to
buy food are thy servants come.  

<span id="011">11</span> We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy
servants are no [spies](../ebd/ebd349.htm#007).  

<span id="012">12</span> And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the
nakedness of the land ye are come.  

<span id="013">13</span> And they said, Thy servants are twelve
brethren, the sons of one man in the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005); and, behold, the youngest is this day
with our father, and one is not.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) said unto
them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are
[spies](../ebd/ebd349.htm#007):  

<span id="015">15</span> Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) ye shall not go forth hence, except
your youngest brother come hither.  

<span id="016">16</span> Send one of you, and let him fetch your
brother, and ye shall be kept in [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006), that
your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by
the life of [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) surely ye are
[spies](../ebd/ebd349.htm#007).  

<span id="017">17</span> And he put them all together into
[ward](../ebd/ebd379.htm#001) three days.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) said unto
them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:  

<span id="019">19</span> If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be
bound in the house of your [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006): go ye, carry
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) for the [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) of
your houses:  

<span id="020">20</span> But bring your youngest brother unto me; so
shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.  

<span id="021">21</span> And they said one to another, We are verily
guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul,
when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress
come upon us.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009) answered
them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) against the child; and ye would not hear?
therefore, behold, also his [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) is
required.  

<span id="023">23</span> And they knew not that
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) understood them; for he spake unto them
by an interpreter.  

<span id="024">24</span> And he turned himself about from them, and
wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from
them [Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002), and bound him before their eyes.  

<span id="025">25</span> Then [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) commanded
to fill their sacks with [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006), and to restore
every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way:
and thus did he unto them.  

<span id="026">26</span> And they laded their asses with the
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006), and departed thence.  

<span id="027">27</span> And as one of them opened his sack to give his
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001) provender in the
[inn](../ebd/ebd188.htm#004), he espied his money; for, behold, it was
in his sack's mouth.  

<span id="028">28</span> And he said unto his brethren, My money is
restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them,
and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath
done unto us?  

<span id="029">29</span> And they came unto
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) their father unto the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005), and told him all that befell unto them;
saying,  

<span id="030">30</span> The man, who is the lord of the land, spake
roughly to us, and took us for [spies](../ebd/ebd349.htm#007) of the
country.  

<span id="031">31</span> And we said unto him, We are true men; we are
no [spies](../ebd/ebd349.htm#007):  

<span id="032">32</span> We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one
is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005).  

<span id="033">33</span> And the man, the lord of the country, said unto
us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren
here with me, and take food for the [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) of
your households, and be gone:  

<span id="034">34</span> And bring your youngest brother unto me: then
shall I know that ye are no [spies](../ebd/ebd349.htm#007), but that ye
are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick
in the land.  

<span id="035">35</span> And it came to pass as they emptied their
sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and
when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were
afraid.  

<span id="036">36</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) their father
said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children:
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) is not, and
[Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002) is not, and ye will take
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) away: all these things are against
me.  

<span id="037">37</span> And [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009) spake unto
his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee:
deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.  

<span id="038">38</span> And he said, My son shall not go down with you;
for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by
the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with
sorrow to the [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008).
