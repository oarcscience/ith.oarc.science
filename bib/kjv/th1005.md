### King James Version: 1 Thessalonians Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> But of the times and the
[seasons](../ebd/ebd325.htm#003.md), brethren, ye have no need that I write
unto you.  

<span id="002">2</span> For yourselves know perfectly that the day of
the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.  

<span id="003">3</span> For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then
sudden [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md) cometh upon them, as travail
upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.  

<span id="004">4</span> But ye, brethren, are not in
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md), that that day should overtake you as
a thief.  

<span id="005">5</span> Ye are all the children of light, and the
children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but
let us watch and be sober.  

<span id="007">7</span> For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they
that be drunken are drunken in the night.  

<span id="008">8</span> But let us, who are of the day, be sober,
putting on the [breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007.md) of faith and love;
and for an [helmet](../ebd/ebd173.htm#004.md), the hope of
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to
obtain [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) by our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md),  

<span id="010">10</span> Who died for us, that, whether we wake or
sleep, we should live together with him.  

<span id="011">11</span> Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and
edify one another, even as also ye do.  

<span id="012">12</span> And we beseech you, brethren, to know them
which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish
you;  

<span id="013">13</span> And to esteem them very highly in love for
their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.  

<span id="014">14</span> Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are
unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward
all men.  

<span id="015">15</span> See that none render evil for evil unto any
man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to
all men.  

<span id="016">16</span> Rejoice evermore.  

<span id="017">17</span> Pray without ceasing.  

<span id="018">18</span> In every thing give thanks: for this is the
will of God in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) concerning you.  

<span id="019">19</span> Quench not the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> Despise not prophesyings.  

<span id="021">21</span> Prove all things; hold
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) that which is good.  

<span id="022">22</span> Abstain from all appearance of evil.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly;
and I pray God your whole [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) and soul and
body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> [Faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005.md) is he that
calleth you, who also will do it.  

<span id="025">25</span> Brethren, pray for us.  

<span id="026">26</span> Greet all the brethren with an holy
[kiss](../ebd/ebd221.htm#000.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be
read unto all the holy brethren.  

<span id="028">28</span> The [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) be with
you. [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).
