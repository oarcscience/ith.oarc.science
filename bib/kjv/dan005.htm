</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#001">Belshazzar</A>, whiles he tasted the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, commanded to bring the golden and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> vessels which his father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</A> had taken out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> which was in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>; that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> therein.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of the house of God which was at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;They drank <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, and praised the gods of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A>, of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>, of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>, and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#001">candlestick</A> upon the plaister of the wall of the king's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A>: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> saw the part of the hand that wrote.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> spake, and said to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, Whosoever shall read this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A>, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</A>, and have a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#008">chain</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> about his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Then came in all the king's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men: but they could not read the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A>, nor make known to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> the interpretation thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#001">Belshazzar</A> greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Now the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</A> by reason of the words of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> and his lords came into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#006">banquet</A> house: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</A> spake and said, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</A> thy father, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, I say, thy father, made master of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#007">magicians</A>, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Forasmuch as an excellent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, whom the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#002">Belteshazzar</A>: now let <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> be called, and he will shew the interpretation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> brought in before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> spake and said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, Art thou that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, which art of the children of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, whom the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> my father brought out of Jewry?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;I have even heard of thee, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And now the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A>, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A>, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</A>, and have a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#008">chain</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> about thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> answered and said before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A> unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and make known to him the interpretation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;O thou <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, the most high God gave <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</A> thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, and honour:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, and they took his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> from him:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A> like oxen, and his body was wet with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And thou his son, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#001">Belshazzar</A>, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> in them; and thou hast praised the gods of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A> was written.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And this is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A> that was written, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd248.htm#002">MENE</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd248.htm#002">MENE</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd360.htm#002">TEKEL</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd374.htm#009">UPHARSIN</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;This is the interpretation of the thing: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd248.htm#002">MENE</A>; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd360.htm#002">TEKEL</A>; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd289.htm#008">PERES</A>; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Then commanded <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#001">Belshazzar</A>, and they clothed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</A>, and put a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#008">chain</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> about his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;In that night was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#001">Belshazzar</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the Chaldeans slain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</A> the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.<BR>
