<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 5</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;After this there was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> of the Jews; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> went up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Now there is at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> market a pool, which is called in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</A> tongue <A HREF="../ebd/ebd055.htm#009">Bethesda</A>, having five porches.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#002">halt</A>, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And he that was healed wist not who it was: for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Afterward <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> findeth him in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;The man departed, and told the Jews that it was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, which had made him whole.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And therefore did the Jews persecute <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A>, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Then answered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#008">damnation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A>: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;If I bear <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> of myself, my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> is not true.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;There is another that beareth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> of me; and I know that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> which he witnesseth of me is true.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Ye sent unto John, and he bare <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> unto the truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;But I receive not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A> from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;But I have greater <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> of me, that the Father hath sent me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;I receive not honour from men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, in whom ye trust.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;For had ye believed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?<BR>
