### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> This shall be the law of the leper in the day of
his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md):  

<span id="003">3</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall go
forth out of the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md); and the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall look, and, behold, if the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) of [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md) be
healed in the leper;  

<span id="004">4</span> Then shall the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005), and [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md)
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and [scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md), and
[hyssop](../ebd/ebd185.htm#007.md):  

<span id="005">5</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over
running water:  

<span id="006">6</span> As for the living [bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000.md),
he shall take it, and the [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md)
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and the [scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md),
and the [hyssop](../ebd/ebd185.htm#007.md), and shall dip them and the
living [bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000.md) in the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the [bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000.md) that
was killed over the running water:  

<span id="007">7</span> And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be
cleansed from the [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md)
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times, and shall pronounce him
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md), and shall let the living
[bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000.md) loose into the open field.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his
clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he
may be [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md): and after that he shall come into
the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md), and shall tarry abroad out of his
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009) [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days.  

<span id="009">9</span> But it shall be on the seventh day, that he
shall shave all his hair off his head and his
[beard](../ebd/ebd049.htm#000.md) and his eyebrows, even all his hair he
shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) in water, and he shall be
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And on the eighth day he shall take two he
lambs without [blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md), and one ewe
[lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md) of the first year without
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007.md), and three tenth deals of fine
[flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001.md) for a meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), mingled with oil, and one
[log](../ebd/ebd231.htm#003.md) of oil.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) that
maketh him [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md) shall present the man that is
to be made [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md), and those things, before the
LORD, at the door of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md):  

<span id="012">12</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
take one he [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md), and offer him for a trespass
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and the [log](../ebd/ebd231.htm#003.md)
of oil, and wave them for a wave [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md)
before the LORD:  

<span id="013">13</span> And he shall slay the
[lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md) in the place where he shall kill the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) and the
burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), in the holy place: for as the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) is the
priest's, so is the trespass [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md): it is
most holy:  

<span id="014">14</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
take some of the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of the trespass
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall put it upon the tip of the right
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the
thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:  

<span id="015">15</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
take some of the [log](../ebd/ebd231.htm#003.md) of oil, and pour it into
the palm of his own left hand:  

<span id="016">16</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall
sprinkle of the oil with his finger [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times
before the LORD:  

<span id="017">17</span> And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand
shall the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) put upon the tip of the right
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md) of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the
thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon
the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of the trespass
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md):  

<span id="018">18</span> And the remnant of the oil that is in the
priest's hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed:
and the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for him before the LORD.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
offer the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for him that is to be cleansed from
his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md):  

<span id="020">20</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
offer the burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) and the meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006): and the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
shall make an [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for him, and he shall
be [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And if he be [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), and
cannot get so much; then he shall take one [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md)
for a trespass [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) to be waved, to make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for him, and one tenth deal of fine
[flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001.md) mingled with oil for a meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and a [log](../ebd/ebd231.htm#003.md) of
oil;  

<span id="022">22</span> And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such
as he is able to get; and the one shall be a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), and the
other a burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And he shall bring them on the eighth day for
his cleansing unto the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), unto the door of
the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003.md) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md), before the LORD.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall

<span id="033">33</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md),
saying,  

<span id="034">34</span> When ye be come into the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md), which I give to you for a possession,
and I put the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) of
[leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md) in a house of the land of your
possession;  

<span id="035">35</span> And he that owneth the house shall come and
tell the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), saying, It seemeth to me there
is as it were a [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) in the house:  

<span id="036">36</span> Then the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
command that they empty the house, before the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) go into it to see the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md), that all that is in the house be not
made unclean: and afterward the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall go
in to see the house:  

<span id="037">37</span> And he shall look on the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md), and, behold, if the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) be in the walls of the house with hollow
strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;  

<span id="038">38</span> Then the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days:  

<span id="039">39</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) be spread in the walls of the house;  

<span id="040">40</span> Then the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
command that they take away the stones in which the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) is, and they shall cast them into an
unclean place without the city:  

<span id="041">41</span> And he shall cause the house to be scraped
within round about, and they shall pour out the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md) that they scrape off without the city into
an unclean place:  

<span id="042">42</span> And they shall take other stones, and put them
in the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall
plaister the house.  

<span id="043">43</span> And if the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) come
again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the
stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is
plaistered;  

<span id="044">44</span> Then the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
come and look, and, behold, if the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) be
spread in the house, it is a fretting [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md)
in the house; it is unclean.  

<span id="045">45</span> And he shall break down the house, the stones
of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he
shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.  

<span id="046">46</span> Moreover he that goeth into the house all the
while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.  

<span id="047">47</span> And he that lieth in the house shall wash his
clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.  

<span id="048">48</span> And if the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md)
shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) hath not spread in the house, after the
house was plaistered: then the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md) shall
pronounce the house [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md), because the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001.md) is healed.  

<span id="049">49</span> And he shall take to cleanse the house two
birds, and [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md),
and [scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md), and
[hyssop](../ebd/ebd185.htm#007.md):  

<span id="050">50</span> And he shall kill the one of the birds in an
earthen vessel over running water:  

<span id="051">51</span> And he shall take the
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md), and the
[hyssop](../ebd/ebd185.htm#007.md), and the
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md), and the living
[bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000.md), and dip them in the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) of the slain
[bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000.md), and in the running water, and sprinkle
the house [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times:  

<span id="052">52</span> And he shall cleanse the house with the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the [bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000.md), and
with the running water, and with the living
[bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000.md), and with the
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md), and with
the [hyssop](../ebd/ebd185.htm#007.md), and with the
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005.md):  

<span id="053">53</span> But he shall let go the living
[bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000.md) out of the city into the open fields, and
make an [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) for the house: and it shall
be [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md).  

<span id="054">54</span> This is the law for all manner of
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) of [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md), and
scall,  

<span id="055">55</span> And for the [leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md) of
a garment, and of a house,  

<span id="056">56</span> And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a
bright spot:  

<span id="057">57</span> To teach when it is unclean, and when it is
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005.md): this is the law of
[leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003.md).
