### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) reigned one year;
and when he had reigned two years over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),  

<span id="002">2</span> [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) chose him three
thousand men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); whereof two thousand
were with [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) in
[Michmash](../ebd/ebd253.htm#002) and in [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md), and a thousand were with
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) in [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008.md) of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md): and the rest of the people he sent
every man to his [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) smote the
[garrison](../ebd/ebd143.htm#007.md) of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) that was in
[Geba](../ebd/ebd144.htm#004.md), and the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) heard of it. And
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) blew the trumpet throughout all the land,
saying, Let the [Hebrews](../ebd/ebd171.htm#001.md) hear.  

<span id="004">4</span> And all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) heard
say that [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) had smitten a
[garrison](../ebd/ebd143.htm#007.md) of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), and that
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) also was had in
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md) with the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md). And the people were called
together after [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) to
[Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)
gathered themselves together to fight with
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), thirty thousand chariots, and six
thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in
multitude: and they came up, and pitched in
[Michmash](../ebd/ebd253.htm#002.md), eastward from Bethaven.  

<span id="006">6</span> When the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)
saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then
the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks,
and in high places, and in pits.  

<span id="007">7</span> And some of the [Hebrews](../ebd/ebd171.htm#001.md)
went over [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) to the land of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007) and [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md). As for
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), he was yet in
[Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md), and all the people followed him
trembling.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he tarried [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
days, according to the set time that [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) had
appointed: but [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) came not to
[Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md); and the people were scattered from
him.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said, Bring
hither a burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) to me, and peace
offerings. And he offered the burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And it came to pass, that as soon as he had
made an end of [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md), behold,
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) came; and [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md)
went out to meet him, that he might salute him.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) said, What
hast thou done? And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said, Because I saw
that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within
the days appointed, and that the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md)
gathered themselves together at [Michmash](../ebd/ebd253.htm#002.md);  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore said I, The
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) will come down now upon me to
[Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md), and I have not made supplication unto
the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) said to
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not
kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for
now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) for ever.  

<span id="014">14</span> But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the
LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath
commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept
that which the LORD commanded thee.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) arose, and
gat him up from [Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md) unto
[Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008) of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md).
And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) numbered the people that were present
with him, about six hundred men.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), and
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) his son, and the people that were
present with them, abode in [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008.md) of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md): but the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) encamped in
[Michmash](../ebd/ebd253.htm#002.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And the spoilers came out of the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md) of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) in three companies: one company
turned unto the way that leadeth to [Ophrah](../ebd/ebd279.htm#009.md),
unto the land of Shual:  

<span id="018">18</span> And another company turned the way to
Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that
looketh to the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) of
[Zeboim](../ebd/ebd388.htm#009.md) toward the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> Now there was no [smith](../ebd/ebd346.htm#006.md)
found throughout all the land of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): for
the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) said, Lest the
[Hebrews](../ebd/ebd171.htm#001.md) make them swords or spears:  

<span id="020">20</span> But all the Israelites went down to the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), to sharpen every man his share,
and his [coulter](../ebd/ebd091.htm#003.md), and his
[axe](../ebd/ebd037.htm#003.md), and his
[mattock](../ebd/ebd244.htm#007.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for
the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the
goads.  

<span id="022">22</span> So it came to pass in the day of battle, that
there was neither [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) nor spear found in the
hand of any of the people that were with [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md)
and [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md): but with
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) and with [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md)
his son was there found.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the [garrison](../ebd/ebd143.htm#007.md) of
the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) went out to the
[passage](../ebd/ebd286.htm#003) of [Michmash](../ebd/ebd253.htm#002.md).
