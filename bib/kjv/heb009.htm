</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For there was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A> made; the first, wherein was the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#001">candlestick</A>, and the table, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd336.htm#008">shewbread</A>; which is called the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And after the second <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#001">veil</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A> which is called the Holiest of all;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Which had the golden <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#002">censer</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> overlaid round about with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, wherein was the golden pot that had <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</A>, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And over it the cherubims of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A>, accomplishing the service of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But into the second went the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> alone once every year, not without <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A> was yet standing:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#008">carnal</A> ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> being come an high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A>, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Neither by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of goats and calves, but by his own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#009">redemption</A> for us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For if the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of bulls and of goats, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</A> of an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#006">heifer</A> sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;How much more shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, who through the eternal <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> offered himself without spot to God, purge your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</A> from dead works to serve the living God?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And for this cause he is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd246.htm#002">mediator</A> of the new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</A>, that by means of death, for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#009">redemption</A> of the transgressions that were under the first <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</A>, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For where a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</A> is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</A> is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Whereupon neither the first <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</A> was dedicated without <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of calves and of goats, with water, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#005">wool</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd185.htm#007">hyssop</A>, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Saying, This is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</A> which God hath enjoined unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Moreover he sprinkled with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> both the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A>, and all the vessels of the ministry.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And almost all things are by the law purged with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>; and without shedding of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> is no remission.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> entereth into the holy place every year with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of others;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> of himself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>.<BR>
