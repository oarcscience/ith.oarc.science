### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> Thou shalt not see thy brother's
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) or his [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) go
astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them
again unto thy brother.  

<span id="002">2</span> And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if
thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it
shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt
restore it to him again.  

<span id="003">3</span> In like manner shalt thou do with his
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md); and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and
with all lost thing of thy brother's, which he hath lost, and thou hast
found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself.  

<span id="004">4</span> Thou shalt not see thy brother's
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001) or his [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007.md) fall
down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him
to lift them up again.  

<span id="005">5</span> The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth
unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that
do so are [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md) unto the LORD thy God.  

<span id="006">6</span> If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the
way in any tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs,
and the dam [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md) upon the young, or upon the
eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young:  

<span id="007">7</span> But thou shalt in any
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) let the dam go, and take the young to
thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy
days.  

<span id="008">8</span> When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt
make a [battlement](../ebd/ebd048.htm#000.md) for thy roof, that thou bring
not [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md) upon thine house, if any man fall
from thence.  

<span id="009">9</span> Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers
seeds: lest the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of thy seed which thou
hast sown, and the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of thy vineyard, be
defiled.  

<span id="010">10</span> Thou shalt not plow with an
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) and an [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md)
together.  

<span id="011">11</span> Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts,
as of woollen and [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md) together.  

<span id="012">12</span> Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four
quarters of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.  

<span id="013">13</span> If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and
hate her,  

<span id="014">14</span> And give occasions of speech against her, and
bring up an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I
came to her, I found her not a maid:  

<span id="015">15</span> Then shall the father of the damsel, and her
mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto
the elders of the city in the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md):  

<span id="016">16</span> And the damsel's father shall say unto the
elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;  

<span id="017">17</span> And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech
against her, saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these are
the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the cloth
before the elders of the city.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the elders of that city shall take that man
and chastise him;  

<span id="019">19</span> And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels
of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and give them unto the father of the
damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a
[virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and
she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.  

<span id="020">20</span> But if this thing be true, and the tokens of
virginity be not found for the damsel:  

<span id="021">21</span> Then they shall bring out the damsel to the
door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) her with stones that she die: because she
hath wrought folly in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), to play the whore
in her father's house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you.  

<span id="022">22</span> If a man be found lying with a woman married to
an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with
the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> If a damsel that is a
[virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009.md) be betrothed unto an husband, and a man
find her in the city, and lie with her;  

<span id="024">24</span> Then ye shall bring them both out unto the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) of that city, and ye shall
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md) them with stones that they die; the
damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because
he hath humbled his neighbour's wife: so thou shalt put away evil from
among you.  

<span id="025">25</span> But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the
field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that
lay with her shall die.  

<span id="026">26</span> But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing;
there is in the damsel no [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) worthy of death:
for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so
is this matter:  

<span id="027">27</span> For he found her in the field, and the
betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her.  

<span id="028">28</span> If a man find a damsel that is a
[virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009.md), which is not betrothed, and lay hold on
her, and lie with her, and they be found;  

<span id="029">29</span> Then the man that lay with her shall give unto
the damsel's father fifty shekels of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md),
and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put
her away all his days.  

<span id="030">30</span> A man shall not take his father's wife, nor
discover his father's skirt.
