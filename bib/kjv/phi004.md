### King James Version: Philippians Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed
for, my joy and [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md), so stand
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004.md) in the Lord, my dearly beloved.  

<span id="002">2</span> I beseech [Euodias](../ebd/ebd127.htm#000.md), and
beseech [Syntyche](../ebd/ebd355.htm#000.md), that they be of the same mind
in the Lord.  

<span id="003">3</span> And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help
those women which laboured with me in the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003), with [Clement](../ebd/ebd084.htm#006.md)
also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of
life.  

<span id="004">4</span> Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say,
Rejoice.  

<span id="005">5</span> Let your moderation be known unto all men. The
Lord is at hand.  

<span id="006">6</span> Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) and supplication with thanksgiving let
your requests be made known unto God.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the peace of God, which passeth all
understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true,
whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of
good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think
on these things.  

<span id="009">9</span> Those things, which ye have both learned, and
received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be
with you.  

<span id="010">10</span> But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at
the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also
careful, but ye lacked opportunity.  

<span id="011">11</span> Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have
learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.  

<span id="012">12</span> I know both how to be abased, and I know how to
abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full
and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.  

<span id="013">13</span> I can do all things through
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) which strengtheneth me.  

<span id="014">14</span> Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did
communicate with my affliction.  

<span id="015">15</span> Now ye Philippians know also, that in the
beginning of the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md), when I departed from
[Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003.md), no church communicated with me as
concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.  

<span id="016">16</span> For even in
[Thessalonica](../ebd/ebd364.htm#000.md) ye sent once and again unto my
necessity.  

<span id="017">17</span> Not because I desire a
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005.md): but I desire
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) that may abound to your account.  

<span id="018">18</span> But I have all, and abound: I am full, having
received of [Epaphroditus](../ebd/ebd122.htm#001.md) the things which were
sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) acceptable, wellpleasing to God.  

<span id="019">19</span> But my God shall supply all your need according
to his riches in [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) by
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> Now unto God and our Father be
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) for ever and ever.
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> Salute every saint in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md). The
brethren which are with me greet you.  

<span id="022">22</span> All the saints salute you, chiefly they that
are of Caesar's household.  

<span id="023">23</span> The [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) be with
you all. [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001.md).
