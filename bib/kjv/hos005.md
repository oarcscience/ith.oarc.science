### King James Version: Hosea Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and give ye
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004), O house of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001); for judgment is toward you, because ye
have been a [snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009) on
[Mizpah](../ebd/ebd258.htm#000), and a [net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002)
spread upon [Tabor](../ebd/ebd356.htm#007).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the revolters are profound to make
slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all.  

<span id="003">3</span> I know [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000), and
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) is not hid from me: for now, O
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000), thou committest whoredom, and
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) is defiled.  

<span id="004">4</span> They will not frame their doings to turn unto
their God: for the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of whoredoms is in
the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the pride of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
doth testify to his face: therefore shall
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000)
fall in their iniquity: [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) also shall fall
with them.  

<span id="006">6</span> They shall go with their flocks and with their
herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn
himself from them.  

<span id="007">7</span> They have dealt treacherously against the LORD:
for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them
with their portions.  

<span id="008">8</span> Blow ye the [cornet](../ebd/ebd090.htm#009) in
[Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008), and the trumpet in
[Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005): cry aloud at Bethaven, after thee, O
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008).  

<span id="009">9</span> [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) shall be
desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) have I made known that which shall
surely be.  

<span id="010">10</span> The princes of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)
were like them that remove the bound: therefore I will pour out my wrath
upon them like water.  

<span id="011">11</span> [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) is oppressed
and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the
commandment.  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore will I be unto
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) as a [moth](../ebd/ebd260.htm#005), and
to the house of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) as rottenness.  

<span id="013">13</span> When [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) saw his
sickness, and [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) saw his wound, then went
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) to the Assyrian, and sent to
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure
you of your wound.  

<span id="014">14</span> For I will be unto
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) as a lion, and as a young lion to the
house of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007): I, even I, will tear and go
away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him.  

<span id="015">15</span> I will go and return to my place, till they
acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they
will seek me early.
