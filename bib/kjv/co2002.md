### King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> But I determined this with myself, that I would
not come again to you in heaviness.  

<span id="002">2</span> For if I make you sorry, who is he then that
maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?  

<span id="003">3</span> And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I
came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having
confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.  

<span id="004">4</span> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart
I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but
that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.  

<span id="005">5</span> But if any have caused grief, he hath not
grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.  

<span id="006">6</span> Sufficient to such a man is this
[punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005.md), which was inflicted of many.  

<span id="007">7</span> So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive
him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up
with overmuch sorrow.  

<span id="008">8</span> Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm
your love toward him.  

<span id="009">9</span> For to this end also did I write, that I might
know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.  

<span id="010">10</span> To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also:
for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave
I it in the person of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md);  

<span id="011">11</span> Lest [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md) should get
an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.  

<span id="012">12</span> Furthermore, when I came to
[Troas](../ebd/ebd372.htm#008.md) to preach Christ's
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003.md), and a door was opened unto me of the
Lord,  

<span id="013">13</span> I had no rest in my
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md), because I found not
[Titus](../ebd/ebd368.htm#007.md) my brother: but taking my leave of them,
I went from thence into [Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us
to triumph in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), and maketh manifest the
savour of his knowledge by us in every place.  

<span id="015">15</span> For we are unto God a sweet savour of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), in them that are saved, and in them
that perish:  

<span id="016">16</span> To the one we are the savour of death unto
death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is
sufficient for these things?  

<span id="017">17</span> For we are not as many, which corrupt the word
of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we
in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).
