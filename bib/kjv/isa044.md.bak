### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 44

<span id="001">1</span> Yet now hear, O [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md)
my servant; and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), whom I have
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md):  

<span id="002">2</span> Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed
thee from the womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I
have [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty,
and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) upon thy seed, and my blessing upon
thine offspring:  

<span id="004">4</span> And they shall spring up as among the
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005), as [willows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#006.md) by
the water [courses](../ebd/ebd091.htm#006.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> One shall say, I am the LORD's; and another
shall call himself by the name of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md); and
another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD, and surname himself
by the name of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> Thus saith the LORD the
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and
his [redeemer](../ebd/ebd308.htm#008.md) the LORD of hosts; I am the first,
and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.  

<span id="007">7</span> And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it,
and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and
the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.  

<span id="008">8</span> Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told
thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is
there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.  

<span id="009">9</span> They that make a graven image are all of them
vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their
own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.  

<span id="010">10</span> Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image
that is profitable for nothing?  

<span id="011">11</span> Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and
the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let
them stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed
together.  

<span id="012">12</span> The [smith](../ebd/ebd346.htm#006.md) with the
tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and
worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his
strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint.  

<span id="013">13</span> The [carpenter](../ebd/ebd072.htm#009.md)
stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it
with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after
the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may
remain in the house.  

<span id="014">14</span> He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the
[cypress](../ebd/ebd095.htm#002) and the [oak](../ebd/ebd275.htm#009.md),
which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006.md): he planteth an
[ash](../ebd/ebd033.htm#005), and the [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) doth
nourish it.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will
take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md); yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth
it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.  

<span id="016">16</span> He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part
thereof he eateth [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md); he roasteth roast, and
is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, and saith,
[Aha](../ebd/ebd013.htm#001.md), I am warm, I have seen the fire:  

<span id="017">17</span> And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even
his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and
prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.  

<span id="018">18</span> They have not known nor understood: for he hath
shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they
cannot understand.  

<span id="019">19</span> And none considereth in his heart, neither is
there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in
the fire; yea, also I have baked [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) upon the
coals thereof; I have roasted [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), and eaten
it: and shall I make the residue thereof an
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003.md)? shall I fall down to the stock of
a tree?  

<span id="020">20</span> He feedeth on [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000.md): a
deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul,
nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?  

<span id="021">21</span> Remember these, O
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); for
thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), thou shalt not be forgotten of me.  

<span id="022">22</span> I have blotted out, as a thick
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md), thy transgressions, and, as a
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md), thy sins: return unto me; for I have
redeemed thee.  

<span id="023">23</span> Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it:
shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye
mountains, O [forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006.md), and every tree therein:
for the LORD hath redeemed [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and glorified
himself in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> Thus saith the LORD, thy
[redeemer](../ebd/ebd308.htm#008.md), and he that formed thee from the
womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the
heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself;  

<span id="025">25</span> That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and
maketh diviners mad; that turneth [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) men
backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;  

<span id="026">26</span> That confirmeth the word of his servant, and
performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the
cities of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), Ye shall be built, and I will
raise up the decayed places thereof:  

<span id="027">27</span> That saith to the
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md), Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:  

<span id="028">28</span> That saith of [Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006.md),
He is my [shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006.md), and shall perform all my
pleasure: even saying to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), Thou shalt
be built; and to the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), Thy foundation
shall be laid.
