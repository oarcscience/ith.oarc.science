### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 31

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the
third month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD
came unto me, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Son of man, speak unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and to his multitude; Whom art thou like
in thy greatness?  

<span id="003">3</span> Behold, the Assyrian was a
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007) in [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md) with
fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and
his top was among the thick boughs.  

<span id="004">4</span> The waters made him great, the
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) set him up on high with her rivers running
round about his plants, and sent her little rivers unto all the trees of
the field.  

<span id="005">5</span> Therefore his height was exalted above all the
trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches
became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.  

<span id="006">6</span> All the fowls of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md)
made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the
beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) dwelt all great nations.  

<span id="007">7</span> Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length
of his branches: for his root was by great waters.  

<span id="008">8</span> The cedars in the garden of God could not hide
him: the [fir](../ebd/ebd133.htm#005.md) trees were not like his boughs,
and the chestnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the
garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.  

<span id="009">9</span> I have made him fair by the multitude of his
branches: so that all the trees of [Eden](../ebd/ebd112.htm#009.md), that
were in the garden of God, envied him.  

<span id="010">10</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou
hast lifted up thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the
thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;  

<span id="011">11</span> I have therefore delivered him into the hand of
the mighty one of the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md); he shall surely
deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.  

<span id="012">12</span> And strangers, the terrible of the nations,
have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the
valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the
rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from
his [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md), and have left him.  

<span id="013">13</span> Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) remain, and all the beasts of the field
shall be upon his branches:  

<span id="014">14</span> To the end that none of all the trees by the
waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top
among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height,
all that [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) water: for they are all
delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of
the children of men, with them that go down to the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he
went down to the [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md) I caused a mourning: I
covered the [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008.md) for him, and I restrained the
floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001) to [mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004.md) for
him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.  

<span id="016">16</span> I made the nations to shake at the sound of his
fall, when I cast him down to [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md) with them
that descend into the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md): and all the trees of
[Eden](../ebd/ebd112.htm#009.md), the choice and best of
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md), all that
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) water, shall be comforted in the nether
parts of the earth.  

<span id="017">17</span> They also went down into
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003.md) with him unto them that be slain with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md); and they that were his arm, that dwelt
under his [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002.md) in the midst of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> To whom art thou thus like in
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) and in greatness among the trees of
[Eden](../ebd/ebd112.htm#009.md)? yet shalt thou be brought down with the
trees of [Eden](../ebd/ebd112.htm#009.md) unto the nether parts of the
earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that
be slain by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md). This is
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005.md) and all his multitude, saith the Lord
GOD.
