### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 124

<span id="001">1</span> If it had not been the LORD who was on our side,
now may [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) say;  

<span id="002">2</span> If it had not been the LORD who was on our side,
when men rose up against us:  

<span id="003">3</span> Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their
wrath was kindled against us:  

<span id="004">4</span> Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream
had gone over our soul:  

<span id="005">5</span> Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.  

<span id="006">6</span> Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a
prey to their teeth.  

<span id="007">7</span> Our soul is escaped as a
[bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000) out of the [snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009.md)
of the fowlers: the [snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009.md) is broken, and we are
escaped.  

<span id="008">8</span> Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) and earth.
