### King James Version: Ephesians Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear
children;  

<span id="002">2</span> And walk in love, as
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) also hath loved us, and hath given
himself for us an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) and a
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) to God for a sweetsmelling savour.  

<span id="003">3</span> But [fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008), and
all uncleanness, or [covetousness](../ebd/ebd092.htm#000), let it not be
once named among you, as becometh saints;  

<span id="004">4</span> Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor
jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.  

<span id="005">5</span> For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor
unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any
inheritance in the kingdom of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) and of
God.  

<span id="006">6</span> Let no man deceive you with vain words: for
because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of
disobedience.  

<span id="007">7</span> Be not ye therefore partakers with them.  

<span id="008">8</span> For ye were sometimes
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008), but now are ye light in the Lord:
walk as children of light:  

<span id="009">9</span> (For the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) is in all
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000) and
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) and truth;)  

<span id="010">10</span> Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.  

<span id="011">11</span> And have no [fellowship](../ebd/ebd132.htm#002)
with the unfruitful works of [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008), but
rather reprove them.  

<span id="012">12</span> For it is a shame even to speak of those things
which are done of them in secret.  

<span id="013">13</span> But all things that are reproved are made
manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.  

<span id="014">14</span> Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest,
and arise from the dead, and [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) shall give
thee light.  

<span id="015">15</span> See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as
fools, but as [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004),  

<span id="016">16</span> Redeeming the time, because the days are
evil.  

<span id="017">17</span> Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding
what the will of the Lord is.  

<span id="018">18</span> And be not [drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007) with
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), wherein is excess; but be filled with the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009);  

<span id="019">19</span> Speaking to yourselves in
[psalms](../ebd/ebd301.htm#005) and hymns and spiritual
[songs](../ebd/ebd348.htm#002), singing and making melody in your heart
to the Lord;  

<span id="020">20</span> Giving thanks always for all things unto God
and the Father in the name of our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000);  

<span id="021">21</span> Submitting yourselves one to another in the
fear of God.  

<span id="022">22</span> Wives, submit yourselves unto your own
husbands, as unto the Lord.  

<span id="023">23</span> For the husband is the head of the wife, even
as [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) is the head of the church: and he is
the [saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003) of the body.  

<span id="024">24</span> Therefore as the church is subject unto
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), so let the wives be to their own
husbands in every thing.  

<span id="025">25</span> Husbands, love your wives, even as
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) also loved the church, and gave himself
for it;  

<span id="026">26</span> That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[washing](../ebd/ebd379.htm#002) of water by the word,  

<span id="027">27</span> That he might present it to himself a glorious
church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it
should be holy and without [blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007).  

<span id="028">28</span> So ought men to love their wives as their own
bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.  

<span id="029">29</span> For no man ever yet hated his own
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007); but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even
as the Lord the church:  

<span id="030">30</span> For we are members of his body, of his
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), and of his bones.  

<span id="031">31</span> For this cause shall a man leave his father and
mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007).  

<span id="032">32</span> This is a great
[mystery](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006): but I speak concerning
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) and the church.  

<span id="033">33</span> Nevertheless let every one of you in particular
so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence
her husband.
