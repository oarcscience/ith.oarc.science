### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 25

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) in [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009.md), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and say unto them, When ye come into
the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) unto the LORD.  

<span id="003">3</span> Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six
years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) thereof;  

<span id="004">4</span> But in the seventh year shall be a
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) of rest unto the land, a
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow
thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.  

<span id="005">5</span> That which groweth of its own accord of thy
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008.md) thou shalt not reap, neither gather the
grapes of thy [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md) undressed: for it is a year
of rest unto the land.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) of the
land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy
maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) that sojourneth with thee.  

<span id="007">7</span> And for thy [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), and
for the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) that are in thy land, shall all
the increase thereof be meat.  

<span id="008">8</span> And thou shalt number
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) sabbaths of years unto thee,
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) times [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
years; and the space of the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) sabbaths of
years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile
to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004.md) shall ye make the trumpet sound
throughout all your land.  

<span id="010">10</span> And ye shall [hallow](../ebd/ebd160.htm#001.md)
the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all
the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall
return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto
his family.  

<span id="011">11</span> A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you:
ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor
gather the grapes in it of thy [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004.md)
undressed.  

<span id="012">12</span> For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto
you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.  

<span id="013">13</span> In the year of this jubile ye shall return
every man unto his possession.  

<span id="014">14</span> And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or
buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one
another:  

<span id="015">15</span> According to the number of years after the
jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of
years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:  

<span id="016">16</span> According to the multitude of years thou shalt
increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou
shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years
of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.  

<span id="017">17</span> Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but
thou shalt fear thy God:for I am the LORD your God.  

<span id="018">18</span> Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my
judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the land shall yield her
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md), and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell
therein in safety.  

<span id="020">20</span> And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the
seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:  

<span id="021">21</span> Then I will command my blessing upon you in the
sixth year, and it shall bring forth [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) for
three years.  

<span id="022">22</span> And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet
of old [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) until the ninth year; until her
fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store.  

<span id="023">23</span> The land shall not be sold for ever: for the
land is mine, for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.  

<span id="024">24</span> And in all the land of your possession ye shall
grant a [redemption](../ebd/ebd308.htm#009.md) for the land.  

<span id="025">25</span> If thy brother be waxen
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), and hath sold away some of his
possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he
redeem that which his brother sold.  

<span id="026">26</span> And if the man have none to redeem it, and
himself be able to redeem it;  

<span id="027">27</span> Then let him count the years of the sale
thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that
he may return unto his possession.  

<span id="028">28</span> But if he be not able to restore it to him,
then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought
it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he
shall return unto his possession.  

<span id="029">29</span> And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled
city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within
a full year may he redeem it.  

<span id="030">30</span> And if it be not redeemed within the space of a
full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be
established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations:
it shall not go out in the jubile.  

<span id="031">31</span> But the houses of the
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003.md) which have no wall round about them
shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and
they shall go out in the jubile.  

<span id="032">32</span> Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and
the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at
any time.  

<span id="033">33</span> And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the
house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the
year of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their
possession among the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="034">34</span> But the field of the
[suburbs](../ebd/ebd352.htm#007.md) of their cities may not be sold; for it
is their perpetual possession.  

<span id="035">35</span> And if thy brother be waxen
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), and fallen in decay with thee; then thou
shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md), or a sojourner; that he may live with
thee.  

<span id="036">36</span> Take thou no [usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006.md) of
him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with
thee.  

<span id="037">37</span> Thou shalt not give him thy money upon
[usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006.md), nor lend him thy victuals for
increase.  

<span id="038">38</span> I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth
out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), to give you the land
of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md), and to be your God.  

<span id="039">39</span> And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be
waxen [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), and be sold unto thee; thou shalt
not compel him to serve as a bondservant:  

<span id="040">40</span> But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he
shall be with thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.  

<span id="041">41</span> And then shall he depart from thee, both he and
his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto
the possession of his fathers shall he return.  

<span id="042">42</span> For they are my servants, which I brought forth
out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): they shall not be
sold as bondmen.  

<span id="043">43</span> Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but
shalt fear thy God.  

<span id="044">44</span> Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou
shalt have, shall be of the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) that are
round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.  

<span id="045">45</span> Moreover of the children of the strangers that
do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that
are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your
possession.  

<span id="046">46</span> And ye shall take them as an inheritance for
your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be
your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), ye shall not rule one over another with
rigour.  

<span id="047">47</span> And if a sojourner or
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) [wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000.md) rich by
thee, and thy brother that dwelleth by him [wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000.md)
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md), and sell himself unto the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md) or sojourner by thee, or to the stock
of the stranger's family:  

<span id="048">48</span> After that he is sold he may be redeemed again;
one of his brethren may redeem him:  

<span id="049">49</span> Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may
redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem
him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.  

<span id="050">50</span> And he shall reckon with him that bought him
from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the
price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according
to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.  

<span id="051">51</span> If there be yet many years behind, according
unto them he shall give again the price of his
[redemption](../ebd/ebd308.htm#009.md) out of the money that he was bought
for.  

<span id="052">52</span> And if there remain but few years unto the year
of jubile, then he shall count with him, and according unto his years
shall he give him again the price of his
[redemption](../ebd/ebd308.htm#009.md).  

<span id="053">53</span> And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with
him: and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.  

<span id="054">54</span> And if he be not redeemed in these years, then
he shall go out in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with
him.  

<span id="055">55</span> For unto me the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) are servants; they are my servants whom
I brought forth out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md): I am
the LORD your God.
