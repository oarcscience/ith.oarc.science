<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Philippians Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A>, so stand <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> in the Lord, my dearly beloved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;I beseech <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#000">Euodias</A>, and beseech <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#000">Syntyche</A>, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A>, with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#006">Clement</A> also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;I can do all things through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> which strengtheneth me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A>, when I departed from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</A>, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For even in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#000">Thessalonica</A> ye sent once and again unto my necessity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Not because I desire a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A>: but I desire <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> that may abound to your account.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#001">Epaphroditus</A> the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> acceptable, wellpleasing to God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Now unto God and our Father be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> for ever and ever. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Salute every saint in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>. The brethren which are with me greet you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> of our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> be with you all. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</A>.<BR>
