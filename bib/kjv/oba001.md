### King James Version: Obadiah Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> The [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md) of
[Obadiah](../ebd/ebd276.htm#001.md). Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md); We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and
an [ambassador](../ebd/ebd019.htm#008.md) is sent among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md), Arise ye, and let us rise up against
her in battle.  

<span id="002">2</span> Behold, I have made thee small among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md): thou art greatly despised.  

<span id="003">3</span> The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee,
thou that dwellest in the clefts of the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md),
whose [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007.md) is high; that saith in his
heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?  

<span id="004">4</span> Though thou exalt thyself as the
[eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003.md), and though thou set thy nest among the
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md), thence will I bring thee down, saith the
LORD.  

<span id="005">5</span> If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night,
(how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough?
if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?  

<span id="006">6</span> How are the things of
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) searched out! how are his hidden things
sought up!  

<span id="007">7</span> All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee
even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived
thee, and prevailed against thee; that they eat thy
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) have laid a wound under thee: there is
none understanding in him.  

<span id="008">8</span> Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even
destroy the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) men out of
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md), and understanding out of the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) of [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md)?  

<span id="009">9</span> And thy mighty men, O
[Teman](../ebd/ebd361.htm#001.md), shall be dismayed, to the end that every
one of the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) of
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) may be cut off by slaughter.  

<span id="010">10</span> For thy violence against thy brother
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be
cut off for ever.  

<span id="011">11</span> In the day that thou stoodest on the other
side, in the day that the strangers carried away
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) his [forces](../ebd/ebd137.htm#000.md),
and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), even thou wast as one of them.  

<span id="012">12</span> But thou shouldest not have looked on the day
of thy brother in the day that he became a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009.md); neither shouldest thou have rejoiced
over the children of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) in the day of their
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md); neither shouldest thou have spoken
proudly in the day of distress.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou shouldest not have entered into the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) of my people in the day of their calamity;
yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of
their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of
their calamity;  

<span id="014">14</span> Neither shouldest thou have stood in the
crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest
thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of
distress.  

<span id="015">15</span> For the day of the LORD is near upon all the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md): as thou hast done, it shall be done
unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head.  

<span id="016">16</span> For as ye have [drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007.md)
upon my holy mountain, so shall all the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md)
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) continually, yea, they shall
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), and they shall
[swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009.md) down, and they shall be as though they
had not been.  

<span id="017">17</span> But upon [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md) shall be deliverance, and there shall be
[holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006.md); and the house of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) shall possess their possessions.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the house of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md)
shall be a fire, and the house of [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md) a
flame, and the house of [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md) for stubble, and
they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any
remaining of the house of [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md); for the LORD
hath spoken it.  

<span id="019">19</span> And they of the south shall possess the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) of [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md); and
they of the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002.md) the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md): and they shall possess the fields
of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), and the fields of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004): and [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md)
shall possess [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And the [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md) of
this [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) shall possess that of the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007.md), even unto
[Zarephath](../ebd/ebd387.htm#006.md); and the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md) of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), which is in
[Sepharad](../ebd/ebd327.htm#008.md), shall possess the cities of the
south.  

<span id="021">21</span> And saviours shall come up on
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md) to
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) of
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005.md); and the kingdom shall be the LORD's.
