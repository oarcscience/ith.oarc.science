### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> And there appeared a great wonder in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md); a woman clothed with the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), and the [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004.md)
under her feet, and upon her head a [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) of
twelve [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008.md):  

<span id="002">2</span> And she being with child cried, travailing in
[birth](../ebd/ebd059.htm#002.md), and pained to be delivered.  

<span id="003">3</span> And there appeared another wonder in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md); and behold a great red
[dragon](../ebd/ebd107.htm#000), having [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md)
heads and ten horns, and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) crowns upon his
heads.  

<span id="004">4</span> And his tail drew the third part of the
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and
did cast them to the earth: and the [dragon](../ebd/ebd107.htm#000.md)
stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour
her child as soon as it was born.  

<span id="005">5</span> And she brought forth a man child, who was to
rule all nations with a rod of [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md): and her
child was caught up unto God, and to his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And the woman fled into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), where she hath a place prepared of
God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and
threescore days.  

<span id="007">7</span> And there was war in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006): [Michael](../ebd/ebd252.htm#009.md) and
his angels fought against the [dragon](../ebd/ebd107.htm#000.md); and the
[dragon](../ebd/ebd107.htm#000.md) fought and his angels,  

<span id="008">8</span> And prevailed not; neither was their place found
any more in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And the great [dragon](../ebd/ebd107.htm#000.md)
was cast out, that old [serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009.md), called the
[Devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007), and [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000.md),
which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his
angels were cast out with him.  

<span id="010">10</span> And I heard a loud voice saying in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), Now is come
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md), and strength, and the kingdom of our
God, and the power of his [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md): for the
[accuser](../ebd/ebd006.htm#002.md) of our brethren is cast down, which
accused them before our God day and night.  

<span id="011">11</span> And they overcame him by the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the [Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003.md), and
by the word of their [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008.md); and they loved
not their lives unto the death.  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that
dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for
the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007.md) is come down unto you, having great
wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.  

<span id="013">13</span> And when the [dragon](../ebd/ebd107.htm#000.md)
saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which
brought forth the man child.  

<span id="014">14</span> And to the woman were given two wings of a
great [eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003.md), that she might
[fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004.md) into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), into her place, where she is
nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And the [serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009.md) cast
out of his mouth water as a [flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000.md) after the
woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> And the earth helped the woman, and the earth
opened her mouth, and swallowed up the [flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000.md)
which the [dragon](../ebd/ebd107.htm#000.md) cast out of his mouth.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the [dragon](../ebd/ebd107.htm#000.md) was
wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed,
which keep the commandments of God, and have the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).
