### King James Version: Luke Chapter 23

<span id="001">1</span> And the whole multitude of them arose, and led
him unto Pilate.  

<span id="002">2</span> And they began to accuse him, saying, We found
this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give
[tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006) to [Caesar](../ebd/ebd068.htm#002.md),
saying that he himself is [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) a
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of the Jews? And he answered him and said,
Thou sayest it.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the
people, I find no fault in this man.  

<span id="005">5</span> And they were the more fierce, saying, He
stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md) to this place.  

<span id="006">6</span> When Pilate heard of
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md), he asked whether the man were a
Galilaean.  

<span id="007">7</span> And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto
Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) at that time.  

<span id="008">8</span> And when Herod saw
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), he was exceeding glad: for he was
desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things
of him; and he hoped to have seen some [miracle](../ebd/ebd256.htm#002.md)
done by him.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then he questioned with him in many words; but
he answered him nothing.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the chief priests and
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003.md) stood and vehemently accused him.  

<span id="011">11</span> And Herod with his men of war set him at
nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him
again to Pilate.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the same day Pilate and Herod were made
friends together: for before they were at
[enmity](../ebd/ebd121.htm#003.md) between themselves.  

<span id="013">13</span> And Pilate, when he had called together the
chief priests and the rulers and the people,  

<span id="014">14</span> Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto
me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined
him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things
whereof ye accuse him:  

<span id="015">15</span> No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and,
lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.  

<span id="016">16</span> I will therefore chastise him, and release
him.  

<span id="017">17</span> (For of necessity he must release one unto them
at the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000)..md)  

<span id="018">18</span> And they cried out all at once, saying, Away
with this man, and release unto us [Barabbas](../ebd/ebd044.htm#002.md):  

<span id="019">19</span> (Who for a certain sedition made in the city,
and for [murder](../ebd/ebd262.htm#002.md), was cast into
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006)..md)  

<span id="020">20</span> Pilate therefore, willing to release
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), spake again to them.  

<span id="021">21</span> But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify
him.  

<span id="022">22</span> And he said unto them the third time, Why, what
evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will
therefore chastise him, and let him go.  

<span id="023">23</span> And they were instant with loud voices,
requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the
chief priests prevailed.  

<span id="024">24</span> And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as
they required.  

<span id="025">25</span> And he released unto them him that for sedition
and [murder](../ebd/ebd262.htm#002.md) was cast into
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006.md), whom they had desired; but he delivered
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) to their will.  

<span id="026">26</span> And as they led him away, they laid hold upon
one [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md), a Cyrenian, coming out of the
country, and on him they laid the [cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000.md), that
he might bear it after [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And there followed him a great company of
people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.  

<span id="028">28</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) turning unto
them said, Daughters of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), weep not for
me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.  

<span id="029">29</span> For, behold, the days are coming, in the which
they shall say, Blessed are the [barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007.md), and the
wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.  

<span id="030">30</span> Then shall they begin to say to the mountains,
Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.  

<span id="031">31</span> For if they do these things in a green tree,
what shall be done in the dry?  

<span id="032">32</span> And there were also two other, malefactors, led
with him to be put to death.  

<span id="033">33</span> And when they were come to the place, which is
called [Calvary](../ebd/ebd069.htm#009.md), there they crucified him, and
the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.  

<span id="034">34</span> Then said [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md),
Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted
his raiment, and cast lots.  

<span id="035">35</span> And the people stood beholding. And the rulers
also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save
himself, if he be [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), the
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) of God.  

<span id="036">36</span> And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to
him, and [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) him
[vinegar](../ebd/ebd377.htm#006.md),  

<span id="037">37</span> And saying, If thou be the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of the Jews, save thyself.  

<span id="038">38</span> And a superscription also was written over him
in letters of [Greek](../ebd/ebd155.htm#004.md), and
[Latin](../ebd/ebd224.htm#007), and [Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009.md),
THIS IS THE [KING](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) OF THE JEWS.  

<span id="039">39</span> And one of the malefactors which were hanged
railed on him, saying, If thou be [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), save
thyself and us.  

<span id="040">40</span> But the other answering rebuked him, saying,
Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?  

<span id="041">41</span> And we indeed justly; for we receive the due
reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.  

<span id="042">42</span> And he said unto
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), Lord, remember me when thou comest into
thy kingdom.  

<span id="043">43</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) said unto
him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in
[paradise](../ebd/ebd284.htm#004.md).  

<span id="044">44</span> And it was about the sixth hour, and there was
a [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md) over all the earth until the ninth
hour.  

<span id="045">45</span> And the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) was
darkened, and the [veil](../ebd/ebd377.htm#001.md) of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) was [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) in the
midst.  

<span id="046">46</span> And when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) had
cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md): and having said thus, he gave up the
[ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md).  

<span id="047">47</span> Now when the [centurion](../ebd/ebd075.htm#004.md)
saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a
righteous man.  

<span id="048">48</span> And all the people that came together to that
sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and
returned.  

<span id="049">49</span> And all his acquaintance, and the women that
followed him from [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md), stood afar off,
beholding these things.  

<span id="050">50</span> And, behold, there was a man named
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), a [counsellor](../ebd/ebd091.htm#005.md);
and he was a good man, and a just:  

<span id="051">51</span> (The same had not consented to the counsel and
deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also
himself waited for the kingdom of God.  

<span id="052">52</span> This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body
of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="053">53</span> And he took it down, and wrapped it in
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008.md), and laid it in a
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md) that was hewn in
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), wherein never man before was laid.  

<span id="054">54</span> And that day was the preparation, and the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) drew on.  

<span id="055">55</span> And the women also, which came with him from
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md), followed after, and beheld the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001.md), and how his body was laid.  

<span id="056">56</span> And they returned, and prepared
[spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005.md) and ointments; and rested the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003.md) day according to the commandment.
