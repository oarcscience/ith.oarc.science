### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 31

<span id="001">1</span> And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying,
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) hath taken away all that was our
father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) beheld the
countenance of [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md), and, behold, it was not
toward him as before.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the LORD said unto
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), Return unto the land of thy fathers, and
to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) sent and
called [Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) and [Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006.md)
to the field unto his flock,  

<span id="005">5</span> And said unto them, I see your father's
countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my
father hath been with me.  

<span id="006">6</span> And ye know that with all my power I have served
your father.  

<span id="007">7</span> And your father hath deceived me, and changed my
[wages](../ebd/ebd378.htm#004.md) ten times; but God suffered him not to
hurt me.  

<span id="008">8</span> If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy
[wages](../ebd/ebd378.htm#004.md); then all the
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) bare speckled: and if he said thus, The
ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) ringstraked.  

<span id="009">9</span> Thus God hath taken away the
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) of your father, and given them to me.  

<span id="010">10</span> And it came to pass at the time that the
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes,
and saw in a [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md), and, behold, the rams which
leaped upon the [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) were ringstraked,
speckled, and grisled.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of God
spake unto me in a [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md), saying,
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md): And I said, Here am I.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see,
all the rams which leap upon the [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) are
ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that
[Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md) doeth unto thee.  

<span id="013">13</span> I am the God of
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006.md), where thou anointedst the
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md), and where thou vowedst a vow unto me:
now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy
kindred.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004.md) and
[Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006.md) answered and said unto him, Is there yet
any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?  

<span id="015">15</span> Are we not counted of him strangers? for he
hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.  

<span id="016">16</span> For all the riches which God hath taken from
our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God
hath said unto thee, do.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) rose up,
and set his sons and his wives upon camels;  

<span id="018">18</span> And he carried away all his
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), and all his goods which he had gotten,
the [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) of his getting, which he had gotten
in Padanaram, for to go to [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md) his father in
the land of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md) went to
shear his [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md): and
[Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004.md) had stolen the images that were her
father's.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) stole away
unawares to [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md) the Syrian, in that he told
him not that he fled.  

<span id="021">21</span> So he fled with all that he had; and he rose
up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And it was told [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md)
on the third day that [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) was fled.  

<span id="023">23</span> And he took his brethren with him, and pursued
after him [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days'
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md); and they overtook him in the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And God came to [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md)
the Syrian in a [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md) by night, and said unto
him, Take heed that thou speak not to [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md)
either good or bad.  

<span id="025">25</span> Then [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md) overtook
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007). Now [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) had
pitched his [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) in the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007): and [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md) with
his brethren pitched in the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md) of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md) said to
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), What hast thou done, that thou hast
stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives
taken with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md)?  

<span id="027">27</span> Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and
steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee
away with mirth, and with [songs](../ebd/ebd348.htm#002.md), with
[tabret](../ebd/ebd356.htm#009.md), and with
[harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001.md)?  

<span id="028">28</span> And hast not suffered me to
[kiss](../ebd/ebd221.htm#000.md) my sons and my daughters? thou hast now
done foolishly in so doing.  

<span id="029">29</span> It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt:
but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou
heed that thou speak not to [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) either good
or bad.  

<span id="030">30</span> And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone,
because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast
thou stolen my gods?  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) answered and
said to [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md), Because I was afraid: for I
said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.  

<span id="032">32</span> With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him
not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and
take it to thee. For [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) knew not that
[Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004.md) had stolen them.  

<span id="033">33</span> And [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md) went into
Jacob's [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md), and into Leah's
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md), and into the two maidservants' tents; but
he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md), and entered into Rachel's
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md).  

<span id="034">34</span> Now [Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004.md) had taken
the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them.
And [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md) searched all the
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md), but found them not.  

<span id="035">35</span> And she said to her father, Let it not
displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the
[custom](../ebd/ebd094.htm#008.md) of women is upon me. And he searched but
found not the images.  

<span id="036">36</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) was wroth,
and chode with [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md): and
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) answered and said to
[Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md), What is my trespass? what is my
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), that thou hast so hotly pursued after
me?  

<span id="037">37</span> Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what
hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my
brethren and thy brethren, that they may [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md)
betwixt us both.  

<span id="038">38</span> This twenty years have I been with thee; thy
ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy
flock have I not eaten.  

<span id="039">39</span> That which was torn of beasts I brought not
unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it,
whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.  

<span id="040">40</span> Thus I was; in the day the
[drought](../ebd/ebd108.htm#005.md) consumed me, and the
[frost](../ebd/ebd138.htm#009.md) by night; and my sleep departed from mine
eyes.  

<span id="041">41</span> Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I
served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md): and thou hast changed my
[wages](../ebd/ebd378.htm#004.md) ten times.  

<span id="042">42</span> Except the God of my father, the God of
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), and the fear of
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md), had been with me, surely thou hadst sent
me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my
hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.  

<span id="043">43</span> And [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md) answered and
said unto [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), These daughters are my
daughters, and these children are my children, and these
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) are my [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md),
and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these
my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?  

<span id="044">44</span> Now therefore come thou, let us make a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md), I and thou; and let it be for a
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) between me and thee.  

<span id="045">45</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) took a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), and set it up for a
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md).  

<span id="046">46</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) said unto
his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an
[heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md): and they did eat there upon the
[heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md).  

<span id="047">47</span> And [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md) called it
Jegarsahadutha: but [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) called it
[Galeed](../ebd/ebd142.htm#001.md).  

<span id="048">48</span> And [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md) said, This
[heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000) is a [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md)
between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called
[Galeed](../ebd/ebd142.htm#001.md);  

<span id="049">49</span> And [Mizpah](../ebd/ebd258.htm#000.md); for he
said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from
another.  

<span id="050">50</span> If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou
shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God
is [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md) betwixt me and thee.  

<span id="051">51</span> And [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md) said to
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), Behold this
[heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md), and behold this
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md), which I have cast betwixt me and
thee:  

<span id="052">52</span> This [heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md) be
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md), and this
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007) be [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008.md),
that I will not pass over this [heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md) to thee,
and that thou shalt not pass over this [heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md) and
this [pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007.md) unto me, for harm.  

<span id="053">53</span> The God of [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md),
and the God of [Nahor](../ebd/ebd265.htm#006.md), the God of their father,
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) betwixt us. And
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) sware by the fear of his father
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006.md).  

<span id="054">54</span> Then [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) offered
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) upon the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md), and called his brethren to eat
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md): and they did eat
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md), and tarried all night in the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md).  

<span id="055">55</span> And early in the morning
[Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md) rose up, and kissed his sons and his
daughters, and blessed them: and [Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008.md)
departed, and returned unto his place.
