### King James Version: John Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> These words spake
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), and lifted up his eyes to
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and said, Father, the hour is come;
[glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005.md) thy Son, that thy Son also may
[glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005.md) thee:  

<span id="002">2</span> As thou hast given him power over all
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md), that he should give eternal life to as
many as thou hast given him.  

<span id="003">3</span> And this is life eternal, that they might know
thee the only true God, and [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md), whom thou hast sent.  

<span id="004">4</span> I have glorified thee on the earth: I have
finished the work which thou gavest me to do.  

<span id="005">5</span> And now, O Father,
[glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005.md) thou me with thine own self with the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) which I had with thee before the world
was.  

<span id="006">6</span> I have manifested thy name unto the men which
thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them
me; and they have kept thy word.  

<span id="007">7</span> Now they have known that all things whatsoever
thou hast given me are of thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> For I have given unto them the words which thou
gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I
came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.  

<span id="009">9</span> I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but
for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.  

<span id="010">10</span> And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and
I am glorified in them.  

<span id="011">11</span> And now I am no more in the world, but these
are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine
own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we
are.  

<span id="012">12</span> While I was with them in the world, I kept them
in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is
lost, but the son of perdition; that the
[scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005.md) might be fulfilled.  

<span id="013">13</span> And now come I to thee; and these things I
speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in
themselves.  

<span id="014">14</span> I have given them thy word; and the world hath
hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the
world.  

<span id="015">15</span> I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of
the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.  

<span id="016">16</span> They are not of the world, even as I am not of
the world.  

<span id="017">17</span> Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is
truth.  

<span id="018">18</span> As thou hast sent me into the world, even so
have I also sent them into the world.  

<span id="019">19</span> And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that
they also might be sanctified through the truth.  

<span id="020">20</span> Neither pray I for these alone, but for them
also which shall believe on me through their word;  

<span id="021">21</span> That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art
in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world
may believe that thou hast sent me.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) which
thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are
one:  

<span id="023">23</span> I in them, and thou in me, that they may be
made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me,
and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.  

<span id="024">24</span> Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast
given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), which thou hast given me: for thou
lovedst me before the foundation of the world.  

<span id="025">25</span> O righteous Father, the world hath not known
thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent
me.  

<span id="026">26</span> And I have declared unto them thy name, and
will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in
them, and I in them.
