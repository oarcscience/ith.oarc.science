### King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> Now in the eighteenth year of
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) the son
of [Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003.md) reigned
[Abijam](../ebd/ebd003.htm#007) over [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> Three years reigned he in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md). and his mother's name was
[Maachah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#004.md), the daughter of Abishalom.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he walked in all the sins of his father,
which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the
LORD his God, as the heart of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) his
father.  

<span id="004">4</span> Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his
God give him a [lamp](../ebd/ebd223.htm#007.md) in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), to set up his son after him, and to
establish [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md):  

<span id="005">5</span> Because [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) did that
which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any
thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the
matter of [Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002.md) the Hittite.  

<span id="006">6</span> And there was war between
[Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007) and [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md)
all the days of his life.  

<span id="007">7</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Abijam](../ebd/ebd003.htm#007.md), and all that he did, are they not
written in the book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003.md) of the
kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)? And there was war between
[Abijam](../ebd/ebd003.htm#007) and [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Abijam](../ebd/ebd003.htm#007.md) slept with
his fathers; and they buried him in the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004): and [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md) his son
reigned in his stead.  

<span id="009">9</span> And in the twentieth year of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) reigned [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md)
over [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And forty and one years reigned he in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md). And his mother's name was
[Maachah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#004.md), the daughter of Abishalom.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md) did that which
was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
his father.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he took away the
[sodomites](../ebd/ebd347.htm#006.md) out of the land, and removed all the
idols that his fathers had made.  

<span id="013">13</span> And also [Maachah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#004.md) his
mother, even her he removed from being [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007.md),
because she had made an [idol](../ebd/ebd186.htm#006.md) in a
[grove](../ebd/ebd155.htm#008); and [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md)
destroyed her [idol](../ebd/ebd186.htm#006.md), and burnt it by the
[brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006) [Kidron](../ebd/ebd218.htm#008.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> But the high places were not removed:
nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the LORD all his days.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he brought in the things which his father
had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the
house of the LORD, [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and vessels.  

<span id="016">16</span> And there was war between
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000) and [Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) all
their days.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) went up
against [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and built
[Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005.md), that he might not suffer any to go out
or come in to [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> Then [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md) took all the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md)
that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the
treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his
servants: and [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md)
sent them to Benhadad, the son of [Tabrimon](../ebd/ebd357.htm#000.md), the
son of [Hezion](../ebd/ebd177.htm#004), [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002.md), that dwelt at
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md), saying,  

<span id="019">19</span> There is a [league](../ebd/ebd225.htm#005.md)
between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, I
have sent unto thee a present of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md) and
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md); come and break thy
[league](../ebd/ebd225.htm#005) with [Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), that
he may depart from me.  

<span id="020">20</span> So Benhadad hearkened unto
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md), and sent the
captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and smote
[Ijon](../ebd/ebd187.htm#002), and [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009.md), and
Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of
[Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006.md).  

<span id="021">21</span> And it came to pass, when
[Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md) heard thereof, that he left off building
of [Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005.md), and dwelt in Tirzah.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md) made a proclamation throughout all
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md); none was exempted: and they took away
the stones of [Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005.md), and the timber thereof,
wherewith [Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md) had builded; and
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md) built with
them [Geba](../ebd/ebd144.htm#004) of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008.md),
and [Mizpah](../ebd/ebd258.htm#000.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> The rest of all the acts of
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md), and all his might, and all that he did,
and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the
[chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003.md) of the kings of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md)? Nevertheless in the time of his old age
he was diseased in his feet.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000.md) slept with his
fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) his father: and
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md) his son reigned in his stead.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Nadab](../ebd/ebd264.htm#008.md) the son of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) began to reign over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) in the second year of
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and reigned over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) two years.  

<span id="026">26</span> And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and
walked in the way of his father, and in his [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md)
wherewith he made [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) to
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md) the son of
[Ahijah](../ebd/ebd014.htm#000.md), of the house of
[Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002.md), conspired against him; and
[Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md) smote him at
[Gibbethon](../ebd/ebd147.htm#007.md), which belonged to the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002); for [Nadab](../ebd/ebd264.htm#008.md)
and all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) laid siege to
[Gibbethon](../ebd/ebd147.htm#007.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> Even in the third year of
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) did [Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md) slay
him, and reigned in his stead.  

<span id="029">29</span> And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he
smote all the house of [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md); he left not to
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) any that breathed, until he had
destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by
his servant [Ahijah](../ebd/ebd014.htm#000.md) the
[Shilonite](../ebd/ebd337.htm#009.md):  

<span id="030">30</span> Because of the sins of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) which he sinned, and which he made
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), by his
provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Nadab](../ebd/ebd264.htm#008.md), and all that he did, are they not
written in the book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003.md) of the
kings of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="032">32</span> And there was war between
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000) and [Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) all
their days.  

<span id="033">33</span> In the third year of
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) began [Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008.md) the
son of [Ahijah](../ebd/ebd014.htm#000.md) to reign over all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) in Tirzah, twenty and four years.  

<span id="034">34</span> And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and
walked in the way of [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md), and in his
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) wherewith he made
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).
