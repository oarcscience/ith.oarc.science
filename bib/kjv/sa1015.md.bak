### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) also said unto
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), The LORD sent me to
[anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008) thee to be [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
over his people, over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): now therefore
hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.  

<span id="002">2</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that
which [Amalek](../ebd/ebd018.htm#009.md) did to
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), how he laid wait for him in the way,
when he came up from [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> Now go and smite
[Amalek](../ebd/ebd018.htm#009.md), and utterly destroy all that they have,
and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling,
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) and [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md),
[camel](../ebd/ebd070.htm#000) and [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) gathered the
people together, and numbered them in [Telaim](../ebd/ebd360.htm#005.md),
two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) came to a city
of [Amalek](../ebd/ebd018.htm#009.md), and laid wait in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said unto the
[Kenites](../ebd/ebd217.htm#004.md), Go, depart, get you down from among
the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to
all the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), when they came up
out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md). So the
[Kenites](../ebd/ebd217.htm#004.md) departed from among the Amalekites.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) smote the
Amalekites from [Havilah](../ebd/ebd167.htm#009.md) until thou comest to
[Shur](../ebd/ebd342.htm#002.md), that is over against
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And he took [Agag](../ebd/ebd011.htm#008.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of the Amalekites alive, and utterly
destroyed all the people with the edge of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> But [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) and the people
spared [Agag](../ebd/ebd011.htm#008.md), and the best of the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), and of the oxen, and of the fatlings,
and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy
them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed
utterly.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then came the word of the LORD unto
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md), saying,  

<span id="011">11</span> It repenteth me that I have set up
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) to be [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md): for
he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my
commandments. And it grieved [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md); and he
cried unto the LORD all night.  

<span id="012">12</span> And when [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) rose
early to meet [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) in the morning, it was told
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001), saying, [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md)
came to [Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006.md), and, behold, he set him up a
place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to
[Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) came to
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002): and [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said
unto him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment
of the LORD.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) said, What
meaneth then this bleating of the [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) in mine
ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said, They
have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of
the [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) and of the oxen, to
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) unto the LORD thy God; and the rest
we have utterly destroyed.  

<span id="016">16</span> Then [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) said unto
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD
hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) said, When
thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the
tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and the LORD anointed thee
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md)?  

<span id="018">18</span> And the LORD sent thee on a
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md), and said, Go and utterly destroy the
sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.  

<span id="019">19</span> Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of
the LORD, but didst [fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004.md) upon the spoil, and
didst evil in the sight of the LORD?  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said unto
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md), Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the
LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought
[Agag](../ebd/ebd011.htm#008) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Amalek](../ebd/ebd018.htm#009.md), and have utterly destroyed the
Amalekites.  

<span id="021">21</span> But the people took of the spoil,
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) and oxen, the chief of the things which
should have been utterly destroyed, to
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) unto the LORD thy God in
[Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) said, Hath
the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in
obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md), and to hearken than the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005.md) of rams.  

<span id="023">23</span> For rebellion is as the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) of [witchcraft](../ebd/ebd382.htm#007.md), and
stubbornness is as iniquity and [idolatry](../ebd/ebd186.htm#007.md).
Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected
thee from being [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said unto
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md), I have sinned: for I have transgressed
the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people,
and obeyed their voice.  

<span id="025">25</span> Now therefore, I pray thee,
[pardon](../ebd/ebd285.htm#001) my [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), and
turn again with me, that I may [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) the
LORD.  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) said unto
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), I will not return with thee: for thou
hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from
being [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> And as [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) turned
about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his
[mantle](../ebd/ebd240.htm#009), and it [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) said unto
him, The LORD hath [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) the kingdom of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) from thee this day, and hath given it to
a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou.  

<span id="029">29</span> And also the Strength of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) will not lie nor repent: for he is not a
man, that he should repent.  

<span id="030">30</span> Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now,
I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and turn again with me, that I may
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002.md) the LORD thy God.  

<span id="031">31</span> So [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) turned again
after [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002); and [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md)
worshipped the LORD.  

<span id="032">32</span> Then said [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md),
Bring ye hither to me [Agag](../ebd/ebd011.htm#008.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of the Amalekites. And
[Agag](../ebd/ebd011.htm#008.md) came unto him delicately. And
[Agag](../ebd/ebd011.htm#008.md) said, Surely the bitterness of death is
past.  

<span id="033">33</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) said, As
the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) hath made women childless, so shall
thy mother be childless among women. And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md)
hewed [Agag](../ebd/ebd011.htm#008) in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md)
before the LORD in [Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001.md).  

<span id="034">34</span> Then [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) went to
[Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005); and [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) went
up to his house to [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008.md) of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md).  

<span id="035">35</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) came no
more to see [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) until the day of his death:
nevertheless [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001.md) mourned for
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md): and the LORD repented that he had made
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).
