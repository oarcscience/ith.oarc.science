### King James Version: Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul
loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.  

<span id="002">2</span> I will rise now, and go about the city in the
streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I
sought him, but I found him not.  

<span id="003">3</span> The watchmen that go about the city found me: to
whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?  

<span id="004">4</span> It was but a little that I passed from them, but
I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go,
until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md) of her that conceived me.  

<span id="005">5</span> I charge you, O ye daughters of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), by the roes, and by the hinds of the
field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.  

<span id="006">6</span> Who is this that cometh out of the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) like pillars of smoke, perfumed with
[myrrh](../ebd/ebd263.htm#003.md) and
[frankincense](../ebd/ebd138.htm#004.md), with all powders of the
[merchant](../ebd/ebd249.htm#003.md)?  

<span id="007">7</span> Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore
valiant men are about it, of the valiant of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> They all hold swords, being expert in war: every
man hath his [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) upon his thigh because of
fear in the night.  

<span id="009">9</span> [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) made himself a
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) of the [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) of
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> He made the pillars thereof of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), the bottom thereof of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), the covering of it of purple, the midst
thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Go forth, O ye daughters of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), and behold [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) with the [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md)
wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the
day of the gladness of his heart.
