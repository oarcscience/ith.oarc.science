### King James Version: Acts Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), yet breathing
out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went
unto the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md),  

<span id="002">2</span> And desired of him letters to
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md) to the synagogues, that if he found
any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them
bound unto [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And as he journeyed, he came near
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md): and suddenly there shined round about
him a light from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md):  

<span id="004">4</span> And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice
saying unto him, [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md),
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), why persecutest thou me?  

<span id="005">5</span> And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord
said, I am [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) whom thou persecutest: it is
hard for thee to kick against the pricks.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what
wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into
the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the men which journeyed with him stood
speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) arose from the
earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by
the hand, and brought him into [Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And he was three days without sight, and neither
did eat nor [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And there was a certain
[disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003) at [Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md),
named [Ananias](../ebd/ebd023.htm#001.md); and to him said the Lord in a
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000), [Ananias](../ebd/ebd023.htm#001.md). And
he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into
the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of
[Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001.md) for one called
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), of [Tarsus](../ebd/ebd359.htm#003.md): for,
behold, he prayeth,  

<span id="012">12</span> And hath seen in a
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md) a man named
[Ananias](../ebd/ebd023.htm#001.md) coming in, and putting his hand on him,
that he might receive his sight.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then [Ananias](../ebd/ebd023.htm#001.md) answered,
Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to
thy saints at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md):  

<span id="014">14</span> And here he hath authority from the chief
priests to bind all that call on thy name.  

<span id="015">15</span> But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he
is a [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) vessel unto me, to bear my name
before the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001.md), and kings, and the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):  

<span id="016">16</span> For I will shew him how great things he must
suffer for my name's sake.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Ananias](../ebd/ebd023.htm#001.md) went his
way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said,
Brother [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), the Lord, even
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), that appeared unto thee in the way as
thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be
filled with the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And immediately there fell from his eyes as it
had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was
baptized.  

<span id="019">19</span> And when he had received meat, he was
strengthened. Then was [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) certain days with
the disciples which were at [Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> And straightway he preached
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) in the synagogues, that he is the Son of
God.  

<span id="021">21</span> But all that heard him were amazed, and said;
Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), and came hither for that intent,
that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?  

<span id="022">22</span> But [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) increased the
more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md), proving that this is very
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md).  

<span id="023">23</span> And after that many days were fulfilled, the
Jews took counsel to kill him:  

<span id="024">24</span> But their laying await was known of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md). And they watched the gates day and night
to kill him.  

<span id="025">25</span> Then the disciples took him by night, and let
him down by the wall in a [basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And when [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) was come
to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md), he assayed to join himself to the
disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was
a [disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003.md).  

<span id="027">27</span> But [Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005.md) took him,
and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen
the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had
preached boldly at [Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007.md) in the name of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md).  

<span id="028">28</span> And he was with them coming in and going out at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="029">29</span> And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md), and disputed against the
[Grecians](../ebd/ebd155.htm#002.md): but they went about to slay him.  

<span id="030">30</span> Which when the brethren knew, they brought him
down to [Caesarea](../ebd/ebd068.htm#003.md), and sent him forth to
[Tarsus](../ebd/ebd359.htm#003.md).  

<span id="031">31</span> Then had the churches rest throughout all
Judaea and [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md) and
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md), and were edified; and walking in the
fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005.md), were multiplied.  

<span id="032">32</span> And it came to pass, as
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) passed throughout all quarters, he came
down also to the saints which dwelt at [Lydda](../ebd/ebd233.htm#009.md).  

<span id="033">33</span> And there he found a certain man named Aeneas,
which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the
[palsy](../ebd/ebd283.htm#004.md).  

<span id="034">34</span> And [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) said unto
him, Aeneas, [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000.md) maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy
bed. And he arose immediately.  

<span id="035">35</span> And all that dwelt at
[Lydda](../ebd/ebd233.htm#009.md) and Saron saw him, and turned to the
Lord.  

<span id="036">36</span> Now there was at [Joppa](../ebd/ebd211.htm#002.md)
a certain [disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003.md) named
[Tabitha](../ebd/ebd356.htm#005.md), which by interpretation is called
[Dorcas](../ebd/ebd106.htm#004.md): this woman was full of good works and
almsdeeds which she did.  

<span id="037">37</span> And it came to pass in those days, that she was
sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md).  

<span id="038">38</span> And forasmuch as [Lydda](../ebd/ebd233.htm#009.md)
was nigh to [Joppa](../ebd/ebd211.htm#002.md), and the disciples had heard
that [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) was there, they sent unto him two
men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.  

<span id="039">39</span> Then [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) arose and
went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md): and all the
[widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003.md) stood by him weeping, and shewing the
coats and garments which [Dorcas](../ebd/ebd106.htm#004.md) made, while she
was with them.  

<span id="040">40</span> But [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md) put them all
forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said,
[Tabitha](../ebd/ebd356.htm#005.md), arise. And she opened her eyes: and
when she saw [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002.md), she sat up.  

<span id="041">41</span> And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up,
and when he had called the saints and [widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003.md),
presented her alive.  

<span id="042">42</span> And it was known throughout all
[Joppa](../ebd/ebd211.htm#002.md); and many believed in the Lord.  

<span id="043">43</span> And it came to pass, that he tarried many days
in [Joppa](../ebd/ebd211.htm#002.md) with one
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004.md) a tanner.
