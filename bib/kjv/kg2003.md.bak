### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Now [Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005.md) the son of
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md) began to reign over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md) the
eighteenth year of [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and
reigned twelve years.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD;
but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image
of [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md) that his father had made.  

<span id="003">3</span> Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000.md) the son of
[Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003.md), which made
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md); he
departed not therefrom.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Mesha](../ebd/ebd250.htm#006.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) was a
sheepmaster, and rendered unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) an hundred thousand lambs, and an
hundred thousand rams, with the [wool](../ebd/ebd383.htm#005.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> But it came to pass, when
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md) was dead, that the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) rebelled
against the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005.md) went out of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004.md) the same time, and numbered all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And he went and sent to
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), saying, The
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) hath
rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am
as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he
answered, The way through the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) of
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> So the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) went, and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md): and they
fetched a compass of [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) days'
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md): and there was no water for the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007.md), and for the
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) that followed them.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) said, Alas! that the LORD hath called
these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md)!  

<span id="011">11</span> But [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md) said,
Is there not here a [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) of the LORD, that
we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of Israel's servants answered and said,
Here is [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) the son of
[Shaphat](../ebd/ebd331.htm#005.md), which poured water on the hands of
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md) said,
The word of the LORD is with him. So the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) and
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md) and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md) went down
to him.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) said unto
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md),
What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and
to the prophets of thy mother. And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath
called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009.md) said, As
the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that
I regard the presence of [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006.md) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), I would
not look toward thee, nor see thee.  

<span id="015">15</span> But now bring me a
[minstrel](../ebd/ebd256.htm#000.md). And it came to pass, when the
[minstrel](../ebd/ebd256.htm#000.md) played, that the hand of the LORD came
upon him.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) full of ditches.  

<span id="017">17</span> For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind,
neither shall ye see [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md); yet that
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008.md) shall be filled with water, that ye may
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md), both ye, and your
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md), and your beasts.  

<span id="018">18</span> And this is but a light thing in the sight of
the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.  

<span id="019">19</span> And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every
choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of
water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.  

<span id="020">20</span> And it came to pass in the morning, when the
meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) was offered, that, behold, there
came water by the way of [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md), and the country
was filled with water.  

<span id="021">21</span> And when all the Moabites heard that the kings
were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to
put on [armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006.md), and upward, and stood in the
border.  

<span id="022">22</span> And they rose up early in the morning, and the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001.md) shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw
the water on the other side as red as [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md):  

<span id="023">23</span> And they said, This is
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md): the kings are surely slain, and they
have smitten one another: now therefore, [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md),
to the spoil.  

<span id="024">24</span> And when they came to the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), the
Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before
them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their
country.  

<span id="025">25</span> And they beat down the cities, and on every
good piece of land cast every man his [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md),
and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all
the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof;
howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.  

<span id="026">26</span> And when the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005.md) saw that the battle was too sore for him,
he took with him [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) hundred men that drew
swords, to break through even unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001.md): but they could not.  

<span id="027">27</span> Then he took his eldest son that should have
reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) upon the wall. And there was great
indignation against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): and they departed
from him, and returned to their own land.
