### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 103

<span id="001">1</span> [Bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) the LORD, O my
soul: and all that is within me, [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) his holy
name.  

<span id="002">2</span> [Bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) the LORD, O my
soul, and forget not all his benefits:  

<span id="003">3</span> Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth
all thy diseases;  

<span id="004">4</span> Who redeemeth thy life from
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md); who crowneth thee with
lovingkindness and tender mercies;  

<span id="005">5</span> Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so
that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.  

<span id="006">6</span> The LORD executeth
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) and judgment for all that are
oppressed.  

<span id="007">7</span> He made known his ways unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md), his acts unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md), and plenteous in
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> He will not always chide: neither will he keep
his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) for ever.  

<span id="010">10</span> He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor
rewarded us according to our iniquities.  

<span id="011">11</span> For as the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) is
high above the earth, so great is his [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md)
toward them that fear him.  

<span id="012">12</span> As far as the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) is
from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.  

<span id="013">13</span> Like as a father pitieth his children, so the
LORD pitieth them that fear him.  

<span id="014">14</span> For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that
we are [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> As for man, his days are as
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md): as a flower of the field, so he
flourisheth.  

<span id="016">16</span> For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone;
and the place thereof shall know it no more.  

<span id="017">17</span> But the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) of the
LORD is from [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) to
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) upon them that fear him, and his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) unto children's children;  

<span id="018">18</span> To such as keep his
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md), and to those that remember his
commandments to do them.  

<span id="019">19</span> The LORD hath prepared his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth
over all.  

<span id="020">20</span> [Bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) the LORD, ye his
angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening
unto the voice of his word.  

<span id="021">21</span> [Bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) ye the LORD, all
ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.  

<span id="022">22</span> [Bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md) the LORD, all
his works in all places of his dominion: [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008.md)
the LORD, O my soul.
