### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> The [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) shall joy in
thy strength, O LORD; and in thy [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md) how
greatly shall he rejoice!  

<span id="002">2</span> Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast
not withholden the request of his lips.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> For thou preventest him with the blessings of
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md): thou settest a
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of pure [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md) on
his head.  

<span id="004">4</span> He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him,
even length of days for ever and ever.  

<span id="005">5</span> His [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) is great in
thy [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md): honour and majesty hast thou
laid upon him.  

<span id="006">6</span> For thou hast made him most blessed for ever:
thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.  

<span id="007">7</span> For the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) trusteth
in the LORD, and through the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) of the most
High he shall not be moved.  

<span id="008">8</span> Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy
right hand shall find out those that hate thee.  

<span id="009">9</span> Thou shalt make them as a fiery
[oven](../ebd/ebd281.htm#005.md) in the time of thine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md): the LORD shall
[swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009.md) them up in his wrath, and the fire
shall devour them.  

<span id="010">10</span> Their [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) shalt thou
destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.  

<span id="011">11</span> For they intended evil against thee: they
imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back,
when thou shalt make ready thine [arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005.md) upon
thy strings against the face of them.  

<span id="013">13</span> Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength:
so will we sing and praise thy power.
