<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 7</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#004">apple</A> of thine eye.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A> which flattereth with her words.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For at the window of my house I looked through my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd073.htm#003">casement</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</A>, and subtil of heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;(She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;I have perfumed my bed with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#003">myrrh</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#004">aloes</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#004">cinnamon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;He hath taken a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#008">bag</A> of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;He goeth after her straightway, as an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Till a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#009">dart</A> strike through his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#004">liver</A>; as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#000">bird</A> hasteth to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</A>, and knoweth not that it is for his life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Her house is the way to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</A>, going down to the chambers of death.<BR>
