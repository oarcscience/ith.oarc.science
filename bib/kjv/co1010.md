### King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should
be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001), and all passed through the sea;  

<span id="002">2</span> And were all baptized unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) in the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) and
in the sea;  

<span id="003">3</span> And did all eat the same spiritual meat;  

<span id="004">4</span> And did all [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) the
same spiritual [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009): for they drank of that
spiritual [Rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) that followed them: and that
[Rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) was [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="005">5</span> But with many of them God was not well pleased:
for they were overthrown in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005).  

<span id="006">6</span> Now these things were our examples, to the
intent we should not [lust](../ebd/ebd233.htm#005) after evil things, as
they also lusted.  

<span id="007">7</span> Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them;
as it is written, The people sat down to eat and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), and rose up to play.  

<span id="008">8</span> Neither let us commit
[fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008), as some of them committed, and
fell in one day three and twenty thousand.  

<span id="009">9</span> Neither let us tempt
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), as some of them also tempted, and were
destroyed of serpents.  

<span id="010">10</span> Neither murmur ye, as some of them also
murmured, and were destroyed of the
[destroyer](../ebd/ebd102.htm#003).  

<span id="011">11</span> Now all these things happened unto them for
ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends
of the world are come.  

<span id="012">12</span> Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth
take heed lest he fall.  

<span id="013">13</span> There hath no
[temptation](../ebd/ebd361.htm#008) taken you but such as is common to
man: but God is [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005), who will not suffer
you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the
[temptation](../ebd/ebd361.htm#008) also make a way to escape, that ye
may be able to bear it.  

<span id="014">14</span> Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from
[idolatry](../ebd/ebd186.htm#007).  

<span id="015">15</span> I speak as to [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004)
men; [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) ye what I say.  

<span id="016">16</span> The [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) of blessing
which we [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008), is it not the
[communion](../ebd/ebd087.htm#004) of the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000)
of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)? The [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006)
which we break, is it not the [communion](../ebd/ebd087.htm#004) of the
body of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)?  

<span id="017">17</span> For we being many are one
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and one body: for we are all partakers
of that one [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006).  

<span id="018">18</span> Behold [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) after
the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007): are not they which eat of the
sacrifices partakers of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006)?  

<span id="019">19</span> What say I then? that the
[idol](../ebd/ebd186.htm#006) is any thing, or that which is offered in
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) to idols is any thing?  

<span id="020">20</span> But I say, that the things which the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002),
they [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) to devils, and not to God: and I
would not that ye should have [fellowship](../ebd/ebd132.htm#002) with
devils.  

<span id="021">21</span> Ye cannot [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) the
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) of the Lord, and the
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the
Lord's table, and of the table of devils.  

<span id="022">22</span> Do we provoke the Lord to
[jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008)? are we stronger than he?  

<span id="023">23</span> All things are lawful for me, but all things
are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify
not.  

<span id="024">24</span> Let no man seek his own, but every man
another's wealth.  

<span id="025">25</span> Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat,
asking no question for [conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006) sake:  

<span id="026">26</span> For the earth is the Lord's, and the
[fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007) thereof.  

<span id="027">27</span> If any of them that believe not bid you to a
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000), and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is
set before you, eat, asking no question for
[conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006) sake.  

<span id="028">28</span> But if any man say unto you, This is offered in
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) unto idols, eat not for his sake that
shewed it, and for [conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006) sake: for the
earth is the Lord's, and the [fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007) thereof:  

<span id="029">29</span> [Conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006), I say, not
thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another
man's [conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006)?  

<span id="030">30</span> For if I by [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) be a
partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?  

<span id="031">31</span> Whether therefore ye eat, or
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), or whatsoever ye do, do all to the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of God.  

<span id="032">32</span> Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to
the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001), nor to the church of God:  

<span id="033">33</span> Even as I please all men in all things, not
seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be
saved.
