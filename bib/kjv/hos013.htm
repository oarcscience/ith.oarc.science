<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and thou shalt know no god but me: for there is no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">saviour</A> beside me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;I did know thee in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, in the land of great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#005">drought</A>.<BR>
