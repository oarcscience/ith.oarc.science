<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 14</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then came certain of the elders of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> unto me, and sat before me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired of at all by them?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>; I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;That I may take the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Therefore say unto the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For every one of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, or of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A> that sojourneth in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> to enquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#002">proverb</A>, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And if the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And they shall bear the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</A> of their iniquity: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> shall be even as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</A> of him that seeketh unto him;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;That the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> thereof, and will send <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A> upon it, and will cut off man and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> from it:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Though these three men, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, saith the Lord GOD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Or if I bring a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> upon that land, and say, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">Sword</A>, go through the land; so that I cut off man and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> from it:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A> upon it in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, to cut off from it man and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>:<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>, and the noisome <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, even concerning all that I have brought upon it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.<BR>
