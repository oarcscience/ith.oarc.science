### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 52

<span id="001">1</span> Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty
man? the [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000.md) of God endureth
continually.  

<span id="002">2</span> The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp
[razor](../ebd/ebd307.htm#009.md), working deceitfully.  

<span id="003">3</span> Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying
rather than to speak [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md).
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou
deceitful tongue.  

<span id="005">5</span> God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he
shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root
thee out of the land of the living. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> The righteous also shall see, and fear, and
shall laugh at him:  

<span id="007">7</span> Lo, this is the man that made not God his
strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened
himself in his wickedness.  

<span id="008">8</span> But I am like a green
[olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009.md) tree in the house of God: I trust in the
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md) of God for ever and ever.  

<span id="009">9</span> I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast
done it: and I will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy
saints.
