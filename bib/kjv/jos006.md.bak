### King James Version: Joshua Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> Now [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md) was
straitly shut up because of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md): none went out, and none came in.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the LORD said unto
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md), See, I have given into thine hand
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008), and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
thereof, and the mighty men of valour.  

<span id="003">3</span> And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of
war, and go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) priests shall
bear before the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md)
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md) of
rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times, and the priests shall blow with
the [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And it shall come to pass, that when they make a
long blast with the ram's [horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003.md), and when ye
hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great
shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people
shall ascend up every man straight before him.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) the son of
[Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006.md) called the priests, and said unto them,
Take up the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md), and let
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) priests bear
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md) of
rams' horns before the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he said unto the people, Pass on, and
compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD.  

<span id="008">8</span> And it came to pass, when
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) had spoken unto the people, that the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) priests bearing the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md) of
rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001): and the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md)
of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of the LORD followed them.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the armed men went before the priests that
blew with the [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md), and the
[rereward](../ebd/ebd311.htm#004.md) came after the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md), the priests going on, and blowing with the
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) had
commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise
with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until
the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.  

<span id="011">11</span> So the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD
compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md), and lodged in the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) rose early
in the morning, and the priests took up the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md)
of the LORD.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) priests
bearing [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md)
of rams' horns before the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD went
on continually, and blew with the [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md): and
the armed men went before them; but the
[rereward](../ebd/ebd311.htm#004.md) came after the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000.md) of the LORD, the priests going on, and
blowing with the [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And the second day they compassed the city
once, and returned into the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md): so they did
six days.  

<span id="015">15</span> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that
they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city
after the same manner [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times: only on that
day they compassed the city [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005.md) times.  

<span id="016">16</span> And it came to pass at the seventh time, when
the priests blew with the [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md),
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) said unto the people, Shout; for the
LORD hath given you the city.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the city shall be accursed, even it, and
all that are therein, to the LORD: only [Rahab](../ebd/ebd305.htm#006.md)
the [harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005.md) shall live, she and all that are
with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.  

<span id="018">18</span> And ye, in any [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md)
keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves
accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) a
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003.md), and trouble it.  

<span id="019">19</span> But all the [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md),
and [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and vessels of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003) and [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md), are
consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the
[treasury](../ebd/ebd372.htm#000.md) of the LORD.  

<span id="020">20</span> So the people shouted when the priests blew
with the [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001.md): and it came to pass, when
the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a
great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up
into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.  

<span id="021">21</span> And they utterly destroyed all that was in the
city, both man and woman, young and old, and
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007), and [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), and
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001.md), with the edge of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md).  

<span id="022">22</span> But [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) had said
unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's
house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye
sware unto her.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the young men that were
[spies](../ebd/ebd349.htm#007.md) went in, and brought out
[Rahab](../ebd/ebd305.htm#006.md), and her father, and her mother, and her
brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred,
and left them without the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And they burnt the city with fire, and all that
was therein: only the [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000.md), and the
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001.md), and the vessels of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003) and of [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md),
they put into the [treasury](../ebd/ebd372.htm#000.md) of the house of the
LORD.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) saved
[Rahab](../ebd/ebd305.htm#006) the [harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005.md)
alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she
dwelleth in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) even unto this day; because
she hid the messengers, which [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) sent to
spy out [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md) adjured
them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that
riseth up and buildeth this city [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md): he
shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest
son shall he set up the gates of it.  

<span id="027">27</span> So the LORD was with
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006.md); and his fame was noised throughout all
the country.
