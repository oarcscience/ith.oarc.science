### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 104

<span id="001">1</span> [Bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) the LORD, O my
soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour
and majesty.  

<span id="002">2</span> Who coverest thyself with light as with a
garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a
[curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004):  

<span id="003">3</span> Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the
waters: who maketh the clouds his [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008): who
walketh upon the wings of the wind:  

<span id="004">4</span> Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a
flaming fire:  

<span id="005">5</span> Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it
should not be removed for ever.  

<span id="006">6</span> Thou coveredst it with the
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008) as with a garment: the waters stood above
the mountains.  

<span id="007">7</span> At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy
[thunder](../ebd/ebd365.htm#003) they hasted away.  

<span id="008">8</span> They go up by the mountains; they go down by the
valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.  

<span id="009">9</span> Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass
over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.  

<span id="010">10</span> He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which
run among the hills.  

<span id="011">11</span> They give [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) to
every [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) of the field: the wild asses quench
their thirst.  

<span id="012">12</span> By them shall the fowls of the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) have their
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007), which sing among the branches.  

<span id="013">13</span> He watereth the hills from his chambers: the
earth is satisfied with the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of thy
works.  

<span id="014">14</span> He causeth the [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005)
to grow for the [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002), and
[herb](../ebd/ebd174.htm#008) for the service of man: that he may bring
forth food out of the earth;  

<span id="015">15</span> And [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) that maketh
glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) which strengtheneth man's heart.  

<span id="016">16</span> The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the
cedars of [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001), which he hath planted;  

<span id="017">17</span> Where the birds make their nests: as for the
[stork](../ebd/ebd351.htm#007), the [fir](../ebd/ebd133.htm#005) trees
are her house.  

<span id="018">18</span> The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats;
and the rocks for the conies.  

<span id="019">19</span> He appointed the [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004)
for [seasons](../ebd/ebd325.htm#003): the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001)
knoweth his going down.  

<span id="020">20</span> Thou makest [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008),
and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006) do creep forth.  

<span id="021">21</span> The young [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001) roar
after their prey, and seek their meat from God.  

<span id="022">22</span> The [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) ariseth, they
gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.  

<span id="023">23</span> Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour
until the evening.  

<span id="024">24</span> O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom
hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.  

<span id="025">25</span> So is this great and wide sea, wherein are
things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.  

<span id="026">26</span> There go the [ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003):
there is that [leviathan](../ebd/ebd227.htm#007), whom thou hast made to
play therein.  

<span id="027">27</span> These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give
them their meat in due season.  

<span id="028">28</span> That thou givest them they gather: thou openest
thine hand, they are filled with good.  

<span id="029">29</span> Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou
takest away their breath, they die, and return to their
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008).  

<span id="030">30</span> Thou sendest forth thy
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), they are created: and thou renewest the
face of the earth.  

<span id="031">31</span> The [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the LORD
shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.  

<span id="032">32</span> He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he
toucheth the hills, and they smoke.  

<span id="033">33</span> I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I
will sing praise to my God while I have my being.  

<span id="034">34</span> My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be
glad in the LORD.  

<span id="035">35</span> Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth,
and let the wicked be no more. [Bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) thou the
LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.
