### King James Version: Lamentations Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us:
consider, and behold our reproach.  

<span id="002">2</span> Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our
houses to aliens.  

<span id="003">3</span> We are [orphans](../ebd/ebd280.htm#008.md) and
fatherless, our mothers are as [widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> We have drunken our water for money; our
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md) is sold unto us.  

<span id="005">5</span> Our necks are under
[persecution](../ebd/ebd290.htm#007.md): we labour, and have no rest.  

<span id="006">6</span> We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to
the Assyrians, to be satisfied with [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we
have borne their iniquities.  

<span id="008">8</span> Servants have ruled over us: there is none that
doth deliver us out of their hand.  

<span id="009">9</span> We gat our [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) with
the peril of our lives because of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) of
the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> Our skin was black like an
[oven](../ebd/ebd281.htm#005.md) because of the terrible
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> They ravished the women in
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), and the maids in the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md).  

<span id="012">12</span> Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces
of elders were not honoured.  

<span id="013">13</span> They took the young men to
[grind](../ebd/ebd155.htm#006.md), and the children fell under the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> The elders have ceased from the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md), the young men from their musick.  

<span id="015">15</span> The joy of our heart is ceased; our
[dance](../ebd/ebd097.htm#000.md) is turned into mourning.  

<span id="016">16</span> The [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001.md) is fallen
from our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned!  

<span id="017">17</span> For this our heart is faint; for these things
our eyes are dim.  

<span id="018">18</span> Because of the mountain of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), which is desolate, the foxes walk upon
it.  

<span id="019">19</span> Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) from [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md)
to [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md).  

<span id="020">20</span> Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and
forsake us so long time?  

<span id="021">21</span> Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be
turned; renew our days as of old.  

<span id="022">22</span> But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art
very wroth against us.
