### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 40

<span id="001">1</span> I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined
unto me, and heard my cry.  

<span id="002">2</span> He brought me up also out of an horrible
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md), out of the miry
[clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004.md), and set my feet upon a
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md), and established my goings.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even
praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the
LORD.  

<span id="004">4</span> Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his
trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.  

<span id="005">5</span> Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works
which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot
be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them,
they are more than can be numbered.  

<span id="006">6</span> [Sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002.md) and
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) thou didst not desire; mine ears hast
thou opened: burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) and
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001.md) hast thou
not required.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the
book it is written of me,  

<span id="008">8</span> I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law
is within my heart.  

<span id="009">9</span> I have preached
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) in the great
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md): lo, I have not refrained my lips,
O LORD, thou knowest.  

<span id="010">10</span> I have not hid thy
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md) within my heart; I have declared
thy faithfulness and thy [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md): I have not
concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O
LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.  

<span id="012">12</span> For innumerable evils have compassed me about:
mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look
up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart
faileth me.  

<span id="013">13</span> Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make
haste to help me.  

<span id="014">14</span> Let them be ashamed and confounded together
that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and
put to shame that wish me evil.  

<span id="015">15</span> Let them be desolate for a reward of their
shame that say unto me, [Aha](../ebd/ebd013.htm#001.md),
[aha](../ebd/ebd013.htm#001.md).  

<span id="016">16</span> Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be
glad in thee: let such as love thy [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md)
say continually, The LORD be magnified.  

<span id="017">17</span> But I am [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md) and
needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer;
make no tarrying, O my God.
