### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> Righteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with
thee: yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments: Wherefore doth the way
of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very
treacherously?  

<span id="002">2</span> Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken
root: they grow, yea, they bring forth [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md):
thou art near in their mouth, and far from their
[reins](../ebd/ebd310.htm#001.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me,
and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) for the slaughter, and prepare them for
the day of slaughter.  

<span id="004">4</span> How long shall the land
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004.md), and the herbs of every field wither, for
the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and
the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.  

<span id="005">5</span> If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have
wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the
land of peace, wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt
thou do in the [swelling](../ebd/ebd354.htm#001.md) of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md)?  

<span id="006">6</span> For even thy brethren, and the house of thy
father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have
called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair
words unto thee.  

<span id="007">7</span> I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine
heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of
her enemies.  

<span id="008">8</span> Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006.md); it crieth out against me: therefore
have I hated it.  

<span id="009">9</span> Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled
[bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000.md), the birds round about are against her;
come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.  

<span id="010">10</span> Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they
have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a
desolate [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> They have made it desolate, and being desolate
it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man
layeth it to heart.  

<span id="012">12</span> The spoilers are come upon all high places
through the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md): for the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) of the LORD shall devour from the one end
of the land even to the other end of the land: no
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) shall have peace.  

<span id="013">13</span> They have sown [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md),
but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, but shall not
profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) of the LORD.  

<span id="014">14</span> Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil
neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them
out of their land, and pluck out the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) from among them.  

<span id="015">15</span> And it shall come to pass, after that I have
plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will
bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his
land.  

<span id="016">16</span> And it shall come to pass, if they will
diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD
liveth; as they taught my people to swear by
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004.md); then shall they be built in the midst of
my people.  

<span id="017">17</span> But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck
up and destroy that nation, saith the LORD.
