### King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> Now these are the divisions of the sons of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md). The sons of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001); [Nadab](../ebd/ebd264.htm#008.md), and
[Abihu](../ebd/ebd003.htm#004), [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000.md), and
[Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> But [Nadab](../ebd/ebd264.htm#008.md) and
[Abihu](../ebd/ebd003.htm#004.md) died before their father, and had no
children: therefore [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000.md) and
[Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005.md) executed the priest's office.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) distributed
them, both [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008.md) of the sons of
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000), and [Ahimelech](../ebd/ebd014.htm#004.md)
of the sons of [Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005.md), according to their
offices in their service.  

<span id="004">4</span> And there were more chief men found of the sons
of [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000.md) than of the sons of
[Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005.md), and thus were they divided. Among the
sons of [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000.md) there were sixteen chief men of
the house of their fathers, and eight among the sons of
[Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005.md) according to the house of their
fathers.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with
another; for the governors of the [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md),
and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000.md), and of the sons of
[Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005.md) the son of
[Nethaneel](../ebd/ebd271.htm#003.md) the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote
them before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), and the princes, and
[Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003.md), and
[Ahimelech](../ebd/ebd014.htm#004.md) the son of
[Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005.md), and before the chief of the fathers
of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000.md), and one taken for
[Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> Now the first lot came forth to
[Jehoiarib](../ebd/ebd201.htm#002.md), the second to
[Jedaiah](../ebd/ebd199.htm#006.md),  

<span id="008">8</span> The third to [Harim](../ebd/ebd164.htm#003.md), the
fourth to [Seorim](../ebd/ebd327.htm#006.md),  

<span id="009">9</span> The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,  

<span id="010">10</span> The seventh to [Hakkoz](../ebd/ebd159.htm#004.md),
the eighth to [Abijah](../ebd/ebd003.htm#006.md),  

<span id="011">11</span> The ninth to Jeshuah, the tenth to
[Shecaniah](../ebd/ebd333.htm#001.md),

[Eliashib](../ebd/ebd116.htm#003.md), the twelfth to
[Jakim](../ebd/ebd196.htm#004.md),  

<span id="013">13</span> The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to
[Jeshebeab](../ebd/ebd205.htm#000.md),  

<span id="014">14</span> The fifteenth to
[Bilgah](../ebd/ebd058.htm#007.md), the sixteenth to
[Immer](../ebd/ebd187.htm#008.md),

[Maaziah](../ebd/ebd235.htm#000.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> These were the orderings of them in their
service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner,
under [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md) their father, as the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) had commanded him.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the rest of the sons of

[Amram](../ebd/ebd022.htm#001.md); Shubael: of the sons of Shubael;
