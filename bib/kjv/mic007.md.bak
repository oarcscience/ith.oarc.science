### King James Version: Micah Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered
the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no
cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> The good man is perished out of the earth: and
there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md); they hunt every man his brother with a
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> That they may do evil with both hands earnestly,
the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004.md) asketh, and the
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005.md) asketh for a reward; and the great man,
he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.  

<span id="004">4</span> The best of them is as a
[brier](../ebd/ebd065.htm#003.md): the most upright is sharper than a
[thorn](../ebd/ebd364.htm#006.md) hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy
visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.  

<span id="005">5</span> Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence
in a guide: keep the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) of thy mouth from
her that lieth in thy [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> For the son dishonoureth the father, the
daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her
mother in law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait
for the God of my [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md): my God will hear
me.  

<span id="008">8</span> Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I
fall, I shall arise; when I sit in [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008.md),
the LORD shall be a light unto me.  

<span id="009">9</span> I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because
I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment
for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and
shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God?
mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of
the streets.  

<span id="011">11</span> In the day that thy walls are to be built, in
that day shall the decree be far removed.  

<span id="012">12</span> In that day also he shall come even to thee
from [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md), and from the fortified cities,
and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from
mountain to mountain.  

<span id="013">13</span> Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate
because of them that dwell therein, for the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of their doings.  

<span id="014">14</span> Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of
thine heritage, which dwell solitarily in the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003.md), in the midst of
[Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006.md): let them feed in
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003) and [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md), as
in the days of old.  

<span id="015">15</span> According to the days of thy coming out of the
land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) will I shew unto him marvellous
things.  

<span id="016">16</span> The nations shall see and be confounded at all
their might: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears
shall be deaf.  

<span id="017">17</span> They shall lick the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) like a [serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009.md),
they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall
be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.  

<span id="018">18</span> Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth
iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his
heritage? he retaineth not his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) for ever,
because he delighteth in [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> He will turn again, he will have compassion
upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their
sins into the depths of the sea.  

<span id="020">20</span> Thou wilt perform the truth to
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), and the [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005.md)
to [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005.md), which thou hast sworn unto our
fathers from the days of old.
