### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the
sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and
the elders of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) sat before me, that the
hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.  

<span id="002">2</span> Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the
appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward,
fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness,
as the [colour](../ebd/ebd086.htm#008) of
[amber](../ebd/ebd019.htm#009).  

<span id="003">3</span> And he put forth the form of an hand, and took
me by a [lock](../ebd/ebd230.htm#009) of mine head; and the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) lifted me up between the earth and the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and brought me in the visions of God to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), to the door of the inner
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) that looketh toward the north; where was
the seat of the image of [jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008), which
provoketh to [jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008).  

<span id="004">4</span> And, behold, the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006)
of the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) was there, according to
the [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000) that I saw in the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002).  

<span id="005">5</span> Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine
eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way
toward the north, and behold [northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002) at the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) this
image of [jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008) in the entry.  

<span id="006">6</span> He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest
thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) committeth here, that I should go far
off from my [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005)? but turn thee yet again,
and thou shalt see greater abominations.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he brought me to the door of the court; and
when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the
wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the
wicked abominations that they do here.  

<span id="010">10</span> So I went in and saw; and behold every form of
creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), pourtrayed upon the wall round
about.  

<span id="011">11</span> And there stood before them seventy men of the
ancients of the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and in the
midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of
[Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004), with every man his
[censer](../ebd/ebd075.htm#002) in his hand; and a thick
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) of [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) went
up.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou
seen what the ancients of the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his
[imagery](../ebd/ebd187.htm#005)? for they say, the LORD seeth us not;
the LORD hath forsaken the earth.  

<span id="013">13</span> He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and
thou shalt see greater abominations that they do.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then he brought me to the door of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the LORD's house which was toward the
north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for
[Tammuz](../ebd/ebd358.htm#005).  

<span id="015">15</span> Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O
son of man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations
than these.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he brought me into the inner court of the
LORD's house, and, behold, at the door of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of the LORD, between the porch and the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), were about five and twenty men, with
their backs toward the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of the LORD, and
their faces toward the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000); and they
worshipped the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) toward the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000).  

<span id="017">17</span> Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O
son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) that they commit the abominations which
they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have
returned to provoke me to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002): and, lo, they
put the [branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002) to their nose.  

<span id="018">18</span> Therefore will I also deal in
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002): mine eye shall not spare, neither will I
have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will
I not hear them.
