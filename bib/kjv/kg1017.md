### King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> And [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md) the
[Tishbite](../ebd/ebd368.htm#003.md), who was of the inhabitants of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009.md), said unto
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002.md), As the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) liveth, before whom I stand, there shall
not be [dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008) nor [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md)
these years, but according to my word.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the word of the LORD came unto him,
saying,  

<span id="003">3</span> Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide
thyself by the [brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006.md)
[Cherith](../ebd/ebd079.htm#002.md), that is before
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> And it shall be, that thou shalt
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of the [brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006.md);
and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.  

<span id="005">5</span> So he went and did according unto the word of
the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the [brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006.md)
[Cherith](../ebd/ebd079.htm#002.md), that is before
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And the ravens brought him
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) and [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) in the
morning, and [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) and
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) in the evening; and he drank of the
[brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And it came to pass after a while, that the
[brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006.md) dried up, because there had been no
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) in the land.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the word of the LORD came unto him,
saying,  

<span id="009">9</span> Arise, get thee to
[Zarephath](../ebd/ebd387.htm#006.md), which belongeth to
[Zidon](../ebd/ebd393.htm#000.md), and dwell there: behold, I have
commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.  

<span id="010">10</span> So he arose and went to
[Zarephath](../ebd/ebd387.htm#006.md). And when he came to the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008.md) of the city, behold, the widow woman was
there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I
pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> And as she was going to fetch it, he called to
her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) in thine hand.  

<span id="012">12</span> And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I
have not a [cake](../ebd/ebd068.htm#009.md), but an handful of meal in a
[barrel](../ebd/ebd045.htm#006.md), and a little oil in a
[cruse](../ebd/ebd093.htm#004.md): and, behold, I am gathering two sticks,
that I may go in and [dress](../ebd/ebd107.htm#008.md) it for me and my
son, that we may eat it, and die.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md) said unto
her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little
[cake](../ebd/ebd068.htm#009.md) first, and bring it unto me, and after
make for thee and for thy son.  

<span id="014">14</span> For thus saith the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), The [barrel](../ebd/ebd045.htm#006.md) of
meal shall not waste, neither shall the [cruse](../ebd/ebd093.htm#004.md)
of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008.md) upon the earth.  

<span id="015">15</span> And she went and did according to the saying of
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md): and she, and he, and her house, did eat
many days.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the [barrel](../ebd/ebd045.htm#006.md) of meal
wasted not, neither did the [cruse](../ebd/ebd093.htm#004.md) of oil fail,
according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> And it came to pass after these things, that
the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his
sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.  

<span id="018">18</span> And she said unto
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md), What have I to do with thee, O thou man
of God? art thou come unto me to call my [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md) to
remembrance, and to slay my son?  

<span id="019">19</span> And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he
took him out of her [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008.md), and carried him up
into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.  

<span id="020">20</span> And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my
God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by
slaying her son?  

<span id="021">21</span> And he stretched himself upon the child three
times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee,
let this child's soul come into him again.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the LORD heard the voice of
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md); and the soul of the child came into him
again, and he revived.  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md) took the
child, and brought him down out of the [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003.md)
into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md) said, See, thy son liveth.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the woman said to
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009.md), Now by this I know that thou art a man
of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.
