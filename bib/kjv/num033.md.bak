### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 33

<span id="001">1</span> These are the journeys of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), which went forth out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md) with their armies under the hand of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) wrote their
goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the LORD:
and these are their journeys according to their goings out.  

<span id="003">3</span> And they departed from
[Rameses](../ebd/ebd307.htm#001.md) in the first month, on the fifteenth
day of the first month; on the morrow after the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md) the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) went out with an high hand in the sight
of all the Egyptians.  

<span id="004">4</span> For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn,
which the LORD had smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD
executed judgments.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) removed from
[Rameses](../ebd/ebd307.htm#001.md), and pitched in
[Succoth](../ebd/ebd352.htm#008.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And they departed from
[Succoth](../ebd/ebd352.htm#008.md), and pitched in
[Etham](../ebd/ebd126.htm#001.md), which is in the edge of the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).  

<span id="007">7</span> And they removed from
[Etham](../ebd/ebd126.htm#001.md), and turned again unto Pihahiroth, which
is before Baalzephon: and they pitched before
[Migdol](../ebd/ebd254.htm#003.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And they departed from before Pihahiroth, and
passed through the midst of the sea into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), and went three days'
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md) in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Etham](../ebd/ebd126.htm#001.md),
and pitched in [Marah](../ebd/ebd241.htm#003.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And they removed from
[Marah](../ebd/ebd241.htm#003.md), and came unto
[Elim](../ebd/ebd117.htm#001): and in [Elim](../ebd/ebd117.htm#001.md) were
twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm trees; and they
pitched there.  

<span id="010">10</span> And they removed from
[Elim](../ebd/ebd117.htm#001.md), and encamped by the Red sea.  

<span id="011">11</span> And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped
in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) of
[Sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md).

[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001.md) out of the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006.md), and
encamped in [Dophkah](../ebd/ebd106.htm#002.md).

<span id="050">50</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003.md) in the plains of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005) by [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) near
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008.md), saying,  

<span id="051">51</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), and say unto them, When ye are passed
over [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004.md) into the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005.md);  

<span id="052">52</span> Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of
the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy
all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:  

<span id="053">53</span> And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the
land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.  

<span id="054">54</span> And ye shall divide the land by lot for an
inheritance among your families: and to the more ye shall give the more
inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every
man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according
to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.  

<span id="055">55</span> But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of
the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which
ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your
sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.  

<span id="056">56</span> Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do
unto you, as I thought to do unto them.
