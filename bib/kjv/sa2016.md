### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> And when [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) was a
little past the top of the hill, behold, [Ziba](../ebd/ebd392.htm#003)
the servant of [Mephibosheth](../ebd/ebd248.htm#006) met him, with a
couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and an hundred bunches of
[raisins](../ebd/ebd306.htm#000), and an hundred of summer fruits, and a
[bottle](../ebd/ebd063.htm#002) of [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said unto
[Ziba](../ebd/ebd392.htm#003), What meanest thou by these? And
[Ziba](../ebd/ebd392.htm#003) said, The asses be for the king's
household to ride on; and the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) and summer
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) for the young men to eat; and the
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), that such as be faint in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) may
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009).  

<span id="003">3</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said, And
where is thy master's son? And [Ziba](../ebd/ebd392.htm#003) said unto
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), Behold, he abideth at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): for he said, To day shall the house
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) restore me the kingdom of my
father.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then said the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) to
[Ziba](../ebd/ebd392.htm#003), Behold, thine are all that pertained unto
[Mephibosheth](../ebd/ebd248.htm#006). And [Ziba](../ebd/ebd392.htm#003)
said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) in thy sight, my lord, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="005">5</span> And when [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) came to [Bahurim](../ebd/ebd041.htm#009),
behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), whose name was
[Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002), the son of
[Gera](../ebd/ebd146.htm#003): he came forth, and cursed still as he
came.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he cast stones at
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and at all the servants of
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004): and all
the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his
left.  

<span id="007">7</span> And thus said [Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002)
when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of
[Belial](../ebd/ebd051.htm#007):  

<span id="008">8</span> The LORD hath returned upon thee all the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the house of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the
LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008) thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in
thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then said [Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005) the
son of [Zeruiah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#009) unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), Why should this dead dog
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off
his head.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said,
What have I to do with you, ye sons of [Zeruiah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#009)?
so let him [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003), because the LORD hath said
unto him, [Curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).
Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?  

<span id="011">11</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said to
[Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005), and to all his servants, Behold, my
son, which came forth of my [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004), seeketh my
life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let
him [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003); for the LORD hath bidden him.  

<span id="012">12</span> It may be that the LORD will look on mine
affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this
day.  

<span id="013">13</span> And as [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) and his
men went by the way, [Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002) went along on the
hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at
him, and cast [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008).  

<span id="014">14</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and all
the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves
there.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008), and all
the people the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), came to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and
[Ahithophel](../ebd/ebd015.htm#000) with him.  

<span id="016">16</span> And it came to pass, when
[Hushai](../ebd/ebd185.htm#003) the [Archite](../ebd/ebd029.htm#006),
David's friend, was come unto [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008), that
[Hushai](../ebd/ebd185.htm#003) said unto
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008), God save the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), God save the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008) said to
[Hushai](../ebd/ebd185.htm#003), Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why
wentest thou not with thy friend?  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Hushai](../ebd/ebd185.htm#003) said unto
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008), Nay; but whom the LORD, and this
people, and all the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), choose, his
will I be, and with him will I abide.  

<span id="019">19</span> And again, whom should I serve? should I not
serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's
presence, so will I be in thy presence.  

<span id="020">20</span> Then said [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008) to
[Ahithophel](../ebd/ebd015.htm#000), Give counsel among you what we
shall do.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Ahithophel](../ebd/ebd015.htm#000) said
unto [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008), Go in unto thy father's
concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy
father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.  

<span id="022">22</span> So they spread [Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008)
a [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009) upon the top of the house; and
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008) went in unto his father's concubines in
the sight of all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="023">23</span> And the counsel of
[Ahithophel](../ebd/ebd015.htm#000), which he counselled in those days,
was as if a man had enquired at the [oracle](../ebd/ebd280.htm#000) of
God: so was all the counsel of [Ahithophel](../ebd/ebd015.htm#000) both
with [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) and with
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008).
