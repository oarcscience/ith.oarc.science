<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 48</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Hear ye this, O house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, which are called by the name of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and are come forth out of the waters of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, but not in truth, nor in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; The LORD of hosts is his name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them suddenly, and they came to pass.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A> is an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A> sinew, and thy brow <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it came to pass I shewed it thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</A> hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time that thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For my name's sake will I defer mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Behold, I have refined thee, but not with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>; I have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> thee in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#000">furnace</A> of affliction.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> unto another.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Hearken unto me, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his pleasure on <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord GOD, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>, hath sent me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">Redeemer</A>, the Holy One of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; I am the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> as the waves of the sea:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A> like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Go ye forth of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> for them: he clave the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> also, and the waters gushed out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.<BR>
