### King James Version: Daniel Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> In the first year of
[Belshazzar](../ebd/ebd052.htm#001) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) had a
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md) and visions of his head upon his bed:
then he wrote the [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005.md), and told the sum of
the matters.  

<span id="002">2</span> [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) spake and said,
I saw in my [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000.md) by night, and, behold, the
four [winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009.md) of the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) strove upon the great sea.  

<span id="003">3</span> And four great beasts came up from the sea,
diverse one from another.  

<span id="004">4</span> The first was like a lion, and had eagle's
wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted
up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's
heart was given to it.  

<span id="005">5</span> And behold another
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md), a second, like to a bear, and it raised
up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between
the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> After this I beheld, and lo another, like a
[leopard](../ebd/ebd227.htm#002.md), which had upon the back of it four
wings of a fowl; the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) had also four heads;
and dominion was given to it.  

<span id="007">7</span> After this I saw in the night visions, and
behold a fourth [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md), dreadful and terrible,
and strong exceedingly; and it had great [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md)
teeth: it devoured and brake in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md), and
stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the
beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.  

<span id="008">8</span> I considered the horns, and, behold, there came
up among them another little [horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003.md), before whom
there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and,
behold, in this [horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003.md) were eyes like the eyes of
man, and a mouth speaking great things.  

<span id="009">9</span> I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and
the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as
[snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000.md), and the hair of his head like the pure
[wool](../ebd/ebd383.htm#005): his [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) was
like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.  

<span id="010">10</span> A fiery stream issued and came forth from
before him: thousand [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md) ministered unto
him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment
was set, and the books were opened.  

<span id="011">11</span> I beheld then because of the voice of the great
words which the [horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003.md) spake: I beheld even till
the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) was slain, and his body destroyed,
and given to the burning flame.  

<span id="012">12</span> As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had
their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season
and time.  

<span id="013">13</span> I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one
like the Son of man came with the clouds of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), and came to the Ancient of days, and
they brought him near before him.  

<span id="014">14</span> And there was given him dominion, and
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md), and a kingdom, that all people, nations,
and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) dominion, which shall not pass
away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.  

<span id="015">15</span> I [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001.md) was grieved
in my [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) in the midst of my body, and the
visions of my head troubled me.  

<span id="016">16</span> I came near unto one of them that stood by, and
asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the
interpretation of the things.  

<span id="017">17</span> These great beasts, which are four, are four
kings, which shall arise out of the earth.  

<span id="018">18</span> But the saints of the most High shall take the
kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.  

<span id="019">19</span> Then I would know the truth of the fourth
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md), which was diverse from all the others,
exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004.md),
and his nails of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003.md); which devoured, brake
in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md), and stamped the residue with his
feet;  

<span id="020">20</span> And of the ten horns that were in his head, and
of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that
[horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003.md) that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very
great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.  

<span id="021">21</span> I beheld, and the same
[horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003.md) made war with the saints, and prevailed
against them;  

<span id="022">22</span> Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment
was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the
saints possessed the kingdom.  

<span id="023">23</span> Thus he said, The fourth
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001.md) shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth,
which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole
earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten
kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall
be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.  

<span id="025">25</span> And he shall speak great words against the most
High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to
change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a
time and times and the dividing of time.  

<span id="026">26</span> But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take
away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.  

<span id="027">27</span> And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness
of the kingdom under the whole [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md), shall be
given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007.md) kingdom, and all dominions shall
serve and obey him.  

<span id="028">28</span> Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001), my [cogitations](../ebd/ebd086.htm#002.md)
much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the
matter in my heart.
