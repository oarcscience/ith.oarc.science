### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 37

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, when
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) heard
it, that he [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007.md) his clothes, and covered
himself with [sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001.md), and went into the house
of the LORD.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he sent [Eliakim](../ebd/ebd116.htm#000.md),
who was over the household, and [Shebna](../ebd/ebd332.htm#009.md) the
scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001), unto [Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007.md)
the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008.md) the son of
[Amoz](../ebd/ebd021.htm#008.md).  

<span id="003">3</span> And they said unto him, Thus saith
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md), This day is a day of trouble, and of
rebuke, and of [blasphemy](../ebd/ebd060.htm#005.md): for the children are
come to the [birth](../ebd/ebd059.htm#002.md), and there is not strength to
bring forth.  

<span id="004">4</span> It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words
of [Rabshakeh](../ebd/ebd305.htm#000.md), whom the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md) his
master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words
which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000.md) for the remnant that is left.  

<span id="005">5</span> So the servants of [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) came to
[Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007.md).  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007.md) said unto
them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not
afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md) have
blasphemed me.  

<span id="007">7</span> Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he
shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to
fall by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md) in his own land.  

<span id="008">8</span> So [Rabshakeh](../ebd/ebd305.htm#000.md) returned,
and found the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md) warring against
[Libnah](../ebd/ebd228.htm#004.md): for he had heard that he was departed
from [Lachish](../ebd/ebd222.htm#009.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> And he heard say concerning
[Tirhakah](../ebd/ebd368.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Ethiopia](../ebd/ebd126.htm#005.md), He is come forth to make war with
thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="010">10</span> Thus shall ye speak to
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md), saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou
trustest, deceive thee, saying, [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) shall
not be given into the hand of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md).  

<span id="011">11</span> Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md) have done to all lands by destroying
them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?  

<span id="012">12</span> Have the gods of the nations delivered them
which my fathers have destroyed, as [Gozan](../ebd/ebd153.htm#009.md), and
[Haran](../ebd/ebd163.htm#007), and [Rezeph](../ebd/ebd312.htm#005.md), and
the children of [Eden](../ebd/ebd112.htm#009.md) which were in
[Telassar](../ebd/ebd360.htm#006.md)?  

<span id="013">13</span> Where is the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005), and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
of [Arphad](../ebd/ebd032.htm#003.md), and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of the city of
[Sepharvaim](../ebd/ebd327.htm#009), [Hena](../ebd/ebd174.htm#003.md), and
[Ivah](../ebd/ebd191.htm#009.md)?  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) received
the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) went up unto the house of the LORD,
and spread it before the LORD.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md) prayed
unto the LORD, saying,  

<span id="016">16</span> O LORD of hosts, God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), that dwellest between the cherubims,
thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth:
thou hast made [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md) and earth.  

<span id="017">17</span> Incline thine [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md), O
LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see: and hear all the words
of [Sennacherib](../ebd/ebd327.htm#005.md), which hath sent to reproach the
living God.  

<span id="018">18</span> Of a truth, LORD, the kings of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md) have laid waste all the nations, and
their countries,  

<span id="019">19</span> And have cast their gods into the fire: for
they were no gods, but the work of men's hands,
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) and [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md):
therefore they have destroyed them.  

<span id="020">20</span> Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his
hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the
LORD, even thou only.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then [Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007.md) the son of
[Amoz](../ebd/ebd021.htm#008.md) sent unto
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003.md), saying, Thus saith the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), Whereas thou hast prayed to me against
[Sennacherib](../ebd/ebd327.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md):  

<span id="022">22</span> This is the word which the LORD hath spoken
concerning him; The [virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009.md), the daughter of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md), hath despised thee, and laughed thee to
scorn; the daughter of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) hath shaken
her head at thee.  

<span id="023">23</span> Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and
against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on
high? even against the Holy One of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="024">24</span> By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord,
and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the
height of the mountains, to the sides of
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md); and I will cut down the tall cedars
thereof, and the choice [fir](../ebd/ebd133.htm#005.md) trees thereof: and
I will enter into the height of his border, and the
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006.md) of his
[Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> I have digged, and
[drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007.md) water; and with the sole of my feet have
I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.  

<span id="026">26</span> Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done
it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it
to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into
ruinous heaps.  

<span id="027">27</span> Therefore their inhabitants were of small
power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were as the
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md) of the field, and as the green
[herb](../ebd/ebd174.htm#008), as the [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005.md) on
the housetops, and as [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006.md) blasted before it be
grown up.  

<span id="028">28</span> But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and
thy coming in, and thy rage against me.  

<span id="029">29</span> Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is
come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my
[hook](../ebd/ebd181.htm#004.md) in thy nose, and my
[bridle](../ebd/ebd065.htm#002.md) in thy lips, and I will turn thee back
by the way by which thou camest.  

<span id="030">30</span> And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall
eat this year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which
springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant
vineyards, and eat the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) thereof.  

<span id="031">31</span> And the remnant that is escaped of the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007.md) shall again take root downward, and bear
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) upward:  

<span id="032">32</span> For out of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md)
shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md): the
[zeal](../ebd/ebd388.htm#003.md) of the LORD of hosts shall do this.  

<span id="033">33</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md), He
shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before
it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.  

<span id="034">34</span> By the way that he came, by the same shall he
return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.  

<span id="035">35</span> For I will defend this city to save it for mine
own sake, and for my servant David's sake.  

<span id="036">36</span> Then the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001.md) of the
LORD went forth, and smote in the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md) of the
Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose
early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.  

<span id="037">37</span> So [Sennacherib](../ebd/ebd327.htm#005.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005.md)
departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at
[Nineveh](../ebd/ebd273.htm#006.md).  

<span id="038">38</span> And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in
the house of [Nisroch](../ebd/ebd273.htm#008.md) his god, that
[Adrammelech](../ebd/ebd010.htm#003.md) and
[Sharezer](../ebd/ebd331.htm#008.md) his sons smote him with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md); and they escaped into the land of
[Armenia](../ebd/ebd031.htm#004.md): and
[Esarhaddon](../ebd/ebd124.htm#004.md) his son reigned in his stead.
