<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</A> prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</A> is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> like our God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;They that were full have hired out themselves for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</A> hath born <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A>; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A>, and bringeth up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The LORD maketh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;He raiseth up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A>, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>; for by strength shall no man prevail.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>; out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> shall he <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#003">thunder</A> upon them: the LORD shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and exalt the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</A> of his anointed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd118.htm#005">Elkanah</A> went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</A> to his house. And the child did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A> unto the LORD before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Now the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A> were sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd051.htm#007">Belial</A>; they knew not the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the priest's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</A> with the people was, that, when any man offered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>, the priest's servant came, while the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he struck it into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd283.htm#009">pan</A>, or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd218.htm#000">kettle</A>, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> took for himself. So they did in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A> unto all the Israelites that came thither.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Also before they burnt the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A>, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> to roast for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>; for he will not have sodden <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> of thee, but raw.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Wherefore the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Moreover his mother made him a little <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</A>, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A> blessed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd118.htm#005">Elkanah</A> and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#008">loan</A> which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And the LORD visited <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</A>, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> grew before the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A> was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD's people to transgress.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;If one man <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> against another, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> him: but if a man <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And the child <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And there came a man of God unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A>, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> in Pharaoh's house?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And did I choose him out of all the tribes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> to be my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, to offer upon mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>, to burn <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A>, to wear an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</A> before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Wherefore kick ye at my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> and at mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A>, which I have commanded in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A>; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> with the chiefest of all the offerings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> my people?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Wherefore the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt see an enemy in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A>, in all the wealth which God shall give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#006">Hophni</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#003">Phinehas</A>; in one day they shall die both of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And I will raise me up a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> and a morsel of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>.<BR>
