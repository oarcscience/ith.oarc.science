</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And she came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> with a very great train, with camels that bare <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</A>, and very much <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and precious stones: and when she was come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A>, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.<BR>

<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, which he told her not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</A> had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,<BR>

<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the meat of his table, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</A>, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> in her.<BR>

<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And she gave the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> an hundred and twenty talents of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</A> very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</A> as these which the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</A> gave to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A>.<BR>
