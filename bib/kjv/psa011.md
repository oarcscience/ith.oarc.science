### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my
soul, Flee as a [bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000) to your mountain?  

<span id="002">2</span> For, lo, the wicked bend their
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003), they make ready their arrow upon the
string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.  

<span id="003">3</span> If the foundations be destroyed, what can the
righteous do?  

<span id="004">4</span> The LORD is in his holy
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), the LORD's
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) is in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006):
his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.  

<span id="005">5</span> The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked
and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.  

<span id="006">6</span> Upon the wicked he shall
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) snares, fire and
[brimstone](../ebd/ebd065.htm#005), and an horrible tempest: this shall
be the portion of their [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000).  

<span id="007">7</span> For the righteous LORD loveth
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004); his countenance doth behold the
upright.
