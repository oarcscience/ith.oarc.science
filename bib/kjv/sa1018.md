### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, when he had made an end of
speaking unto [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), that the soul of
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) was knit with the soul of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md)
loved him as his own soul.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) took him that
day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) and
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) made a [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md),
because he loved him as his own soul.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000.md) stripped
himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and his garments, even to his
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and to his [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md),
and to his [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005.md).  

<span id="005">5</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) went out
whithersoever [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) sent him, and behaved
himself wisely: and [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) set him over the men
of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in
the sight of Saul's servants.  

<span id="006">6</span> And it came to pass as they came, when
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) was returned from the slaughter of the
Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), singing and dancing, to meet
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), with
tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the women answered one another as they
played, and said, [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) hath slain his
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008), and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md)
his ten [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md).  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) was very
wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed
unto [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) ten
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md), and to me they have ascribed but
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008.md): and what can he have more but the
kingdom?  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) eyed
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) from that day and forward.  

<span id="010">10</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the
evil [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) from God came upon
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), and he prophesied in the midst of the
house: and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) played with his hand, as at
other times: and there was a [javelin](../ebd/ebd198.htm#006.md) in Saul's
hand.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) cast the
[javelin](../ebd/ebd198.htm#006.md); for he said, I will smite
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) even to the wall with it. And
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) avoided out of his presence twice.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) was afraid of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), because the LORD was with him, and was
departed from [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> Therefore [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) removed
him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out
and came in before the people.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) behaved
himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.  

<span id="015">15</span> Wherefore when [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md)
saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.  

<span id="016">16</span> But all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) and
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) loved [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md),
because he went out and came in before them.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), Behold my [elder](../ebd/ebd114.htm#008.md)
daughter [Merab](../ebd/ebd248.htm#007.md), her will I give thee to wife:
only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles. For
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but
let the hand of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) be upon him.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said unto
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), Who am I? and what is my life, or my
father's family in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), that I should be son
in law to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)?  

<span id="019">19</span> But it came to pass at the time when
[Merab](../ebd/ebd248.htm#007.md) Saul's daughter should have been given to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), that she was given unto
[Adriel](../ebd/ebd010.htm#006.md) the Meholathite to wife.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Michal](../ebd/ebd253.htm#001.md) Saul's
daughter loved [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md): and they told
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md), and the thing pleased him.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said, I will
give him her, that she may be a [snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009.md) to him,
and that the hand of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) may be
against him. Wherefore [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), Thou shalt this day be my son in law in
the one of the twain.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) commanded his
servants, saying, Commune with [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) secretly,
and say, Behold, the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) hath delight in thee,
and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in
law.  

<span id="023">23</span> And Saul's servants spake those words in the
ears of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md). And
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to
be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006.md)
man, and lightly esteemed?  

<span id="024">24</span> And the servants of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) told him, saying, On this manner spake
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) said, Thus
shall ye say to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), The
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) desireth not any
[dowry](../ebd/ebd106.htm#009.md), but an hundred foreskins of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md), to be avenged of the king's
enemies. But [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) thought to make
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) fall by the hand of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md).  

<span id="026">26</span> And when his servants told
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) these words, it pleased
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) well to be the king's son in law: and the
days were not expired.  

<span id="027">27</span> Wherefore [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) arose
and went, he and his men, and slew of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) two hundred men; and
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) brought their foreskins, and they gave
them in full [tale](../ebd/ebd357.htm#008.md) to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md), that he might be the king's son in law.
And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) gave him
[Michal](../ebd/ebd253.htm#001.md) his daughter to wife.  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) saw and knew
that the LORD was with [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md), and that
[Michal](../ebd/ebd253.htm#001.md) Saul's daughter loved him.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) was yet the
more afraid of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md); and
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md) became David's enemy continually.  

<span id="030">30</span> Then the princes of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002.md) went forth: and it came to pass,
after they went forth, that [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) behaved
himself more wisely than all the servants of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002.md); so that his name was much set by.
