### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> And when he had called unto him his twelve
disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out,
and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.  

<span id="002">2</span> Now the names of the twelve apostles are these;
The first, [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004), who is called
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002), and [Andrew](../ebd/ebd023.htm#007) his
brother; [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007) the son of
[Zebedee](../ebd/ebd388.htm#008), and John his brother;  

<span id="003">3</span> [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008), and
[Bartholomew](../ebd/ebd045.htm#009); [Thomas](../ebd/ebd364.htm#005),
and [Matthew](../ebd/ebd244.htm#003) the
[publican](../ebd/ebd301.htm#009); [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007) the
son of [Alphaeus](../ebd/ebd018.htm#005), and
[Lebbaeus](../ebd/ebd226.htm#002), whose surname was
[Thaddaeus](../ebd/ebd363.htm#001);  

<span id="004">4</span> [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004) the
[Canaanite](../ebd/ebd070.htm#008), and [Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001)
[Iscariot](../ebd/ebd190.htm#000), who also betrayed him.  

<span id="005">5</span> These twelve [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) sent
forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001), and into any city of the
[Samaritans](../ebd/ebd320.htm#005) enter ye not:  

<span id="006">6</span> But go rather to the lost
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) of the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="007">7</span> And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) is at hand.  

<span id="008">8</span> Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the
dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.  

<span id="009">9</span> Provide neither [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001),
nor [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), nor [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003)
in your purses,  

<span id="010">10</span> Nor [scrip](../ebd/ebd324.htm#004) for your
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001), neither two coats, neither shoes, nor
yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.  

<span id="011">11</span> And into whatsoever city or town ye shall
enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.  

<span id="012">12</span> And when ye come into an house, salute it.  

<span id="013">13</span> And if the house be worthy, let your peace come
upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.  

<span id="014">14</span> And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear
your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) of your feet.  

<span id="015">15</span> Verily I say unto you, It shall be more
tolerable for the land of [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004) and Gomorrha in
the day of judgment, than for that city.  

<span id="016">16</span> Behold, I send you forth as
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) as serpents, and harmless as doves.  

<span id="017">17</span> But beware of men: for they will deliver you up
to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;  

<span id="018">18</span> And ye shall be brought before governors and
kings for my sake, for a [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) against them
and the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001).  

<span id="019">19</span> But when they deliver you up, take no thought
how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour
what ye shall speak.  

<span id="020">20</span> For it is not ye that speak, but the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of your Father which speaketh in you.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the brother shall deliver up the brother to
death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against
their parents, and cause them to be put to death.  

<span id="022">22</span> And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's
sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.  

<span id="023">23</span> But when they persecute you in this city, flee
ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over
the cities of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), till the Son of man be
come.  

<span id="024">24</span> The [disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003) is not
above his master, nor the servant above his lord.  

<span id="025">25</span> It is enough for the
[disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003) that he be as his master, and the
servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house
[Beelzebub](../ebd/ebd050.htm#001), how much more shall they call them
of his household?  

<span id="026">26</span> Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing
covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.  

<span id="027">27</span> What I tell you in
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008), that speak ye in light: and what ye
hear in the [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004), that preach ye upon the
housetops.  

<span id="028">28</span> And fear not them which kill the body, but are
not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy
both soul and body in [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003).  

<span id="029">29</span> Are not two sparrows sold for a
[farthing](../ebd/ebd131.htm#003)? and one of them shall not fall on the
ground without your Father.  

<span id="030">30</span> But the very hairs of your head are all
numbered.  

<span id="031">31</span> Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value
than many sparrows.  

<span id="032">32</span> Whosoever therefore shall confess me before
men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="033">33</span> But whosoever shall deny me before men, him
will I also deny before my Father which is in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="034">34</span> Think not that I am come to send peace on
earth: I came not to send peace, but a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="035">35</span> For I am come to set a man at variance against
his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law
against her mother in law.  

<span id="036">36</span> And a man's foes shall be they of his own
household.  

<span id="037">37</span> He that loveth father or mother more than me is
not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not
worthy of me.  

<span id="038">38</span> And he that taketh not his
[cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000), and followeth after me, is not worthy of
me.  

<span id="039">39</span> He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he
that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.  

<span id="040">40</span> He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that
receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.  

<span id="041">41</span> He that receiveth a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) in the name of a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) shall receive a prophet's reward; and
he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall
receive a righteous man's reward.  

<span id="042">42</span> And whosoever shall give to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) unto one of these little ones a
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) of cold water only in the name of a
[disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003), verily I say unto you, he shall in no
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) lose his reward.
