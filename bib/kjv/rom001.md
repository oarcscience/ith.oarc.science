### King James Version: Romans Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), a servant of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), called
to be an [apostle](../ebd/ebd026.htm#008), separated unto the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) of God,  

<span id="002">2</span> (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in
the holy scriptures,)  

<span id="003">3</span> Concerning his Son
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) our Lord,
which was made of the seed of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) according
to the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007);  

<span id="004">4</span> And declared to be the Son of God with power,
according to the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of
[holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006), by the resurrection from the dead:  

<span id="005">5</span> By whom we have received
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) and apostleship, for obedience to the
faith among all nations, for his name:  

<span id="006">6</span> Among whom are ye also the called of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000):  

<span id="007">7</span> To all that be in [Rome](../ebd/ebd315.htm#007),
beloved of God, called to be saints: [Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) to
you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="008">8</span> First, I thank my God through
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) for you
all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.  

<span id="009">9</span> For God is my [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008),
whom I serve with my [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) in the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) of his Son, that without ceasing I make
mention of you always in my prayers;  

<span id="010">10</span> Making request, if by any means now at length I
might have a prosperous [journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001) by the will of
God to come unto you.  

<span id="011">11</span> For I long to see you, that I may impart unto
you some spiritual [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005), to the end ye may be
established;  

<span id="012">12</span> That is, that I may be comforted together with
you by the mutual faith both of you and me.  

<span id="013">13</span> Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren,
that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,)
that I might have some [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) among you also,
even as among other [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001).  

<span id="014">14</span> I am [debtor](../ebd/ebd100.htm#000) both to
the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), and to the unwise.  

<span id="015">15</span> So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach
the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) to you that are at
[Rome](../ebd/ebd315.htm#007) also.  

<span id="016">16</span> For I am not ashamed of the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000): for
it is the power of God unto [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) to every
one that believeth; to the [Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004) first, and also
to the [Greek](../ebd/ebd155.htm#004).  

<span id="017">17</span> For therein is the
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) of God revealed from faith to
faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.  

<span id="018">18</span> For the wrath of God is revealed from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) against all ungodliness and
unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;  

<span id="019">19</span> Because that which may be known of God is
manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.  

<span id="020">20</span> For the invisible things of him from the
[creation](../ebd/ebd092.htm#003) of the world are clearly seen, being
understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and
[Godhead](../ebd/ebd151.htm#006); so that they are without excuse:  

<span id="021">21</span> Because that, when they knew God, they
glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in
their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.  

<span id="022">22</span> Professing themselves to be
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), they became fools,  

<span id="023">23</span> And changed the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006)
of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and
to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.  

<span id="024">24</span> Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness
through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies
between themselves:  

<span id="025">25</span> Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and
worshipped and served the [creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004) more than
the Creator, who is blessed for ever. [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).  

<span id="026">26</span> For this cause God gave them up unto vile
affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that
which is against nature:  

<span id="027">27</span> And likewise also the men, leaving the natural
use of the woman, burned in their [lust](../ebd/ebd233.htm#005) one
toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and
receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.  

<span id="028">28</span> And even as they did not like to retain God in
their knowledge, God gave them over to a
[reprobate](../ebd/ebd311.htm#003) mind, to do those things which are
not convenient;  

<span id="029">29</span> Being filled with all unrighteousness,
[fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008), wickedness,
[covetousness](../ebd/ebd092.htm#000), maliciousness; full of envy,
[murder](../ebd/ebd262.htm#002), debate, deceit, malignity;
whisperers,  

<span id="030">30</span> Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud,
boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,  

<span id="031">31</span> Without understanding, covenantbreakers,
without natural [affection](../ebd/ebd011.htm#004), implacable,
unmerciful:  

<span id="032">32</span> Who knowing the judgment of God, that they
which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but
have pleasure in them that do them.
