### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 26

<span id="001">1</span> In the beginning of the reign of
[Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) the son of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) came this word from the LORD, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the
LORD's house, and speak unto all the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), which come to
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) in the LORD's house, all the words that
I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word:  

<span id="003">3</span> If so be they will hearken, and turn every man
from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to
do unto them because of the evil of their doings.  

<span id="004">4</span> And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the
LORD; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set
before you,  

<span id="005">5</span> To hearken to the words of my servants the
prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending them,
but ye have not hearkened;  

<span id="006">6</span> Then will I make this house like
[Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008), and will make this city a
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) to all the nations of the earth.  

<span id="007">7</span> So the priests and the prophets and all the
people heard [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) speaking these words in
the house of the LORD.  

<span id="008">8</span> Now it came to pass, when
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) had made an end of speaking all that
the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the
priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt
surely die.  

<span id="009">9</span> Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the
LORD, saying, This house shall be like [Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008),
and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the
people were gathered against [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) in the
house of the LORD.  

<span id="010">10</span> When the princes of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) heard these things, then they came up
from the king's house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the
entry of the new [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the LORD's house.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then spake the priests and the prophets unto
the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die;
for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your
ears.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then spake [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006)
unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to
prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye
have heard.  

<span id="013">13</span> Therefore now amend your ways and your doings,
and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of
the evil that he hath pronounced against you.  

<span id="014">14</span> As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with
me as seemeth good and meet unto you.  

<span id="015">15</span> But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to
death, ye shall surely bring innocent [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000)
upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof:
for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words
in your ears.  

<span id="016">16</span> Then said the princes and all the people unto
the priests and to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he
hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then rose up certain of the elders of the land,
and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,  

<span id="018">18</span> [Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005) the Morasthite
prophesied in the days of [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and
spake to all the people of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), saying, Thus
saith the LORD of hosts; [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002) shall be plowed
like a field, and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) shall become heaps,
and the mountain of the house as the high places of a
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006).  

<span id="019">19</span> Did [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and all
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) put him at all to death? did he not fear
the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil
which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil
against our souls.  

<span id="020">20</span> And there was also a man that prophesied in the
name of the LORD, [Urijah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#004) the son of
[Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005) of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied
against this city and against this land according to all the words of
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006).  

<span id="021">21</span> And when [Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), with all his mighty men, and all the
princes, heard his words, the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) sought to
put him to death: but when [Urijah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#004) heard it, he
was afraid, and fled, and went into [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009);  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) sent men into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), namely,
[Elnathan](../ebd/ebd118.htm#009) the son of
[Achbor](../ebd/ebd006.htm#007), and certain men with him into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="023">23</span> And they fetched forth
[Urijah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#004) out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009),
and brought him unto [Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001); who slew him with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and cast his dead body into the graves
of the common people.  

<span id="024">24</span> Nevertheless the hand of
[Ahikam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#001) the son of
[Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004) was with
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006), that they should not give him into
the hand of the people to put him to death.
