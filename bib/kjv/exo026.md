### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 26

<span id="001">1</span> Moreover thou shalt make the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) with ten curtains of fine twined
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), and [blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003), and
purple, and [scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005): with cherubims of cunning
work shalt thou make them.  

<span id="002">2</span> The length of one
[curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004) shall be eight and twenty cubits, and
the breadth of one [curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004) four cubits: and
every one of the curtains shall have one measure.  

<span id="003">3</span> The five curtains shall be coupled together one
to another; and other five curtains shall be coupled one to another.  

<span id="004">4</span> And thou shalt make loops of
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003) upon the edge of the one
[curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004) from the selvedge in the coupling; and
likewise shalt thou make in the uttermost edge of another
[curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004), in the coupling of the second.  

<span id="005">5</span> Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one
[curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004), and fifty loops shalt thou make in the
edge of the [curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004) that is in the coupling of
the second; that the loops may take hold one of another.  

<span id="006">6</span> And thou shalt make fifty
[taches](../ebd/ebd357.htm#001) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and
couple the curtains together with the [taches](../ebd/ebd357.htm#001):
and it shall be one [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003).  

<span id="007">7</span> And thou shalt make curtains of goats' hair to
be a covering upon the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003): eleven
curtains shalt thou make.  

<span id="008">8</span> The length of one
[curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004) shall be thirty cubits, and the breadth
of one [curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004) four cubits: and the eleven
curtains shall be all of one measure.  

<span id="009">9</span> And thou shalt couple five curtains by
themselves, and six curtains by themselves, and shalt double the sixth
[curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004) in the forefront of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003).  

<span id="010">10</span> And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of
the one [curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004) that is outmost in the
coupling, and fifty loops in the edge of the
[curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004) which coupleth the second.  

<span id="011">11</span> And thou shalt make fifty
[taches](../ebd/ebd357.htm#001) of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003), and
put the [taches](../ebd/ebd357.htm#001) into the loops, and couple the
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009) together, that it may be one.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains
of the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009), the half
[curtain](../ebd/ebd094.htm#004) that remaineth, shall hang over the
backside of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003).  

<span id="013">13</span> And a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006) on the one
side, and a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006) on the other side of that
which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009), it shall hang over the sides of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) on this side and on that side, to
cover it.  

<span id="014">14</span> And thou shalt make a covering for the
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009) of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering
above of badgers' skins.  

<span id="015">15</span> And thou shalt make boards for the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of [shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009)
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) standing up.  

<span id="016">16</span> Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and
a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006) and a half shall be the breadth of one
board.  

<span id="017">17</span> Two tenons shall there be in one board, set in
order one against another: thus shalt thou make for all the boards of
the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003).  

<span id="018">18</span> And thou shalt make the boards for the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003), twenty boards on the south side
southward.  

<span id="019">19</span> And thou shalt make forty sockets of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) under the twenty boards; two sockets
under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board
for his two tenons.  

<span id="020">20</span> And for the second side of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) on the north side there shall be
twenty boards:  

<span id="021">21</span> And their forty sockets of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000); two sockets under one board, and two
sockets under another board.  

<span id="022">22</span> And for the sides of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) [westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008)
thou shalt make six boards.  

<span id="023">23</span> And two boards shalt thou make for the corners
of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) in the two sides.  

<span id="024">24</span> And they shall be coupled together beneath, and
they shall be coupled together above the head of it unto one
[ring](../ebd/ebd313.htm#007): thus shall it be for them both; they
shall be for the two corners.  

<span id="025">25</span> And they shall be eight boards, and their
sockets of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), sixteen sockets; two sockets
under one board, and two sockets under another board.  

<span id="026">26</span> And thou shalt make bars of
[shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003); five for
the boards of the one side of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003),  

<span id="027">27</span> And five bars for the boards of the other side
of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003), and five bars for the boards
of the side of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003), for the two
sides [westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008).  

<span id="028">28</span> And the middle bar in the midst of the boards
shall reach from end to end.  

<span id="029">29</span> And thou shalt overlay the boards with
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and make their rings of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) for places for the bars: and thou shalt
overlay the bars with [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="030">30</span> And thou shalt rear up the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) according to the fashion thereof
which was shewed thee in the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007).  

<span id="031">31</span> And thou shalt make a vail of
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003), and purple, and
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005), and fine twined
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008) of cunning work: with cherubims shall it
be made:  

<span id="032">32</span> And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of
[shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) overlaid
with [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001): their hooks shall be of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), upon the four sockets of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000).  

<span id="033">33</span> And thou shalt hang up the vail under the
[taches](../ebd/ebd357.htm#001), that thou mayest bring in thither
within the vail the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008): and the vail shall divide unto you
between the holy place and the most holy.  

<span id="034">34</span> And thou shalt put the
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) seat upon the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008)
in the most holy place.  

<span id="035">35</span> And thou shalt set the table without the vail,
and the [candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001) over against the table on
the side of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) toward the south:
and thou shalt put the table on the north side.  

<span id="036">36</span> And thou shalt make an
[hanging](../ebd/ebd163.htm#001) for the door of the
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009), of [blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003), and

[hanging](../ebd/ebd163.htm#001) five pillars of
[shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and
overlay them with [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and their hooks shall
be of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001): and thou shalt cast five sockets of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003) for them.
