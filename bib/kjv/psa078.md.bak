### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 78

<span id="001">1</span> Give [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004.md), O my people,
to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.  

<span id="002">2</span> I will open my mouth in a
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003.md): I will utter dark sayings of old:  

<span id="003">3</span> Which we have heard and known, and our fathers
have told us.  

<span id="004">4</span> We will not hide them from their children,
shewing to the [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) to come the praises
of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath
done.  

<span id="005">5</span> For he established a
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) in [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md),
and appointed a law in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md), which he
commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their
children:  

<span id="006">6</span> That the [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) to
come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should
arise and declare them to their children:  

<span id="007">7</span> That they might set their hope in God, and not
forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:  

<span id="008">8</span> And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn
and rebellious [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md); a
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008.md) that set not their heart aright, and
whose [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) was not stedfast with God.  

<span id="009">9</span> The children of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md), being armed, and carrying bows, turned
back in the day of battle.  

<span id="010">10</span> They kept not the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md) of God, and refused to walk in his
law;  

<span id="011">11</span> And forgat his works, and his wonders that he
had shewed them.  

<span id="012">12</span> Marvellous things did he in the sight of their
fathers, in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), in the field of
[Zoan](../ebd/ebd395.htm#003.md).  

<span id="013">13</span> He divided the sea, and caused them to pass
through; and he made the waters to stand as an
[heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> In the daytime also he led them with a
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001.md), and all the night with a light of
fire.  

<span id="015">15</span> He clave the rocks in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), and gave them
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md) as out of the great depths.  

<span id="016">16</span> He brought streams also out of the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md), and caused waters to run down like
rivers.  

<span id="017">17</span> And they sinned yet more against him by
provoking the most High in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And they tempted God in their heart by asking
meat for their [lust](../ebd/ebd233.htm#005.md).  

<span id="019">19</span> Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God
furnish a table in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md)?  

<span id="020">20</span> Behold, he smote the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md), that the waters gushed out, and the
streams overflowed; can he give [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006.md) also? can
he provide [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) for his people?  

<span id="021">21</span> Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth:
so a fire was kindled against [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md), and
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) also came up against
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md);  

<span id="022">22</span> Because they believed not in God, and trusted
not in his [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003.md):  

<span id="023">23</span> Though he had commanded the clouds from above,
and opened the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009.md) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md),  

<span id="024">24</span> And had rained down
[manna](../ebd/ebd240.htm#006.md) upon them to eat, and had given them of
the [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md).  

<span id="025">25</span> Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to
the full.  

<span id="026">26</span> He caused an [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000.md) wind
to blow in the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006.md): and by his power he
brought in the south wind.  

<span id="027">27</span> He rained [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md) also
upon them as [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008.md), and feathered fowls like as
the sand of the sea:  

<span id="028">28</span> And he let it fall in the midst of their
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002.md), round about their habitations.  

<span id="029">29</span> So they did eat, and were well filled: for he
gave them their own desire;  

<span id="030">30</span> They were not estranged from their
[lust](../ebd/ebd233.htm#005.md). But while their meat was yet in their
mouths,  

<span id="031">31</span> The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the
fattest of them, and smote down the [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008.md) men
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="032">32</span> For all this they sinned still, and believed
not for his wondrous works.  

<span id="033">33</span> Therefore their days did he consume in vanity,
and their years in trouble.  

<span id="034">34</span> When he slew them, then they sought him: and
they returned and enquired early after God.  

<span id="035">35</span> And they remembered that God was their
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001.md), and the high God their
[redeemer](../ebd/ebd308.htm#008.md).  

<span id="036">36</span> Nevertheless they did flatter him with their
mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.  

<span id="037">37</span> For their heart was not right with him, neither
were they stedfast in his [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008.md).  

<span id="038">38</span> But he, being full of compassion, forgave their
iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) away, and did not stir up all his
wrath.  

<span id="039">39</span> For he remembered that they were but
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007.md); a wind that passeth away, and cometh not
again.  

<span id="040">40</span> How oft did they provoke him in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md), and grieve him in the
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000.md)!  

<span id="041">41</span> Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and
limited the Holy One of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md).  

<span id="042">42</span> They remembered not his hand, nor the day when
he delivered them from the enemy.  

<span id="043">43</span> How he had wrought his signs in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md), and his wonders in the field of
[Zoan](../ebd/ebd395.htm#003.md).  

<span id="044">44</span> And had turned their rivers into
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md); and their floods, that they could not
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009.md).  

<span id="045">45</span> He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which
devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.  

<span id="046">46</span> He gave also their increase unto the
caterpiller, and their labour unto the
[locust](../ebd/ebd231.htm#000.md).  

<span id="047">47</span> He destroyed their vines with
[hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002.md), and their sycomore trees with
[frost](../ebd/ebd138.htm#009.md).  

<span id="048">48</span> He gave up their
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002.md) also to the
[hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002.md), and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.  

<span id="049">49</span> He cast upon them the fierceness of his
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md), wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by
sending evil angels among them.  

<span id="050">50</span> He made a way to his
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md); he spared not their soul from death, but
gave their life over to the pestilence;  

<span id="051">51</span> And smote all the firstborn in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009.md); the chief of their strength in the
tabernacles of [Ham](../ebd/ebd160.htm#003.md):  

<span id="052">52</span> But made his own people to go forth like
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), and guided them in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005.md) like a flock.  

<span id="053">53</span> And he led them on safely, so that they feared
not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.  

<span id="054">54</span> And he brought them to the border of his
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md), even to this mountain, which his
right hand had purchased.  

<span id="055">55</span> He cast out the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005.md) also before them, and divided them an
inheritance by line, and made the tribes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) to dwell in their tents.  

<span id="056">56</span> Yet they tempted and provoked the most high
God, and kept not his testimonies:  

<span id="057">57</span> But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like
their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003.md).  

<span id="058">58</span> For they provoked him to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002.md) with their high places, and moved him to
[jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008.md) with their graven images.  

<span id="059">59</span> When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly
abhorred [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md):  

<span id="060">60</span> So that he forsook the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of [Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008.md),
the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009.md) which he placed among men;  

<span id="061">61</span> And delivered his strength into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002.md), and his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md) into the enemy's hand.  

<span id="062">62</span> He gave his people over also unto the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md); and was wroth with his inheritance.  

<span id="063">63</span> The fire consumed their young men; and their
maidens were not given to marriage.  

<span id="064">64</span> Their priests fell by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003.md); and their
[widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003.md) made no
[lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005.md).  

<span id="065">65</span> Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and
like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md).  

<span id="066">66</span> And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts:
he put them to a perpetual reproach.  

<span id="067">67</span> Moreover he refused the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005.md),
and chose not the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000.md):  

<span id="068">68</span> But chose the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004.md) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007.md)
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002.md) which he loved.  

<span id="069">69</span> And he built his
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005.md) like high palaces, like the earth
which he hath established for ever.  

<span id="070">70</span> He chose [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) also
his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:  

<span id="071">71</span> From following the ewes great with young he
brought him to feed [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007.md) his people, and
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md) his inheritance.  

<span id="072">72</span> So he fed them according to the integrity of
his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
