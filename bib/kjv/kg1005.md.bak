### King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> And [Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003.md)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001.md) sent his
servants unto [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md); for he had heard that
they had anointed him [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md) in the room of his
father: for [Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003.md) was ever a lover of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) sent to
[Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003.md), saying,  

<span id="003">3</span> Thou knowest how that
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) my father could not build an house unto
the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every
side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.  

<span id="004">4</span> But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on
every side, so that there is neither [adversary](../ebd/ebd011.htm#001.md)
nor evil occurrent.  

<span id="005">5</span> And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto
the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004.md) my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will
set upon thy [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001.md) in thy room, he shall build
an house unto my name.  

<span id="006">6</span> Now therefore command thou that they hew me
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md) trees out of
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md); and my servants shall be with thy
servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to
all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us
any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.  

<span id="007">7</span> And it came to pass, when
[Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003.md) heard the words of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), that he rejoiced greatly, and said,
Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath given unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) a [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) son over
this great people.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003.md) sent to
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md), saying, I have considered the things
which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning
timber of [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md), and concerning timber of
[fir](../ebd/ebd133.htm#005.md).  

<span id="009">9</span> My servants shall bring them down from
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md) unto the sea: and I will convey them by
sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause
them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt
accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.  

<span id="010">10</span> So [Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003.md) gave
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007.md) trees
and [fir](../ebd/ebd133.htm#005.md) trees according to all his desire.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) gave
[Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003.md) twenty thousand measures of
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000.md) for food to his household, and twenty
measures of pure oil: thus gave [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) to
[Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003.md) year by year.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the LORD gave
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) wisdom, as he promised him: and there
was peace between [Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003.md) and
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md); and they two made a
[league](../ebd/ebd225.htm#005.md) together.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) raised a [levy](../ebd/ebd228.htm#001.md)
out of all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md); and the
[levy](../ebd/ebd228.htm#001.md) was thirty thousand men.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he sent them to
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md), ten thousand a month by
[courses](../ebd/ebd091.htm#006.md): a month they were in
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001.md), and two months at home: and
[Adoniram](../ebd/ebd009.htm#008.md) was over the
[levy](../ebd/ebd228.htm#001.md).  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md) had
threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand
hewers in the mountains;  

<span id="016">16</span> Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which
were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over
the people that wrought in the work.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed
stones, to lay the foundation of the house.  

<span id="018">18</span> And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did
hew them, and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to
build the house.
