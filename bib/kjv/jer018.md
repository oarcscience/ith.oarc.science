### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> The word which came to
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) from the LORD, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and
there I will cause thee to hear my words.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then I went down to the potter's house, and,
behold, he wrought a work on the wheels.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the vessel that he made of
[clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004) was marred in the hand of the potter: so
he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make
it.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,  

<span id="006">6</span> O house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),
cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold, as the
[clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004) is in the potter's hand, so are ye in mine
hand, O house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="007">7</span> At what instant I shall speak concerning a
nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to
destroy it;  

<span id="008">8</span> If that nation, against whom I have pronounced,
turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do
unto them.  

<span id="009">9</span> And at what instant I shall speak concerning a
nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;  

<span id="010">10</span> If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my
voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit
them.  

<span id="011">11</span> Now therefore go to, speak to the men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and to the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold,
I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now
every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.  

<span id="012">12</span> And they said, There is no hope: but we will
walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of
his evil heart.  

<span id="013">13</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among
the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), who hath heard such things: the
[virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) hath
done a very horrible thing.  

<span id="014">14</span> Will a man leave the
[snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000) of [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001) which
cometh from the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) of the field? or shall the
cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?  

<span id="015">15</span> Because my people hath forgotten me, they have
burned [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) to vanity, and they have caused
them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths,
in a way not cast up;  

<span id="016">16</span> To make their land desolate, and a perpetual
hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his
head.  

<span id="017">17</span> I will scatter them as with an
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) wind before the enemy; I will shew them
the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then said they, Come and let us devise devices
against [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006); for the law shall not perish
from the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), nor counsel from the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), nor the word from the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008). Come, and let us smite him with the
tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.  

<span id="019">19</span> Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the
voice of them that contend with me.  

<span id="020">20</span> Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they
have digged a [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007) for my soul. Remember that I
stood before thee to speak good for them, and to turn away thy wrath
from them.  

<span id="021">21</span> Therefore deliver up their children to the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000), and pour out their
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) by the force of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003); and let their wives be bereaved of their
children, and be [widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003); and let their men be
put to death; let their young men be slain by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) in battle.  

<span id="022">22</span> Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou
shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007) to take me, and hid snares for my feet.  

<span id="023">23</span> Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel
against me to slay me: forgive not their iniquity, neither
[blot](../ebd/ebd061.htm#002) out their [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thus with
them in the time of thine [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002).
