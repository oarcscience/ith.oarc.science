### King James Version: John Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> And the third day there was a marriage in
[Cana](../ebd/ebd070.htm#004) of [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md); and
the mother of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) was there:  

<span id="002">2</span> And both [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) was
called, and his disciples, to the marriage.  

<span id="003">3</span> And when they wanted
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), the mother of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saith unto him, They have no
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md).  

<span id="004">4</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saith unto her,
Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.  

<span id="005">5</span> His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever
he saith unto you, do it.  

<span id="006">6</span> And there were set there six waterpots of
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005.md), after the manner of the purifying of the
Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.  

<span id="007">7</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) saith unto them,
Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear
unto the governor of the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md). And they bare
it.  

<span id="009">9</span> When the ruler of the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) had tasted the water that was made
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md), and knew not whence it was: (but the
servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md) called the bridegroom,  

<span id="010">10</span> And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning
doth set forth good [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md); and when men have
well [drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007.md), then that which is worse: but thou
hast kept the good [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000.md) until now.  

<span id="011">11</span> This beginning of miracles did
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) in [Cana](../ebd/ebd070.htm#004.md) of
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008.md), and manifested forth his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006.md); and his disciples believed on him.  

<span id="012">12</span> After this he went down to
[Capernaum](../ebd/ebd071.htm#007.md), he, and his mother, and his
brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the Jews' [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005.md)
was at hand, and [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) went up to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md).  

<span id="014">14</span> And found in the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) those that sold oxen and
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md) and doves, and the changers of money
[sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009.md):  

<span id="015">15</span> And when he had made a scourge of small cords,
he drove them all out of the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), and the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005.md), and the oxen; and poured out the
changers' money, and overthrew the [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006.md);  

<span id="016">16</span> And said unto them that sold doves, Take these
things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.  

<span id="017">17</span> And his disciples remembered that it was
written, The [zeal](../ebd/ebd388.htm#003.md) of thine house hath eaten me
up.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What
sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?  

<span id="019">19</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) answered and
said unto them, Destroy this [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md), and in
three days I will raise it up.  

<span id="020">20</span> Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was
this [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) in building, and wilt thou rear it
up in three days?  

<span id="021">21</span> But he spake of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004.md) of his body.  

<span id="022">22</span> When therefore he was risen from the dead, his
disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed
the [scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005.md), and the word which
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) had said.  

<span id="023">23</span> Now when he was in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005.md) at the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005), in the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000.md)
day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he
did.  

<span id="024">24</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006.md) did not
commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,  

<span id="025">25</span> And needed not that any should testify of man:
for he knew what was in man.
