### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> The proverbs of [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007.md)
the son of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001.md)
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000.md);  

<span id="002">2</span> To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the
words of understanding;  

<span id="003">3</span> To receive the instruction of wisdom,
[justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007.md), and judgment, and equity;  

<span id="004">4</span> To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man
knowledge and discretion.  

<span id="005">5</span> A [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) man will hear,
and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md) counsels:  

<span id="006">6</span> To understand a
[proverb](../ebd/ebd301.htm#002.md), and the interpretation; the words of
the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004.md), and their dark sayings.  

<span id="007">7</span> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of
knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.  

<span id="008">8</span> My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and
forsake not the law of thy mother:  

<span id="009">9</span> For they shall be an ornament of
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000.md) unto thy head, and chains about thy
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000.md).  

<span id="010">10</span> My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou
not.  

<span id="011">11</span> If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md), let us lurk privily for the innocent
without cause:  

<span id="012">12</span> Let us [swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009.md) them up
alive as the [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008.md); and whole, as those that go
down into the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007.md):  

<span id="013">13</span> We shall find all precious substance, we shall
fill our houses with spoil:  

<span id="014">14</span> Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one
[purse](../ebd/ebd302.htm#008.md):  

<span id="015">15</span> My son, walk not thou in the way with them;
refrain thy foot from their path:  

<span id="016">16</span> For their feet run to evil, and make haste to
shed [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md).  

<span id="017">17</span> Surely in vain the [net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002.md)
is spread in the sight of any [bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000.md).  

<span id="018">18</span> And they lay wait for their own
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000.md); they lurk privily for their own lives.  

<span id="019">19</span> So are the ways of every one that is greedy of
gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.  

<span id="020">20</span> Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice
in the streets:  

<span id="021">21</span> She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in
the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,  

<span id="022">22</span> How long, ye simple ones, will ye love
simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate
knowledge?  

<span id="023">23</span> Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out
my [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009.md) unto you, I will make known my words
unto you.  

<span id="024">24</span> Because I have called, and ye refused; I have
stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;  

<span id="025">25</span> But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and
would none of my reproof:  

<span id="026">26</span> I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock
when your fear cometh;  

<span id="027">27</span> When your fear cometh as desolation, and your
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004.md) cometh as a whirlwind; when
distress and anguish cometh upon you.  

<span id="028">28</span> Then shall they call upon me, but I will not
answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:  

<span id="029">29</span> For that they hated knowledge, and did not
choose the fear of the LORD:  

<span id="030">30</span> They would none of my counsel: they despised
all my reproof.  

<span id="031">31</span> Therefore shall they eat of the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000.md) of their own way, and be filled with
their own devices.  

<span id="032">32</span> For the turning away of the simple shall slay
them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.  

<span id="033">33</span> But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell
safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.
