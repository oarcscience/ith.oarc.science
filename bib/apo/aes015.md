### Apocrypha: Additions to Esther Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> And upon the third day, when she had ended her
prayers, she laid away her mourning garments, and put on her glorious
apparel.

<span id="002">2</span> And being gloriously adorned, after she had
called upon God, who is the beholder and saviour of all things, she took
two maids with her:

<span id="003">3</span> And upon the one she leaned, as carrying herself
daintily;

<span id="004">4</span> And the other followed, bearing up her train.

<span id="005">5</span> And she was ruddy through the perfection of her
beauty, and her countenance was cheerful and very amiable: but her heart
was in anguish for fear.

<span id="006">6</span> Then having passed through all the doors, she
stood before the king, who sat upon his royal throne, and was clothed
with all his robes of majesty, all glittering with gold and precious
stones; and he was very dreadful.

<span id="007">7</span> Then lifting up his countenance that shone with
majesty, he looked very fiercely upon her: and the queen fell down, and
was pale, and fainted, and bowed herself upon the head of the maid that
went before her.

<span id="008">8</span> Then God changed the spirit of the king into
mildness, who in a fear leaped from his throne, and took her in his
arms, till she came to herself again, and comforted her with loving
words and said unto her,

<span id="009">9</span> Esther, what is the matter? I am thy brother, be
of good cheer:

<span id="010">10</span> Thou shalt not die, though our our commandment
be general: come near.

<span id="011">11</span> And so be held up his golden sceptre, and laid
it upon her neck,

<span id="012">12</span> And embraced her, and said, Speak unto me.

<span id="013">13</span> Then said she unto him, I saw thee, my lord, as
an angel of God, and my heart was troubled for fear of thy majesty.

<span id="014">14</span> For wonderful art thou, lord, and thy
countenance is full of grace.

<span id="015">15</span> And as she was speaking, she fell down for
faintness.

<span id="016">16</span> Then the king was troubled, and ail his
servants comforted her.
