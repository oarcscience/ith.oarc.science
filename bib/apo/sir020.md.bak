### Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> There is a reproof that is not comely: again,
some man holdeth his tongue, and he is wise.

<span id="002">2</span> It is much better to reprove, than to be angry
secretly: and he that confesseth his fault shall be preserved from hurt.

<span id="003">3</span> How good is it, when thou art reproved, to shew
repentance! for so shalt thou escape wilful sin.

<span id="004">4</span> As is the lust of an eunuch to deflower a
virgin; so is he that executeth judgment with violence.

<span id="005">5</span> There is one that keepeth silence, and is found
wise: and another by much babbling becometh hateful.

<span id="006">6</span> Some man holdeth his tongue, because he hath not
to answer: and some keepeth silence, knowing his time.

<span id="007">7</span> A wise man will hold his tongue till he see
opportunity: but a babbler and a fool will regard no time.

<span id="008">8</span> He that useth many words shall be abhorred; and
he that taketh to himself authority therein shall be hated.

<span id="009">9</span> There is a sinner that hath good success in evil
things; and there is a gain that turneth to loss.

<span id="010">10</span> There is a gift that shall not profit thee; and
there is a gift whose recompence is double.

<span id="011">11</span> There is an abasement because of glory; and
there is that lifteth up his head from a low estate.

<span id="012">12</span> There is that buyeth much for a little, and
repayeth it sevenfold.

<span id="013">13</span> A wise man by his words maketh him beloved: but
the graces of fools shall be poured out.

<span id="014">14</span> The gift of a fool shall do thee no good when
thou hast it; neither yet of the envious for his necessity: for he
looketh to receive many things for one.

<span id="015">15</span> He giveth little, and upbraideth much; he
openeth his mouth like a crier; to day he lendeth, and to morrow will he
ask it again: such an one is to be hated of God and man.

<span id="016">16</span> The fool saith, I have no friends, I have no
thank for all my good deeds, and they that eat my bread speak evil of
me.

<span id="017">17</span> How oft, and of how many shall he be laughed to
scorn! for he knoweth not aright what it is to have; and it is all one
unto him as if he had it not.

<span id="018">18</span> To slip upon a pavement is better than to slip
with the tongue: so the fall of the wicked shall come speedily.

<span id="019">19</span> An unseasonable tale will always be in the
mouth of the unwise.

<span id="020">20</span> A wise sentence shall be rejected when it
cometh out of a fool's mouth; for he will not speak it in due season.

<span id="021">21</span> There is that is hindered from sinning through
want: and when he taketh rest, he shall not be troubled.

<span id="022">22</span> There is that destroyeth his own soul through
bashfulness, and by accepting of persons overthroweth himself.

<span id="023">23</span> There is that for bashfulness promiseth to his
friend, and maketh him his enemy for nothing.

<span id="024">24</span> A lie is a foul blot in a man, yet it is
continually in the mouth of the untaught.

<span id="025">25</span> A thief is better than a man that is accustomed
to lie: but they both shall have destruction to heritage.

<span id="026">26</span> The disposition of a liar is dishonourable, and
his shame is ever with him.

<span id="027">27</span> A wise man shall promote himself to honour with
his words: and he that hath understanding will please great men.

<span id="028">28</span> He that tilleth his land shall increase his
heap: and he that pleaseth great men shall get pardon for iniquity.

<span id="029">29</span> Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise,
and stop up his mouth that he cannot reprove.

<span id="030">30</span> Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is
hoarded up, what profit is in them both?

<span id="031">31</span> Better is he that hideth his folly than a man
that hideth his wisdom.

<span id="032">32</span> Necessary patience in seeking ing the Lord is
better than he that leadeth his life without a guide.
