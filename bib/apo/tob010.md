### Apocrypha: Tobias Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> Now Tobit his father counted every day: and when
the days of the journey were expired, and they came not,

<span id="002">2</span> Then Tobit said, Are they detained? or is Gabael
dead, and there is no man to give him the money?

<span id="003">3</span> Therefore he was very sorry.

<span id="004">4</span> Then his wife said unto him, My son is dead,
seeing he stayeth long; and she began to wail him, and said,

<span id="005">5</span> Now I care for nothing, my son, since I have let
thee go, the light of mine eyes.

<span id="006">6</span> To whom Tobit said, Hold thy peace, take no
care, for he is safe.

<span id="007">7</span> But she said, Hold thy peace, and deceive me
not; my son is dead. And she went out every day into the way which they
went, and did eat no meat on the daytime, and ceased not whole nights to
bewail her son Tobias, until the fourteen days of the wedding were
expired, which Raguel had sworn that he should spend there. Then Tobias
said to Raguel, Let me go, for my father and my mother look no more to
see me.

<span id="008">8</span> But his father in law said unto him, Tarry with
me, and I will send to thy father, and they shall declare unto him how
things go with thee.

<span id="009">9</span> But Tobias said, No; but let me go to my father.

<span id="010">10</span> Then Raguel arose, and gave him Sara his wife,
and half his goods, servants, and cattle, and money:

<span id="011">11</span> And he blessed them, and sent them away,
saying, The God of heaven give you a prosperous journey, my children.

<span id="012">12</span> And he said to his daughter, Honour thy father
and thy mother in law, which are now thy parents, that I may hear good
report of thee. And he kissed her. Edna also said to Tobias, The Lord of
heaven restore thee, my dear brother, and grant that I may see thy
children of my daughter Sara before I die, that I may rejoice before the
Lord: behold, I commit my daughter unto thee of special trust; where are
do not entreat her evil.
