### Apocrypha: 2 Macabees Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> Not long after the, Lysias the king's protector
and cousin, who also managed the affairs, took sore displeasure for the
things that were done.

<span id="002">2</span> And when he had gathered about fourscore
thousand with all the horsemen, he came against the Jews, thinking to
make the city an habitation of the Gentiles,

<span id="003">3</span> And to make a gain of the temple, as of the
other chapels of the heathen, and to set the high priesthood to sale
every year:

<span id="004">4</span> Not at all considering the power of God but
puffed up with his ten thousands of footmen, and his thousands of
horsemen, and his fourscore elephants.

<span id="005">5</span> So he came to Judea, and drew near to Bethsura,
which was a strong town, but distant from Jerusalem about five furlongs,
and he laid sore siege unto it.

<span id="006">6</span> Now when they that were with Maccabeus heard
that he besieged the holds, they and all the people with lamentation and
tears besought the Lord that he would send a good angel to deliver
Israel.

<span id="007">7</span> Then Maccabeus himself first of all took
weapons, exhorting the other that they would jeopard themselves together
with him to help their brethren: so they went forth together with a
willing mind.

<span id="008">8</span> And as they were at Jerusalem, there appeared
before them on horseback one in white clothing, shaking his armour of
gold.

<span id="009">9</span> Then they praised the merciful God all together,
and took heart, insomuch that they were ready not only to fight with
men, but with most cruel beasts, and to pierce through walls of iron.

<span id="010">10</span> Thus they marched forward in their armour,
having an helper from heaven: for the Lord was merciful unto them

<span id="011">11</span> And giving a charge upon their enemies like
lions, they slew eleven thousand footmen, and sixteen hundred horsemen,
and put all the other to flight.

<span id="012">12</span> Many of them also being wounded escaped naked;
and Lysias himself fled away shamefully, and so escaped.

<span id="013">13</span> Who, as he was a man of understanding, casting
with himself what loss he had had, and considering that the Hebrews
could not be overcome, because the Almighty God helped them, he sent
unto them,

<span id="014">14</span> And persuaded them to agree to all reasonable
conditions, and promised that he would persuade the king that he must
needs be a friend unto them.

<span id="015">15</span> Then Maccabeus consented to all that Lysias
desired, being careful of the common good; and whatsoever Maccabeus
wrote unto Lysias concerning the Jews, the king granted it.

<span id="016">16</span> For there were letters written unto the Jews
from Lysias to this effect: Lysias unto the people of the Jews sendeth
greeting:

<span id="017">17</span> John and Absolom, who were sent from you,
delivered me the petition subscribed, and made request for the
performance of the contents thereof.

<span id="018">18</span> Therefore what things soever were meet to be
reported to the king, I have declared them, and he hath granted as much
as might be.

<span id="019">19</span> And if then ye will keep yourselves loyal to
the state, hereafter also will I endeavour to be a means of your good.

<span id="020">20</span> But of the particulars I have given order both
to these and the other that came from me, to commune with you.

<span id="021">21</span> Fare ye well. The hundred and eight and
fortieth year, the four and twentieth day of the month Dioscorinthius.

<span id="022">22</span> Now the king's letter contained these words:
King Antiochus unto his brother Lysias sendeth greeting:

<span id="023">23</span> Since our father is translated unto the gods,
our will is, that they that are in our realm live quietly, that every
one may attend upon his own affairs.

<span id="024">24</span> We understand also that the Jews would not
consent to our father, for to be brought unto the custom of the
Gentiles, but had rather keep their own manner of living: for the which
cause they require of us, that we should suffer them to live after their
own laws.

<span id="025">25</span> Wherefore our mind is, that this nation shall
be in rest, and we have determined to restore them their temple, that
they may live according to the customs of their forefathers.

<span id="026">26</span> Thou shalt do well therefore to send unto them,
and grant them peace, that when they are certified of our mind, they may
be of good comfort, and ever go cheerfully about their own affairs.

<span id="027">27</span> And the letter of the king unto the nation of
the Jews was after this manner: King Antiochus sendeth greeting unto the
council, and the rest of the Jews:

<span id="028">28</span> If ye fare well, we have our desire; we are
also in good health.

<span id="029">29</span> Menelaus declared unto us, that your desire was
to return home, and to follow your own business:

<span id="030">30</span> Wherefore they that will depart shall have safe
conduct till the thirtieth day of Xanthicus with security.

<span id="031">31</span> And the Jews shall use their own kind of meats
and laws, as before; and none of them any manner of ways shall be
molested for things ignorantly done.

<span id="032">32</span> I have sent also Menelaus, that he may comfort
you.

<span id="033">33</span> Fare ye well. In the hundred forty and eighth
year, and the fifteenth day of the month Xanthicus.

<span id="034">34</span> The Romans also sent unto them a letter
containing these words: Quintus Memmius and Titus Manlius, ambassadors
of the Romans, send greeting unto the people of the Jews.

<span id="035">35</span> Whatsoever Lysias the king's cousin hath
granted, therewith we also are well pleased.

<span id="036">36</span> But touching such things as he judged to be
referred to the king, after ye have advised thereof, send one forthwith,
that we may declare as it is convenient for you: for we are now going to
Antioch.

<span id="037">37</span> Therefore send some with speed, that we may
know what is your mind.

<span id="038">38</span> Farewell. This hundred and eight and fortieth
year, the fifteenth day of the month Xanthicus.
