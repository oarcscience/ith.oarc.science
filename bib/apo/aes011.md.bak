### Apocrypha: Additions to Esther Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> In the fourth year of the reign of Ptolemeus and
Cleopatra, Dositheus, who said he was a priest and Levite, and Ptolemeus
his son, brought this epistle of Phurim, which they said was the same,
and that Lysimachus the son of Ptolemeus, that was in Jerusalem, had
interpreted it.

<span id="002">2</span> In the second year of the reign of Artexerxes
the great, in the first day of the month Nisan, Mardocheus the son of
Jairus, the son of Semei, the son of Cisai, of the tribe of Benjamin,
had a dream;

<span id="003">3</span> Who was a Jew, and dwelt in the city of Susa, a
great man, being a servitor in the king's court.

<span id="004">4</span> He was also one of the captives, which
Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon carried from Jerusalem with Jechonias
king of Judea; and this was his dream:

<span id="005">5</span> Behold a noise of a tumult, with thunder, and
earthquakes, and uproar in the land:

<span id="006">6</span> And, behold, two great dragons came forth ready
to fight, and their cry was great.

<span id="007">7</span> And at their cry all nations were prepared to
battle, that they might fight against the righteous people.

<span id="008">8</span> And lo a day of darkness and obscurity,
tribulation and anguish, affliction and great uproar, upon earth.

<span id="009">9</span> And the whole righteous nation was troubled,
fearing their own evils, and were ready to perish.

<span id="010">10</span> Then they cried unto God, and upon their cry,
as it were from a little fountain, was made a great flood, even much
water.

<span id="011">11</span> The light and the sun rose up, and the lowly
were exalted, and devoured the glorious.

<span id="012">12</span> Now when Mardocheus, who had seen this dream,
and what God had determined to do, was awake, he bare this dream in
mind, and until night by all means was desirous to know it.
