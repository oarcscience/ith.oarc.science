<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: 2 Esdras Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord, I brought this people out of bondage, and I gave them my commandments by menservants the prophets; whom they would not hear, but despised my counsels. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;The mother that bare them saith unto them, Go your way, ye children; for I am a widow and forsaken. </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;I brought you up with gladness; but with sorrow and heaviness have I lost you: for ye have sinned before the Lord your God, and done that thing that is evil before him. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But what shall I now do unto you? I am a widow and forsaken: go your way, O my children, and ask mercy of the Lord. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;As for me, O father, I call upon thee for a witness over the mother of these children, which would not keep my covenant, </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;That thou bring them to confusion, and their mother to a spoil, that there may be no offspring of them. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Let them be scattered abroad among the heathen, let their names be put out of the earth: for they have despised my covenant. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Woe be unto thee, Assur, thou that hidest the unrighteous in thee! O thou wicked people, remember what I did unto Sodom and Gomorrha; </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Whose land lieth in clods of pitch and heaps of ashes: even so also will I do unto them that hear me not, saith the Almighty Lord. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord unto Esdras, Tell my people that I will give them the kingdom of Jerusalem, which I would have given unto Israel. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Their glory also will I take unto me, and give these the everlasting tabernacles, which I had prepared for them. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;They shall have the tree of life for an ointment of sweet savour; they shall neither labour, nor be weary. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Go, and ye shall receive: pray for few days unto you, that they may be shortened: the kingdom is already prepared for you: watch. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Take heaven and earth to witness; for I have broken the evil in pieces, and created the good: for I live, saith the Lord. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Mother, embrace thy children, and bring them up with gladness, make their feet as fast as a pillar: for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And those that be dead will I raise up again from their places, and bring them out of the graves: for I have known my name in Israel. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Fear not, thou mother of the children: for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For thy help will I send my servants Esau and Jeremy, after whose counsel I have sanctified and prepared for thee twelve trees laden with divers fruits, </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And as many fountains flowing with milk and honey, and seven mighty mountains, whereupon there grow roses and lilies, whereby I will fill thy children with joy. </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Do right to the widow, judge for the fatherless, give to the poor, defend the orphan, clothe the naked, </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Heal the broken and the weak, laugh not a lame man to scorn, defend the maimed, and let the blind man come into the sight of my clearness. </P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Keep the old and young within thy walls. </P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Wheresoever thou findest the dead, take them and bury them, and I will give thee the first place in my resurrection. </P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Abide still, O my people, and take thy rest, for thy quietness still come. </P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Nourish thy children, O thou good nurse; stablish their feet. </P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;As for the servants whom I have given thee, there shall not one of them perish; for I will require them from among thy number. </P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Be not weary: for when the day of trouble and heaviness cometh, others shall weep and be sorrowful, but thou shalt be merry and have abundance. </P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;The heathen shall envy thee, but they shall be able to do nothing against thee, saith the Lord. </P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;My hands shall cover thee, so that thy children shall not see hell. </P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Be joyful, O thou mother, with thy children; for I will deliver thee, saith the Lord. </P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Remember thy children that sleep, for I shall bring them out of the sides of the earth, and shew mercy unto them: for I am merciful, saith the Lord Almighty. </P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Embrace thy children until I come and shew mercy unto them: for my wells run over, and my grace shall not fail. </P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;I Esdras received a charge of the Lord upon the mount Oreb, that I should go unto Israel; but when I came unto them, they set me at nought, and despised the commandment of the Lord. </P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And therefore I say unto you, O ye heathen, that hear and understand, look for your Shepherd, he shall give you everlasting rest; for he is nigh at hand, that shall come in the end of the world. </P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Be ready to the reward of the kingdom, for the everlasting light shall shine upon you for evermore. </P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Flee the shadow of this world, receive the joyfulness of your glory: I testify my Saviour openly. </P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;O receive the gift that is given you, and be glad, giving thanks unto him that hath led you to the heavenly kingdom. </P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;Arise up and stand, behold the number of those that be sealed in the feast of the Lord; </P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;Which are departed from the shadow of the world, and have received glorious garments of the Lord. </P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;Take thy number, O Sion, and shut up those of thine that are clothed in white, which have fulfilled the law of the Lord. </P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;The number of thy children, whom thou longedst for, is fulfilled: beseech the power of the Lord, that thy people, which have been called from the beginning, may be hallowed. </P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;I Esdras saw upon the mount Sion a great people, whom I could not number, and they all praised the Lord with songs. </P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;And in the midst of them there was a young man of a high stature, taller than all the rest, and upon every one of their heads he set crowns, and was more exalted; which I marvelled at greatly. </P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;So I asked the angel, and said, Sir, what are these? </P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;He answered and said unto me, These be they that have put off the mortal clothing, and put on the immortal, and have confessed the name of God: now are they crowned, and receive palms. </P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;Then said I unto the angel, What young person is it that crowneth them, and giveth them palms in their hands? </P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;So he answered and said unto me, It is the Son of God, whom they have confessed in the world. Then began I greatly to commend them that stood so stiffly for the name of the Lord. </P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;Then the angel said unto me, Go thy way, and tell my people what manner of things, and how great wonders of the Lord thy God, thou hast seen. </P>
