### Apocrypha: Tobias Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> Then Tobit called his son Tobias, and said unto
him, My son, see that the man have his wages, which went with thee, and
thou must give him more.

<span id="002">2</span> And Tobias said unto him, O father, it is no
harm to me to give him half of those things which I have brought:

<span id="003">3</span> For he hath brought me again to thee in safety,
and made whole my wife, and brought me the money, and likewise healed
thee.

<span id="004">4</span> Then the old man said, It is due unto him.

<span id="005">5</span> So he called the angel, and he said unto him,
Take half of all that ye have brought and go away in safety.

<span id="006">6</span> Then he took them both apart, and said unto
them, Bless God, praise him, and magnify him, and praise him for the
things which he hath done unto you in the sight of all that live. It is
good to praise God, and exalt his name, and honourably to shew forth the
works of God; therefore be not slack to praise him.

<span id="007">7</span> It is good to keep close the secret of a king,
but it is honourable to reveal the works of God. Do that which is good,
and no evil shall touch you.

<span id="008">8</span> Prayer is good with fasting and alms and
righteousness. A little with righteousness is better than much with
unrighteousness. It is better to give alms than to lay up gold:

<span id="009">9</span> For alms doth deliver from death, and shall
purge away all sin. Those that exercise alms and righteousness shall be
filled with life:

<span id="010">10</span> But they that sin are enemies to their own
life.

<span id="011">11</span> Surely I will keep close nothing from you. For
I said, It was good to keep close the secret of a king, but that it was
honourable to reveal the works of God.

<span id="012">12</span> Now therefore, when thou didst pray, and Sara
thy daughter in law, I did bring the remembrance of your prayers before
the Holy One: and when thou didst bury the dead, I was with thee
likewise.

<span id="013">13</span> And when thou didst not delay to rise up, and
leave thy dinner, to go and cover the dead, thy good deed was not hid
from me: but I was with thee.

<span id="014">14</span> And now God hath sent me to heal thee and Sara
thy daughter in law.

<span id="015">15</span> I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels,
which present the prayers of the saints, and which go in and out before
the glory of the Holy One.

<span id="016">16</span> Then they were both troubled, and fell upon
their faces: for they feared.

<span id="017">17</span> But he said unto them, Fear not, for it shall
go well with you; praise God therefore.

<span id="018">18</span> For not of any favour of mine, but by the will
of our God I came; wherefore praise him for ever.

<span id="019">19</span> All these days I did appear unto you; but I did
neither eat nor drink, but ye did see a vision.

<span id="020">20</span> Now therefore give God thanks: for I go up to
him that sent me; but write all things which are done in a book.

<span id="021">21</span> And when they arose, they saw him no more.

<span id="022">22</span> Then they confessed the great and wonderful
works of God, and how the angel of the Lord had appeared unto them.
