### Apocrypha: 1 Macabees Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> Now when Simon heard that Tryphon had gathered
together a great host to invade the land of Judea, and destroy it,

<span id="002">2</span> And saw that the people was in great trembling
and fear, he went up to Jerusalem, and gathered the people together,

<span id="003">3</span> And gave them exhortation, saying, Ye yourselves
know what great things I, and my brethren, and my father's house, have
done for the laws and the sanctuary, the battles also and troubles which
we have seen.

<span id="004">4</span> By reason whereof all my brethren are slain for
Israel's sake, and I am left alone.

<span id="005">5</span> Now therefore be it far from me, that I should
spare mine own life in any time of trouble: for I am no better than my
brethren.

<span id="006">6</span> Doubtless I will avenge my nation, and the
sanctuary, and our wives, and our children: for all the heathen are
gathered to destroy us of very malice.

<span id="007">7</span> Now as soon as the people heard these words,
their spirit revived.

<span id="008">8</span> And they answered with a loud voice, saying,
Thou shalt be our leader instead of Judas and Jonathan thy brother.

<span id="009">9</span> Fight thou our battles, and whatsoever, thou
commandest us, that will we do.

<span id="010">10</span> So then he gathered together all the men of
war, and made haste to finish the walls of Jerusalem, and he fortified
it round about.

<span id="011">11</span> Also he sent Jonathan the son of Absolom, and
with him a great power, to Joppa: who casting out them that were therein
remained there in it.

<span id="012">12</span> So Tryphon removed from Ptolemaus with a great
power to invade the land of Judea, and Jonathan was with him in ward.

<span id="013">13</span> But Simon pitched his tents at Adida, over
against the plain.

<span id="014">14</span> Now when Tryphon knew that Simon was risen up
instead of his brother Jonathan, and meant to join battle with him, he
sent messengers unto him, saying,

<span id="015">15</span> Whereas we have Jonathan thy brother in hold,
it is for money that he is owing unto the king's treasure, concerning
the business that was committed unto him.

<span id="016">16</span> Wherefore now send an hundred talents of
silver, and two of his sons for hostages, that when he is at liberty he
may not revolt from us, and we will let him go.

<span id="017">17</span> Hereupon Simon, albeit he perceived that they
spake deceitfully unto him yet sent he the money and the children, lest
peradventure he should procure to himself great hatred of the people:

<span id="018">18</span> Who might have said, Because I sent him not the
money and the children, therefore is Jonathan dead.

<span id="019">19</span> So he sent them the children and the hundred
talents: howbeit Tryphon dissembled neither would he let Jonathan go.

<span id="020">20</span> And after this came Tryphon to invade the land,
and destroy it, going round about by the way that leadeth unto Adora:
but Simon and his host marched against him in every place, wheresoever
he went.

<span id="021">21</span> Now they that were in the tower sent messengers
unto Tryphon, to the end that he should hasten his coming unto them by
the wilderness, and send them victuals.

<span id="022">22</span> Wherefore Tryphon made ready all his horsemen
to come that night: but there fell a very great snow, by reason whereof
he came not. So he departed, and came into the country of Galaad.

<span id="023">23</span> And when he came near to Bascama he slew
Jonathan, who was buried there.

<span id="024">24</span> Afterward Tryphon returned and went into his
own land.

<span id="025">25</span> Then sent Simon, and took the bones of Jonathan
his brother, and buried them in Modin, the city of his fathers.

<span id="026">26</span> And all Israel made great lamentation for him,
and bewailed him many days.

<span id="027">27</span> Simon also built a monument upon the sepulchre
of his father and his brethren, and raised it aloft to the sight, with
hewn stone behind and before.

<span id="028">28</span> Moreover he set up seven pyramids, one against
another, for his father, and his mother, and his four brethren.

<span id="029">29</span> And in these he made cunning devices, about the
which he set great pillars, and upon the pillars he made all their
armour for a perpetual memory, and by the armour ships carved, that they
might be seen of all that sail on the sea.

<span id="030">30</span> This is the sepulchre which he made at Modin,
and it standeth yet unto this day.

<span id="031">31</span> Now Tryphon dealt deceitfully with the young
king Antiochus, and slew him.

<span id="032">32</span> And he reigned in his stead, and crowned
himself king of Asia, and brought a great calamity upon the land.

<span id="033">33</span> Then Simon built up the strong holds in Judea,
and fenced them about with high towers, and great walls, and gates, and
bars, and laid up victuals therein.

<span id="034">34</span> Moreover Simon chose men, and sent to king
Demetrius, to the end he should give the land an immunity, because all
that Tryphon did was to spoil.

<span id="035">35</span> Unto whom king Demetrius answered and wrote
after this manner:

<span id="036">36</span> King Demetrius unto Simon the high priest, and
friend of kings, as also unto the elders and nation of the Jews, sendeth
greeting:

<span id="037">37</span> The golden crown, and the scarlet robe, which
ye sent unto us, we have received: and we are ready to make a stedfast
peace with you, yea, and to write unto our officers, to confirm the
immunities which we have granted.

<span id="038">38</span> And whatsoever covenants we have made with you
shall stand; and the strong holds, which ye have builded, shall be your
own.

<span id="039">39</span> As for any oversight or fault committed unto
this day, we forgive it, and the crown tax also, which ye owe us: and if
there were any other tribute paid in Jerusalem, it shall no more be
paid.

<span id="040">40</span> And look who are meet among you to be in our
court, let then be enrolled, and let there be peace betwixt us.

<span id="041">41</span> Thus the yoke of the heathen was taken away
from Israel in the hundred and seventieth year.

<span id="042">42</span> Then the people of Israel began to write in
their instruments and contracts, In the first year of Simon the high
priest, the governor and leader of the Jews.

<span id="043">43</span> In those days Simon camped against Gaza and
besieged it round about; he made also an engine of war, and set it by
the city, and battered a certain tower, and took it.

<span id="044">44</span> And they that were in the engine leaped into
the city; whereupon there was a great uproar in the city:

<span id="045">45</span> Insomuch as the people of the city rent their
clothes, and climbed upon the walls with their wives and children, and
cried with a loud voice, beseeching Simon to grant them peace.

<span id="046">46</span> And they said, Deal not with us according to
our wickedness, but according to thy mercy.

<span id="047">47</span> So Simon was appeased toward them, and fought
no more against them, but put them out of the city, and cleansed the
houses wherein the idols were, and so entered into it with songs and
thanksgiving.

<span id="048">48</span> Yea, he put all uncleanness out of it, and
placed such men there as would keep the law, and made it stronger than
it was before, and built therein a dwellingplace for himself.

<span id="049">49</span> They also of the tower in Jerusalem were kept
so strait, that they could neither come forth, nor go into the country,
nor buy, nor sell: wherefore they were in great distress for want of
victuals, and a great number of them perished through famine.

<span id="050">50</span> Then cried they to Simon, beseeching him to be
at one with them: which thing he granted them; and when he had put them
out from thence, he cleansed the tower from pollutions:

<span id="051">51</span> And entered into it the three and twentieth day
of the second month in the hundred seventy and first year, with
thanksgiving, and branches of palm trees, and with harps, and cymbals,
and with viols, and hymns, and songs: because there was destroyed a
great enemy out of Israel.

<span id="052">52</span> He ordained also that that day should be kept
every year with gladness. Moreover the hill of the temple that was by
the tower he made stronger than it was, and there he dwelt himself with
his company.

<span id="053">53</span> And when Simon saw that John his son was a
valiant man, he made him captain of all the hosts; and he dwelt in
Gazera.
