### Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> My son, if thou come to serve the Lord, prepare
thy soul for temptation.

<span id="002">2</span> Set thy heart aright, and constantly endure, and
make not haste in time of trouble.

<span id="003">3</span> Cleave unto him, and depart not away, that thou
mayest be increased at thy last end.

<span id="004">4</span> Whatsoever is brought upon thee take cheerfully,
and be patient when thou art changed to a low estate.

<span id="005">5</span> For gold is tried in the fire, and acceptable
men in the furnace of adversity.

<span id="006">6</span> Believe in him, and he will help thee; order thy
way aright, and trust in him.

<span id="007">7</span> Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; and
go not aside, lest ye fall.

<span id="008">8</span> Ye that fear the Lord, believe him; and your
reward shall not fail.

<span id="009">9</span> Ye that fear the Lord, hope for good, and for
everlasting joy and mercy.

<span id="010">10</span> Look at the generations of old, and see; did
ever any trust in the Lord, and was confounded? or did any abide in his
fear, and was forsaken? or whom did he ever despise, that called upon
him?

<span id="011">11</span> For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy,
longsuffering, and very pitiful, and forgiveth sins, and saveth in time
of affliction.

<span id="012">12</span> Woe be to fearful hearts, and faint hands, and
the sinner that goeth two ways!

<span id="013">13</span> Woe unto him that is fainthearted! for he
believeth not; therefore shall he not be defended.

<span id="014">14</span> Woe unto you that have lost patience! and what
will ye do when the Lord shall visit you?

<span id="015">15</span> They that fear the Lord will not disobey his
Word; and they that love him will keep his ways.

<span id="016">16</span> They that fear the Lord will seek that which is
well, pleasing unto him; and they that love him shall be filled with the
law.

<span id="017">17</span> They that fear the Lord will prepare their
hearts, and humble their souls in his sight,

<span id="018">18</span> Saying, We will fall into the hands of the
Lord, and not into the hands of men: for as his majesty is, so is his
mercy.
