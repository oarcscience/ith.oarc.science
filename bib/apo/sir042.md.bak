### Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 42

<span id="001">1</span> Of these things be not thou ashamed, and accept
no person to sin thereby:

<span id="002">2</span> Of the law of the most High, and his covenant;
and of judgment to justify the ungodly;

<span id="003">3</span> Of reckoning with thy partners and travellers;
or of the gift of the heritage of friends;

<span id="004">4</span> Of exactness of balance and weights; or of
getting much or little;

<span id="005">5</span> And of merchants' indifferent selling; of much
correction of children; and to make the side of an evil servant to
bleed.

<span id="006">6</span> Sure keeping is good, where an evil wife is; and
shut up, where many hands are.

<span id="007">7</span> Deliver all things in number and weight; and put
all in writing that thou givest out, or receivest in.

<span id="008">8</span> Be not ashamed to inform the unwise and foolish,
and the extreme aged that contendeth with those that are young: thus
shalt thou be truly learned, and approved of all men living.

<span id="009">9</span> The father waketh for the daughter, when no man
knoweth; and the care for her taketh away sleep: when she is young, lest
she pass away the flower of her age; and being married, lest she should
be hated:

<span id="010">10</span> In her virginity, lest she should be defiled
and gotten with child in her father's house; and having an husband, lest
she should misbehave herself; and when she is married, lest she should
be barren.

<span id="011">11</span> Keep a sure watch over a shameless daughter,
lest she make thee a laughingstock to thine enemies, and a byword in the
city, and a reproach among the people, and make thee ashamed before the
multitude.

<span id="012">12</span> Behold not every body's beauty, and sit not in
the midst of women.

<span id="013">13</span> For from garments cometh a moth, and from women
wickedness.

<span id="014">14</span> Better is the churlishness of a man than a
courteous woman, a woman, I say, which bringeth shame and reproach.

<span id="015">15</span> I will now remember the works of the Lord, and
declare the things that I have seen: In the words of the Lord are his
works.

<span id="016">16</span> The sun that giveth light looketh upon all
things, and the work thereof is full of the glory of the Lord.

<span id="017">17</span> The Lord hath not given power to the saints to
declare all his marvellous works, which the Almighty Lord firmly
settled, that whatsoever is might be established for his glory.

<span id="018">18</span> He seeketh out the deep, and the heart, and
considereth their crafty devices: for the Lord knoweth all that may be
known, and he beholdeth the signs of the world.

<span id="019">19</span> He declareth the things that are past, and for
to come, and revealeth the steps of hidden things.

<span id="020">20</span> No thought escapeth him, neither any word is
hidden from him.

<span id="021">21</span> He hath garnished the excellent works of his
wisdom, and he is from everlasting to everlasting: unto him may nothing
be added, neither can he be diminished, and he hath no need of any
counsellor.

<span id="022">22</span> Oh how desirable are all his works! and that a
man may see even to a spark.

<span id="023">23</span> All these things live and remain for ever for
all uses, and they are all obedient.

<span id="024">24</span> All things are double one against another: and
he hath made nothing imperfect.

<span id="025">25</span> One thing establisheth the good or another: and
who shall be filled with beholding his glory?
