### Apocrypha: Baruch Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Put off, O Jerusalem, the garment of mourning
and affliction, and put on the comeliness of the glory that cometh from
God for ever.

<span id="002">2</span> Cast about thee a double garment of the
righteousness which cometh from God; and set a diadem on thine head of
the glory of the Everlasting.

<span id="003">3</span> For God will shew thy brightness unto every
country under heaven.

<span id="004">4</span> For thy name shall be called of God for ever The
peace of righteousness, and The glory of God's worship.

<span id="005">5</span> Arise, O Jerusalem, and stand on high, and look
about toward the east, and behold thy children gathered from the west
unto the east by the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the remembrance
of God.

<span id="006">6</span> For they departed from thee on foot, and were
led away of their enemies: but God bringeth them unto thee exalted with
glory, as children of the kingdom.

<span id="007">7</span> For God hath appointed that every high hill, and
banks of long continuance, should be cast down, and valleys filled up,
to make even the ground, that Israel may go safely in the glory of God,

<span id="008">8</span> Moreover even the woods and every sweetsmelling
tree shall overshadow Israel by the commandment of God.

<span id="009">9</span> For God shall lead Israel with joy in the light
of his glory with the mercy and righteousness that cometh from him.
