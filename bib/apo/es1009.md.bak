### Apocrypha: 1 Esdras Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> Then Esdras rising from the court of the temple
went to the chamber of Joanan the son of Eliasib,

<span id="002">2</span> And remained there, and did eat no meat nor
drink water, mourning for the great iniquities of the multitude.

<span id="003">3</span> And there was a proclamation in all Jewry and
Jerusalem to all them that were of the captivity, that they should be
gathered together at Jerusalem:

<span id="004">4</span> And that whosoever met not there within two or
three days according as the elders that bare rule appointed, their
cattle should be seized to the use of the temple, and himself cast out
from them that were of the captivity.

<span id="005">5</span> And in three days were all they of the tribe of
Judah and Benjamin gathered together at Jerusalem the twentieth day of
the ninth month.

<span id="006">6</span> And all the multitude sat trembling in the broad
court of the temple because of the present foul weather.

<span id="007">7</span> So Esdras arose up, and said unto them, Ye have
transgressed the law in marrying strange wives, thereby to increase the
sins of Israel.

<span id="008">8</span> And now by confessing give glory unto the Lord
God of our fathers,

<span id="009">9</span> And do his will, and separate yourselves from
the heathen of the land, and from the strange women.

<span id="010">10</span> Then cried the whole multitude, and said with a
loud voice, Like as thou hast spoken, so will we do.

<span id="011">11</span> But forasmuch as the people are many, and it is
foul weather, so that we cannot stand without, and this is not a work of
a day or two, seeing our sin in these things is spread far:

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore let the rulers of the multitude stay,
and let all them of our habitations that have strange wives come at the
time appointed,

<span id="013">13</span> And with them the rulers and judges of every
place, till we turn away the wrath of the Lord from us for this matter.

<span id="014">14</span> Then Jonathan the son of Azael and Ezechias the
son of Theocanus accordingly took this matter upon them: and Mosollam
and Levis and Sabbatheus helped them.

<span id="015">15</span> And they that were of the captivity did
according to all these things.

<span id="016">16</span> And Esdras the priest chose unto him the
principal men of their families, all by name: and in the first day of
the tenth month they sat together to examine the matter.

<span id="017">17</span> So their cause that held strange wives was
brought to an end in the first day of the first month.

<span id="018">18</span> And of the priests that were come together, and
had strange wives, there were found:

<span id="019">19</span> Of the sons of Jesus the son of Josedec, and
his brethren; Matthelas and Eleazar, and Joribus and Joadanus.

<span id="020">20</span> And they gave their hands to put away their
wives and to offer rams to make reconcilement for their errors.

<span id="021">21</span> And of the sons of Emmer; Ananias, and Zabdeus,
and Eanes, and Sameius, and Hiereel, and Azarias.

<span id="022">22</span> And of the sons of Phaisur; Elionas, Massias
Israel, and Nathanael, and Ocidelus and Talsas.

<span id="023">23</span> And of the Levites; Jozabad, and Semis, and
Colius, who was called Calitas, and Patheus, and Judas, and Jonas.

<span id="024">24</span> Of the holy singers; Eleazurus, Bacchurus.

<span id="025">25</span> Of the porters; Sallumus, and Tolbanes.

<span id="026">26</span> Of them of Israel, of the sons of Phoros;
Hiermas, and Eddias, and Melchias, and Maelus, and Eleazar, and Asibias,
and Baanias.

<span id="027">27</span> Of the sons of Ela; Matthanias, Zacharias, and
Hierielus, and Hieremoth, and Aedias.

<span id="028">28</span> And of the sons of Zamoth; Eliadas, Elisimus,
Othonias, Jarimoth, and Sabatus, and Sardeus.

<span id="029">29</span> Of the sons of Babai; Johannes, and Ananias and
Josabad, and Amatheis.

<span id="030">30</span> Of the sons of Mani; Olamus, Mamuchus, Jedeus,
Jasubus, Jasael, and Hieremoth.

<span id="031">31</span> And of the sons of Addi; Naathus, and Moosias,
Lacunus, and Naidus, and Mathanias, and Sesthel, Balnuus, and Manasseas.

<span id="032">32</span> And of the sons of Annas; Elionas and Aseas,
and Melchias, and Sabbeus, and Simon Chosameus.

<span id="033">33</span> And of the sons of Asom; Altaneus, and
Matthias, and Baanaia, Eliphalet, and Manasses, and Semei.

<span id="034">34</span> And of the sons of Maani; Jeremias, Momdis,
Omaerus, Juel, Mabdai, and Pelias, and Anos, Carabasion, and Enasibus,
and Mamnitanaimus, Eliasis, Bannus, Eliali, Samis, Selemias, Nathanias:
and of the sons of Ozora; Sesis, Esril, Azaelus, Samatus, Zambis,
Josephus.

<span id="035">35</span> And of the sons of Ethma; Mazitias, Zabadaias,
Edes, Juel, Banaias.

<span id="036">36</span> All these had taken strange wives, and they put
them away with their children.

<span id="037">37</span> And the priests and Levites, and they that were
of Israel, dwelt in Jerusalem, and in the country, in the first day of
the seventh month: so the children of Israel were in their habitations.

<span id="038">38</span> And the whole multitude came together with one
accord into the broad place of the holy porch toward the east:

<span id="039">39</span> And they spake unto Esdras the priest and
reader, that he would bring the law of Moses, that was given of the Lord
God of Israel.

<span id="040">40</span> So Esdras the chief priest brought the law unto
the whole multitude from man to woman, and to all the priests, to hear
law in the first day of the seventh month.

<span id="041">41</span> And he read in the broad court before the holy
porch from morning unto midday, before both men and women; and the
multitude gave heed unto the law.

<span id="042">42</span> And Esdras the priest and reader of the law
stood up upon a pulpit of wood, which was made for that purpose.

<span id="043">43</span> And there stood up by him Mattathias, Sammus,
Ananias, Azarias, Urias, Ezecias, Balasamus, upon the right hand:

<span id="044">44</span> And upon his left hand stood Phaldaius, Misael,
Melchias, Lothasubus, and Nabarias.

<span id="045">45</span> Then took Esdras the book of the law before the
multitude: for he sat honourably in the first place in the sight of them
all.

<span id="046">46</span> And when he opened the law, they stood all
straight up. So Esdras blessed the Lord God most High, the God of hosts,
Almighty.

<span id="047">47</span> And all the people answered, Amen; and lifting
up their hands they fell to the ground, and worshipped the Lord.

<span id="048">48</span> Also Jesus, Anus, Sarabias, Adinus, Jacubus,
Sabateas, Auteas, Maianeas, and Calitas, Asrias, and Joazabdus, and
Ananias, Biatas, the Levites, taught the law of the Lord, making them
withal to understand it.

<span id="049">49</span> Then spake Attharates unto Esdras the chief
priest. and reader, and to the Levites that taught the multitude, even
to all, saying,

<span id="050">50</span> This day is holy unto the Lord; (for they all
wept when they heard the law:)

<span id="051">51</span> Go then, and eat the fat, and drink the sweet,
and send part to them that have nothing;

<span id="052">52</span> For this day is holy unto the Lord: and be not
sorrowful; for the Lord will bring you to honour.

<span id="053">53</span> So the Levites published all things to the
people, saying, This day is holy to the Lord; be not sorrowful.

<span id="054">54</span> Then went they their way, every one to eat and
drink, and make merry, and to give part to them that had nothing, and to
make great cheer;

<span id="055">55</span> Because they understood the words wherein they
were instructed, and for the which they had been assembled.
