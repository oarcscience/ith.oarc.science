### Apocrypha: 2 Macabees Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> About that time came Antiochus with dishonour
out of the country of Persia

<span id="002">2</span> For he had entered the city called Persepolis,
and went about to rob the temple, and to hold the city; whereupon the
multitude running to defend themselves with their weapons put them to
flight; and so it happened, that Antiochus being put to flight of the
inhabitants returned with shame.

<span id="003">3</span> Now when he came to Ecbatane, news was brought
him what had happened unto Nicanor and Timotheus.

<span id="004">4</span> Then swelling with anger. he thought to avenge
upon the Jews the disgrace done unto him by those that made him flee.
Therefore commanded he his chariotman to drive without ceasing, and to
dispatch the journey, the judgment of GOd now following him. For he had
spoken proudly in this sort, That he would come to Jerusalem and make it
a common burying place of the Jews.

<span id="005">5</span> But the Lord Almighty, the God of Isreal, smote
him with an incurable and invisible plague: or as soon as he had spoken
these words, a pain of the bowels that was remediless came upon him, and
sore torments of the inner parts;

<span id="006">6</span> And that most justly: for he had tormented other
men's bowels with many and strange torments.

<span id="007">7</span> Howbeit he nothing at all ceased from his
bragging, but still was filled with pride, breathing out fire in his
rage against the Jews, and commanding to haste the journey: but it came
to pass that he fell down from his chariot, carried violently; so that
having a sore fall, all the members of his body were much pained.

<span id="008">8</span> And thus he that a little afore thought he might
command the waves of the sea, (so proud was he beyond the condition of
man) and weigh the high mountains in a balance, was now cast on the
ground, and carried in an horselitter, shewing forth unto all the
manifest power of God.

<span id="009">9</span> So that the worms rose up out of the body of
this wicked man, and whiles he lived in sorrow and pain, his flesh fell
away, and the filthiness of his smell was noisome to all his army.

<span id="010">10</span> And the man, that thought a little afore he
could reach to the stars of heaven, no man could endure to carry for his
intolerable stink.

<span id="011">11</span> Here therefore, being plagued, he began to
leave off his great pride, and to come to the knowledge of himself by
the scourge of God, his pain increasing every moment.

<span id="012">12</span> And when he himself could not abide his own
smell, he said these words, It is meet to be subject unto God, and that
a man that is mortal should not proudly think of himself if he were God.

<span id="013">13</span> This wicked person vowed also unto the Lord,
who now no more would have mercy upon him, saying thus,

<span id="014">14</span> That the holy city (to the which he was going
in haste to lay it even with the ground, and to make it a common
buryingplace,) he would set at liberty:

<span id="015">15</span> And as touching the Jews, whom he had judged
not worthy so much as to be buried, but to be cast out with their
children to be devoured of the fowls and wild beasts, he would make them
all equals to the citizens of Athens:

<span id="016">16</span> And the holy temple, which before he had
spoiled, he would garnish with goodly gifts, and restore all the holy
vessels with many more, and out of his own revenue defray the charges
belonging to the sacrifices:

<span id="017">17</span> Yea, and that also he would become a Jew
himself, and go through all the world that was inhabited, and declare
the power of God.

<span id="018">18</span> But for all this his pains would not cease: for
the just judgment of God was come upon him: therefore despairing of his
health, he wrote unto the Jews the letter underwritten, containing the
form of a supplication, after this manner:

<span id="019">19</span> Antiochus, king and governor, to the good Jews
his citizens wisheth much joy, health, and prosperity:

<span id="020">20</span> If ye and your children fare well, and your
affairs be to your contentment, I give very great thanks to God, having
my hope in heaven.

<span id="021">21</span> As for me, I was weak, or else I would have
remembered kindly your honour and good will returning out of Persia, and
being taken with a grievous disease, I thought it necessary to care for
the common safety of all:

<span id="022">22</span> Not distrusting mine health, but having great
hope to escape this sickness.

<span id="023">23</span> But considering that even my father, at what
time he led an army into the high countries. appointed a successor,

<span id="024">24</span> To the end that, if any thing fell out contrary
to expectation, or if any tidings were brought that were grievous, they
of the land, knowing to whom the state was left, might not be troubled:

<span id="025">25</span> Again, considering how that the princes that
are borderers and neighbours unto my kingdom wait for opportunities, and
expect what shall be the event. I have appointed my son Antiochus king,
whom I often committed and commended unto many of you, when I went up
into the high provinces; to whom I have written as followeth:

<span id="026">26</span> Therefore I pray and request you to remember
the benefits that I have done unto you generally, and in special, and
that every man will be still faithful to me and my son.

<span id="027">27</span> For I am persuaded that he understanding my
mind will favourably and graciously yield to your desires.

<span id="028">28</span> Thus the murderer and blasphemer having
suffered most grievously, as he entreated other men, so died he a
miserable death in a strange country in the mountains.

<span id="029">29</span> And Philip, that was brought up with him,
carried away his body, who also fearing the son of Antiochus went into
Egypt to Ptolemeus Philometor.
