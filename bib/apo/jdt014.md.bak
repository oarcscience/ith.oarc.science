### Apocrypha: Judith Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> Then said Judith unto them, Hear me now, my
brethren, and take this head, and hang it upon the highest place of your
walls.

<span id="002">2</span> And so soon as the morning shall appear, and the
sun shall come forth upon the earth, take ye every one his weapons, and
go forth every valiant man out of the city, and set ye a captain over
them, as though ye would go down into the field toward the watch of the
Assyrians; but go not down.

<span id="003">3</span> Then they shall take their armour, and shall go
into their camp, and raise up the captains of the army of Assur, and
shall run to the tent of Holofernes, but shall not find him: then fear
shall fall upon them, and they shall flee before your face.

<span id="004">4</span> So ye, and all that inhabit the coast of Israel,
shall pursue them, and overthrow them as they go.

<span id="005">5</span> But before ye do these things, call me Achior
the Ammonite, that he may see and know him that despised the house of
Israel, and that sent him to us as it were to his death.

<span id="006">6</span> Then they called Achior out of the house of
Ozias; and when he was come, and saw the head of Holofernes in a man's
hand in the assembly of the people, he fell down on his face, and his
spirit failed.

<span id="007">7</span> But when they had recovered him, he fell at
Judith's feet, and reverenced her, and said, Blessed art thou in all the
tabernacles of Juda, and in all nations, which hearing thy name shall be
astonished.

<span id="008">8</span> Now therefore tell me all the things that thou
hast done in these days. Then Judith declared unto him in the midst of
the people all that she had done, from the day that she went forth until
that hour she spake unto them.

<span id="009">9</span> And when she had left off speaking, the people
shouted with a loud voice, and made a joyful noise in their city.

<span id="010">10</span> And when Achior had seen all that the God of
Israel had done, he believed in God greatly, and circumcised the flesh
of his foreskin, and was joined unto the house of Israel unto this day.

<span id="011">11</span> And as soon as the morning arose, they hanged
the head of Holofernes upon the wall, and every man took his weapons,
and they went forth by bands unto the straits of the mountain.

<span id="012">12</span> But when the Assyrians saw them, they sent to
their leaders, which came to their captains and tribunes, and to every
one of their rulers.

<span id="013">13</span> So they came to Holofernes' tent, and said to
him that had the charge of all his things, Waken now our lord: for the
slaves have been bold to come down against us to battle, that they may
be utterly destroyed.

<span id="014">14</span> Then went in Bagoas, and knocked at the door of
the tent; for he thought that he had slept with Judith.

<span id="015">15</span> But because none answered, he opened it, and
went into the bedchamber, and found him cast upon the floor dead, and
his head was taken from him.

<span id="016">16</span> Therefore he cried with a loud voice, with
weeping, and sighing, and a mighty cry, and rent his garments.

<span id="017">17</span> After he went into the tent where Judith
lodged: and when he found her not, he leaped out to the people, and
cried,

<span id="018">18</span> These slaves have dealt treacherously; one
woman of the Hebrews hath brought shame upon the house of king
Nabuchodonosor: for, behold, Holofernes lieth upon the ground without a
head.

<span id="019">19</span> When the captains of the Assyrians' army heard
these words, they rent their coats and their minds were wonderfully
troubled, and there was a cry and a very great noise throughout the
camp.
