### Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> He that feareth the Lord will do good, and he
that hath the knowledge of the law shall obtain her.

<span id="002">2</span> And as a mother shall she meet him, and receive
him as a wife married of a virgin.

<span id="003">3</span> With the bread of understanding shall she feed
him, and give him the water of wisdom to drink.

<span id="004">4</span> He shall be stayed upon her, and shall not be
moved; and shall rely upon her, and shall not be confounded.

<span id="005">5</span> She shall exalt him above his neighbours, and in
the midst of the congregation shall she open his mouth.

<span id="006">6</span> He shall find joy and a crown of gladness, and
she shall cause him to inherit an everlasting name.

<span id="007">7</span> But foolish men shall not attain unto her, and
sinners shall not see her.

<span id="008">8</span> For she is far from pride, and men that are
liars cannot remember her.

<span id="009">9</span> Praise is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner,
for it was not sent him of the Lord.

<span id="010">10</span> For praise shall be uttered in wisdom, and the
Lord will prosper it.

<span id="011">11</span> Say not thou, It is through the Lord that I
fell away: for thou oughtest not to do the things that he hateth.

<span id="012">12</span> Say not thou, He hath caused me to err: for he
hath no need of the sinful man.

<span id="013">13</span> The Lord hateth all abomination; and they that
fear God love it not.

<span id="014">14</span> He himself made man from the beginning, and
left him in the hand of his counsel;

<span id="015">15</span> If thou wilt, to keep the commandments, and to
perform acceptable faithfulness.

<span id="016">16</span> He hath set fire and water before thee: stretch
forth thy hand unto whether thou wilt.

<span id="017">17</span> Before man is life and death; and whether him
liketh shall be given him.

<span id="018">18</span> For the wisdom of the Lord is great, and he is
mighty in power, and beholdeth all things:

<span id="019">19</span> And his eyes are upon them that fear him, and
he knoweth every work of man.

<span id="020">20</span> He hath commanded no man to do wickedly,
neither hath he given any man licence to sin.
