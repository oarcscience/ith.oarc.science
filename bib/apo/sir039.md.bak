### Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 39

<span id="001">1</span> But he that giveth his mind to the law of the
most High, and is occupied in the meditation thereof, will seek out the
wisdom of all the ancient, and be occupied in prophecies.

<span id="002">2</span> He will keep the sayings of the renowned men:
and where subtil parables are, he will be there also.

<span id="003">3</span> He will seek out the secrets of grave sentences,
and be conversant in dark parables.

<span id="004">4</span> He shall serve among great men, and appear
before princes: he will travel through strange countries; for he hath
tried the good and the evil among men.

<span id="005">5</span> He will give his heart to resort early to the
Lord that made him, and will pray before the most High, and will open
his mouth in prayer, and make supplication for his sins.

<span id="006">6</span> When the great Lord will, he shall be filled
with the spirit of understanding: he shall pour out wise sentences, and
give thanks unto the Lord in his prayer.

<span id="007">7</span> He shall direct his counsel and knowledge, and
in his secrets shall he meditate.

<span id="008">8</span> He shall shew forth that which he hath learned,
and shall glory in the law of the covenant of the Lord.

<span id="009">9</span> Many shall commend his understanding; and so
long as the world endureth, it shall not be blotted out; his memorial
shall not depart away, and his name shall live from generation to
generation.

<span id="010">10</span> Nations shall shew forth his wisdom, and the
congregation shall declare his praise.

<span id="011">11</span> If he die, he shall leave a greater name than a
thousand: and if he live, he shall increase it.

<span id="012">12</span> Yet have I more to say, which I have thought
upon; for I am filled as the moon at the full.

<span id="013">13</span> Hearken unto me, ye holy children, and bud
forth as a rose growing by the brook of the field:

<span id="014">14</span> And give ye a sweet savour as frankincense, and
flourish as a lily, send forth a smell, and sing a song of praise, bless
the Lord in all his works.

<span id="015">15</span> Magnify his name, and shew forth his praise
with the songs of your lips, and with harps, and in praising him ye
shall say after this manner:

<span id="016">16</span> All the works of the Lord are exceeding good,
and whatsoever he commandeth shall be accomplished in due season.

<span id="017">17</span> And none may say, What is this? wherefore is
that? for at time convenient they shall all be sought out: at his
commandment the waters stood as an heap, and at the words of his mouth
the receptacles of waters.

<span id="018">18</span> At his commandment is done whatsoever pleaseth
him; and none can hinder, when he will save.

<span id="019">19</span> The works of all flesh are before him, and
nothing can be hid from his eyes.

<span id="020">20</span> He seeth from everlasting to everlasting; and
there is nothing wonderful before him.

<span id="021">21</span> A man need not to say, What is this? wherefore
is that? for he hath made all things for their uses.

<span id="022">22</span> His blessing covered the dry land as a river,
and watered it as a flood.

<span id="023">23</span> As he hath turned the waters into saltness: so
shall the heathen inherit his wrath.

<span id="024">24</span> As his ways are plain unto the holy; so are
they stumblingblocks unto the wicked.

<span id="025">25</span> For the good are good things created from the
beginning: so evil things for sinners.

<span id="026">26</span> The principal things for the whole use of man's
life are water, fire, iron, and salt, flour of wheat, honey, milk, and
the blood of the grape, and oil, and clothing.

<span id="027">27</span> All these things are for good to the godly: so
to the sinners they are turned into evil.

<span id="028">28</span> There be spirits that are created for
vengeance, which in their fury lay on sore strokes; in the time of
destruction they pour out their force, and appease the wrath of him that
made them.

<span id="029">29</span> Fire, and hail, and famine, and death, all
these were created for vengeance;

<span id="030">30</span> Teeth of wild beasts, and scorpions, serpents,
and the sword punishing the wicked to destruction.

<span id="031">31</span> They shall rejoice in his commandment, and they
shall be ready upon earth, when need is; and when their time is come,
they shall not transgress his word.

<span id="032">32</span> Therefore from the beginning I was resolved,
and thought upon these things, and have left them in writing.

<span id="033">33</span> All the works of the Lord are good: and he will
give every needful thing in due season.

<span id="034">34</span> So that a man cannot say, This is worse than
that: for in time they shall all be well approved.

<span id="035">35</span> And therefore praise ye the Lord with the whole
heart and mouth, and bless the name of the Lord.
