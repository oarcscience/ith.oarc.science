### Apocrypha: Additions to Esther Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> And Mardocheus took his rest in the court with
Gabatha and Tharra, the two eunuchs of the king, and keepers of the
palace.

<span id="002">2</span> And he heard their devices, and searched out
their purposes, and learned that they were about to lay hands upon
Artexerxes the king; and so he certified the king of them.

<span id="003">3</span> Then the king examined the two eunuchs, and
after that they had confessed it, they were strangled.

<span id="004">4</span> And the king made a record of these things, and
Mardocheus also wrote thereof.

<span id="005">5</span> So the king commanded, Mardocheus to serve in
the court, and for this he rewarded him.

<span id="006">6</span> Howbeit Aman the son of Amadathus the Agagite,
who was in great honour with the king, sought to molest Mardocheus and
his people because of the two eunuchs of the king.
