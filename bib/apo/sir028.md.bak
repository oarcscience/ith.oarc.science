### Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 28

<span id="001">1</span> He that revengeth shall find vengeance from the
Lord, and he will surely keep his sins \[in remembrance.\]

<span id="002">2</span> Forgive thy neighbour the hurt that he hath done
unto thee, so shall thy sins also be forgiven when thou prayest.

<span id="003">3</span> One man beareth hatred against another, and doth
he seek pardon from the Lord?

<span id="004">4</span> He sheweth no mercy to a man, which is like
himself: and doth he ask forgiveness of his own sins?

<span id="005">5</span> If he that is but flesh nourish hatred, who will
intreat for pardon of his sins?

<span id="006">6</span> Remember thy end, and let enmity cease;
\[remember\] corruption and death, and abide in the commandments.

<span id="007">7</span> Remember the commandments, and bear no malice to
thy neighbour: \[remember\] the covenant of the Highest, and wink at
ignorance.

<span id="008">8</span> Abstain from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy
sins: for a furious man will kindle strife,

<span id="009">9</span> A sinful man disquieteth friends, and maketh
debate among them that be at peace.

<span id="010">10</span> As the matter of the fire is, so it burneth:
and as a man's strength is, so is his wrath; and according to his riches
his anger riseth; and the stronger they are which contend, the more they
will be inflamed.

<span id="011">11</span> An hasty contention kindleth a fire: and an
hasty fighting sheddeth blood.

<span id="012">12</span> If thou blow the spark, it shall burn: if thou
spit upon it, it shall be quenched: and both these come out of thy
mouth.

<span id="013">13</span> Curse the whisperer and doubletongued: for such
have destroyed many that were at peace.

<span id="014">14</span> A backbiting tongue hath disquieted many, and
driven them from nation to nation: strong cities hath it pulled down,
and overthrown the houses of great men.

<span id="015">15</span> A backbiting tongue hath cast out virtuous
women, and deprived them of their labours.

<span id="016">16</span> Whoso hearkeneth unto it shall never find rest,
and never dwell quietly.

<span id="017">17</span> The stroke of the whip maketh marks in the
flesh: but the stroke of the tongue breaketh the bones.

<span id="018">18</span> Many have fallen by the edge of the sword: but
not so many as have fallen by the tongue.

<span id="019">19</span> Well is he that is defended through the venom
thereof; who hath not drawn the yoke thereof, nor hath been bound in her
bands.

<span id="020">20</span> For the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron, and the
bands thereof are bands of brass.

<span id="021">21</span> The death thereof is an evil death, the grave
were better than it.

<span id="022">22</span> It shall not have rule over them that fear God,
neither shall they be burned with the flame thereof.

<span id="023">23</span> Such as forsake the Lord shall fall into it;
and it shall burn in them, and not be quenched; it shall be sent upon
them as a lion, and devour them as a leopard.

<span id="024">24</span> Look that thou hedge thy possession about with
thorns, and bind up thy silver and gold,

<span id="025">25</span> And weigh thy words in a balance, and make a
door and bar for thy mouth.

<span id="026">26</span> Beware thou slide not by it, lest thou fall
before him that lieth in wait.
