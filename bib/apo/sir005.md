### Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Set thy heart upon thy goods; and say not, I
have enough for my life.

<span id="002">2</span> Follow not thine own mind and thy strength, to
walk in the ways of thy heart:

<span id="003">3</span> And say not, Who shall controul me for my works?
for the Lord will surely revenge thy pride.

<span id="004">4</span> Say not, I have sinned, and what harm hath
happened unto me? for the Lord is longsuffering, he will in no wise let
thee go.

<span id="005">5</span> Concerning propitiation, be not without fear to
add sin unto sin:

<span id="006">6</span> And say not His mercy is great; he will be
pacified for the multitude of my sins: for mercy and wrath come from
him, and his indignation resteth upon sinners.

<span id="007">7</span> Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord, and put
not off from day to day: for suddenly shall the wrath of the Lord come
forth, and in thy security thou shalt be destroyed, and perish in the
day of vengeance.

<span id="008">8</span> Set not thine heart upon goods unjustly gotten,
for they shall not profit thee in the day of calamity.

<span id="009">9</span> Winnow not with every wind, and go not into
every way: for so doth the sinner that hath a double tongue.

<span id="010">10</span> Be stedfast in thy understanding; and let thy
word be the same.

<span id="011">11</span> Be swift to hear; and let thy life be sincere;
and with patience give answer.

<span id="012">12</span> If thou hast understanding, answer thy
neighbour; if not, lay thy hand upon thy mouth.

<span id="013">13</span> Honour and shame is in talk: and the tongue of
man is his fall.

<span id="014">14</span> Be not called a whisperer, and lie not in wait
with thy tongue: for a foul shame is upon the thief, and an evil
condemnation upon the double tongue.

<span id="015">15</span> Be not ignorant of any thing in a great matter
or a small.
