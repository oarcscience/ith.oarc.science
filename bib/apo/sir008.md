### Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> Strive not with a mighty man' lest thou fall
into his hands.

<span id="002">2</span> Be not at variance with a rich man, lest he
overweigh thee: for gold hath destroyed many, and perverted the hearts
of kings.

<span id="003">3</span> Strive not with a man that is full of tongue,
and heap not wood upon his fire.

<span id="004">4</span> Jest not with a rude man, lest thy ancestors be
disgraced.

<span id="005">5</span> Reproach not a man that turneth from sin, but
remember that we are all worthy of punishment.

<span id="006">6</span> Dishonour not a man in his old age: for even
some of us wax old.

<span id="007">7</span> Rejoice not over thy greatest enemy being dead,
but remember that we die all.

<span id="008">8</span> Despise not the discourse of the wise, but
acquaint thyself with their proverbs: for of them thou shalt learn
instruction, and how to serve great men with ease.

<span id="009">9</span> Miss not the discourse of the elders: for they
also learned of their fathers, and of them thou shalt learn
understanding, and to give answer as need requireth.

<span id="010">10</span> Kindle not the coals of a sinner, lest thou be
burnt with the flame of his fire.

<span id="011">11</span> Rise not up \[in anger\] at the presence of an
injurious person, lest he lie in wait to entrap thee in thy words

<span id="012">12</span> Lend not unto him that is mightier than
thyself; for if thou lendest him, count it but lost.

<span id="013">13</span> Be not surety above thy power: for if thou be
surety, take care to pay it.

<span id="014">14</span> Go not to law with a judge; for they will judge
for him according to his honour.

<span id="015">15</span> Travel not by the way with a bold fellow, lest
he become grievous unto thee: for he will do according to his own will,
and thou shalt perish with him through his folly.

<span id="016">16</span> Strive not with an angry man, and go not with
him into a solitary place: for blood is as nothing in his sight, and
where there is no help, he will overthrow thee.

<span id="017">17</span> Consult not with a fool; for he cannot keep
counsel.

<span id="018">18</span> Do no secret thing before a stranger; for thou
knowest not what he will bring forth.

<span id="019">19</span> Open not thine heart to every man, lest he
requite thee with a shrewd turn.
