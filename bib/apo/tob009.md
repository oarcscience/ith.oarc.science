### Apocrypha: Tobias Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> Then Tobias called Raphael, and said unto him,

<span id="002">2</span> Brother Azarias, take with thee a servant, and
two camels, and go to Rages of Media to Gabael, and bring me the money,
and bring him to the wedding.

<span id="003">3</span> For Raguel hath sworn that I shall not depart.

<span id="004">4</span> But my father counteth the days; and if I tarry
long, he will be very sorry.

<span id="005">5</span> So Raphael went out, and lodged with Gabael, and
gave him the handwriting: who brought forth bags which were sealed up,
and gave them to him.

<span id="006">6</span> And early in the morning they went forth both
together, and came to the wedding: and Tobias blessed his wife.
