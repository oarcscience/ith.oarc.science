### Apocrypha: Wisdom Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> As for the ungodly, wrath came upon them without
mercy unto the end: for he knew before what they would do;

<span id="002">2</span> How that having given them leave to depart, and
sent them hastily away, they would repent and pursue them.

<span id="003">3</span> For whilst they were yet mourning and making
lamentation at the graves of the dead, they added another foolish
device, and pursued them as fugitives, whom they had intreated to be
gone.

<span id="004">4</span> For the destiny, whereof they were worthy, drew
them unto this end, and made them forget the things that had already
happened, that they might fulfil the punishment which was wanting to
their torments:

<span id="005">5</span> And that thy people might pass a wonderful way:
but they might find a strange death.

<span id="006">6</span> For the whole creature in his proper kind was
fashioned again anew, serving the peculiar commandments that were given
unto them, that thy children might be kept without hurt:

<span id="007">7</span> As namely, a cloud shadowing the camp; and where
water stood before, dry land appeared; and out of the Red sea a way
without impediment; and out of the violent stream a green field:

<span id="008">8</span> Wherethrough all the people went that were
defended with thy hand, seeing thy marvellous strange wonders.

<span id="009">9</span> For they went at large like horses, and leaped
like lambs, praising thee, O Lord, who hadst delivered them.

<span id="010">10</span> For they were yet mindful of the things that
were done while they sojourned in the strange land, how the ground
brought forth flies instead of cattle, and how the river cast up a
multitude of frogs instead of fishes.

<span id="011">11</span> But afterwards they saw a new generation of
fowls, when, being led with their appetite, they asked delicate meats.

<span id="012">12</span> For quails came up unto them from the sea for
their contentment.

<span id="013">13</span> And punishments came upon the sinners not
without former signs by the force of thunders: for they suffered justly
according to their own wickedness, insomuch as they used a more hard and
hateful behaviour toward strangers.

<span id="014">14</span> For the Sodomites did not receive those, whom
they knew not when they came: but these brought friends into bondage,
that had well deserved of them.

<span id="015">15</span> And not only so, but peradventure some respect
shall be had of those, because they used strangers not friendly:

<span id="016">16</span> But these very grievously afflicted them, whom
they had received with feastings, and were already made partakers of the
same laws with them.

<span id="017">17</span> Therefore even with blindness were these
stricken, as those were at the doors of the righteous man: when, being
compassed about with horrible great darkness, every one sought the
passage of his own doors.

<span id="018">18</span> For the elements were changed in themselves by
a kind of harmony, like as in a psaltery notes change the name of the
tune, and yet are always sounds; which may well be perceived by the
sight of the things that have been done.

<span id="019">19</span> For earthly things were turned into watery, and
the things, that before swam in the water, now went upon the ground.

<span id="020">20</span> The fire had power in the water, forgetting his
own virtue: and the water forgat his own quenching nature.

<span id="021">21</span> On the other side, the flames wasted not the
flesh of the corruptible living things, though they walked therein;
neither melted they the icy kind of heavenly meat that was of nature apt
to melt.

<span id="022">22</span> For in all things, O Lord, thou didst magnify
thy people, and glorify them, neither didst thou lightly regard them:
but didst assist them in every time and place.
