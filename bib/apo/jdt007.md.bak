### Apocrypha: Judith Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> The next day Holofernes commanded all his army,
and all his people which were come to take his part, that they should
remove their camp against Bethulia, to take aforehand the ascents of the
hill country, and to make war against the children of Israel.

<span id="002">2</span> Then their strong men removed their camps in
that day, and the army of the men of war was an hundred and seventy
thousand footmen, and twelve thousand horsemen, beside the baggage, and
other men that were afoot among them, a very great multitude.

<span id="003">3</span> And they camped in the valley near unto
Bethulia, by the fountain, and they spread themselves in breadth over
Dothaim even to Belmaim, and in length from Bethulia unto Cynamon, which
is over against Esdraelon.

<span id="004">4</span> Now the children of Israel, when they saw the
multitude of them, were greatly troubled, and said every one to his
neighbour, Now will these men lick up the face of the earth; for neither
the high mountains, nor the valleys, nor the hills, are able to bear
their weight.

<span id="005">5</span> Then every man took up his weapons of war, and
when they had kindled fires upon their towers, they remained and watched
all that night.

<span id="006">6</span> But in the second day Holofernes brought forth
all his horsemen in the sight of the children of Israel which were in
Bethulia,

<span id="007">7</span> And viewed the passages up to the city, and came
to the fountains of their waters, and took them, and set garrisons of
men of war over them, and he himself removed toward his people.

<span id="008">8</span> Then came unto him all the chief of the children
of Esau, and all the governors of the people of Moab, and the captains
of the sea coast, and said,

<span id="009">9</span> Let our lord now hear a word, that there be not
an overthrow in thine army.

<span id="010">10</span> For this people of the children of Israel do
not trust in their spears, but in the height of the mountains wherein
they dwell, because it is not easy to come up to the tops of their
mountains.

<span id="011">11</span> Now therefore, my lord, fight not against them
in battle array, and there shall not so much as one man of thy people
perish.

<span id="012">12</span> Remain in thy camp, and keep all the men of
thine army, and let thy servants get into their hands the fountain of
water, which issueth forth of the foot of the mountain:

<span id="013">13</span> For all the inhabitants of Bethulia have their
water thence; so shall thirst kill them, and they shall give up their
city, and we and our people shall go up to the tops of the mountains
that are near, and will camp upon them, to watch that none go out of the
city.

<span id="014">14</span> So they and their wives and their children
shall be consumed with fire, and before the sword come against them,
they shall be overthrown in the streets where they dwell.

<span id="015">15</span> Thus shalt thou render them an evil reward;
because they rebelled, and met not thy person peaceably.

<span id="016">16</span> And these words pleased Holofernes and all his
servants, and he appointed to do as they had spoken.

<span id="017">17</span> So the camp of the children of Ammon departed,
and with them five thousand of the Assyrians, and they pitched in the
valley, and took the waters, and the fountains of the waters of the
children of Israel.

<span id="018">18</span> Then the children of Esau went up with the
children of Ammon, and camped in the hill country over against Dothaim:
and they sent some of them toward the south, and toward the east over
against Ekrebel, which is near unto Chusi, that is upon the brook
Mochmur; and the rest of the army of the Assyrians camped in the plain,
and covered the face of the whole land; and their tents and carriages
were pitched to a very great multitude.

<span id="019">19</span> Then the children of Israel cried unto the Lord
their God, because their heart failed, for all their enemies had
compassed them round about, and there was no way to escape out from
among them.

<span id="020">20</span> Thus all the company of Assur remained about
them, both their footmen, chariots, and horsemen, four and thirty days,
so that all their vessels of water failed all the inhibitants of
Bethulia.

<span id="021">21</span> And the cisterns were emptied, and they had not
water to drink their fill for one day; for they gave them drink by
measure.

<span id="022">22</span> Therefore their young children were out of
heart, and their women and young men fainted for thirst, and fell down
in the streets of the city, and by the passages of the gates, and there
was no longer any strength in them.

<span id="023">23</span> Then all the people assembled to Ozias, and to
the chief of the city, both young men, and women, and children, and
cried with a loud voice, and said before all the elders,

<span id="024">24</span> God be judge between us and you: for ye have
done us great injury, in that ye have not required peace of the children
of Assur.

<span id="025">25</span> For now we have no helper: but God hath sold us
into their hands, that we should be thrown down before them with thirst
and great destruction.

<span id="026">26</span> Now therefore call them unto you, and deliver
the whole city for a spoil to the people of Holofernes, and to all his
army.

<span id="027">27</span> For it is better for us to be made a spoil unto
them, than to die for thirst: for we will be his servants, that our
souls may live, and not see the death of our infants before our eyes,
nor our wives nor our children to die.

<span id="028">28</span> We take to witness against you the heaven and
the earth, and our God and Lord of our fathers, which punisheth us
according to our sins and the sins of our fathers, that he do not
according as we have said this day.

<span id="029">29</span> Then there was great weeping with one consent
in the midst of the assembly; and they cried unto the Lord God with a
loud voice.

<span id="030">30</span> Then said Ozias to them, Brethren, be of good
courage, let us yet endure five days, in the which space the Lord our
God may turn his mercy toward us; for he will not forsake us utterly.

<span id="031">31</span> And if these days pass, and there come no help
unto us, I will do according to your word.

<span id="032">32</span> And he dispersed the people, every one to their
own charge; and they went unto the walls and towers of their city, and
sent the women and children into their houses: and they were very low
brought in the city.
