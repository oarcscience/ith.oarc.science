### Apocrypha: 1 Macabees Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Then his son Judas, called Maccabeus, rose up in
his stead.

<span id="002">2</span> And all his brethren helped him, and so did all
they that held with his father, and they fought with cheerfulness the
battle of Israel.

<span id="003">3</span> So he gat his people great honour, and put on a
breastplate as a giant, and girt his warlike harness about him, and he
made battles, protecting the host with his sword.

<span id="004">4</span> In his acts he was like a lion, and like a
lion's whelp roaring for his prey.

<span id="005">5</span> For He pursued the wicked, and sought them out,
and burnt up those that vexed his people.

<span id="006">6</span> Wherefore the wicked shrunk for fear of him, and
all the workers of iniquity were troubled, because salvation prospered
in his hand.

<span id="007">7</span> He grieved also many kings, and made Jacob glad
with his acts, and his memorial is blessed for ever.

<span id="008">8</span> Moreover he went through the cities of Juda,
destroying the ungodly out of them, and turning away wrath from Israel:

<span id="009">9</span> So that he was renowned unto the utmost part of
the earth, and he received unto him such as were ready to perish.

<span id="010">10</span> Then Apollonius gathered the Gentiles together,
and a great host out of Samaria, to fight against Israel.

<span id="011">11</span> Which thing when Judas perceived, he went forth
to meet him, and so he smote him, and slew him: many also fell down
slain, but the rest fled.

<span id="012">12</span> Wherefore Judas took their spoils, and
Apollonius' sword also, and therewith he fought all his life long.

<span id="013">13</span> Now when Seron, a prince of the army of Syria,
heard say that Judas had gathered unto him a multitude and company of
the faithful to go out with him to war;

<span id="014">14</span> He said, I will get me a name and honour in the
kingdom; for I will go fight with Judas and them that are with him, who
despise the king's commandment.

<span id="015">15</span> So he made him ready to go up, and there went
with him a mighty host of the ungodly to help him, and to be avenged of
the children of Israel.

<span id="016">16</span> And when he came near to the going up of
Bethhoron, Judas went forth to meet him with a small company:

<span id="017">17</span> Who, when they saw the host coming to meet
them, said unto Judas, How shall we be able, being so few, to fight
against so great a multitude and so strong, seeing we are ready to faint
with fasting all this day?

<span id="018">18</span> Unto whom Judas answered, It is no hard matter
for many to be shut up in the hands of a few; and with the God of heaven
it is all one, to deliver with a great multitude, or a small company:

<span id="019">19</span> For the victory of battle standeth not in the
multitude of an host; but strength cometh from heaven.

<span id="020">20</span> They come against us in much pride and iniquity
to destroy us, and our wives and children, and to spoil us:

<span id="021">21</span> But we fight for our lives and our laws.

<span id="022">22</span> Wherefore the Lord himself will overthrow them
before our face: and as for you, be ye not afraid of them.

<span id="023">23</span> Now as soon as he had left off speaking, he
leapt suddenly upon them, and so Seron and his host was overthrown
before him.

<span id="024">24</span> And they pursued them from the going down of
Bethhoron unto the plain, where were slain about eight hundred men of
them; and the residue fled into the land of the Philistines.

<span id="025">25</span> Then began the fear of Judas and his brethren,
and an exceeding great dread, to fall upon the nations round about them:

<span id="026">26</span> Insomuch as his fame came unto the king, and
all nations talked of the battles of Judas.

<span id="027">27</span> Now when king Antiochus heard these things, he
was full of indignation: wherefore he sent and gathered together all the
forces of his realm, even a very strong army.

<span id="028">28</span> He opened also his treasure, and gave his
soldiers pay for a year, commanding them to be ready whensoever he
should need them.

<span id="029">29</span> Nevertheless, when he saw that the money of his
treasures failed and that the tributes in the country were small,
because of the dissension and plague, which he had brought upon the land
in taking away the laws which had been of old time;

<span id="030">30</span> He feared that he should not be able to bear
the charges any longer, nor to have such gifts to give so liberally as
he did before: for he had abounded above the kings that were before him.

<span id="031">31</span> Wherefore, being greatly perplexed in his mind,
he determined to go into Persia, there to take the tributes of the
countries, and to gather much money.

<span id="032">32</span> So he left Lysias, a nobleman, and one of the
blood royal, to oversee the affairs of the king from the river Euphrates
unto the borders of Egypt:

<span id="033">33</span> And to bring up his son Antiochus, until he
came again.

<span id="034">34</span> Moreover he delivered unto him the half of his
forces, and the elephants, and gave him charge of all things that he
would have done, as also concerning them that dwelt in Juda and
Jerusalem:

<span id="035">35</span> To wit, that he should send an army against
them, to destroy and root out the strength of Israel, and the remnant of
Jerusalem, and to take away their memorial from that place;

<span id="036">36</span> And that he should place strangers in all their
quarters, and divide their land by lot.

<span id="037">37</span> So the king took the half of the forces that
remained, and departed from Antioch, his royal city, the hundred forty
and seventh year; and having passed the river Euphrates, he went through
the high countries.

<span id="038">38</span> Then Lysias chose Ptolemee the son of
Dorymenes, Nicanor, and Gorgias, mighty men of the king's friends:

<span id="039">39</span> And with them he sent forty thousand footmen,
and seven thousand horsemen, to go into the land of Juda, and to destroy
it, as the king commanded.

<span id="040">40</span> So they went forth with all their power, and
came and pitched by Emmaus in the plain country.

<span id="041">41</span> And the merchants of the country, hearing the
fame of them, took silver and gold very much, with servants, and came
into the camp to buy the children of Israel for slaves: a power also of
Syria and of the land of the Philistines joined themselves unto them.

<span id="042">42</span> Now when Judas and his brethren saw that
miseries were multiplied, and that the forces did encamp themselves in
their borders: for they knew how the king had given commandment to
destroy the people, and utterly abolish them;

<span id="043">43</span> They said one to another, Let us restore the
decayed fortune of our people, and let us fight for our people and the
sanctuary.

<span id="044">44</span> Then was the congregation gathered together,
that they might be ready for battle, and that they might pray, and ask
mercy and compassion.

<span id="045">45</span> Now Jerusalem lay void as a wilderness, there
was none of her children that went in or out: the sanctuary also was
trodden down, and aliens kept the strong hold; the heathen had their
habitation in that place; and joy was taken from Jacob, and the pipe
with the harp ceased.

<span id="046">46</span> Wherefore the Israelites assembled themselves
together, and came to Maspha, over against Jerusalem; for in Maspha was
the place where they prayed aforetime in Israel.

<span id="047">47</span> Then they fasted that day, and put on
sackcloth, and cast ashes upon their heads, and rent their clothes,

<span id="048">48</span> And laid open the book of the law, wherein the
heathen had sought to paint the likeness of their images.

<span id="049">49</span> They brought also the priests' garments, and
the firstfruits, and the tithes: and the Nazarites they stirred up, who
had accomplished their days.

<span id="050">50</span> Then cried they with a loud voice toward
heaven, saying, What shall we do with these, and whither shall we carry
them away?

<span id="051">51</span> For thy sanctuary is trodden down and profaned,
and thy priests are in heaviness, and brought low.

<span id="052">52</span> And lo, the heathen are assembled together
against us to destroy us: what things they imagine against us, thou
knowest.

<span id="053">53</span> How shall we be able to stand against them,
except thou, O God, be our help?

<span id="054">54</span> Then sounded they with trumpets, and cried with
a loud voice.

<span id="055">55</span> And after this Judas ordained captains over the
people, even captains over thousands, and over hundreds, and over
fifties, and over tens.

<span id="056">56</span> But as for such as were building houses, or had
betrothed wives, or were planting vineyards, or were fearful, those he
commanded that they should return, every man to his own house, according
to the law.

<span id="057">57</span> So the camp removed, and pitched upon the south
side of Emmaus.

<span id="058">58</span> And Judas said, arm yourselves, and be valiant
men, and see that ye be in readiness against the morning, that ye may
fight with these nations, that are assembled together against us to
destroy us and our sanctuary:

<span id="059">59</span> For it is better for us to die in battle, than
to behold the calamities of our people and our sanctuary.

<span id="060">60</span> Nevertheless, as the will of God is in heaven,
so let him do.
