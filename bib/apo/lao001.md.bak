### Apocrypha: Laodiceans Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> Paul, an apostle not of men nor by man, but by
Jesus Christ, unto the brethren that are at Laodicea.

<span id="002">2</span> Grace be unto you and peace from God the Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="003">3</span> I give thanks unto Christ in all my prayers,
that ye continue in him and persevere in his works, looking for the
promise at the day of judgement.

<span id="004">4</span> Neither do the vain talkings of some overset
you, which creep in, that they may turn you away from the truth of the
Gospel which is preached by me.

<span id="005">5</span> And now shall God cause that they that are of me
shall continue ministering unto the increase of the truth of the Gospel
and accomplishing goodness, and the work of salvation, even eternal
life.

<span id="006">6</span> And now are my bonds seen of all men, which I
suffer in Christ, wherein I rejoice and am glad.

<span id="007">7</span> And unto me this is for everlasting salvation,
which also is brought about by your prayers, and the ministry of the
Holy Ghost, whether by life or by death.

<span id="008">8</span> For verily to me life is in Christ, and to die
is joy.

<span id="009">9</span> And unto him (or And also) shall he work his
mercy in you that ye may have the same love, and be of one mind.

<span id="010">10</span> Therefore, dearly beloved, as ye have heard in
my presence so hold fast and work in the fear of God, and it shall be
unto you for life eternal.

<span id="011">11</span> For it is God that worketh in you.

<span id="012">12</span> And do ye without afterthought whatsoever ye
do.

<span id="013">13</span> And for the rest, dearly beloved, rejoice in
Christ, and beware of them that are filthy in lucre.

<span id="014">14</span> Let all your petitions be made openly before
God, and be ye steadfast in the mind of Christ.

<span id="015">15</span> And what things are sound and true and sober
and just and to be loved, do ye.

<span id="016">16</span> And what ye have heard and received, keep fast
in your heart.

<span id="017">17</span> And peace shall be unto you.

<span id="018">18</span> The saints salute you.

<span id="019">19</span> The grace of the Lord Jesus be with your
spirit.

<span id="020">20</span> And cause this epistle to be read unto them of
Colossae, and the epistle of the Colossians to be read unto you.
