### Apocrypha: Judith Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> So they sent ambassadors unto him to treat of
peace, saying,

<span id="002">2</span> Behold, we the servants of Nabuchodonosor the
great king lie before thee; use us as shall be good in thy sight.

<span id="003">3</span> Behold, our houses, and all our places, and all
our fields of wheat, and flocks, and herds, and all the lodges of our
tents lie before thy face; use them as it pleaseth thee.

<span id="004">4</span> Behold, even our cities and the inhabitants
thereof are thy servants; come and deal with them as seemeth good unto
thee.

<span id="005">5</span> So the men came to Holofernes, and declared unto
him after this manner.

<span id="006">6</span> Then came he down toward the sea coast, both he
and his army, and set garrisons in the high cities, and took out of them
chosen men for aid.

<span id="007">7</span> So they and all the country round about received
them with garlands, with dances, and with timbrels.

<span id="008">8</span> Yet he did cast down their frontiers, and cut
down their groves: for he had decreed to destroy all the gods of the
land, that all nations should worship Nabuchodonosor only, and that all
tongues and tribes should call upon him as god.

<span id="009">9</span> Also he came over against Esdraelon near unto
Judea, over against the great strait of Judea.

<span id="010">10</span> And he pitched between Geba and Scythopolis,
and there he tarried a whole month, that he might gather together all
the carriages of his army.
