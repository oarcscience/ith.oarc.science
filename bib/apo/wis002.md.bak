### Apocrypha: Wisdom Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> For the ungodly said, reasoning with themselves,
but not aright, Our life is short and tedious, and in the death of a man
there is no remedy: neither was there any man known to have returned
from the grave.

<span id="002">2</span> For we are born at all adventure: and we shall
be hereafter as though we had never been: for the breath in our nostrils
is as smoke, and a little spark in the moving of our heart:

<span id="003">3</span> Which being extinguished, our body shall be
turned into ashes, and our spirit shall vanish as the soft air,

<span id="004">4</span> And our name shall be forgotten in time, and no
man shall have our works in remembrance, and our life shall pass away as
the trace of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist, that is driven
away with the beams of the sun, and overcome with the heat thereof.

<span id="005">5</span> For our time is a very shadow that passeth away;
and after our end there is no returning: for it is fast sealed, so that
no man cometh again.

<span id="006">6</span> Come on therefore, let us enjoy the good things
that are present: and let us speedily use the creatures like as in
youth.

<span id="007">7</span> Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and
ointments: and let no flower of the spring pass by us:

<span id="008">8</span> Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds, before
they be withered:

<span id="009">9</span> Let none of us go without his part of our
voluptuousness: let us leave tokens of our joyfulness in every place:
for this is our portion, and our lot is this.

<span id="010">10</span> Let us oppress the poor righteous man, let us
not spare the widow, nor reverence the ancient gray hairs of the aged.

<span id="011">11</span> Let our strength be the law of justice: for
that which is feeble is found to be nothing worth.

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore let us lie in wait for the righteous;
because he is not for our turn, and he is clean contrary to our doings:
he upbraideth us with our offending the law, and objecteth to our infamy
the transgressings of our education.

<span id="013">13</span> He professeth to have the knowledge of God: and
he calleth himself the child of the Lord.

<span id="014">14</span> He was made to reprove our thoughts.

<span id="015">15</span> He is grievous unto us even to behold: for his
life is not like other men's, his ways are of another fashion.

<span id="016">16</span> We are esteemed of him as counterfeits: he
abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness: he pronounceth the end of
the just to be blessed, and maketh his boast that God is his father.

<span id="017">17</span> Let us see if his words be true: and let us
prove what shall happen in the end of him.

<span id="018">18</span> For if the just man be the son of God, he will
help him, and deliver him from the hand of his enemies.

<span id="019">19</span> Let us examine him with despitefulness and
torture, that we may know his meekness, and prove his patience.

<span id="020">20</span> Let us condemn him with a shameful death: for
by his own saying he shall be respected.

<span id="021">21</span> Such things they did imagine, and were
deceived: for their own wickedness hath blinded them.

<span id="022">22</span> As for the mysteries of God, they kn ew them
not: neither hoped they for the wages of righteousness, nor discerned a
reward for blameless souls.

<span id="023">23</span> For God created man to be immortal, and made
him to be an image of his own eternity.

<span id="024">24</span> Nevertheless through envy of the devil came
death into the world: and they that do hold of his side do find it.
