### Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> Wisdom lifteth up the head of him that is of low
degree, and maketh him to sit among great men.

<span id="002">2</span> Commend not a man for his beauty; neither abhor
a man for his outward appearance.

<span id="003">3</span> The bee is little among such as fly; but her
fruit is the chief of sweet things.

<span id="004">4</span> Boast not of thy clothing and raiment, and exalt
not thyself in the day of honour: for the works of the Lord are
wonderful, and his works among men are hidden.

<span id="005">5</span> Many kings have sat down upon the ground; and
one that was never thought of hath worn the crown.

<span id="006">6</span> Many mighty men have been greatly disgraced; and
the honourable delivered into other men's hands.

<span id="007">7</span> Blame not before thou hast examined the truth:
understand first, and then rebuke.

<span id="008">8</span> Answer not before thou hast heard the cause:
neither interrupt men in the midst of their talk.

<span id="009">9</span> Strive not in a matter that concerneth thee not;
and sit not in judgment with sinners.

<span id="010">10</span> My son, meddle not with many matters: for if
thou meddle much, thou shalt not be innocent; and if thou follow after,
thou shalt not obtain, neither shalt thou escape by fleeing.

<span id="011">11</span> There is one that laboureth, and taketh pains,
and maketh haste, and is so much the more behind.

<span id="012">12</span> Again, there is another that is slow, and hath
need of help, wanting ability, and full of poverty; yet the eye of the
Lord looked upon him for good, and set him up from his low estate,

<span id="013">13</span> And lifted up his head from misery; so that
many that saw from him is peace over all the

<span id="014">14</span> Prosperity and adversity, life and death,
poverty and riches, come of the Lord.

<span id="015">15</span> Wisdom, knowledge, and understanding of the
law, are of the Lord: love, and the way of good works, are from him.

<span id="016">16</span> Error and darkness had their beginning together
with sinners: and evil shall wax old with them that glory therein.

<span id="017">17</span> The gift of the Lord remaineth with the
ungodly, and his favour bringeth prosperity for ever.

<span id="018">18</span> There is that waxeth rich by his wariness and
pinching, and this his the portion of his reward:

<span id="019">19</span> Whereas he saith, I have found rest, and now
will eat continually of my goods; and yet he knoweth not what time shall
come upon him, and that he must leave those things to others, and die.

<span id="020">20</span> Be stedfast in thy covenant, and be conversant
therein, and wax old in thy work.

<span id="021">21</span> Marvel not at the works of sinners; but trust
in the Lord, and abide in thy labour: for it is an easy thing in the
sight of the Lord on the sudden to make a poor man rich.

<span id="022">22</span> The blessing of the Lord is in the reward of
the godly, and suddenly he maketh his blessing flourish.

<span id="023">23</span> Say not, What profit is there of my service?
and what good things shall I have hereafter?

<span id="024">24</span> Again, say not, I have enough, and possess many
things, and what evil shall I have hereafter?

<span id="025">25</span> In the day of prosperity there is a
forgetfulness of affliction: and in the day of affliction there is no
more remembrance of prosperity.

<span id="026">26</span> For it is an easy thing unto the Lord in the
day of death to reward a man according to his ways.

<span id="027">27</span> The affliction of an hour maketh a man forget
pleasure: and in his end his deeds shall be discovered.

<span id="028">28</span> Judge none blessed before his death: for a man
shall be known in his children.

<span id="029">29</span> Bring not every man into thine house: for the
deceitful man hath many trains.

<span id="030">30</span> Like as a partridge taken \[and kept\] in a
cage, so is the heart of the proud; and like as a spy, watcheth he for
thy fall:

<span id="031">31</span> For he lieth in wait, and turneth good into
evil, and in things worthy praise will lay blame upon thee.

<span id="032">32</span> Of a spark of fire a heap of coals is kindled:
and a sinful man layeth wait for blood.

<span id="033">33</span> Take heed of a mischievous man, for he worketh
wickedness; lest he bring upon thee a perpetual blot.

<span id="034">34</span> Receive a stranger into thine house, and he
will disturb thee, and turn thee out of thine own.
