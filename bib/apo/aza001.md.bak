### Apocrypha: Prayer of Azariah Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> And they walked in the midst of the fire,
praising God, and blessing the Lord.

<span id="002">2</span> Then Azarias stood up, and prayed on this
manner; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire said,

<span id="003">3</span> Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: thy
name is worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore:

<span id="004">4</span> For thou art righteous in all the things that
thou hast done to us: yea, true are all thy works, thy ways are right,
and all thy judgments truth.

<span id="005">5</span> In all the things that thou hast brought upon
us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, even Jerusalem, thou hast
executed true judgment: for according to truth and judgment didst thou
bring all these things upon us because of our sins.

<span id="006">6</span> For we have sinned and committed iniquity,
departing from thee.

<span id="007">7</span> In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed
thy commandments, nor kept them, neither done as thou hast commanded us,
that it might go well with us.

<span id="008">8</span> Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us,
and every thing that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true
judgment.

<span id="009">9</span> And thou didst deliver us into the hands of
lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers of God, and to an unjust king,
and the most wicked in all the world.

<span id="010">10</span> And now we cannot open our mouths, we are
become a shame and reproach to thy servants; and to them that worship
thee.

<span id="011">11</span> Yet deliver us not up wholly, for thy name's
sake, neither disannul thou thy covenant:

<span id="012">12</span> And cause not thy mercy to depart from us, for
thy beloved Abraham's sake, for thy servant Issac's sake, and for thy
holy Israel's sake;

<span id="013">13</span> To whom thou hast spoken and promised, that
thou wouldest multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the
sand that lieth upon the seashore.

<span id="014">14</span> For we, O Lord, are become less than any
nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because of our sins.

<span id="015">15</span> Neither is there at this time prince, or
prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or
incense, or place to sacrifice before thee, and to find mercy.

<span id="016">16</span> Nevertheless in a contrite heart and an humble
spirit let us be accepted.

<span id="017">17</span> Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and
bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let our
sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and grant that we may wholly go
after thee: for they shall not be confounded that put their trust in
thee.

<span id="018">18</span> And now we follow thee with all our heart, we
fear thee, and seek thy face.

<span id="019">19</span> Put us not to shame: but deal with us after thy
lovingkindness, and according to the multitude of thy mercies.

<span id="020">20</span> Deliver us also according to thy marvellous
works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord: and let all them that do thy
servants hurt be ashamed;

<span id="021">21</span> And let them be confounded in all their power
and might, and let their strength be broken;

<span id="022">22</span> And let them know that thou art God, the only
God, and glorious over the whole world.

<span id="023">23</span> And the king's servants, that put them in,
ceased not to make the oven hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and small wood;

<span id="024">24</span> So that the flame streamed forth above the
furnace forty and nine cubits.

<span id="025">25</span> And it passed through, and burned those
Chaldeans it found about the furnace.

<span id="026">26</span> But the angel of the Lord came down into the
oven together with Azarias and his fellows, and smote the flame of the
fire out of the oven;

<span id="027">27</span> And made the midst of the furnace as it had
been a moist whistling wind, so that the fire touched them not at all,
neither hurt nor troubled them.

<span id="028">28</span> Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised,
glorified, and blessed, God in the furnace, saying,

<span id="029">29</span> Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers:
and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.

<span id="030">30</span> And blessed is thy glorious and holy name: and
to be praised and exalted above all for ever.

<span id="031">31</span> Blessed art thou in the temple of thine holy
glory: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever.

<span id="032">32</span> Blessed art thou that beholdest the depths, and
sittest upon the cherubims: and to be praised and exalted above all for
ever.

<span id="033">33</span> Blessed art thou on the glorious throne of thy
kingdom: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever.

<span id="034">34</span> Blessed art thou in the firmament of heaven:
and above ail to be praised and glorified for ever.
