### Apocrypha: Judith Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> And when the tumult of men that were about the
council was ceased, Holofernes the chief captain of the army of Assur
said unto Achior and all the Moabites before all the company of other
nations,

<span id="002">2</span> And who art thou, Achior, and the hirelings of
Ephraim, that thou hast prophesied against us as to day, and hast said,
that we should not make war with the people of Israel, because their God
will defend them? and who is God but Nabuchodonosor?

<span id="003">3</span> He will send his power, and will destroy them
from the face of the earth, and their God shall not deliver them: but we
his servants will destroy them as one man; for they are not able to
sustain the power of our horses.

<span id="004">4</span> For with them we will tread them under foot, and
their mountains shall be drunken with their blood, and their fields
shall be filled with their dead bodies, and their footsteps shall not be
able to stand before us, for they shall utterly perish, saith king
Nabuchodonosor, lord of all the earth: for he said, None of my words
shall be in vain.

<span id="005">5</span> And thou, Achior, an hireling of Ammon, which
hast spoken these words in the day of thine iniquity, shalt see my face
no more from this day, until I take vengeance of this nation that came
out of Egypt.

<span id="006">6</span> And then shall the sword of mine army, and the
multitude of them that serve me, pass through thy sides, and thou shalt
fall among their slain, when I return.

<span id="007">7</span> Now therefore my servants shall bring thee back
into the hill country, and shall set thee in one of the cities of the
passages:

<span id="008">8</span> And thou shalt not perish, till thou be
destroyed with them.

<span id="009">9</span> And if thou persuade thyself in thy mind that
they shall be taken, let not thy countenance fall: I have spoken it, and
none of my words shall be in vain.

<span id="010">10</span> Then Holofernes commanded his servants, that
waited in his tent, to take Achior, and bring him to Bethulia, and
deliver him into the hands of the children of Israel.

<span id="011">11</span> So his servants took him, and brought him out
of the camp into the plain, and they went from the midst of the plain
into the hill country, and came unto the fountains that were under
Bethulia.

<span id="012">12</span> And when the men of the city saw them, they
took up their weapons, and went out of the city to the top of the hill:
and every man that used a sling kept them from coming up by casting of
stones against them.

<span id="013">13</span> Nevertheless having gotten privily under the
hill, they bound Achior, and cast him down, and left him at the foot of
the hill, and returned to their lord.

<span id="014">14</span> But the Israelites descended from their city,
and came unto him, and loosed him, and brought him to Bethulia, and
presented him to the governors of the city:

<span id="015">15</span> Which were in those days Ozias the son of
Micha, of the tribe of Simeon, and Chabris the son of Gothoniel, and
Charmis the son of Melchiel.

<span id="016">16</span> And they called together all the ancients of
the city, and all their youth ran together, and their women, to the
assembly, and they set Achior in the midst of all their people. Then
Ozias asked him of that which was done.

<span id="017">17</span> And he answered and declared unto them the
words of the council of Holofernes, and all the words that he had spoken
in the midst of the princes of Assur, and whatsoever Holofernes had
spoken proudly against the house of Israel.

<span id="018">18</span> Then the people fell down and worshipped God,
and cried unto God. saying,

<span id="019">19</span> O Lord God of heaven, behold their pride, and
pity the low estate of our nation, and look upon the face of those that
are sanctified unto thee this day.

<span id="020">20</span> Then they comforted Achior, and praised him
greatly.

<span id="021">21</span> And Ozias took him out of the assembly unto his
house, and made a feast to the elders; and they called on the God of
Israel all that night for help.
