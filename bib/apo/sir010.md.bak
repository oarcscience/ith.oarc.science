### Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> A wise judge will instruct his people; and the
government of a prudent man is well ordered.

<span id="002">2</span> As the judge of the people is himself, so are
his officers; and what manner of man the ruler of the city is, such are
all they that dwell therein.

<span id="003">3</span> An unwise king destroyeth his people; but
through the prudence of them which are in authority the city shall be
inhabited.

<span id="004">4</span> The power of the earth is in the hand of the
Lord, and in due time he will set over it one that is profitable.

<span id="005">5</span> In the hand of God is the prosperity of man: and
upon the person of the scribe shall he lay his honour.

<span id="006">6</span> Bear not hatred to thy neighbour for every
wrong; and do nothing at all by injurious practices.

<span id="007">7</span> Pride is hateful before God and man: and by both
doth one commit iniquity.

<span id="008">8</span> Because of unrighteous dealings, injuries, and
riches got by deceit, the kingdom is translated from one people to
another.

<span id="009">9</span> Why is earth and ashes proud? There is not a
more wicked thing than a covetous man: for such an one setteth his own
soul to sale; because while he liveth he casteth away his bowels.

<span id="010">10</span> The physician cutteth off a long disease; and
he that is to day a king to morrow shall die.

<span id="011">11</span> For when a man is dead, he shall inherit
creeping things, beasts, and worms.

<span id="012">12</span> The beginning of pride is when one departeth
from God, and his heart is turned away from his Maker.

<span id="013">13</span> For pride is the beginning of sin, and he that
hath it shall pour out abomination: and therefore the Lord brought upon
them strange calamities, and overthrew them utterly.

<span id="014">14</span> The Lord hath cast down the thrones of proud
princes, and set up the meek in their stead.

<span id="015">15</span> The Lord hath plucked up the roots of the proud
nations, and planted the lowly in their place.

<span id="016">16</span> The Lord overthrew countries of the heathen,
and destroyed them to the foundations of the earth.

<span id="017">17</span> He took some of them away, and destroyed them,
and hath made their memorial to cease from the earth.

<span id="018">18</span> Pride was not made for men, nor furious anger
for them that are born of a woman.

<span id="019">19</span> They that fear the Lord are a sure seed, and
they that love him an honourable plant: they that regard not the law are
a dishonourable seed; they that transgress the commandments are a
deceivable seed.

<span id="020">20</span> Among brethren he that is chief is honorable;
so are they that fear the Lord in his eyes.

<span id="021">21</span> The fear of the Lord goeth before the obtaining
of authority: but roughness and pride is the losing thereof.

<span id="022">22</span> Whether he be rich, noble, or poor, their glory
is the fear of the Lord.

<span id="023">23</span> It is not meet to despise the poor man that
hath understanding; neither is it convenient to magnify a sinful man.

<span id="024">24</span> Great men, and judges, and potentates, shall be
honoured; yet is there none of them greater than he that feareth the
Lord.

<span id="025">25</span> Unto the servant that is wise shall they that
are free do service: and he that hath knowledge will not grudge when he
is reformed.

<span id="026">26</span> Be not overwise in doing thy business; and
boast not thyself in the time of thy distress.

<span id="027">27</span> Better is he that laboureth, and aboundeth in
all things, than he that boasteth himself, and wanteth bread.

<span id="028">28</span> My son, glorify thy soul in meekness, and give
it honour according to the dignity thereof.

<span id="029">29</span> Who will justify him that sinneth against his
own soul? and who will honour him that dishonoureth his own life?

<span id="030">30</span> The poor man is honoured for his skill, and the
rich man is honoured for his riches.

<span id="031">31</span> He that is honoured in poverty, how much more
in riches? and he that is dishonourable in riches, how much more in
poverty?
