### Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 50

<span id="001">1</span> Simon the high priest, the son of Onias, who in
his life repaired the house again, and in his days fortified the temple:

<span id="002">2</span> And by him was built from the foundation the
double height, the high fortress of the wall about the temple:

<span id="003">3</span> In his days the cistern to receive water, being
in compass as the sea, was covered with plates of brass:

<span id="004">4</span> He took care of the temple that it should not
fall, and fortified the city against besieging:

<span id="005">5</span> How was he honoured in the midst of the people
in his coming out of the sanctuary!

<span id="006">6</span> He was as the morning star in the midst of a
cloud, and as the moon at the full:

<span id="007">7</span> As the sun shining upon the temple of the most
High, and as the rainbow giving light in the bright clouds:

<span id="008">8</span> And as the flower of roses in the spring of the
year, as lilies by the rivers of waters, and as the branches of the
frankincense tree in the time of summer:

<span id="009">9</span> As fire and incense in the censer, and as a
vessel of beaten gold set with all manner of precious stones:

<span id="010">10</span> And as a fair olive tree budding forth fruit,
and as a cypress tree which groweth up to the clouds.

<span id="011">11</span> When he put on the robe of honour, and was
clothed with the perfection of glory, when he went up to the holy altar,
he made the garment of holiness honourable.

<span id="012">12</span> When he took the portions out of the priests'
hands, he himself stood by the hearth of the altar, compassed about, as
a young cedar in Libanus; and as palm trees compassed they him round
about.

<span id="013">13</span> So were all the sons of Aaron in their glory,
and the oblations of the Lord in their hands, before all the
congregation of Israel.

<span id="014">14</span> And finishing the service at the altar, that he
might adorn the offering of the most high Almighty,

<span id="015">15</span> He stretched out his hand to the cup, and
poured of the blood of the grape, he poured out at the foot of the altar
a sweetsmelling savour unto the most high King of all.

<span id="016">16</span> Then shouted the sons of Aaron, and sounded the
silver trumpets, and made a great noise to be heard, for a remembrance
before the most High.

<span id="017">17</span> Then all the people together hasted, and fell
down to the earth upon their faces to worship their Lord God Almighty,
the most High.

<span id="018">18</span> The singers also sang praises with their
voices, with great variety of sounds was there made sweet melody.

<span id="019">19</span> And the people besought the Lord, the most
High, by prayer before him that is merciful, till the solemnity of the
Lord was ended, and they had finished his service.

<span id="020">20</span> Then he went down, and lifted up his hands over
the whole congregation of the children of Israel, to give the blessing
of the Lord with his lips, and to rejoice in his name.

<span id="021">21</span> And they bowed themselves down to worship the
second time, that they might receive a blessing from the most High.

<span id="022">22</span> Now therefore bless ye the God of all, which
only doeth wondrous things every where, which exalteth our days from the
womb, and dealeth with us according to his mercy.

<span id="023">23</span> He grant us joyfulness of heart, and that peace
may be in our days in Israel for ever:

<span id="024">24</span> That he would confirm his mercy with us, and
deliver us at his time!

<span id="025">25</span> There be two manner of nations which my heart
abhorreth, and the third is no nation:

<span id="026">26</span> They that sit upon the mountain of Samaria, and
they that dwell among the Philistines, and that foolish people that
dwell in Sichem.

<span id="027">27</span> Jesus the son of Sirach of Jerusalem hath
written in this book the instruction of understanding and knowledge, who
out of his heart poured forth wisdom.

<span id="028">28</span> Blessed is he that shall be exercised in these
things; and he that layeth them up in his heart shall become wise.

<span id="029">29</span> For if he do them, he shall be strong to all
things: for the light of the Lord leadeth him, who giveth wisdom to the
godly. Blessed be the name of the Lord for ever. Amen, Amen.
