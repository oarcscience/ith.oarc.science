### Apocrypha: Tobias Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> After these things Tobias went his way, praising
God that he had given him a prosperous journey, and blessed Raguel and
Edna his wife, and went on his way till they drew near unto Nineve.

<span id="002">2</span> Then Raphael said to Tobias, Thou knowest,
brother, how thou didst leave thy father:

<span id="003">3</span> Let us haste before thy wife, and prepare the
house.

<span id="004">4</span> And take in thine hand the gall of the fish. So
they went their way, and the dog went after them.

<span id="005">5</span> Now Anna sat looking about toward the way for
her son.

<span id="006">6</span> And when she espied him coming, she said to his
father, Behold, thy son cometh, and the man that went with him.

<span id="007">7</span> Then said Raphael, I know, Tobias, that thy
father will open his eyes.

<span id="008">8</span> Therefore anoint thou his eyes with the gall,
and being pricked therewith, he shall rub, and the whiteness shall fall
away, and he shall see thee.

<span id="009">9</span> Then Anna ran forth, and fell upon the neck of
her son, and said unto him, Seeing I have seen thee, my son, from
henceforth I am content to die. And they wept both.

<span id="010">10</span> Tobit also went forth toward the door, and
stumbled: but his son ran unto him,

<span id="011">11</span> And took hold of his father: and he strake of
the gall on his fathers' eyes, saying, Be of good hope, my father.

<span id="012">12</span> And when his eyes began to smart, he rubbed
them;

<span id="013">13</span> And the whiteness pilled away from the corners
of his eyes: and when he saw his son, he fell upon his neck.

<span id="014">14</span> And he wept, and said, Blessed art thou, O God,
and blessed is thy name for ever; and blessed are all thine holy angels:

<span id="015">15</span> For thou hast scourged, and hast taken pity on
me: for, behold, I see my son Tobias. And his son went in rejoicing, and
told his father the great things that had happened to him in Media.

<span id="016">16</span> Then Tobit went out to meet his daughter in law
at the gate of Nineve, rejoicing and praising God: and they which saw
him go marvelled, because he had received his sight.

<span id="017">17</span> But Tobias gave thanks before them, because God
had mercy on him. And when he came near to Sara his daughter in law, he
blessed her, saying, Thou art welcome, daughter: God be blessed, which
hath brought thee unto us, and blessed be thy father and thy mother. And
there was joy among all his brethren which were at Nineve.

<span id="018">18</span> And Achiacharus, and Nasbas his brother's son,
came:

<span id="019">19</span> And Tobias' wedding was kept seven days with
great joy.
