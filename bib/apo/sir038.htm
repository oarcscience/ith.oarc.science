<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 38</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Honour a physician with the honour due unto him for the uses which ye may have of him: for the Lord hath created him. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For of the most High cometh healing, and he shall receive honour of the king. </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;The skill of the physician shall lift up his head: and in the sight of great men he shall be in admiration. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;The Lord hath created medicines out of the earth; and he that is wise will not abhor them. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Was not the water made sweet with wood, that the virtue thereof might be known? </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he hath given men skill, that he might be honoured in his marvellous works. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;With such doth he heal [men,] and taketh away their pains. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Of such doth the apothecary make a confection; and of his works there is no end; and from him is peace over all the earth, </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;My son, in thy sickness be not negligent: but pray unto the Lord, and he will make thee whole. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Leave off from sin, and order thine hands aright, and cleanse thy heart from all wickedness. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Give a sweet savour, and a memorial of fine flour; and make a fat offering, as not being. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then give place to the physician, for the Lord hath created him: let him not go from thee, for thou hast need of him. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;There is a time when in their hands there is good success. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For they shall also pray unto the Lord, that he would prosper that, which they give for ease and remedy to prolong life. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;He that sinneth before his Maker, let him fall into the hand of the physician. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;My son, let tears fall down over the dead, and begin to lament, as if thou hadst suffered great harm thyself; and then cover his body according to the custom, and neglect not his burial. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Weep bitterly, and make great moan, and use lamentation, as he is worthy, and that a day or two, lest thou be evil spoken of: and then comfort thyself for thy heaviness. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For of heaviness cometh death, and the heaviness of the heart breaketh strength. </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;In affliction also sorrow remaineth: and the life of the poor is the curse of the heart. </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Take no heaviness to heart: drive it away, and member the last end. </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Forget it not, for there is no turning again: thou shalt not do him good, but hurt thyself. </P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Remember my judgment: for thine also shall be so; yesterday for me, and to day for thee. </P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest; and be comforted for him, when his Spirit is departed from him. </P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;The wisdom of a learned man cometh by opportunity of leisure: and he that hath little business shall become wise. </P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;How can he get wisdom that holdeth the plough, and that glorieth in the goad, that driveth oxen, and is occupied in their labours, and whose talk is of bullocks? </P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;He giveth his mind to make furrows; and is diligent to give the kine fodder. </P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;So every carpenter and workmaster, that laboureth night and day: and they that cut and grave seals, and are diligent to make great variety, and give themselves to counterfeit imagery, and watch to finish a work: </P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;The smith also sitting by the anvil, and considering the iron work, the vapour of the fire wasteth his flesh, and he fighteth with the heat of the furnace: the noise of the hammer and the anvil is ever in his ears, and his eyes look still upon the pattern of the thing that he maketh; he setteth his mind to finish his work, and watcheth to polish it perfectly: </P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;So doth the potter sitting at his work, and turning the wheel about with his feet, who is alway carefully set at his work, and maketh all his work by number; </P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;He fashioneth the clay with his arm, and boweth down his strength before his feet; he applieth himself to lead it over; and he is diligent to make clean the furnace: </P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;All these trust to their hands: and every one is wise in his work. </P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Without these cannot a city be inhabited: and they shall not dwell where they will, nor go up and down: </P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;They shall not be sought for in publick counsel, nor sit high in the congregation: they shall not sit on the judges' seat, nor understand the sentence of judgment: they cannot declare justice and judgment; and they shall not be found where parables are spoken. </P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;But they will maintain the state of the world, and [all] their desire is in the work of their craft. </P>
