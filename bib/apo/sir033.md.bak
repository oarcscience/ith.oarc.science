### Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 33

<span id="001">1</span> There shall no evil happen unto him that feareth
the Lord; but in temptation even again he will deliver him.

<span id="002">2</span> A wise man hateth not the law; but he that is an
hypocrite therein is as a ship in a storm.

<span id="003">3</span> A man of understanding trusteth in the law; and
the law is faithful unto him, as an oracle.

<span id="004">4</span> Prepare what to say, and so thou shalt be heard:
and bind up instruction, and then make answer.

<span id="005">5</span> The heart of the foolish is like a cartwheel;
and his thoughts are like a rolling axletree.

<span id="006">6</span> A stallion horse is as a mocking friend, he
neigheth under every one that sitteth upon him.

<span id="007">7</span> Why doth one day excel another, when as all the
light of every day in the year is of the sun?

<span id="008">8</span> By the knowledge of the Lord they were
distinguished: and he altered seasons and feasts.

<span id="009">9</span> Some of them hath he made high days, and
hallowed them, and some of them hath he made ordinary days.

<span id="010">10</span> And all men are from the ground, and Adam was
created of earth:

<span id="011">11</span> In much knowledge the Lord hath divided them,
and made their ways diverse.

<span id="012">12</span> Some of them hath he blessed and exalted and
some of them he sanctified, and set near himself: but some of them hath
he cursed and brought low, and turned out of their places.

<span id="013">13</span> As the clay is in the potter's hand, to fashion
it at his pleasure: so man is in the hand of him that made him, to
render to them as liketh him best.

<span id="014">14</span> Good is set against evil, and life against
death: so is the godly against the sinner, and the sinner against the
godly.

<span id="015">15</span> So look upon all the works of the most High;
and there are two and two, one against another.

<span id="016">16</span> I awaked up last of all, as one that gathereth
after the grapegatherers: by the blessing of the Lord I profited, and
tred my winepress like a gatherer of grapes.

<span id="017">17</span> Consider that I laboured not for myself only,
but for all them that seek learning.

<span id="018">18</span> Hear me, O ye great men of the people, and
hearken with your ears, ye rulers of the congregation.

<span id="019">19</span> Give not thy son and wife, thy brother and
friend, power over thee while thou livest, and give not thy goods to
another: lest it repent thee, and thou intreat for the same again.

<span id="020">20</span> As long as thou livest and hast breath in thee,
give not thyself over to any.

<span id="021">21</span> For better it is that thy children should seek
to thee, than that thou shouldest stand to their courtesy.

<span id="022">22</span> In all thy works keep to thyself the
preeminence; leave not a stain in thine honour.

<span id="023">23</span> At the time when thou shalt end thy days, and
finish thy life, distribute thine inheritance.

<span id="024">24</span> Fodder, a wand, and burdens, are for the ass;
and bread, correction, and work, for a servant. .

<span id="025">25</span> If thou set thy servant to labour, thou shalt
find rest: but if thou let him go idle, he shall seek liberty.

<span id="026">26</span> A yoke and a collar do bow the neck: so are
tortures and torments for an evil servant.

<span id="027">27</span> Send him to labour, that he be not idle; for
idleness teacheth much evil.

<span id="028">28</span> Set him to work, as is fit for him: if he be
not obedient, put on more heavy fetters.

<span id="029">29</span> But be not excessive toward any; and without
discretion do nothing.

<span id="030">30</span> If thou have a servant, let him be unto thee as
thyself, because thou hast bought him with a price.

<span id="031">31</span> If thou have a servant, entreat him as a
brother: for thou hast need of him, as of thine own soul: if thou
entreat him evil, and he run from thee, which way wilt thou go to seek
him?
