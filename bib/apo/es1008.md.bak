### Apocrypha: 1 Esdras Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> And after these things, when Artexerxes the king
of the Persians reigned came Esdras the son of Saraias, the son of
Ezerias, the son of Helchiah, the son of Salum,

<span id="002">2</span> The son of Sadduc, the son of Achitob, the son
of Amarias, the son of Ezias, the son of Meremoth, the son of Zaraias,
the son of Savias, the son of Boccas, the son of Abisum, the son of
Phinees, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest.

<span id="003">3</span> This Esdras went up from Babylon, as a scribe,
being very ready in the law of Moses, that was given by the God of
Israel.

<span id="004">4</span> And the king did him honour: for he found grace
in his sight in all his requests.

<span id="005">5</span> There went up with him also certain of the
children of Israel, of the priest of the Levites, of the holy singers,
porters, and ministers of the temple, unto Jerusalem,

<span id="006">6</span> In the seventh year of the reign of Artexerxes,
in the fifth month, this was the king's seventh year; for they went from
Babylon in the first day of the first month, and came to Jerusalem,
according to the prosperous journey which the Lord gave them.

<span id="007">7</span> For Esdras had very great skill, so that he
omitted nothing of the law and commandments of the Lord, but taught all
Israel the ordinances and judgments.

<span id="008">8</span> Now the copy of the commission, which was
written from Artexerxes the king, and came to Esdras the priest and
reader of the law of the Lord, is this that followeth;

<span id="009">9</span> King Artexerxes unto Esdras the priest and
reader of the law of the Lord sendeth greeting:

<span id="010">10</span> Having determined to deal graciously, I have
given order, that such of the nation of the Jews, and of the priests and
Levites being within our realm, as are willing and desirous should go
with thee unto Jerusalem.

<span id="011">11</span> As many therefore as have a mind thereunto, let
them depart with thee, as it hath seemed good both to me and my seven
friends the counsellors;

<span id="012">12</span> That they may look unto the affairs of Judea
and Jerusalem, agreeably to that which is in the law of the Lord;

<span id="013">13</span> And carry the gifts unto the Lord of Israel to
Jerusalem, which I and my friends have vowed, and all the gold and
silver that in the country of Babylon can be found, to the Lord in
Jerusalem,

<span id="014">14</span> With that also which is given of the people for
the temple of the Lord their God at Jerusalem: and that silver and gold
may be collected for bullocks, rams, and lambs, and things thereunto
appertaining;

<span id="015">15</span> To the end that they may offer sacrifices unto
the Lord upon the altar of the Lord their God, which is in Jerusalem.

<span id="016">16</span> And whatsoever thou and thy brethren will do
with the silver and gold, that do, according to the will of thy God.

<span id="017">17</span> And the holy vessels of the Lord, which are
given thee for the use of the temple of thy God, which is in Jerusalem,
thou shalt set before thy God in Jerusalem.

<span id="018">18</span> And whatsoever thing else thou shalt remember
for the use of the temple of thy God, thou shalt give it out of the
king's treasury.

<span id="019">19</span> And I king Artexerxes have also commanded the
keepers of the treasures in Syria and Phenice, that whatsoever Esdras
the priest and the reader of the law of the most high God shall send
for, they should give it him with speed,

<span id="020">20</span> To the sum of an hundred talents of silver,
likewise also of wheat even to an hundred cors, and an hundred pieces of
wine, and other things in abundance.

<span id="021">21</span> Let all things be performed after the law of
God diligently unto the most high God, that wrath come not upon the
kingdom of the king and his sons.

<span id="022">22</span> I command you also, that ye require no tax, nor
any other imposition, of any of the priests, or Levites, or holy
singers, or porters, or ministers of the temple, or of any that have
doings in this temple, and that no man have authority to impose any
thing upon them.

<span id="023">23</span> And thou, Esdras, according to the wisdom of
God ordain judges and justices, that they may judge in all Syria and
Phenice all those that know the law of thy God; and those that know it
not thou shalt teach.

<span id="024">24</span> And whosoever shall transgress the law of thy
God, and of the king, shall be punished diligently, whether it be by
death, or other punishment, by penalty of money, or by imprisonment.

<span id="025">25</span> Then said Esdras the scribe, Blessed be the
only Lord God of my fathers, who hath put these things into the heart of
the king, to glorify his house that is in Jerusalem:

<span id="026">26</span> And hath honoured me in the sight of the king,
and his counsellors, and all his friends and nobles.

<span id="027">27</span> Therefore was I encouraged by the help of the
Lord my God, and gathered together men of Israel to go up with me.

<span id="028">28</span> And these are the chief according to their
families and several dignities, that went up with me from Babylon in the
reign of king Artexerxes:

<span id="029">29</span> Of the sons of Phinees, Gerson: of the sons of
Ithamar, Gamael: of the sons of David, Lettus the son of Sechenias:

<span id="030">30</span> Of the sons of Pharez, Zacharias; and with him
were counted an hundred and fifty men:

<span id="031">31</span> Of the sons of Pahath Moab, Eliaonias, the son
of Zaraias, and with him two hundred men:

<span id="032">32</span> Of the sons of Zathoe, Sechenias the son of
Jezelus, and with him three hundred men: of the sons of Adin, Obeth the
son of Jonathan, and with him two hundred and fifty men:

<span id="033">33</span> Of the sons of Elam, Josias son of Gotholias,
and with him seventy men:

<span id="034">34</span> Of the sons of Saphatias, Zaraias son of
Michael, and with him threescore and ten men:

<span id="035">35</span> Of the sons of Joab, Abadias son of Jezelus,
and with him two hundred and twelve men:

<span id="036">36</span> Of the sons of Banid, Assalimoth son of
Josaphias, and with him an hundred and threescore men:

<span id="037">37</span> Of the sons of Babi, Zacharias son of Bebai,
and with him twenty and eight men:

<span id="038">38</span> Of the sons of Astath, Johannes son of Acatan,
and with him an hundred and ten men:

<span id="039">39</span> Of the sons of Adonikam the last, and these are
the names of them, Eliphalet, Jewel, and Samaias, and with them seventy
men:

<span id="040">40</span> Of the sons of Bago, Uthi the son of
Istalcurus, and with him seventy men.

<span id="041">41</span> And these I gathered together to the river
called Theras, where we pitched our tents three days: and then I
surveyed them.

<span id="042">42</span> But when I had found there none of the priests
and Levites,

<span id="043">43</span> Then sent I unto Eleazar, and Iduel, and
Masman,

<span id="044">44</span> And Alnathan, and Mamaias, and Joribas, and
Nathan, Eunatan, Zacharias, and Mosollamon, principal men and learned.

<span id="045">45</span> And I bade them that they should go unto
Saddeus the captain, who was in the place of the treasury:

<span id="046">46</span> And commanded them that they should speak unto
Daddeus, and to his brethren, and to the treasurers in that place, to
send us such men as might execute the priests' office in the house of
the Lord.

<span id="047">47</span> And by the mighty hand of our Lord they brought
unto us skilful men of the sons of Moli the son of Levi, the son of
Israel, Asebebia, and his sons, and his brethren, who were eighteen.

<span id="048">48</span> And Asebia, and Annus, and Osaias his brother,
of the sons of Channuneus, and their sons, were twenty men.

<span id="049">49</span> And of the servants of the temple whom David
had ordained, and the principal men for the service of the Levites to
wit, the servants of the temple two hundred and twenty, the catalogue of
whose names were shewed.

<span id="050">50</span> And there I vowed a fast unto the young men
before our Lord, to desire of him a prosperous journey both for us and
them that were with us, for our children, and for the cattle:

<span id="051">51</span> For I was ashamed to ask the king footmen, and
horsemen, and conduct for safeguard against our adversaries.

<span id="052">52</span> For we had said unto the king, that the power
of the Lord our God should be with them that seek him, to support them
in all ways.

<span id="053">53</span> And again we besought our Lord as touching
these things, and found him favourable unto us.

<span id="054">54</span> Then I separated twelve of the chief of the
priests, Esebrias, and Assanias, and ten men of their brethren with
them:

<span id="055">55</span> And I weighed them the gold, and the silver,
and the holy vessels of the house of our Lord, which the king, and his
council, and the princes, and all Israel, had given.

<span id="056">56</span> And when I had weighed it, I delivered unto
them six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels of an
hundred talents, and an hundred talents of gold,

<span id="057">57</span> And twenty golden vessels, and twelve vessels
of brass, even of fine brass, glittering like gold.

<span id="058">58</span> And I said unto them, Both ye are holy unto the
Lord, and the vessels are holy, and the gold and the silver is a vow
unto the Lord, the Lord of our fathers.

<span id="059">59</span> Watch ye, and keep them till ye deliver them to
the chief of the priests and Levites, and to the principal men of the
families of Israel, in Jerusalem, into the chambers of the house of our
God.

<span id="060">60</span> So the priests and the Levites, who had
received the silver and the gold and the vessels, brought them unto
Jerusalem, into the temple of the Lord.

<span id="061">61</span> And from the river Theras we departed the
twelfth day of the first month, and came to Jerusalem by the mighty hand
of our Lord, which was with us: and from the beginning of our journey
the Lord delivered us from every enemy, and so we came to Jerusalem.

<span id="062">62</span> And when we had been there three days, the gold
and silver that was weighed was delivered in the house of our Lord on
the fourth day unto Marmoth the priest the son of Iri.

<span id="063">63</span> And with him was Eleazar the son of Phinees,
and with them were Josabad the son of Jesu and Moeth the son of Sabban,
Levites: all was delivered them by number and weight.

<span id="064">64</span> And all the weight of them was written up the
same hour.

<span id="065">65</span> Moreover they that were come out of the
captivity offered sacrifice unto the Lord God of Israel, even twelve
bullocks for all Israel, fourscore and sixteen rams,

<span id="066">66</span> Threescore and twelve lambs, goats for a peace
offering, twelve; all of them a sacrifice to the Lord.

<span id="067">67</span> And they delivered the king's commandments unto
the king's stewards' and to the governors of Celosyria and Phenice; and
they honoured the people and the temple of God.

<span id="068">68</span> Now when these things were done, the rulers
came unto me, and said,

<span id="069">69</span> The nation of Israel, the princes, the priests
and Levites, have not put away from them the strange people of the land,
nor the pollutions of the Gentiles to wit, of the Canaanites, Hittites,
Pheresites, Jebusites, and the Moabites, Egyptians, and Edomites.

<span id="070">70</span> For both they and their sons have married with
their daughters, and the holy seed is mixed with the strange people of
the land; and from the beginning of this matter the rulers and the great
men have been partakers of this iniquity.

<span id="071">71</span> And as soon as I had heard these things, I rent
my clothes, and the holy garment, and pulled off the hair from off my
head and beard, and sat me down sad and very heavy.

<span id="072">72</span> So all they that were then moved at the word of
the Lord God of Israel assembled unto me, whilst I mourned for the
iniquity: but I sat still full of heaviness until the evening sacrifice.

<span id="073">73</span> Then rising up from the fast with my clothes
and the holy garment rent, and bowing my knees, and stretching forth my
hands unto the Lord,

<span id="074">74</span> I said, O Lord, I am confounded and ashamed
before thy face;

<span id="075">75</span> For our sins are multiplied above our heads,
and our ignorances have reached up unto heaven.

<span id="076">76</span> For ever since the time of our fathers we have
been and are in great sin, even unto this day.

<span id="077">77</span> And for our sins and our fathers' we with our
brethren and our kings and our priests were given up unto the kings of
the earth, to the sword, and to captivity, and for a prey with shame,
unto this day.

<span id="078">78</span> And now in some measure hath mercy been shewed
unto us from thee, O Lord, that there should be left us a root and a
name in the place of thy sanctuary;

<span id="079">79</span> And to discover unto us a light in the house of
the Lord our God, and to give us food in the time of our servitude.

<span id="080">80</span> Yea, when we were in bondage, we were not
forsaken of our Lord; but he made us gracious before the kings of
Persia, so that they gave us food;

<span id="081">81</span> Yea, and honoured the temple of our Lord, and
raised up the desolate Sion, that they have given us a sure abiding in
Jewry and Jerusalem.

<span id="082">82</span> And now, O Lord, what shall we say, having
these things? for we have transgressed thy commandments, which thou
gavest by the hand of thy servants the prophets, saying,

<span id="083">83</span> That the land, which ye enter into to possess
as an heritage, is a land polluted with the pollutions of the strangers
of the land, and they have filled it with their uncleanness.

<span id="084">84</span> Therefore now shall ye not join your daughters
unto their sons, neither shall ye take their daughters unto your sons.

<span id="085">85</span> Moreover ye shall never seek to have peace with
them, that ye may be strong, and eat the good things of the land, and
that ye may leave the inheritance of the land unto your children for
evermore.

<span id="086">86</span> And all that is befallen is done unto us for
our wicked works and great sins; for thou, O Lord, didst make our sins
light,

<span id="087">87</span> And didst give unto us such a root: but we have
turned back again to transgress thy law, and to mingle ourselves with
the uncleanness of the nations of the land.

<span id="088">88</span> Mightest not thou be angry with us to destroy
us, till thou hadst left us neither root, seed, nor name?

<span id="089">89</span> O Lord of Israel, thou art true: for we are
left a root this day.

<span id="090">90</span> Behold, now are we before thee in our
iniquities, for we cannot stand any longer by reason of these things
before thee.

<span id="091">91</span> And as Esdras in his prayer made his
confession, weeping, and lying flat upon the ground before the temple,
there gathered unto him from Jerusalem a very great multitude of men and
women and children: for there was great weeping among the multitude.

<span id="092">92</span> Then Jechonias the son of Jeelus, one of the
sons of Israel, called out, and said, O Esdras, we have sinned against
the Lord God, we have married strange women of the nations of the land,
and now is all Israel aloft.

<span id="093">93</span> Let us make an oath to the Lord, that we will
put away all our wives, which we have taken of the heathen, with their
children,

<span id="094">94</span> Like as thou hast decreed, and as many as do
obey the law of the Lord.

<span id="095">95</span> Arise and put in execution: for to thee doth
this matter appertain, and we will be with thee: do valiantly.

<span id="096">96</span> So Esdras arose, and took an oath of the chief
of the priests and Levites of all Israel to do after these things; and
so they sware.
