### Apocrypha: 2 Macabees Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> This Simon now, of whom we spake afore, having
been a betrayer of the money, and of his country, slandered Onias, as if
he ha terrified Heliodorus, and been the worker of these evils.

<span id="002">2</span> Thus was he bold to call him a traitor, that had
deserved well of the city, and tendered his own nation, and was so
zealous of the laws.

<span id="003">3</span> But when their hatred went so far, that by one
of Simon's faction murders were committed,

<span id="004">4</span> Onias seeing the danger of this contention, and
that Apollonius, as being the governor of Celosyria and Phenice, did
rage, and increase Simon's malice,

<span id="005">5</span> He went to the king, not to be an accuser of his
countrymen, but seeking the good of all, both publick and private:

<span id="006">6</span> For he saw that it was impossible that the state
should continue quiet, and Simon leave his folly, unless the king did
look thereunto.

<span id="007">7</span> But after the death of Seleucus, when Antiochus,
called Epiphanes, took the kingdom, Jason the brother of Onias laboured
underhand to be high priest,

<span id="008">8</span> Promising unto the king by intercession three
hundred and threescore talents of silver, and of another revenue eighty
talents:

<span id="009">9</span> Beside this, he promised to assign an hundred
and fifty more, if he might have licence to set him up a place for
exercise, and for the training up of youth in the fashions of the
heathen, and to write them of Jerusalem by the name of Antiochians.

<span id="010">10</span> Which when the king had granted, and he had
gotten into his hand the rule he forthwith brought his own nation to
Greekish fashion.

<span id="011">11</span> And the royal privileges granted of special
favour to the Jews by the means of John the father of Eupolemus, who
went ambassador to Rome for amity and aid, he took away; and putting
down the governments which were according to the law, he brought up new
customs against the law:

<span id="012">12</span> For he built gladly a place of exercise under
the tower itself, and brought the chief young men under his subjection,
and made them wear a hat.

<span id="013">13</span> Now such was the height of Greek fashions, and
increase of heathenish manners, through the exceeding profaneness of
Jason, that ungodly wretch, and no high priest;

<span id="014">14</span> That the priests had no courage to serve any
more at the altar, but despising the temple, and neglecting the
sacrifices, hastened to be partakers of the unlawful allowance in the
place of exercise, after the game of Discus called them forth;

<span id="015">15</span> Not setting by the honours of their fathers,
but liking the glory of the Grecians best of all.

<span id="016">16</span> By reason whereof sore calamity came upon them:
for they had them to be their enemies and avengers, whose custom they
followed so earnestly, and unto whom they desired to be like in all
things.

<span id="017">17</span> For it is not a light thing to do wickedly
against the laws of God: but the time following shall declare these
things.

<span id="018">18</span> Now when the game that was used every faith
year was kept at Tyrus, the king being present,

<span id="019">19</span> This ungracious Jason sent special messengers
from Jerusalem, who were Antiochians, to carry three hundred drachms of
silver to the sacrifice of Hercules, which even the bearers thereof
thought fit not to bestow upon the sacrifice, because it was not
convenient, but to be reserved for other charges.

<span id="020">20</span> This money then, in regard of the sender, was
appointed to Hercules' sacrifice; but because of the bearers thereof, it
was employed to the making of gallies.

<span id="021">21</span> Now when Apollonius the son of Menestheus was
sent into Egypt for the coronation of king Ptolemeus Philometor,
Antiochus, understanding him not to be well affected to his affairs,
provided for his own safety: whereupon he came to Joppa, and from thence
to Jerusalem:

<span id="022">22</span> Where he was honourably received of Jason, and
of the city, and was brought in with torch alight, and with great
shoutings: and so afterward went with his host unto Phenice.

<span id="023">23</span> Three years afterward Jason sent Menelaus, the
aforesaid Simon's brother, to bear the money unto the king, and to put
him in mind of certain necessary matters.

<span id="024">24</span> But he being brought to the presence of the
king, when he had magnified him for the glorious appearance of his
power, got the priesthood to himself, offering more than Jason by three
hundred talents of silver.

<span id="025">25</span> So he came with the king's mandate, bringing
nothing worthy the high priesthood, but having the fury of a cruel
tyrant, and the rage of a savage beast.

<span id="026">26</span> Then Jason, who had undermined his own brother,
being undermined by another, was compelled to flee into the country of
the Ammonites.

<span id="027">27</span> So Menelaus got the principality: but as for
the money that he had promised unto the king, he took no good order for
it, albeit Sostratis the ruler of the castle required it:

<span id="028">28</span> For unto him appertained the gathering of the
customs. Wherefore they were both called before the king.

<span id="029">29</span> Now Menelaus left his brother Lysimachus in his
stead in the priesthood; and Sostratus left Crates, who was governor of
the Cyprians.

<span id="030">30</span> While those things were in doing, they of
Tarsus and Mallos made insurrection, because they were given to the
king's concubine, called Antiochus.

<span id="031">31</span> Then came the king in all haste to appease
matters, leaving Andronicus, a man in authority, for his deputy.

<span id="032">32</span> Now Menelaus, supposing that he had gotten a
convenient time, stole certain vessels of gold out of the temple, and
gave some of them to Andronicus, and some he sold into Tyrus and the
cities round about.

<span id="033">33</span> Which when Onias knew of a surety, he reproved
him, and withdrew himself into a sanctuary at Daphne, that lieth by
Antiochia.

<span id="034">34</span> Wherefore Menelaus, taking Andronicus apart,
prayed, him to get Onias into his hands; who being persuaded thereunto,
and coming to Onias in deceit, gave him his right hand with oaths; and
though he were suspected by him, yet persuaded he him to come forth of
the sanctuary: whom forthwith he shut up without regard of justice.

<span id="035">35</span> For the which cause not only the Jews, but many
also of other nations, took great indignation, and were much grieved for
the unjust murder of the man.

<span id="036">36</span> And when the king was come again from the
places about Cilicia, the Jews that were in the city, and certain of the
Greeks that abhorred the fact also, complained because Onias was slain
without cause.

<span id="037">37</span> Therefore Antiochus was heartily sorry, and
moved to pity, and wept, because of the sober and modest behaviour of
him that was dead.

<span id="038">38</span> And being kindled with anger, forthwith he took
away Andronicus his purple, and rent off his clothes, and leading him
through the whole city unto that very place, where he had committed
impiety against Onias, there slew he the cursed murderer. Thus the Lord
rewarded him his punishment, as he had deserved.

<span id="039">39</span> Now when many sacrileges had been committed in
the city by Lysimachus with the consent of Menelaus, and the fruit
thereof was spread abroad, the multitude gathered themselves together
against Lysimachus, many vessels of gold being already carried away.

<span id="040">40</span> Whereupon the common people rising, and being
filled with rage, Lysimachus armed about three thousand men, and began
first to offer violence; one Auranus being the leader, a man far gone in
years, and no less in folly.

<span id="041">41</span> They then seeing the attempt of Lysimachus,
some of them caught stones, some clubs, others taking handfuls of dust,
that was next at hand, cast them all together upon Lysimachus, and those
that set upon them.

<span id="042">42</span> Thus many of them they wounded, and some they
struck to the ground, and all of them they forced to flee: but as for
the churchrobber himself, him they killed beside the treasury.

<span id="043">43</span> Of these matters therefore there was an
accusation laid against Menelaus.

<span id="044">44</span> Now when the king came to Tyrus, three men that
were sent from the senate pleaded the cause before him:

<span id="045">45</span> But Menelaus, being now convicted, promised
Ptolemee the son of Dorymenes to give him much money, if he would pacify
the king toward him.

<span id="046">46</span> Whereupon Ptolemee taking the king aside into a
certain gallery, as it were to take the air, brought him to be of
another mind:

<span id="047">47</span> Insomuch that he discharged Menelaus from the
accusations, who notwithstanding was cause of all the mischief: and
those poor men, who, if they had told their cause, yea, before the
Scythians, should have been judged innocent, them he condemned to death.

<span id="048">48</span> Thus they that followed the matter for the
city, and for the people, and for the holy vessels, did soon suffer
unjust punishment.

<span id="049">49</span> Wherefore even they of Tyrus, moved with hatred
of that wicked deed, caused them to be honourably buried.

<span id="050">50</span> And so through the covetousness of them that
were of power Menelaus remained still in authority, increasing in
malice, and being a great traitor to the citizens.
