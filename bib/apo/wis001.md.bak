### Apocrypha: Wisdom Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the
earth: think of the Lord with a good (heart,) and in simplicity of heart
seek him.

<span id="002">2</span> For he will be found of them that tempt him not;
and sheweth himself unto such as do not distrust him.

<span id="003">3</span> For froward thoughts separate from God: and his
power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise.

<span id="004">4</span> For into a malicious soul wisdom shall not
enter; nor dwell in the body that is subject unto sin.

<span id="005">5</span> For the holy spirit of discipline will flee
deceit, and remove from thoughts that are without understanding, and
will not abide when unrighteousness cometh in.

<span id="006">6</span> For wisdom is a loving spirit; and will not
acquit a blasphemer of his words: for God is witness of his reins, and a
true beholder of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.

<span id="007">7</span> For the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world:
and that which containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice.

<span id="008">8</span> Therefore he that speaketh unrighteous things
cannot be hid: neither shall vengeance, when it punisheth, pass by him.

<span id="009">9</span> For inquisition shall be made into the counsels
of the ungodly: and the sound of his words shall come unto the Lord for
the manifestation of his wicked deeds.

<span id="010">10</span> For the ear of jealousy heareth all things: and
the noise of murmurings is not hid.

<span id="011">11</span> Therefore beware of murmuring, which is
unprofitable; and refrain your tongue from backbiting: for there is no
word so secret, that shall go for nought: and the mouth that belieth
slayeth the soul.

<span id="012">12</span> Seek not death in the error of your life: and
pull not upon yourselves destruction with the works of your hands.

<span id="013">13</span> For God made not death: neither hath he
pleasure in the destruction of the living.

<span id="014">14</span> For he created all things, that they might have
their being: and the generations of the world were healthful; and there
is no poison of destruction in them, nor the kingdom of death upon the
earth:

<span id="015">15</span> (For righteousness is immortal:)

<span id="016">16</span> But ungodly men with their works and words
called it to them: for when they thought to have it their friend, they
consumed to nought, and made a covenant with it, because they are worthy
to take part with it.
