### Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 31

<span id="001">1</span> Watching for riches consumeth the flesh, and the
care thereof driveth away sleep.

<span id="002">2</span> Watching care will not let a man slumber, as a
sore disease breaketh sleep,

<span id="003">3</span> The rich hath great labour in gathering riches
together; and when he resteth, he is filled with his delicates.

<span id="004">4</span> The poor laboureth in his poor estate; and when
he leaveth off, he is still needy.

<span id="005">5</span> He that loveth gold shall not be justified, and
he that followeth corruption shall have enough thereof.

<span id="006">6</span> Gold hath been the ruin of many, and their
destruction was present.

<span id="007">7</span> It is a stumblingblock unto them that sacrifice
unto it, and every fool shall be taken therewith.

<span id="008">8</span> Blessed is the rich that is found without
blemish, and hath not gone after gold.

<span id="009">9</span> Who is he? and we will call him blessed: for
wonderful things hath he done among his people.

<span id="010">10</span> Who hath been tried thereby, and found perfect?
then let him glory. Who might offend, and hath not offended? or done
evil, and hath not done it?

<span id="011">11</span> His goods shall be established, and the
congregation shall declare his alms.

<span id="012">12</span> If thou sit at a bountiful table, be not greedy
upon it, and say not, There is much meat on it.

<span id="013">13</span> Remember that a wicked eye is an evil thing:
and what is created more wicked than an eye? therefore it weepeth upon
every occasion.

<span id="014">14</span> Stretch not thine hand whithersoever it
looketh, and thrust it not with him into the dish.

<span id="015">15</span> Judge not thy neighbour by thyself: and be
discreet in every point.

<span id="016">16</span> Eat as it becometh a man, those things which
are set before thee; and devour note, lest thou be hated.

<span id="017">17</span> Leave off first for manners' sake; and be not
unsatiable, lest thou offend.

<span id="018">18</span> When thou sittest among many, reach not thine
hand out first of all.

<span id="019">19</span> A very little is sufficient for a man well
nurtured, and he fetcheth not his wind short upon his bed.

<span id="020">20</span> Sound sleep cometh of moderate eating: he
riseth early, and his wits are with him: but the pain of watching, and
choler, and pangs of the belly, are with an unsatiable man.

<span id="021">21</span> And if thou hast been forced to eat, arise, go
forth, vomit, and thou shalt have rest.

<span id="022">22</span> My son, hear me, and despise me not, and at the
last thou shalt find as I told thee: in all thy works be quick, so shall
there no sickness come unto thee.

<span id="023">23</span> Whoso is liberal of his meat, men shall speak
well of him; and the report of his good housekeeping will be believed.

<span id="024">24</span> But against him that is a niggard of his meat
the whole city shall murmur; and the testimonies of his niggardness
shall not be doubted of.

<span id="025">25</span> Shew not thy valiantness in wine; for wine hath
destroyed many.

<span id="026">26</span> The furnace proveth the edge by dipping: so
doth wine the hearts of the proud by drunkeness.

<span id="027">27</span> Wine is as good as life to a man, if it be
drunk moderately: what life is then to a man that is without wine? for
it was made to make men glad.

<span id="028">28</span> Wine measurably drunk and in season bringeth
gladness of the heart, and cheerfulness of the mind:

<span id="029">29</span> But wine drunken with excess maketh bitterness
of the mind, with brawling and quarrelling.

<span id="030">30</span> Drunkenness increaseth the rage of a fool till
he offend: it diminisheth strength, and maketh wounds.

<span id="031">31</span> Rebuke not thy neighbour at the wine, and
despise him not in his mirth: give him no despiteful words, and press
not upon him with urging him \[to drink.\]
