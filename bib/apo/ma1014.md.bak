### Apocrypha: 1 Macabees Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> Now in the hundred threescore and twelfth year
king Demetrius gathered his forces together, and went into Media to get
him help to fight against Tryphone.

<span id="002">2</span> But when Arsaces, the king of Persia and Media,
heard that Demetrius was entered within his borders, he sent one of his
princes to take him alive:

<span id="003">3</span> Who went and smote the host of Demetrius, and
took him, and brought him to Arsaces, by whom he was put in ward.

<span id="004">4</span> As for the land of Judea, that was quiet all the
days of Simon; for he sought the good of his nation in such wise, as
that evermore his authority and honour pleased them well.

<span id="005">5</span> And as he was honourable in all his acts, so in
this, that he took Joppa for an haven, and made an entrance to the isles
of the sea,

<span id="006">6</span> And enlarged the bounds of his nation, and
recovered the country,

<span id="007">7</span> And gathered together a great number of
captives, and had the dominion of Gazera, and Bethsura, and the tower,
out of the which he took all uncleaness, neither was there any that
resisted him.

<span id="008">8</span> Then did they till their ground in peace, and
the earth gave her increase, and the trees of the field their fruit.

<span id="009">9</span> The ancient men sat all in the streets,
communing together of good things, and the young men put on glorious and
warlike apparel.

<span id="010">10</span> He provided victuals for the cities, and set in
them all manner of munition, so that his honourable name was renowned
unto the end of the world.

<span id="011">11</span> He made peace in the land, and Israel rejoiced
with great joy:

<span id="012">12</span> For every man sat under his vine and his fig
tree, and there was none to fray them:

<span id="013">13</span> Neither was there any left in the land to fight
against them: yea, the kings themselves were overthrown in those days.

<span id="014">14</span> Moreover he strengthened all those of his
people that were brought low: the law he searched out; and every
contemner of the law and wicked person he took away.

<span id="015">15</span> He beautified the sanctuary, and multiplied
vessels of the temple.

<span id="016">16</span> Now when it was heard at Rome, and as far as
Sparta, that Jonathan was dead, they were very sorry.

<span id="017">17</span> But as soon as they heard that his brother
Simon was made high priest in his stead, and ruled the country, and the
cities therein:

<span id="018">18</span> They wrote unto him in tables of brass, to
renew the friendship and league which they had made with Judas and
Jonathan his brethren:

<span id="019">19</span> Which writings were read before the
congregation at Jerusalem.

<span id="020">20</span> And this is the copy of the letters that the
Lacedemonians sent; The rulers of the Lacedemonians, with the city, unto
Simon the high priest, and the elders, and priests, and residue of the
people of the Jews, our brethren, send greeting:

<span id="021">21</span> The ambassadors that were sent unto our people
certified us of your glory and honour: wherefore we were glad of their
coming,

<span id="022">22</span> And did register the things that they spake in
the council of the people in this manner; Numenius son of Antiochus, and
Antipater son of Jason, the Jews' ambassadors, came unto us to renew the
friendship they had with us.

<span id="023">23</span> And it pleased the people to entertain the men
honourably, and to put the copy of their ambassage in publick records,
to the end the people of the Lacedemonians might have a memorial
thereof: furthermore we have written a copy thereof unto Simon the high
priest.

<span id="024">24</span> After this Simon sent Numenius to Rome with a
great shield of gold of a thousand pound weight to confirm the league
with them.

<span id="025">25</span> Whereof when the people heard, they said, What
thanks shall we give to Simon and his sons?

<span id="026">26</span> For he and his brethren and the house of his
father have established Israel, and chased away in fight their enemies
from them, and confirmed their liberty.

<span id="027">27</span> So then they wrote it in tables of brass, which
they set upon pillars in mount Sion: and this is the copy of the
writing; The eighteenth day of the month Elul, in the hundred threescore
and twelfth year, being the third year of Simon the high priest,

<span id="028">28</span> At Saramel in the great congregation of the
priests, and people, and rulers of the nation, and elders of the
country, were these things notified unto us.

<span id="029">29</span> Forasmuch as oftentimes there have been wars in
the country, wherein for the maintenance of their sanctuary, and the
law, Simon the son of Mattathias, of the posterity of Jarib, together
with his brethren, put themselves in jeopardy, and resisting the enemies
of their nation did their nation great honour:

<span id="030">30</span> (For after that Jonathan, having gathered his
nation together, and been their high priest, was added to his people,

<span id="031">31</span> Their enemies prepared to invade their country,
that they might destroy it, and lay hands on the sanctuary:

<span id="032">32</span> At which time Simon rose up, and fought for his
nation, and spent much of his own substance, and armed the valiant men
of his nation and gave them wages,

<span id="033">33</span> And fortified the cities of Judea, together
with Bethsura, that lieth upon the borders of Judea, where the armour of
the enemies had been before; but he set a garrison of Jews there:

<span id="034">34</span> Moreover he fortified Joppa, which lieth upon
the sea, and Gazera, that bordereth upon Azotus, where the enemies had
dwelt before: but he placed Jews there, and furnished them with all
things convenient for the reparation thereof.)

<span id="035">35</span> The people therefore sang the acts of Simon,
and unto what glory he thought to bring his nation, made him their
governor and chief priest, because he had done all these things, and for
the justice and faith which he kept to his nation, and for that he
sought by all means to exalt his people.

<span id="036">36</span> For in his time things prospered in his hands,
so that the heathen were taken out of their country, and they also that
were in the city of David in Jerusalem, who had made themselves a tower,
out of which they issued, and polluted all about the sanctuary, and did
much hurt in the holy place:

<span id="037">37</span> But he placed Jews therein. and fortified it
for the safety of the country and the city, and raised up the walls of
Jerusalem.

<span id="038">38</span> King Demetrius also confirmed him in the high
priesthood according to those things,

<span id="039">39</span> And made him one of his friends, and honoured
him with great honour.

<span id="040">40</span> For he had heard say, that the Romans had
called the Jews their friends and confederates and brethren; and that
they had entertained the ambassadors of Simon honourably;

<span id="041">41</span> Also that the Jews and priests were well
pleased that Simon should be their governor and high priest for ever,
until there should arise a faithful prophet;

<span id="042">42</span> Moreover that he should be their captain, and
should take charge of the sanctuary, to set them over their works, and
over the country, and over the armour, and over the fortresses, that, I
say, he should take charge of the sanctuary;

<span id="043">43</span> Beside this, that he should be obeyed of every
man, and that all the writings in the country should be made in his
name, and that he should be clothed in purple, and wear gold:

<span id="044">44</span> Also that it should be lawful for none of the
people or priests to break any of these things, or to gainsay his words,
or to gather an assembly in the country without him, or to be clothed in
purple, or wear a buckle of gold;

<span id="045">45</span> And whosoever should do otherwise, or break any
of these things, he should be punished.

<span id="046">46</span> Thus it liked all the people to deal with
Simon, and to do as hath been said.

<span id="047">47</span> Then Simon accepted hereof, and was well
pleased to be high priest, and captain and governor of the Jews and
priests, and to defend them all.

<span id="048">48</span> So they commanded that this writing should be
put in tables of brass, and that they should be set up within the
compass of the sanctuary in a conspicuous place;

<span id="049">49</span> Also that the copies thereof should be laid up
in the treasury, to the end that Simon and his sons might have them.
