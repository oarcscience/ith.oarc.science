### Apocrypha: Additions to Esther Chapter 10

<span id="004">4</span> Then Mardocheus said, God hath done these
things.

<span id="005">5</span> For I remember a dream which I saw concerning
these matters, and nothing thereof hath failed.

<span id="006">6</span> A little fountain became a river, and there was
light, and the sun, and much water: this river is Esther, whom the king
married, and made queen:

<span id="007">7</span> And the two dragons are I and Aman.

<span id="008">8</span> And the nations were those that were assembled
to destroy the name of the Jews:

<span id="009">9</span> And my nation is this Israel, which cried to
God, and were saved: for the Lord hath saved his people, and the Lord
hath delivered us from all those evils, and God hath wrought signs and
great wonders, which have not been done among the Gentiles.

<span id="010">10</span> Therefore hath he made two lots, one for the
people of God, and another for all the Gentiles.

<span id="011">11</span> And these two lots came at the hour, and time,
and day of judgment, before God among all nations.

<span id="012">12</span> So God remembered his people, and justified his
inheritance.

<span id="013">13</span> Therefore those days shall be unto them in the
month Adar, the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the same month, with an
assembly, and joy, and with gladness before God, according to the
generations for ever among his people.
