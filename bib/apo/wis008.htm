<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Wisdom Chapter 8</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Wisdom reacheth from one end to another mightily: and sweetly doth she order all things. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;I loved her, and sought her out from my youth, I desired to make her my spouse, and I was a lover of her beauty. </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;In that she is conversant with God, she magnifieth her nobility: yea, the Lord of all things himself loved her. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For she is privy to the mysteries of the knowledge of God, and a lover of his works. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;If riches be a possession to be desired in this life; what is richer than wisdom, that worketh all things? </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And if prudence work; who of all that are is a more cunning workman than she? </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And if a man love righteousness her labours are virtues: for she teacheth temperance and prudence, justice and fortitude: which are such things, as en can have nothing more profitable in their life. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;If a man desire much experience, she knoweth things of old, and conjectureth aright what is to come: she knoweth the subtilties of speeches, and can expound dark sentences: she foreseeth signs and wonders, and the events of seasons and times. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Therefore I purposed to take her to me to live with me, knowing that she would be a counsellor of good things, and a comfort in cares and grief. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For her sake I shall have estimation among the multitude, and honour with the elders, though I be young. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;I shall be found of a quick conceit in judgment, and shall be admired in the sight of great men. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;When I hold my tongue, they shall bide my leisure, and when I speak, they shall give good ear unto me: if I talk much, they shall lay their hands upon their mouth. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Moreover by the means of her I shall obtain immortality, and leave behind me an everlasting memorial to them that come after me. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;I shall set the people in order, and the nations shall be subject unto me. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Horrible tyrants shall be afraid, when they do but hear of me; I shall be found good among the multitude, and valiant in war. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;After I am come into mine house, I will repose myself with her: for her conversation hath no bitterness; and to live with her hath no sorrow, but mirth and joy. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Now when I considered these things in myself, and pondered them in my heart, how that to be allied unto wisdom is immortality; </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And great pleasure it is to have her friendship; and in the works of her hands are infinite riches; and in the exercise of conference with her, prudence; and in talking with her, a good report; I went about seeking how to take her to me. </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For I was a witty child, and had a good spirit. </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Yea rather, being good, I came into a body undefiled. </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless, when I perceived that I could not otherwise obtain her, except God gave her me; and that was a point of wisdom also to know whose gift she was; I prayed unto the Lord, and besought him, and with my whole heart I said, </P>
