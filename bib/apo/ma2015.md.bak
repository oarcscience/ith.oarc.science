### Apocrypha: 2 Macabees Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> But Nicanor, hearing that Judas and his company
were in the strong places about Samaria, resolved without any danger to
set upon them on the sabbath day.

<span id="002">2</span> Nevertheless the Jews that were compelled to go
with him said, O destroy not so cruelly and barbarously, but give honour
to that day, which he, that seeth all things, hath honoured with
holiness above all other days.

<span id="003">3</span> Then the most ungracious wretch demanded, if
there were a Mighty one in heaven, that had commanded the sabbath day to
be kept.

<span id="004">4</span> And when they said, There is in heaven a living
Lord, and mighty, who commanded the seventh day to be kept:

<span id="005">5</span> Then said the other, And I also am mighty upon
earth, and I command to take arms, and to do the king's business. Yet he
obtained not to have his wicked will done.

<span id="006">6</span> So Nicanor in exceeding pride and haughtiness
determined to set up a publick monument of his victory over Judas and
them that were with him.

<span id="007">7</span> But Maccabeus had ever sure confidence that the
Lord would help him:

<span id="008">8</span> Wherefore he exhorted his people not to fear the
coming of the heathen against them, but to remember the help which in
former times they had received from heaven, and now to expect the
victory and aid, which should come unto them from the Almighty.

<span id="009">9</span> And so comforting them out of the law and the
prophets, and withal putting them in mind of the battles that they won
afore, he made them more cheerful.

<span id="010">10</span> And when he had stirred up their minds, he gave
them their charge, shewing them therewithall the falsehood of the
heathen, and the breach of oaths.

<span id="011">11</span> Thus he armed every one of them, not so much
with defence of shields and spears, as with comfortable and good words:
and beside that, he told them a dream worthy to be believed, as if it
had been so indeed, which did not a little rejoice them.

<span id="012">12</span> And this was his vision: That Onias, who had
been high priest, a virtuous and a good man, reverend in conversation,
gentle in condition, well spoken also, and exercised from a child in all
points of virtue, holding up his hands prayed for the whole body of the
Jews.

<span id="013">13</span> This done, in like manner there appeared a man
with gray hairs, and exceeding glorious, who was of a wonderful and
excellent majesty.

<span id="014">14</span> Then Onias answered, saying, This is a lover of
the brethren, who prayeth much for the people, and for the holy city, to
wit, Jeremias the prophet of God.

<span id="015">15</span> Whereupon Jeremias holding forth his right hand
gave to Judas a sword of gold, and in giving it spake thus,

<span id="016">16</span> Take this holy sword, a gift from God, with the
which thou shalt wound the adversaries.

<span id="017">17</span> Thus being well comforted by the words of
Judas, which were very good, and able to stir them up to valour, and to
encourage the hearts of the young men, they determined not to pitch
camp, but courageously to set upon them, and manfully to try the matter
by conflict, because the city and the sanctuary and the temple were in
danger.

<span id="018">18</span> For the care that they took for their wives,
and their children, their brethren, and folks, was in least account with
them: but the greatest and principal fear was for the holy temple.

<span id="019">19</span> Also they that were in the city took not the
least care, being troubled for the conflict abroad.

<span id="020">20</span> And now, when as all looked what should be the
trial, and the enemies were already come near, and the army was set in
array, and the beasts conveniently placed, and the horsemen set in
wings,

<span id="021">21</span> Maccabeus seeing the coming of the multitude,
and the divers preparations of armour, and the fierceness of the beasts,
stretched out his hands toward heaven, and called upon the Lord that
worketh wonders, knowing that victory cometh not by arms, but even as it
seemeth good to him, he giveth it to such as are worthy:

<span id="022">22</span> Therefore in his prayer he said after this
manner; O Lord, thou didst send thine angel in the time of Ezekias king
of Judea, and didst slay in the host of Sennacherib an hundred fourscore
and five thousand:

<span id="023">23</span> Wherefore now also, O Lord of heaven, send a
good angel before us for a fear and dread unto them;

<span id="024">24</span> And through the might of thine arm let those be
stricken with terror, that come against thy holy people to blaspheme.
And he ended thus.

<span id="025">25</span> Then Nicanor and they that were with him came
forward with trumpets and songs.

<span id="026">26</span> But Judas and his company encountered the
enemies with invocation and prayer.

<span id="027">27</span> So that fighting with their hands, and praying
unto God with their hearts, they slew no less than thirty and five
thousand men: for through the appearance of God they were greatly
cheered.

<span id="028">28</span> Now when the battle was done, returning again
with joy, they knew that Nicanor lay dead in his harness.

<span id="029">29</span> Then they made a great shout and a noise,
praising the Almighty in their own language.

<span id="030">30</span> And Judas, who was ever the chief defender of
the citizens both in body and mind, and who continued his love toward
his countrymen all his life, commanded to strike off Nicanor's head, and
his hand with his shoulder, and bring them to Jerusalem.

<span id="031">31</span> So when he was there, and called them of his
nation together, and set the priests before the altar, he sent for them
that were of the tower,

<span id="032">32</span> And shewed them vile Nicanor's head, and the
hand of that blasphemer, which with proud brags he had stretched out
against the holy temple of the Almighty.

<span id="033">33</span> And when he had cut out the tongue of that
ungodly Nicanor, he commanded that they should give it by pieces unto
the fowls, and hang up the reward of his madness before the temple.

<span id="034">34</span> So every man praised toward the heaven the
glorious Lord, saying, Blessed be he that hath kept his own place
undefiled.

<span id="035">35</span> He hanged also Nicanor's head upon the tower,
an evident and manifest sign unto all of the help of the Lord.

<span id="036">36</span> And they ordained all with a common decree in
no case to let that day pass without solemnity, but to celebrate the
thirtieth day of the twelfth month, which in the Syrian tongue is called
Adar, the day before Mardocheus' day.

<span id="037">37</span> Thus went it with Nicanor: and from that time
forth the Hebrews had the city in their power. And here will I make an
end.

<span id="038">38</span> And if I have done well, and as is fitting the
story, it is that which I desired: but if slenderly and meanly, it is
that which I could attain unto.

<span id="039">39</span> For as it is hurtful to drink wine or water
alone; and as wine mingled with water is pleasant, and delighteth the
taste: even so speech finely framed delighteth the ears of them that
read the story. And here shall be an end.
