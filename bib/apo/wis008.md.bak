### Apocrypha: Wisdom Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> Wisdom reacheth from one end to another
mightily: and sweetly doth she order all things.

<span id="002">2</span> I loved her, and sought her out from my youth, I
desired to make her my spouse, and I was a lover of her beauty.

<span id="003">3</span> In that she is conversant with God, she
magnifieth her nobility: yea, the Lord of all things himself loved her.

<span id="004">4</span> For she is privy to the mysteries of the
knowledge of God, and a lover of his works.

<span id="005">5</span> If riches be a possession to be desired in this
life; what is richer than wisdom, that worketh all things?

<span id="006">6</span> And if prudence work; who of all that are is a
more cunning workman than she?

<span id="007">7</span> And if a man love righteousness her labours are
virtues: for she teacheth temperance and prudence, justice and
fortitude: which are such things, as en can have nothing more profitable
in their life.

<span id="008">8</span> If a man desire much experience, she knoweth
things of old, and conjectureth aright what is to come: she knoweth the
subtilties of speeches, and can expound dark sentences: she foreseeth
signs and wonders, and the events of seasons and times.

<span id="009">9</span> Therefore I purposed to take her to me to live
with me, knowing that she would be a counsellor of good things, and a
comfort in cares and grief.

<span id="010">10</span> For her sake I shall have estimation among the
multitude, and honour with the elders, though I be young.

<span id="011">11</span> I shall be found of a quick conceit in
judgment, and shall be admired in the sight of great men.

<span id="012">12</span> When I hold my tongue, they shall bide my
leisure, and when I speak, they shall give good ear unto me: if I talk
much, they shall lay their hands upon their mouth.

<span id="013">13</span> Moreover by the means of her I shall obtain
immortality, and leave behind me an everlasting memorial to them that
come after me.

<span id="014">14</span> I shall set the people in order, and the
nations shall be subject unto me.

<span id="015">15</span> Horrible tyrants shall be afraid, when they do
but hear of me; I shall be found good among the multitude, and valiant
in war.

<span id="016">16</span> After I am come into mine house, I will repose
myself with her: for her conversation hath no bitterness; and to live
with her hath no sorrow, but mirth and joy.

<span id="017">17</span> Now when I considered these things in myself,
and pondered them in my heart, how that to be allied unto wisdom is
immortality;

<span id="018">18</span> And great pleasure it is to have her
friendship; and in the works of her hands are infinite riches; and in
the exercise of conference with her, prudence; and in talking with her,
a good report; I went about seeking how to take her to me.

<span id="019">19</span> For I was a witty child, and had a good spirit.

<span id="020">20</span> Yea rather, being good, I came into a body
undefiled.

<span id="021">21</span> Nevertheless, when I perceived that I could not
otherwise obtain her, except God gave her me; and that was a point of
wisdom also to know whose gift she was; I prayed unto the Lord, and
besought him, and with my whole heart I said,
