### Apocrypha: 1 Macabees Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> About that time king Antiochus travelling
through the high countries heard say, that Elymais in the country of
Persia was a city greatly renowned for riches, silver, and gold;

<span id="002">2</span> And that there was in it a very rich temple,
wherein were coverings of gold, and breastplates, and shields, which
Alexander, son of Philip, the Macedonian king, who reigned first among
the Grecians, had left there.

<span id="003">3</span> Wherefore he came and sought to take the city,
and to spoil it; but he was not able, because they of the city, having
had warning thereof,

<span id="004">4</span> Rose up against him in battle: so he fled, and
departed thence with great heaviness, and returned to Babylon.

<span id="005">5</span> Moreover there came one who brought him tidings
into Persia, that the armies, which went against the land of Judea, were
put to flight:

<span id="006">6</span> And that Lysias, who went forth first with a
great power was driven away of the Jews; and that they were made strong
by the armour, and power, and store of spoils, which they had gotten of
the armies, whom they had destroyed:

<span id="007">7</span> Also that they had pulled down the abomination,
which he had set up upon the altar in Jerusalem, and that they had
compassed about the sanctuary with high walls, as before, and his city
Bethsura.

<span id="008">8</span> Now when the king heard these words, he was
astonished and sore moved: whereupon he laid him down upon his bed, and
fell sick for grief, because it had not befallen him as he looked for.

<span id="009">9</span> And there he continued many days: for his grief
was ever more and more, and he made account that he should die.

<span id="010">10</span> Wherefore he called for all his friends, and
said unto them, The sleep is gone from mine eyes, and my heart faileth
for very care.

<span id="011">11</span> And I thought with myself, Into what
tribulation am I come, and how great a flood of misery is it, wherein
now I am! for I was bountiful and beloved in my power.

<span id="012">12</span> But now I remember the evils that I did at
Jerusalem, and that I took all the vessels of gold and silver that were
therein, and sent to destroy the inhabitants of Judea without a cause.

<span id="013">13</span> I perceive therefore that for this cause these
troubles are come upon me, and, behold, I perish through great grief in
a strange land.

<span id="014">14</span> Then called he for Philip, one of his friends,
who he made ruler over all his realm,

<span id="015">15</span> And gave him the crown, and his robe, and his
signet, to the end he should bring up his son Antiochus, and nourish him
up for the kingdom.

<span id="016">16</span> So king Antiochus died there in the hundred
forty and ninth year.

<span id="017">17</span> Now when Lysias knew that the king was dead, he
set up Antiochus his son, whom he had brought up being young, to reign
in his stead, and his name he called Eupator.

<span id="018">18</span> About this time they that were in the tower
shut up the Israelites round about the sanctuary, and sought always
their hurt, and the strengthening of the heathen.

<span id="019">19</span> Wherefore Judas, purposing to destroy them,
called all the people together to besiege them.

<span id="020">20</span> So they came together, and besieged them in the
hundred and fiftieth year, and he made mounts for shot against them, and
other engines.

<span id="021">21</span> Howbeit certain of them that were besieged got
forth, unto whom some ungodly men of Israel joined themselves:

<span id="022">22</span> And they went unto the king, and said, How long
will it be ere thou execute judgment, and avenge our brethren?

<span id="023">23</span> We have been willing to serve thy father, and
to do as he would have us, and to obey his commandments;

<span id="024">24</span> For which cause they of our nation besiege the
tower, and are alienated from us: moreover as many of us as they could
light on they slew, and spoiled our inheritance.

<span id="025">25</span> Neither have they stretched out their hand
against us only, but also against their borders.

<span id="026">26</span> And, behold, this day are they besieging the
tower at Jerusalem, to take it: the sanctuary also and Bethsura have
they fortified.

<span id="027">27</span> Wherefore if thou dost not prevent them
quickly, they will do the greater things than these, neither shalt thou
be able to rule them.

<span id="028">28</span> Now when the king heard this, he was angry, and
gathered together all his friends, and the captains of his army, and
those that had charge of the horse.

<span id="029">29</span> There came also unto him from other kingdoms,
and from isles of the sea, bands of hired soldiers.

<span id="030">30</span> So that the number of his army was an hundred
thousand footmen, and twenty thousand horsemen, and two and thirty
elephants exercised in battle.

<span id="031">31</span> These went through Idumea, and pitched against
Bethsura, which they assaulted many days, making engines of war; but
they of Bethsura came out, and burned them with fire, and fought
valiantly.

<span id="032">32</span> Upon this Judas removed from the tower, and
pitched in Bathzacharias, over against the king's camp.

<span id="033">33</span> Then the king rising very early marched
fiercely with his host toward Bathzacharias, where his armies made them
ready to battle, and sounded the trumpets.

<span id="034">34</span> And to the end they might provoke the elephants
to fight, they shewed them the blood of grapes and mulberries.

<span id="035">35</span> Moreover they divided the beasts among the
armies, and for every elephant they appointed a thousand men, armed with
coats of mail, and with helmets of brass on their heads; and beside
this, for every beast were ordained five hundred horsemen of the best.

<span id="036">36</span> These were ready at every occasion: wheresoever
the beast was, and whithersoever the beast went, they went also, neither
departed they from him.

<span id="037">37</span> And upon the beasts were there strong towers of
wood, which covered every one of them, and were girt fast unto them with
devices: there were also upon every one two and thirty strong men, that
fought upon them, beside the Indian that ruled him.

<span id="038">38</span> As for the remnant of the horsemen, they set
them on this side and that side at the two parts of the host giving them
signs what to do, and being harnessed all over amidst the ranks.

<span id="039">39</span> Now when the sun shone upon the shields of gold
and brass, the mountains glistered therewith, and shined like lamps of
fire.

<span id="040">40</span> So part of the king's army being spread upon
the high mountains, and part on the valleys below, they marched on
safely and in order.

<span id="041">41</span> Wherefore all that heard the noise of their
multitude, and the marching of the company, and the rattling of the
harness, were moved: for the army was very great and mighty.

<span id="042">42</span> Then Judas and his host drew near, and entered
into battle, and there were slain of the king's army six hundred men.

<span id="043">43</span> Eleazar also, surnamed Savaran, perceiving that
one of the beasts, armed with royal harness, was higher than all the
rest, and supposing that the king was upon him,

<span id="044">44</span> Put himself in jeopardy, to the end he might
deliver his people, and get him a perpetual name:

<span id="045">45</span> Wherefore he ran upon him courageously through
the midst of the battle, slaying on the right hand and on the left, so
that they were divided from him on both sides.

<span id="046">46</span> Which done, he crept under the elephant, and
thrust him under, and slew him: whereupon the elephant fell down upon
him, and there he died.

<span id="047">47</span> Howbeit the rest of the Jews seeing the
strength of the king, and the violence of his forces, turned away from
them.

<span id="048">48</span> Then the king's army went up to Jerusalem to
meet them, and the king pitched his tents against Judea, and against
mount Sion.

<span id="049">49</span> But with them that were in Bethsura he made
peace: for they came out of the city, because they had no victuals there
to endure the siege, it being a year of rest to the land.

<span id="050">50</span> So the king took Bethsura, and set a garrison
there to keep it.

<span id="051">51</span> As for the sanctuary, he besieged it many days:
and set there artillery with engines and instruments to cast fire and
stones, and pieces to cast darts and slings.

<span id="052">52</span> Whereupon they also made engines against their
engines, and held them battle a long season.

<span id="053">53</span> Yet at the last, their vessels being without
victuals, (for that it was the seventh year, and they in Judea that were
delivered from the Gentiles, had eaten up the residue of the store;)

<span id="054">54</span> There were but a few left in the sanctuary,
because the famine did so prevail against them, that they were fain to
disperse themselves, every man to his own place.

<span id="055">55</span> At that time Lysias heard say, that Philip,
whom Antiochus the king, whiles he lived, had appointed to bring up his
son Antiochus, that he might be king,

<span id="056">56</span> Was returned out of Persia and Media, and the
king's host also that went with him, and that he sought to take unto him
the ruling of the affairs.

<span id="057">57</span> Wherefore he went in all haste, and said to the
king and the captains of the host and the company, We decay daily, and
our victuals are but small, and the place we lay siege unto is strong,
and the affairs of the kingdom lie upon us:

<span id="058">58</span> Now therefore let us be friends with these men,
and make peace with them, and with all their nation;

<span id="059">59</span> And covenant with them, that they shall live
after their laws, as they did before: for they are therefore displeased,
and have done all these things, because we abolished their laws.

<span id="060">60</span> So the king and the princes were content:
wherefore he sent unto them to make peace; and they accepted thereof.

<span id="061">61</span> Also the king and the princes made an oath unto
them: whereupon they went out of the strong hold.

<span id="062">62</span> Then the king entered into mount Sion; but when
he saw the strength of the place, he broke his oath that he had made,
and gave commandment to pull down the wall round about.

<span id="063">63</span> Afterward departed he in all haste, and
returned unto Antiochia, where he found Philip to be master of the city:
so he fought against him, and took the city by force.
