### Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 44

<span id="001">1</span> Let us now praise famous men, and our fathers
that begat us.

<span id="002">2</span> The Lord hath wrought great glory by them
through his great power from the beginning.

<span id="003">3</span> Such as did bear rule in their kingdoms, men
renowned for their power, giving counsel by their understanding, and
declaring prophecies:

<span id="004">4</span> Leaders of the people by their counsels, and by
their knowledge of learning meet for the people, wise and eloquent are
their instructions:

<span id="005">5</span> Such as found out musical tunes, and recited
verses in writing:

<span id="006">6</span> Rich men furnished with ability, living
peaceably in their habitations:

<span id="007">7</span> All these were honoured in their generations,
and were the glory of their times.

<span id="008">8</span> There be of them, that have left a name behind
them, that their praises might be reported.

<span id="009">9</span> And some there be, which have no memorial; who
are perished, as though they had never been; and are become as though
they had never been born; and their children after them.

<span id="010">10</span> But these were merciful men, whose
righteousness hath not been forgotten.

<span id="011">11</span> With their seed shall continually remain a good
inheritance, and their children are within the covenant.

<span id="012">12</span> Their seed standeth fast, and their children
for their sakes.

<span id="013">13</span> Their seed shall remain for ever, and their
glory shall not be blotted out.

<span id="014">14</span> Their bodies are buried in peace; but their
name liveth for evermore.

<span id="015">15</span> The people will tell of their wisdom, and the
congregation will shew forth their praise.

<span id="016">16</span> Enoch pleased the Lord, and was translated,
being an example of repentance to all generations.

<span id="017">17</span> Noah was found perfect and righteous; in the
time of wrath he was taken in exchange \[for the world;\] therefore was
he left as a remnant unto the earth, when the flood came.

<span id="018">18</span> An everlasting covenant was made with him, that
all flesh should perish no more by the flood.

<span id="019">19</span> Abraham was a great father of many people: in
glory was there none like unto him;

<span id="020">20</span> Who kept the law of the most High, and was in
covenant with him: he established the covenant in his flesh; and when he
was proved, he was found faithful.

<span id="021">21</span> Therefore he assured him by an oath, that he
would bless the nations in his seed, and that he would multiply him as
the dust of the earth, and exalt his seed as the stars, and cause them
to inherit from sea to sea, and from the river unto the utmost part of
the land.

<span id="022">22</span> With Isaac did he establish likewise \[for
Abraham his father's sake\] the blessing of all men, and the covenant,
And made it rest upon the head of Jacob. He acknowledged him in his
blessing, and gave him an heritage, and divided his portions; among the
twelve tribes did he part them.
