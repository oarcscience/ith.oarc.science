<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 16</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Desire not a multitude of unprofitable children, neither delight in ungodly sons. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Though they multiply, rejoice not in them, except the fear of the Lord be with them. </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Trust not thou in their life, neither respect their multitude: for one that is just is better than a thousand; and better it is to die without children, than to have them that are ungodly. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For by one that hath understanding shall the city be replenished: but the kindred of the wicked shall speedily become desolate. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Many such things have I seen with mine eyes, and mine ear hath heard greater things than these. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;In the congregation of the ungodly shall a fire be kindled; and in a rebellious nation wrath is set on fire. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;He was not pacified toward the old giants, who fell away in the strength of their foolishness. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Neither spared he the place where Lot sojourned, but abhorred them for their pride. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;He pitied not the people of perdition, who were taken away in their sins: </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Nor the six hundred thousand footmen, who were gathered together in the hardness of their hearts. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And if there be one stiffnecked among the people, it is marvel if he escape unpunished: for mercy and wrath are with him; he is mighty to forgive, and to pour out displeasure. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;As his mercy is great, so is his correction also: he judgeth a man according to his works </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;The sinner shall not escape with his spoils: and the patience of the godly shall not be frustrate. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Make way for every work of mercy: for every man shall find according to his works. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;The Lord hardened Pharaoh, that he should not know him, that his powerful works might be known to the world. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;His mercy is manifest to every creature; and he hath separated his light from the darkness with an adamant. </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Say not thou, I will hide myself from the Lord: shall any remember me from above? I shall not be remembered among so many people: for what is my soul among such an infinite number of creatures? </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Behold, the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, the deep, and the earth, and all that therein is, shall be moved when he shall visit. </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The mountains also and foundations of the earth be shaken with trembling, when the Lord looketh upon them. </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;No heart can think upon these things worthily: and who is able to conceive his ways? </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;It is a tempest which no man can see: for the most part of his works are hid. </P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Who can declare the works of his justice? or who can endure them? for his covenant is afar off, and the trial of all things is in the end. </P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;He that wanteth understanding will think upon vain things: and a foolish man erring imagineth follies. </P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;by son, hearken unto me, and learn knowledge, and mark my words with thy heart. </P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;I will shew forth doctrine in weight, and declare his knowledge exactly. </P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;The works of the Lord are done in judgment from the beginning: and from the time he made them he disposed the parts thereof. </P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;He garnished his works for ever, and in his hand are the chief of them unto all generations: they neither labour, nor are weary, nor cease from their works. </P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;None of them hindereth another, and they shall never disobey his word. </P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;After this the Lord looked upon the earth, and filled it with his blessings. </P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;With all manner of living things hath he covered the face thereof; and they shall return into it again. </P>
