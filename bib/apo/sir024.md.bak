### Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> Wisdom shall praise herself, and shall glory in
the midst of her people.

<span id="002">2</span> In the congregation of the most High shall she
open her mouth, and triumph before his power.

<span id="003">3</span> I came out of the mouth of the most High, and
covered the earth as a cloud.

<span id="004">4</span> I dwelt in high places, and my throne is in a
cloudy pillar.

<span id="005">5</span> I alone compassed the circuit of heaven, and
walked in the bottom of the deep.

<span id="006">6</span> In the waves of the sea and in all the earth,
and in every people and nation, I got a possession.

<span id="007">7</span> With all these I sought rest: and in whose
inheritance shall I abide?

<span id="008">8</span> So the Creator of all things gave me a
commandment, and he that made me caused my tabernacle to rest, and said,
Let thy dwelling be in Jacob, and thine inheritance in Israel.

<span id="009">9</span> He created me from the beginning before the
world, and I shall never fail.

<span id="010">10</span> In the holy tabernacle I served before him; and
so was I established in Sion.

<span id="011">11</span> Likewise in the beloved city he gave me rest,
and in Jerusalem was my power.

<span id="012">12</span> And I took root in an honourable people, even
in the portion of the Lord's inheritance.

<span id="013">13</span> I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a
cypress tree upon the mountains of Hermon.

<span id="014">14</span> I was exalted like a palm tree in En-gaddi, and
as a rose plant in Jericho, as a fair olive tree in a pleasant field,
and grew up as a plane tree by the water.

<span id="015">15</span> I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon and
aspalathus, and I yielded a pleasant odour like the best myrrh, as
galbanum, and onyx, and sweet storax, and as the fume of frankincense in
the tabernacle.

<span id="016">16</span> As the turpentine tree I stretched out my
branches, and my branches are the branches of honour and grace.

<span id="017">17</span> As the vine brought I forth pleasant savour,
and my flowers are the fruit of honour and riches.

<span id="018">18</span> I am the mother of fair love, and fear, and
knowledge, and holy hope: I therefore, being eternal, am given to all my
children which are named of him.

<span id="019">19</span> Come unto me, all ye that be desirous of me,
and fill yourselves with my fruits.

<span id="020">20</span> For my memorial is sweeter than honey, and mine
inheritance than the honeycomb.

<span id="021">21</span> They that eat me shall yet be hungry, and they
that drink me shall yet be thirsty.

<span id="022">22</span> He that obeyeth me shall never be confounded,
and they that work by me shall not do amiss.

<span id="023">23</span> All these things are the book of the covenant
of the most high God, even the law which Moses commanded for an heritage
unto the congregations of Jacob.

<span id="024">24</span> Faint not to be strong in the Lord; that he may
confirm you, cleave unto him: for the Lord Almighty is God alone, and
beside him there is no other Saviour.

<span id="025">25</span> He filleth all things with his wisdom, as
Phison and as Tigris in the time of the new fruits.

<span id="026">26</span> He maketh the understanding to abound like
Euphrates, and as Jordan in the time of the harvest.

<span id="027">27</span> He maketh the doctrine of knowledge appear as
the light, and as Geon in the time of vintage.

<span id="028">28</span> The first man knew her not perfectly: no more
shall the last find her out.

<span id="029">29</span> For her thoughts are more than the sea, and her
counsels profounder than the great deep.

<span id="030">30</span> I also came out as a brook from a river, and as
a conduit into a garden.

<span id="031">31</span> I said, I will water my best garden, and will
water abundantly my garden bed: and, lo, my brook became a river, and my
river became a sea.

<span id="032">32</span> I will yet make doctrine to shine as the
morning, and will send forth her light afar off.

<span id="033">33</span> I will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy, and
leave it to all ages for ever.

<span id="034">34</span> Behold that I have not laboured for myself
only, but for all them that seek wisdom.
