<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 19</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;A labouring man that A is given to drunkenness shall not be rich: and he that contemneth small things shall fall by little and little. </P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Wine and women will make men of understanding to fall away: and he that cleaveth to harlots will become impudent. </P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Moths and worms shall have him to heritage, and a bold man shall be taken away. </P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;He that is hasty to give credit is lightminded; and he that sinneth shall offend against his own soul. </P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Whoso taketh pleasure in wickedness shall be condemned: but he that resisteth pleasures crowneth his life. </P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;He that can rule his tongue shall live without strife; and he that hateth babbling shall have less evil. </P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Rehearse not unto another that which is told unto thee, and thou shalt fare never the worse. </P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Whether it be to friend or foe, talk not of other men's lives; and if thou canst without offence, reveal them not. </P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For he heard and observed thee, and when time cometh he will hate thee. </P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;If thou hast heard a word, let it die with thee; and be bold, it will not burst thee. </P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;A fool travaileth with a word, as a woman in labour of a child. </P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;As an arrow that sticketh in a man's thigh, so is a word within a fool's belly. </P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Admonish a friend, it may be he hath not done it: and if he have done it, that he do it no more. </P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Admonish thy friend, it may be he hath not said it: and if he have, that he speak it not again. </P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Admonish a friend: for many times it is a slander, and believe not every tale. </P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;There is one that slippeth in his speech, but not from his heart; and who is he that hath not offended with his tongue? </P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Admonish thy neighbour before thou threaten him; and not being angry, give place to the law of the most High. </P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;The fear of the Lord is the first step to be accepted [of him,] and wisdom obtaineth his love. </P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The knowledge of the commandments of the Lord is the doctrine of life: and they that do things that please him shall receive the fruit of the tree of immortality. </P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;The fear of the Lord is all wisdom; and in all wisdom is the performance of the law, and the knowledge of his omnipotency. </P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;If a servant say to his master, I will not do as it pleaseth thee; though afterward he do it, he angereth him that nourisheth him. </P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;The knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom, neither at any time the counsel of sinners prudence. </P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;There is a wickedness, and the same an abomination; and there is a fool wanting in wisdom. </P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;He that hath small understanding, and feareth God, is better than one that hath much wisdom, and transgresseth the law of the most High. </P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;There is an exquisite subtilty, and the same is unjust; and there is one that turneth aside to make judgment appear; and there is a wise man that justifieth in judgment. </P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;There is a wicked man that hangeth down his head sadly; but inwardly he is full of deceit, </P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Casting down his countenance, and making as if he heard not: where he is not known, he will do thee a mischief before thou be aware. </P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And if for want of power he be hindered from sinning, yet when he findeth opportunity he will do evil. </P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;A man may be known by his look, and one that hath understanding by his countenance, when thou meetest him. </P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;A man's attire, and excessive laughter, and gait, shew what he is. </P>
