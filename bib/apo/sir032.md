### Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 32

<span id="001">1</span> If thou be made the master \[of a feast,\] lift
not thyself up, but be among them as one of the rest; take diligent care
for them, and so sit down.

<span id="002">2</span> And when thou hast done all thy office, take thy
place, that thou mayest be merry with them, and receive a crown for thy
well ordering of the feast.

<span id="003">3</span> Speak, thou that art the elder, for it becometh
thee, but with sound judgment; and hinder not musick.

<span id="004">4</span> Pour not out words where there is a musician,
and shew not forth wisdom out of time.

<span id="005">5</span> A concert of musick in a banquet of wine is as a
signet of carbuncle set in gold.

<span id="006">6</span> As a signet of an emerald set in a work of gold,
so is the melody of musick with pleasant wine.

<span id="007">7</span> Speak, young man, if there be need of thee: and
yet scarcely when thou art twice asked.

<span id="008">8</span> Let thy speech be short, comprehending much in
few words; be as one that knoweth and yet holdeth his tongue.

<span id="009">9</span> If thou be among great men, make not thyself
equal with them; and when ancient men are in place, use not many words.

<span id="010">10</span> Before the thunder goeth lightning; and before
a shamefaced man shall go favour.

<span id="011">11</span> Rise up betimes, and be not the last; but get
thee home without delay.

<span id="012">12</span> There take thy pastime, and do what thou wilt:
but sin not by proud speech.

<span id="013">13</span> And for these things bless him that made thee,
and hath replenished thee with his good things.

<span id="014">14</span> Whoso feareth the Lord will receive his
discipline; and they that seek him early shall find favour.

<span id="015">15</span> He that seeketh the law shall be filled
therewith: but the hypocrite will be offended thereat.

<span id="016">16</span> They that fear the Lord shall find judgment,
and shall kindle justice as a light.

<span id="017">17</span> A sinful man will not be reproved, but findeth
an excuse according to his will.

<span id="018">18</span> A man of counsel will be considerate; but a
strange and proud man is not daunted with fear, even when of himself he
hath done without counsel.

<span id="019">19</span> Do nothing without advice; and when thou hast
once done, repent not.

<span id="020">20</span> Go not in a way wherein thou mayest fall, and
stumble not among the stones.

<span id="021">21</span> Be not confident in a plain way.

<span id="022">22</span> And beware of thine own children.

<span id="023">23</span> In every good work trust thy own soul; for this
is the keeping of the commandments.

<span id="024">24</span> He that believeth in the Lord taketh heed to
the commandment; and he that trusteth in him shall fare never the worse.
