### Apocrypha: 2 Macabees Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> When these covenants were made, Lysias went unto
the king, and the Jews were about their husbandry.

<span id="002">2</span> But of the governours of several places,
Timotheus, and Apollonius the son of Genneus, also Hieronymus, and
Demophon, and beside them Nicanor the governor of Cyprus, would not
suffer them to be quiet and live in peace.

<span id="003">3</span> The men of Joppa also did such an ungodly deed:
they prayed the Jews that dwelt among them to go with their wives and
children into the boats which they had prepared, as though they had
meant them no hurt.

<span id="004">4</span> Who accepted of it according to the common
decree of the city, as being desirous to live in peace, and suspecting
nothing: but when they were gone forth into the deep, they drowned no
less than two hundred of them.

<span id="005">5</span> When Judas heard of this cruelty done unto his
countrymen, he commanded those that were with him to make them ready.

<span id="006">6</span> And calling upon God the righteous Judge, he
came against those murderers of his brethren, and burnt the haven by
night, and set the boats on fire, and those that fled thither he slew.

<span id="007">7</span> And when the town was shut up, he went backward,
as if he would return to root out all them of the city of Joppa.

<span id="008">8</span> But when he heard that the Jamnites were minded
to do in like manner unto the Jews that dwelt among them,

<span id="009">9</span> He came upon the Jamnites also by night, and set
fire on the haven and the navy, so that the light of the fire was seen
at Jerusalem two hundred and forty furlongs off.

<span id="010">10</span> Now when they were gone from thence nine
furlongs in their journey toward Timotheus, no fewer than five thousand
men on foot and five hundred horsemen of the Arabians set upon him.

<span id="011">11</span> Whereupon there was a very sore battle; but
Judas' side by the help of God got the victory; so that the Nomades of
Arabia, being overcome, besought Judas for peace, promising both to give
him cattle, and to pleasure him otherwise.

<span id="012">12</span> Then Judas, thinking indeed that they would be
profitable in many things, granted them peace: whereupon they shook
hands, and so they departed to their tents.

<span id="013">13</span> He went also about to make a bridge to a
certain strong city, which was fenced about with walls, and inhabited by
people of divers countries; and the name of it was Caspis.

<span id="014">14</span> But they that were within it put such trust in
the strength of the walls and provision of victuals, that they behaved
themselves rudely toward them that were with Judas, railing and
blaspheming, and uttering such words as were not to be spoken.

<span id="015">15</span> Wherefore Judas with his company, calling upon
the great Lord of the world, who without rams or engines of war did cast
down Jericho in the time of Joshua, gave a fierce assault against the
walls,

<span id="016">16</span> And took the city by the will of God, and made
unspeakable slaughters, insomuch that a lake two furlongs broad near
adjoining thereunto, being filled full, was seen running with blood.

<span id="017">17</span> Then departed they from thence seven hundred
and fifty furlongs, and came to Characa unto the Jews that are called
Tubieni.

<span id="018">18</span> But as for Timotheus, they found him not in the
places: for before he had dispatched any thing, he departed from thence,
having left a very strong garrison in a certain hold.

<span id="019">19</span> Howbeit Dositheus and Sosipater, who were of
Maccabeus' captains, went forth, and slew those that Timotheus had left
in the fortress, above ten thousand men.

<span id="020">20</span> And Maccabeus ranged his army by bands, and set
them over the bands, and went against Timotheus, who had about him an
hundred and twenty thousand men of foot, and two thousand and five
hundred horsemen.

<span id="021">21</span> Now when Timotheus had knowledge of Judas'
coming, he sent the women and children and the other baggage unto a
fortress called Carnion: for the town was hard to besiege, and uneasy to
come unto, by reason of the straitness of all the places.

<span id="022">22</span> But when Judas his first band came in sight,
the enemies, being smitten with fear and terror through the appearing of
him who seeth all things, fled amain, one running into this way, another
that way, so as that they were often hurt of their own men, and wounded
with the points of their own swords.

<span id="023">23</span> Judas also was very earnest in pursuing them,
killing those wicked wretches, of whom he slew about thirty thousand
men.

<span id="024">24</span> Moreover Timotheus himself fell into the hands
of Dositheus and Sosipater, whom he besought with much craft to let him
go with his life, because he had many of the Jews' parents, and the
brethren of some of them, who, if they put him to death, should not be
regarded.

<span id="025">25</span> So when he had assured them with many words
that he would restore them without hurt, according to the agreement,
they let him go for the saving of their brethren.

<span id="026">26</span> Then Maccabeus marched forth to Carnion, and to
the temple of Atargatis, and there he slew five and twenty thousand
persons.

<span id="027">27</span> And after he had put to flight and destroyed
them, Judas removed the host toward Ephron, a strong city, wherein
Lysias abode, and a great multitude of divers nations, and the strong
young men kept the walls, and defended them mightily: wherein also was
great provision of engines and darts.

<span id="028">28</span> But when Judas and his company had called upon
Almighty God, who with his power breaketh the strength of his enemies,
they won the city, and slew twenty and five thousand of them that were
within,

<span id="029">29</span> From thence they departed to Scythopolis, which
lieth six hundred furlongs from Jerusalem,

<span id="030">30</span> But when the Jews that dwelt there had
testified that the Scythopolitans dealt lovingly with them, and
entreated them kindly in the time of their adversity;

<span id="031">31</span> They gave them thanks, desiring them to be
friendly still unto them: and so they came to Jerusalem, the feast of
the weeks approaching.

<span id="032">32</span> And after the feast, called Pentecost, they
went forth against Gorgias the governor of Idumea,

<span id="033">33</span> Who came out with three thousand men of foot
and four hundred horsemen.

<span id="034">34</span> And it happened that in their fighting together
a few of the Jews were slain.

<span id="035">35</span> At which time Dositheus, one of Bacenor's
company, who was on horseback, and a strong man, was still upon Gorgias,
and taking hold of his coat drew him by force; and when he would have
taken that cursed man alive, a horseman of Thracia coming upon him smote
off his shoulder, so that Gorgias fled unto Marisa.

<span id="036">36</span> Now when they that were with Gorgias had fought
long, and were weary, Judas called upon the Lord, that he would shew
himself to be their helper and leader of the battle.

<span id="037">37</span> And with that he began in his own language, and
sung psalms with a loud voice, and rushing unawares upon Gorgias' men,
he put them to flight.

<span id="038">38</span> So Judas gathered his host, and came into the
city of Odollam, And when the seventh day came, they purified
themselves, as the custom was, and kept the sabbath in the same place.

<span id="039">39</span> And upon the day following, as the use had
been, Judas and his company came to take up the bodies of them that were
slain, and to bury them with their kinsmen in their fathers' graves.

<span id="040">40</span> Now under the coats of every one that was slain
they found things consecrated to the idols of the Jamnites, which is
forbidden the Jews by the law. Then every man saw that this was the
cause wherefore they were slain.

<span id="041">41</span> All men therefore praising the Lord, the
righteous Judge, who had opened the things that were hid,

<span id="042">42</span> Betook themselves unto prayer, and besought him
that the sin committed might wholly be put out of remembrance. Besides,
that noble Judas exhorted the people to keep themselves from sin,
forsomuch as they saw before their eyes the things that came to pass for
the sins of those that were slain.

<span id="043">43</span> And when he had made a gathering throughout the
company to the sum of two thousand drachms of silver, he sent it to
Jerusalem to offer a sin offering, doing therein very well and honestly,
in that he was mindful of the resurrection:

<span id="044">44</span> For if he had not hoped that they that were
slain should have risen again, it had been superfluous and vain to pray
for the dead.

<span id="045">45</span> And also in that he perceived that there was
great favour laid up for those that died godly, it was an holy and good
thought. Whereupon he made a reconciliation for the dead, that they
might be delivered from sin.
