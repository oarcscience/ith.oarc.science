<p align="center"><a href="../apo/aza001.htm">Apo</a></p><P>1&nbsp;And they walked in the midst of the fire, praising God, and blessing the Lord. </P>
<P>2&nbsp;Then Azarias stood up, and prayed on this manner; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire said, </P>
<P>3&nbsp;Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: thy name is worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore: </P>
<P>4&nbsp;For thou art righteous in all the things that thou hast done to us: yea, true are all thy works, thy ways are right, and all thy judgments truth. </P>
<P>5&nbsp;In all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, even Jerusalem, thou hast executed true judgment: for according to truth and judgment didst thou bring all these things upon us because of our sins. </P>
<P>6&nbsp;For we have sinned and committed iniquity, departing from thee. </P>
<P>7&nbsp;In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed thy commandments, nor kept them, neither done as thou hast commanded us, that it might go well with us. </P>
<P>8&nbsp;Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thing that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment. </P>
<P>9&nbsp;And thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers of God, and to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the world. </P>
<P>10&nbsp;And now we cannot open our mouths, we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants; and to them that worship thee. </P>
<P>11&nbsp;Yet deliver us not up wholly, for thy name's sake, neither disannul thou thy covenant: </P>
<P>12&nbsp;And cause not thy mercy to depart from us, for thy beloved Abraham's sake, for thy servant Issac's sake, and for thy holy Israel's sake; </P>
<P>13&nbsp;To whom thou hast spoken and promised, that thou wouldest multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that lieth upon the seashore. </P>
<P>14&nbsp;For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because of our sins. </P>
<P>15&nbsp;Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place to sacrifice before thee, and to find mercy. </P>
<P>16&nbsp;Nevertheless in a contrite heart and an humble spirit let us be accepted. </P>
<P>17&nbsp;Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and grant that we may wholly go after thee: for they shall not be confounded that put their trust in thee. </P>
<P>18&nbsp;And now we follow thee with all our heart, we fear thee, and seek thy face. </P>
<P>19&nbsp;Put us not to shame: but deal with us after thy lovingkindness, and according to the multitude of thy mercies. </P>
<P>20&nbsp;Deliver us also according to thy marvellous works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord: and let all them that do thy servants hurt be ashamed; </P>
<P>21&nbsp;And let them be confounded in all their power and might, and let their strength be broken; </P>
<P>22&nbsp;And let them know that thou art God, the only God, and glorious over the whole world. </P>
<P>23&nbsp;And the king's servants, that put them in, ceased not to make the oven hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and small wood; </P>
<P>24&nbsp;So that the flame streamed forth above the furnace forty and nine cubits. </P>
<P>25&nbsp;And it passed through, and burned those Chaldeans it found about the furnace. </P>
<P>26&nbsp;But the angel of the Lord came down into the oven together with Azarias and his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire out of the oven; </P>
<P>27&nbsp;And made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind, so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them. </P>
<P>28&nbsp;Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised, glorified, and blessed, God in the furnace, saying, </P>
<P>29&nbsp;Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever. </P>
<P>30&nbsp;And blessed is thy glorious and holy name: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever. </P>
<P>31&nbsp;Blessed art thou in the temple of thine holy glory: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever. </P>
<P>32&nbsp;Blessed art thou that beholdest the depths, and sittest upon the cherubims: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever. </P>
<P>33&nbsp;Blessed art thou on the glorious throne of thy kingdom: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever. </P>
<P>34&nbsp;Blessed art thou in the firmament of heaven: and above ail to be praised and glorified for ever. </P>

<P>68&nbsp;O all ye that worship the Lord, bless the God of gods, praise him, and give him thanks: for his mercy endureth for ever. </P>
