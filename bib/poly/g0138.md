G138  
αἱρέομαι  
aihreomai  
*hahee-reh‘-om-ahee*  
Probably akin to [142](g0142.md) to *take* *for* *oneself*, that is, to
*prefer*. Some of the forms are borrowed from a cognate ( ἕλλομαι h
ellomai ), which is otherwise obsolete: - choose. Some of the forms are
borrowed from a cognate hellomai, hel-lom-ahee; which is otherwise
obsolete.
