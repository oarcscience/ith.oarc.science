### Sirach 50

[Apo](../apo/sir050.md)

1 Simon the high priest, the son of Onias, who in his life repaired the
house again, and in his days fortified the temple:

2 And by him was built from the foundation the double height, the high
fortress of the wall about the temple:

3 In his days the cistern to receive water, being in compass as the sea,
was covered with plates of brass:

4 He took care of the temple that it should not fall, and fortified the
city against besieging:

5 How was he honoured in the midst of the people in his coming out of
the sanctuary!

6 He was as the morning star in the midst of a cloud, and as the moon at
the full:

7 As the sun shining upon the temple of the most High, and as the
rainbow giving light in the bright clouds:

8 And as the flower of roses in the spring of the year, as lilies by the
rivers of waters, and as the branches of the frankincense tree in the
time of summer:

9 As fire and incense in the censer, and as a vessel of beaten gold set
with all manner of precious stones:

10 And as a fair olive tree budding forth fruit, and as a cypress tree
which groweth up to the clouds.

11 When he put on the robe of honour, and was clothed with the
perfection of glory, when he went up to the holy altar, he made the
garment of holiness honourable.

12 When he took the portions out of the priests' hands, he himself stood
by the hearth of the altar, compassed about, as a young cedar in
Libanus; and as palm trees compassed they him round about.

13 So were all the sons of Aaron in their glory, and the oblations of
the Lord in their hands, before all the congregation of Israel.

14 And finishing the service at the altar, that he might adorn the
offering of the most high Almighty,

15 He stretched out his hand to the cup, and poured of the blood of the
grape, he poured out at the foot of the altar a sweetsmelling savour
unto the most high King of all.

16 Then shouted the sons of Aaron, and sounded the silver trumpets, and
made a great noise to be heard, for a remembrance before the most High.

17 Then all the people together hasted, and fell down to the earth upon
their faces to worship their Lord God Almighty, the most High.

18 The singers also sang praises with their voices, with great variety
of sounds was there made sweet melody.

19 And the people besought the Lord, the most High, by prayer before him
that is merciful, till the solemnity of the Lord was ended, and they had
finished his service.

20 Then he went down, and lifted up his hands over the whole
congregation of the children of Israel, to give the blessing of the Lord
with his lips, and to rejoice in his name.

21 And they bowed themselves down to worship the second time, that they
might receive a blessing from the most High.

22 Now therefore bless ye the God of all, which only doeth wondrous
things every where, which exalteth our days from the womb, and dealeth
with us according to his mercy.

23 He grant us joyfulness of heart, and that peace may be in our days in
Israel for ever:

24 That he would confirm his mercy with us, and deliver us at his time!

25 There be two manner of nations which my heart abhorreth, and the
third is no nation:

26 They that sit upon the mountain of Samaria, and they that dwell among
the Philistines, and that foolish people that dwell in Sichem.

27 Jesus the son of Sirach of Jerusalem hath written in this book the
instruction of understanding and knowledge, who out of his heart poured
forth wisdom.

28 Blessed is he that shall be exercised in these things; and he that
layeth them up in his heart shall become wise.

29 For if he do them, he shall be strong to all things: for the light of
the Lord leadeth him, who giveth wisdom to the godly. Blessed be the
name of the Lord for ever. Amen, Amen.

1 Σιμων Ονιου υἱὸς ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας ὃς ἐν ζωῇ αὐτοῦ ὑπέρραψεν οἶκον καὶ ἐν
ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ ἐστερέωσεν ναόν

2 καὶ ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἐθεμελιώθη ὕψος διπλῆς ἀνάλημμα ὑψηλὸν περιβόλου ἱεροῦ

3 ἐν ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ ἐλατομήθη ἀποδοχεῖον ὑδάτων λάκκος ὡσεὶ θαλάσσης τὸ
περίμετρον

4 ὁ φροντίζων τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ πτώσεως καὶ ἐνισχύσας πόλιν ἐν
πολιορκήσει

5 ὡς ἐδοξάσθη ἐν περιστροφῇ λαοῦ ἐν ἐξόδῳ οἴκου καταπετάσματος

6 ὡς ἀστὴρ ἑωθινὸς ἐν μέσῳ νεφελῶν ὡς σελήνη πλήρης ἐν ἡμέραις

7 ὡς ἥλιος ἐκλάμπων ἐπὶ ναὸν ὑψίστου καὶ ὡς τόξον φωτίζον ἐν νεφέλαις
δόξης

8 ὡς ἄνθος ῥόδων ἐν ἡμέραις νέων ὡς κρίνα ἐπ᾽ ἐξόδῳ ὕδατος ὡς βλαστὸς
Λιβάνου ἐν ἡμέραις θέρους

9 ὡς πῦρ καὶ λίβανος ἐπὶ πυρείου ὡς σκεῦος χρυσίου ὁλοσφύρητον
κεκοσμημένον παντὶ λίθῳ πολυτελεῖ

10 ὡς ἐλαία ἀναθάλλουσα καρποὺς καὶ ὡς κυπάρισσος ὑψουμένη ἐν νεφέλαις

11 ἐν τῷ ἀναλαμβάνειν αὐτὸν στολὴν δόξης καὶ ἐνδιδύσκεσθαι αὐτὸν
συντέλειαν καυχήματος ἐν ἀναβάσει θυσιαστηρίου ἁγίου ἐδόξασεν περιβολὴν
ἁγιάσματος

12 ἐν δὲ τῷ δέχεσθαι μέλη ἐκ χειρῶν ἱερέων καὶ αὐτὸς ἑστὼς παρ᾽ ἐσχάρᾳ
βωμοῦ κυκλόθεν αὐτοῦ στέφανος ἀδελφῶν ὡς βλάστημα κέδρων ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ
καὶ ἐκύκλωσαν αὐτὸν ὡς στελέχη φοινίκων

13 καὶ πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ Ααρων ἐν δόξῃ αὐτῶν καὶ προσφορὰ κυρίου ἐν χερσὶν
αὐτῶν ἔναντι πάσης ἐκκλησίας Ισραηλ

14 καὶ συντέλειαν λειτουργῶν ἐπὶ βωμῶν κοσμῆσαι προσφορὰν ὑψίστου
παντοκράτορος

15 ἐξέτεινεν ἐπὶ σπονδείου χεῖρα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔσπεισεν ἐξ αἵματος σταφυλῆς
ἐξέχεεν εἰς θεμέλια θυσιαστηρίου ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας ὑψίστῳ παμβασιλεῖ

16 τότε ἀνέκραγον οἱ υἱοὶ Ααρων ἐν σάλπιγξιν ἐλαταῖς ἤχησαν ἀκουστὴν
ἐποίησαν φωνὴν μεγάλην εἰς μνημόσυνον ἔναντι ὑψίστου

17 τότε πᾶς ὁ λαὸς κοινῇ κατέσπευσαν καὶ ἔπεσαν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν
προσκυνῆσαι τῷ κυρίῳ αὐτῶν παντοκράτορι θεῷ ὑψίστῳ

18 καὶ ᾔνεσαν οἱ ψαλτῳδοὶ ἐν φωναῖς αὐτῶν ἐν πλείστῳ ἤχῳ ἐγλυκάνθη μέλος

19 καὶ ἐδεήθη ὁ λαὸς κυρίου ὑψίστου ἐν προσευχῇ κατέναντι ἐλεήμονος ἕως
συντελεσθῇ κόσμος κυρίου καὶ τὴν λειτουργίαν αὐτοῦ ἐτελείωσαν

20 τότε καταβὰς ἐπῆρεν χεῖρας αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν ἐκκλησίαν υἱῶν Ισραηλ
δοῦναι εὐλογίαν κυρίου ἐκ χειλέων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ καυχήσασθαι

21 καὶ ἐδευτέρωσαν ἐν προσκυνήσει ἐπιδέξασθαι τὴν εὐλογίαν παρὰ ὑψίστου

22 καὶ νῦν εὐλογήσατε τὸν θεὸν πάντων τὸν μεγάλα ποιοῦντα πάντῃ τὸν
ὑψοῦντα ἡμέρας ἡμῶν ἐκ μήτρας καὶ ποιοῦντα μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν κατὰ τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ

23 δῴη ἡμῖν εὐφροσύνην καρδίας καὶ γενέσθαι εἰρήνην ἐν ἡμέραις ἡμῶν ἐν
Ισραηλ κατὰ τὰς ἡμέρας τοῦ αἰῶνος

24 ἐμπιστεύσαι μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἡμῶν
λυτρωσάσθω ἡμᾶς

25 ἐν δυσὶν ἔθνεσιν προσώχθισεν ἡ ψυχή μου καὶ τὸ τρίτον οὐκ ἔστιν ἔθνος

26 οἱ καθήμενοι ἐν ὄρει Σαμαρείας καὶ Φυλιστιιμ καὶ ὁ λαὸς ὁ μωρὸς ὁ
κατοικῶν ἐν Σικιμοις

27 παιδείαν συνέσεως καὶ ἐπιστήμης ἐχάραξεν ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τούτῳ Ἰησοῦς
υἱὸς Σιραχ Ελεαζαρ ὁ Ιεροσολυμίτης ὃς ἀνώμβρησεν σοφίαν ἀπὸ καρδίας
αὐτοῦ

28 μακάριος ὃς ἐν τούτοις ἀναστραφήσεται καὶ θεὶς αὐτὰ ἐπὶ καρδίαν αὐτοῦ
σοφισθήσεται

29 ἐὰν γὰρ αὐτὰ ποιήσῃ πρὸς πάντα ἰσχύσει ὅτι φῶς κυρίου τὸ ἴχνος αὐτοῦ

[Vul](../vul/sir050.md)

1 \[Simon, Oniæ filius, sacerdos magnus,  
qui in vita sua suffulsit domum,  
et in diebus suis corroboravit templum.  

2 Templi etiam altitudo ab ipso fundata est,  
duplex ædificatio, et excelsi parietes templi.  

3 In diebus ipsius emanaverunt putei aquarum,  
et quasi mare adimpleti sunt supra modum.  

4 Qui curavit gentem suam,  
et liberavit eam a perditione:  

5 qui prævaluit amplificare civitatem,  
qui adeptus est gloriam in conversatione gentis,  
et ingressum domus et atrii amplificavit.  

6 Quasi stella matutina in medio nebulæ,  
et quasi luna plena, in diebus suis lucet:  

7 et quasi sol refulgens,  
sic ille effulsit in templo Dei.  

8 Quasi arcus refulgens inter nebulas gloriæ,  
et quasi flos rosarum in diebus vernis,  
et quasi lilia quæ sunt in transitu aquæ,  
et quasi thus redolens in diebus æstatis:  

9 quasi ignis effulgens,  
et thus ardens in igne:  

10 quasi vas auri solidum,  
ornatum omni lapide pretioso:  

11 quasi oliva pullulans, et cypressus in altitudinem se extollens,  
in accipiendo ipsum stolam gloriæ,  
et vestiri eum in consummationem virtutis.  

12 In ascensu altaris sancti  
gloriam dedit sanctitatis amictum.  

13 In accipiendo autem partes de manu sacerdotum,  
et ipse stans juxta aram:  
et circa illum corona fratrum:  
quasi plantatio cedri in monte Libano,  

14 sic circa illum steterunt quasi rami palmæ:  
et omnes filii Aaron in gloria sua.  

15 Oblatio autem Domini in manibus ipsorum  
coram omni synagoga Israël:  
et consummatione fungens in ara,  
amplificare oblationem excelsi Regis,  

16 porrexit manum suam in libatione,  
et libavit de sanguine uvæ.  

17 Effudit in fundamento altaris  
odorem divinum excelso Principi.  

18 Tunc exclamaverunt filii Aaron,  
in tubis productilibus sonuerunt:  
et auditam fecerunt vocem magnam in memoriam coram Deo.  

19 Tunc omnis populus simul properaverunt,  
et ceciderunt in faciem super terram,  
adorare Dominum Deum suum,  
et dare preces omnipotenti Deo excelso.  

20 Et amplificaverunt psallentes in vocibus suis,  
et in magna domo auctus est sonus suavitatis plenus.  

21 Et rogavit populus Dominum excelsum in prece,  
usque dum perfectus est honor Domini,  
et munus suum perfecerunt.  

22 Tunc descendens, manus suas extulit  
in omne congregationem filiorum Israël,  
dare gloriam Deo a labiis suis,  
et in nomine ipsius gloriari:  

23 et iteravit orationem suam,  
volens ostendere virtutem Dei.  

24 Et nunc orate Deum omnium, qui magna fecit in omni terra,  
qui auxit dies nostros a ventre matris nostræ,  
et fecit nobiscum secundum suam misericordiam:  

25 det nobis jucunditatem cordis,  
et fieri pacem in diebus nostris in Israël per dies sempiternos:  

26 credere Israël nobiscum esse Dei misericordiam,  
ut liberet nos in diebus suis.\]  

27 \[Duas gentes odit anima mea:  
tertia autem non est gens quam oderim:  

28 qui sedent in monte Seir, et Philisthiim,  
et stultus populus qui habitat in Sichimis.\]  

29 \[Doctrinam sapientiæ et disciplinæ scripsit in codice isto  
Jesus, filius Sirach, Jerosolymita,  
qui renovavit sapientiam de corde suo.  

30 Beatus qui in istis versatur bonis:  
qui ponit illa in corde suo, sapiens erit semper.  

31 Si enim hæc fecerit, ad omnia valebit, quia lux Dei vestigium ejus
est.\]
