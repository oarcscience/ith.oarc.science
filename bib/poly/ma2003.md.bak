### 2 Macabees 3

[Apo](../apo/ma2003.md)

1 Now when the holy city was inhabited with all peace, and the laws were
kept very well, because of the godliness of Onias the high priest, and
his hatred of wickedness,

2 It came to pass that even the kings themselves did honour the place,
and magnify the temple with their best gifts;

3 Insomuch that Seleucus of Asia of his own revenues bare all the costs
belonging to the service of the sacrifices.

4 But one Simon of the tribe of Benjamin, who was made governor of the
temple, fell out with the high priest about disorder in the city.

5 And when he could not overcome Onias, he gat him to Apollonius the son
of Thraseas, who then was governor of Celosyria and Phenice,

6 And told him that the treasury in Jerusalem was full of infinite sums
of money, so that the multitude of their riches, which did not pertain
to the account of the sacrifices, was innumerable, and that it was
possible to bring all into the king's hand.

7 Now when Apollonius came to the king, and had shewed him of the money
whereof he was told, the king chose out Heliodorus his treasurer, and
sent him with a commandment to bring him the foresaid money.

8 So forthwith Heliodorus took his journey; under a colour of visiting
the cities of Celosyria and Phenice, but indeed to fulfil the king's
purpose.

9 And when he was come to Jerusalem, and had been courteously received
of the high priest of the city, he told him what intelligence was given
of the money, and declared wherefore he came, and asked if these things
were so indeed.

10 Then the high priest told him that there was such money laid up for
the relief of widows and fatherless children:

11 And that some of it belonged to Hircanus son of Tobias, a man of
great dignity, and not as that wicked Simon had misinformed: the sum
whereof in all was four hundred talents of silver, and two hundred of
gold:

12 And that it was altogether impossible that such wrongs should be done
unto them, that had committed it to the holiness of the place, and to
the majesty and inviolable sanctity of the temple, honoured over all the
world.

13 But Heliodorus, because of the king's commandment given him, said,
That in any wise it must be brought into the king's treasury.

14 So at the day which he appointed he entered in to order this matter:
wherefore there was no small agony throughout the whole city.

15 But the priests, prostrating themselves before the altar in their
priests' vestments, called unto heaven upon him that made a law
concerning things given to he kept, that they should safely be preserved
for such as had committed them to be kept.

16 Then whoso had looked the high priest in the face, it would have
wounded his heart: for his countenance and the changing of his colour
declared the inward agony of his mind.

17 For the man was so compassed with fear and horror of the body, that
it was manifest to them that looked upon him, what sorrow he had now in
his heart.

18 Others ran flocking out of their houses to the general supplication,
because the place was like to come into contempt.

19 And the women, girt with sackcloth under their breasts, abounded in
the streets, and the virgins that were kept in ran, some to the gates,
and some to the walls, and others looked out of the windows.

20 And all, holding their hands toward heaven, made supplication.

21 Then it would have pitied a man to see the falling down of the
multitude of all sorts, and the fear of the high priest being in such an
agony.

22 They then called upon the Almighty Lord to keep the things committed
of trust safe and sure for those that had committed them.

23 Nevertheless Heliodorus executed that which was decreed.

24 Now as he was there present himself with his guard about the
treasury, the Lord of spirits, and the Prince of all power, caused a
great apparition, so that all that presumed to come in with him were
astonished at the power of God, and fainted, and were sore afraid.

25 For there appeared unto them an horse with a terrible rider upon him,
and adorned with a very fair covering, and he ran fiercely, and smote at
Heliodorus with his forefeet, and it seemed that he that sat upon the
horse had complete harness of gold.

26 Moreover two other young men appeared before him, notable in
strength, excellent in beauty, and comely in apparel, who stood by him
on either side; and scourged him continually, and gave him many sore
stripes.

27 And Heliodorus fell suddenly unto the ground, and was compassed with
great darkness: but they that were with him took him up, and put him
into a litter.

28 Thus him, that lately came with a great train and with all his guard
into the said treasury, they carried out, being unable to help himself
with his weapons: and manifestly they acknowledged the power of God.

29 For he by the hand of God was cast down, and lay speechless without
all hope of life.

30 But they praised the Lord, that had miraculously honoured his own
place: for the temple; which a little afore was full of fear and
trouble, when the Almighty Lord appeared, was filled with joy and
gladness.

31 Then straightways certain of Heliodorus' friends prayed Onias, that
he would call upon the most High to grant him his life, who lay ready to
give up the ghost.

32 So the high priest, suspecting lest the king should misconceive that
some treachery had been done to Heliodorus by the Jews, offered a
sacrifice for the health of the man.

33 Now as the high priest was making an atonement, the same young men in
the same clothing appeared and stood beside Heliodorus, saying, Give
Onias the high priest great thanks, insomuch as for his sake the Lord
hath granted thee life:

34 And seeing that thou hast been scourged from heaven, declare unto all
men the mighty power of God. And when they had spoken these words, they
appeared no more.

35 So Heliodorus, after he had offered sacrifice unto the Lord, and made
great vows unto him that had saved his life, and saluted Onias, returned
with his host to the king.

36 Then testified he to all men the works of the great God, which he had
seen with his eyes.

37 And when the king Heliodorus, who might be a fit man to be sent yet
once again to Jerusalem, he said,

38 If thou hast any enemy or traitor, send him thither, and thou shalt
receive him well scourged, if he escape with his life: for in that
place, no doubt; there is an especial power of God.

39 For he that dwelleth in heaven hath his eye on that place, and
defendeth it; and he beateth and destroyeth them that come to hurt it.

40 And the things concerning Heliodorus, and the keeping of the
treasury, fell out on this sort.

[Vul](../vul/ma2003.md)

1 Igitur cum sancta civitas habitaretur in omni pace, leges etiam adhuc
optime custodirentur, propter Oniæ pontificis pietatem, et animos odio
habentes mala,

2 fiebat ut et ipsi reges et principes locum summo honore dignum
ducerent, et templum maximis muneribus illustrarent:

3 ita ut Seleucus Asiæ rex de redditibus suis præstaret omnes sumptus ad
ministerium sacrificiorum pertinentes.

4 Simon autem de tribu Benjamin, præpositus templi constitutus,
contendebat, obsistente sibi principe sacerdotum, iniquum aliquid in
civitate moliri.

5 Sed cum vincere Oniam non posset, venit ad Apollonium Tharsææ filium,
qui eo tempore erat dux Cœlesyriæ et Phœnicis:

6 et nuntiavit ei pecuniis innumerabilibus plenum esse ærarium
Jerosolymis, et communes copias immensas esse, quæ non pertinent ad
rationem sacrificiorum: esse autem possibile sub potestate regis cadere
universa.

7 Cumque retulisset ad regem Apollonius de pecuniis quæ delatæ erant,
illæ accitum Heliodorum, qui erat super negotia ejus, misit, cum
mandatis ut prædictam pecuniam transportaret.

8 Statimque Heliodorus iter est agressus, specie quidem quasi per
Cœlesyriam et Phœnicen civitates esset peragraturus, re vera autem regis
propositum perfecturus.

9 Sed cum venisset Jerosolymam, et benigne a summo sacerdote in civitate
esset exceptus, narravit de dato indicio pecuniarum, et cujus rei gratia
adesset, aperuit: interrogabat autem si vere hæc ita essent.

10 Tunc summus sacerdos ostendit deposita esse hæc, et victualia
viduarum et pupillorum:

11 quædam vero esse Hircani Tobiæ viri valde eminentis, in his quæ
detulerat impius Simon: universa autem argenti talenta esse
quadringenta, et auri ducenta:

12 decipi vero eos qui credidissent loco et templo quod per universum
mundum honoratur pro sui veneratione et sanctitate, omnino impossibile
esse.

13 At ille pro his quæ habebat in mandatis a rege, dicebat omni genere
regi ea esse deferenda.

14 Constituta autem die, intrabat de his Heliodorus ordinaturus. Non
modica vero per universam civitatem erat trepidatio.

15 Sacerdotes autem ante altare cum stolis sacerdotalibus jactaverunt
se, et invocabant de cælo eum qui de depositis legem posuit, ut his qui
deposuerant ea salva custodiret.

16 Jam vero qui videbat summi sacerdotis vultum, mente vulnerabatur:
facies enim et color immutatus declarabat internum animi dolorem:

17 circumfusa enim erat mœstitia quædam viro, et horror corporis, per
quem manifestus aspicientibus dolor cordis ejus efficiebatur.

18 Alii etiam gregatim de domibus confluebant, publica supplicatione
obsecrantes, pro eo quod in contemptum locus esset venturus.

19 Accinctæque mulieres ciliciis pectus, per plateas confluebant: sed et
virgines quæ conclusæ erant, procurrebant ad Oniam, aliæ autem ad muros,
quædam vero per fenestras aspiciebant:

20 universæ autem protendentes manus in cælum, deprecabantur:

21 erat enim misera commistæ multitudinis, et magni sacerdotis in agone
constituti exspectatio.

22 Et hi quidem invocabant omnipotentem Deum, ut credita sibi his qui
crediderant, cum omni integritate conservarentur.

23 Heliodorus autem, quod decreverat, perficiebat eodem loco ipse cum
satellitibus circa ærarium præsens.

24 Sed spiritus omnipotentis Dei magnam fecit suæ ostensionis
evidentiam, ita ut omnes qui ausi fuerant parere ei, ruentes Dei
virtute, in dissolutionem et formidinem converterentur.

25 Apparuit enim illis quidam equus terribilem habens sessorem, optimis
operimentis adornatus: isque cum impetu Heliodoro priores calces elisit:
qui autem ei sedebat, videbatur arma habere aurea.

26 Alii etiam apparuerunt duo juvenes virtute decori, optimi gloria,
speciosique amictu: qui circumsteterunt eum, et ex utraque parte
flagellabant, sine intermissione multis plagis verberantes.

27 Subito autem Heliodorus concidit in terram, eumque multa caligine
circumfusum rapuerunt, atque in sella gestatoria positum ejecerunt.

28 Et is, qui cum multis cursoribus et satellitibus prædictum ingressus
est ærarium, portabatur nullo sibi auxilium ferente, manifesta Dei
cognita virtute:

29 et ille quidem per divinam virtutem jacebat mutus, atque omni spe et
salute privatus.

30 Hi autem Dominum benedicebant, quia magnificabat locum suum: et
templum, quod paulo ante timore ac tumultu erat plenum, apparente
omnipotente Domino, gaudio et lætitia impletum est.

31 Tunc vero ex amicis Heliodori quidam rogabant confestim Oniam, ut
invocaret Altissimum ut vitam donaret ei qui in supremo spiritu erat
constitutus.

32 Considerans autem summus sacerdos ne forte rex suspicaretur malitiam
aliquam ex Judæis circa Heliodorum consummatum, obtulit pro salute viri
hostiam salutarem.

33 Cumque summus sacerdos exoraret, iidem juvenes eisdem vestibus amicti
astantes Heliodoro, dixerunt: Oniæ sacerdoti gratias age: nam propter
eum Dominus tibi vitam donavit.

34 Tu autem a Deo flagellatus, nuntia omnibus magnalia Dei, et
potestatem. Et his dictis, non comparuerunt.

35 Heliodorus autem, hostia Deo oblata, et votis magnis promissis ei qui
vivere illi concessit, et Oniæ gratias agens, recepto exercitu,
repedabat ad regem.

36 Testabatur autem omnibus ea quæ sub oculis suis viderat opera magni
Dei.

37 Cum autem rex interrogasset Heliodorum, quis esset aptus adhuc semel
Jerosolymam mitti, ait:

38 Si quem habes hostem, aut regni tui insidiatorem, mitte illuc, et
flagellatum eum recipies, si tamen evaserit: eo quod in loco sit vere
Dei quædam virtus.

39 Nam ipse, qui habet in cælis habitationem, visitator et adjutor est
loci illius, et venientes ad malefaciendum percutit ac perdit.

40 Igitur de Heliodoro et ærarii custodia ita res se habet.
