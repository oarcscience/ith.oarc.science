Shown as the first form; from [7725](h7725) and [3899](h3899.md) *returner*
*of* *bread*; *Jashubi-Lechem*, an Israelite; but probably the text
should be pointed (as in the second form) and rendered (*they* *were*)
*inhabitants* *of* *Lechem*, that is, of Bethlehem (by contraction): -
Jashubi-lehem. \[Probably the text should be pointed Yoshebey Lechem ,
*yo-sheh-bay* *leh-khem* , and rendered “(they were) inhabitants of
Lechem,” That is,of Bethlehem (by contraction). Compare [3902](h3902.md)
