G5590  
ψυχή  
psuchē  
*psoo-khay‘*  
From [5594](g5594) *breath*, that is, (by implication) *spirit*,
abstractly or concretely (the *animal* sentient principle only; thus
distinguished on the one hand from [4151](g4151) which is the rational
and immortal *soul*; and on the other from [2222](g2222) which is mere
*vitality*, even of plants: these terms thus exactly correspond
respectively to the Hebrew \[[5315](h5315) , \[[7307](h7307) and
\[[2416](h2416) : - heart (+ -ily), life, mind, soul, + us, + you.
