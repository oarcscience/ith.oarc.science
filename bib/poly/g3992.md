G3992  
πέμπω  
pempō  
*pem‘-po*  
Apparently a primary verb; to *dispatch* (from the subjective view or
point of *departure*, whereas ἵημι hiēmi \[as a stronger form of εἶμι
eimi \] refers rather to the objective point or *terminus* *ad* *quem*,
and [4724](g4724) denotes properly the *orderly* motion involved),
especially on a temporary errand; also to *transmit*, *bestow*, or
*wield:* - send, thrust in.
