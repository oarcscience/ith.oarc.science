G5594  
ψύχω  
psuchō  
*psoo‘-kho*  
A primary verb; to *breathe* (*voluntarily* but *gently*; thus differing
on the one hand from [4154](g4154.md) which denotes properly a *forcible*
respiration; and on the other from the base of [109](g0109.md) which refers
properly to an inanimate *breeze*), that is, (by implication of
reduction of temperature by evaporation) to *chill* (figuratively): -
wax cold.
