G3741  
ὅσιος  
hosios  
*hos‘-ee-os*  
Of uncertain affinity; properly *right* (by intrinsic or divine
character; thus distinguished from [1342](g1342.md) which refers rather to
*human* statutes and relations; from [2413](g2413.md) which denotes formal
*consecration*; and from [40](g0040.md) which relates to *purity* from
defilement), that is, *hallowed* (*pious*, *sacred*, *sure*): - holy,
mercy, shalt be.
