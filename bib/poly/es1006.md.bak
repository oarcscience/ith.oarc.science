### 1 Esdras 6

[Apo](../apo/es1006.md)

1 Now in the second year of the reign of Darius Aggeus and Zacharias the
son of Addo, the prophets, prophesied unto the Jews in Jewry and
Jerusalem in the name of the Lord God of Israel, which was upon them.

2 Then stood up Zorobabel the son of Salatiel, and Jesus the son of
Josedec, and began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, the
prophets of the Lord being with them, and helping them.

3 At the same time came unto them Sisinnes the governor of Syria and
Phenice, with Sathrabuzanes and his companions, and said unto them,

4 By whose appointment do ye build this house and this roof, and perform
all the other things? and who are the workmen that perform these things?

5 Nevertheless the elders of the Jews obtained favour, because the Lord
had visited the captivity;

6 And they were not hindered from building, until such time as
signification was given unto Darius concerning them, and an answer
received.

7 The copy of the letters which Sisinnes, governor of Syria and Phenice,
and Sathrabuzanes, with their companions, rulers in Syria and Phenice,
wrote and sent unto Darius; To king Darius, greeting:

8 Let all things be known unto our lord the king, that being come into
the country of Judea, and entered into the city of Jerusalem we found in
the city of Jerusalem the ancients of the Jews that were of the
captivity

9 Building an house unto the Lord, great and new, of hewn and costly
stones, and the timber already laid upon the walls.

10 And those works are done with great speed, and the work goeth on
prosperously in their hands, and with all glory and diligence is it
made.

11 Then asked we these elders, saying, By whose commandment build ye
this house, and lay the foundations of these works?

12 Therefore to the intent that we might give knowledge unto thee by
writing, we demanded of them who were the chief doers, and we required
of them the names in writing of their principal men.

13 So they gave us this answer, We are the servants of the Lord which
made heaven and earth.

14 And as for this house, it was builded many years ago by a king of
Israel great and strong, and was finished.

15 But when our fathers provoked God unto wrath, and sinned against the
Lord of Israel which is in heaven, he gave them over into the power of
Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, of the Chaldees;

16 Who pulled down the house, and burned it, and carried away the people
captives unto Babylon.

17 But in the first year that king Cyrus reigned over the country of
Babylon Cyrus the king wrote to build up this house.

18 And the holy vessels of gold and of silver, that Nabuchodonosor had
carried away out of the house at Jerusalem, and had set them in his own
temple those Cyrus the king brought forth again out of the temple at
Babylon, and they were delivered to Zorobabel and to Sanabassarus the
ruler,

19 With commandment that he should carry away the same vessels, and put
them in the temple at Jerusalem; and that the temple of the Lord should
be built in his place.

20 Then the same Sanabassarus, being come hither, laid the foundations
of the house of the Lord at Jerusalem; and from that time to this being
still a building, it is not yet fully ended.

21 Now therefore, if it seem good unto the king, let search be made
among the records of king Cyrus:

22 And if it be found that the building of the house of the Lord at
Jerusalem hath been done with the consent of king Cyrus, and if our lord
the king be so minded, let him signify unto us thereof.

23 Then commanded king Darius to seek among the records at Babylon: and
so at Ecbatane the palace, which is in the country of Media, there was
found a roll wherein these things were recorded.

24 In the first year of the reign of Cyrus king Cyrus commanded that the
house of the Lord at Jerusalem should be built again, where they do
sacrifice with continual fire:

25 Whose height shall be sixty cubits and the breadth sixty cubits, with
three rows of hewn stones, and one row of new wood of that country; and
the expences thereof to be given out of the house of king Cyrus:

26 And that the holy vessels of the house of the Lord, both of gold and
silver, that Nabuchodonosor took out of the house at Jerusalem, and
brought to Babylon, should be restored to the house at Jerusalem, and be
set in the place where they were before.

27 And also he commanded that Sisinnes the governor of Syria and
Phenice, and Sathrabuzanes, and their companions, and those which were
appointed rulers in Syria and Phenice, should be careful not to meddle
with the place, but suffer Zorobabel, the servant of the Lord, and
governor of Judea, and the elders of the Jews, to build the house of the
Lord in that place.

28 I have commanded also to have it built up whole again; and that they
look diligently to help those that be of the captivity of the Jews, till
the house of the Lord be finished:

29 And out of the tribute of Celosyria and Phenice a portion carefully
to be given these men for the sacrifices of the Lord, that is, to
Zorobabel the governor, for bullocks, and rams, and lambs;

30 And also corn, salt, wine, and oil, and that continually every year
without further question, according as the priests that be in Jerusalem
shall signify to be daily spent:

31 That offerings may be made to the most high God for the king and for
his children, and that they may pray for their lives.

32 And he commanded that whosoever should transgress, yea, or make light
of any thing afore spoken or written, out of his own house should a tree
be taken, and he thereon be hanged, and all his goods seized for the
king.

33 The Lord therefore, whose name is there called upon, utterly destroy
every king and nation, that stretcheth out his hand to hinder or
endamage that house of the Lord in Jerusalem.

34 I Darius the king have ordained that according unto these things it
be done with diligence.

1 ἐν δὲ τῷ δευτέρῳ ἔτει τῆς τοῦ Δαρείου βασιλείας ἐπροφήτευσεν Αγγαιος
καὶ Ζαχαριας ὁ τοῦ Εδδι οἱ προφῆται ἐπὶ τοὺς Ιουδαίους τοὺς ἐν τῇ
Ιουδαίᾳ καὶ Ιερουσαλημ ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι κυρίου θεοῦ Ισραηλ ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς

2 τότε στὰς Ζοροβαβελ ὁ τοῦ Σαλαθιηλ καὶ Ἰησοῦς ὁ τοῦ Ιωσεδεκ ἤρξαντο
οἰκοδομεῖν τὸν οἶκον τοῦ κυρίου τὸν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ συνόντων τῶν προφητῶν
τοῦ κυρίου βοηθούντων αὐτοῖς

3 ἐν αὐτῷ τῷ χρόνῳ παρῆν πρὸς αὐτοὺς Σισίννης ὁ ἔπαρχος Συρίας καὶ
Φοινίκης καὶ Σαθραβουζάνης καὶ οἱ συνέταιροι καὶ εἶπαν αὐτοῖς

4 τίνος ὑμῖν συντάξαντος τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον οἰκοδομεῖτε καὶ τὴν στέγην
ταύτην καὶ τἄλλα πάντα ἐπιτελεῖτε καὶ τίνες εἰσὶν οἱ οἰκοδόμοι οἱ ταῦτα
ἐπιτελοῦντες

5 καὶ ἔσχοσαν χάριν ἐπισκοπῆς γενομένης ἐπὶ τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν παρὰ τοῦ
κυρίου οἱ πρεσβύτεροι τῶν Ιουδαίων

6 καὶ οὐκ ἐκωλύθησαν τῆς οἰκοδομῆς μέχρι τοῦ ὑποσημανθῆναι Δαρείῳ περὶ
αὐτῶν καὶ προσφωνηθῆναι

7 ἀντίγραφον ἐπιστολῆς ἧς ἔγραψεν Δαρείῳ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Σισίννης ὁ
ἔπαρχος Συρίας καὶ Φοινίκης καὶ Σαθραβουζάνης καὶ οἱ συνέταιροι οἱ ἐν
Συρίᾳ καὶ Φοινίκῃ ἡγεμόνες

8 βασιλεῖ Δαρείῳ χαίρειν πάντα γνωστὰ ἔστω τῷ κυρίῳ ἡμῶν τῷ βασιλεῖ ὅτι
παραγενόμενοι εἰς τὴν χώραν τῆς Ιουδαίας καὶ ἐλθόντες εἰς Ιερουσαλημ τὴν
πόλιν κατελάβομεν τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους τῶν Ιουδαίων ἐν
Ιερουσαλημ τῇ πόλει οἰκοδομοῦντας οἶκον τῷ κυρίῳ μέγαν καινὸν διὰ λίθων
ξυστῶν πολυτελῶν ξύλων τιθεμένων ἐν τοῖς τοίχοις

9 καὶ τὰ ἔργα ἐκεῖνα ἐπὶ σπουδῆς γιγνόμενα καὶ εὐοδούμενον τὸ ἔργον ἐν
ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν καὶ ἐν πάσῃ δόξῃ καὶ ἐπιμελείᾳ συντελούμενα

10 τότε ἐπυνθανόμεθα τῶν πρεσβυτέρων τούτων λέγοντες τίνος ὑμῖν
προστάξαντος οἰκοδομεῖτε τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον καὶ τὰ ἔργα ταῦτα θεμελιοῦτε

11 ἐπηρωτήσαμεν οὖν αὐτοὺς εἵνεκεν τοῦ γνωρίσαι σοι καὶ γράψαι σοι τοὺς
ἀνθρώπους τοὺς ἀφηγουμένους καὶ τὴν ὀνοματογραφίαν ᾐτοῦμεν αὐτοὺς τῶν
προκαθηγουμένων

12 οἱ δὲ ἀπεκρίθησαν ἡμῖν λέγοντες ἡμεῖς ἐσμεν παῖδες τοῦ κυρίου τοῦ
κτίσαντος τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν

13 καὶ ᾠκοδόμητο ὁ οἶκος ἔμπροσθεν ἐτῶν πλειόνων διὰ βασιλέως τοῦ Ισραηλ
μεγάλου καὶ ἰσχυροῦ καὶ ἐπετελέσθη

14 καὶ ἐπεὶ οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν παραπικράναντες ἥμαρτον εἰς τὸν κύριον τοῦ
Ισραηλ τὸν οὐράνιον παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς εἰς χεῖρας Ναβουχοδονοσορ βασιλέως
Βαβυλῶνος βασιλέως τῶν Χαλδαίων

15 τόν τε οἶκον καθελόντες ἐνεπύρισαν καὶ τὸν λαὸν ᾐχμαλώτευσαν εἰς
Βαβυλῶνα

16 ἐν δὲ τῷ πρώτῳ ἔτει βασιλεύοντος Κύρου χώρας Βαβυλωνίας ἔγραψεν ὁ
βασιλεὺς Κῦρος οἰκοδομῆσαι τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον

17 καὶ τὰ ἱερὰ σκεύη τὰ χρυσᾶ καὶ τὰ ἀργυρᾶ ἃ ἐξήνεγκεν Ναβουχοδονοσορ
ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἀπηρείσατο αὐτὰ ἐν τῷ ἑαυτοῦ ναῷ
πάλιν ἐξήνεγκεν αὐτὰ Κῦρος ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐκ τοῦ ναοῦ τοῦ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι καὶ
παρεδόθη Ζοροβαβελ καὶ Σαναβασσάρῳ τῷ ἐπάρχῳ

18 καὶ ἐπετάγη αὐτῷ ἀπενέγκαντι πάντα τὰ σκεύη ταῦτα ἀποθεῖναι ἐν τῷ ναῷ
τῷ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ τὸν ναὸν τοῦ κυρίου τοῦτον οἰκοδομηθῆναι ἐπὶ τοῦ
τόπου

19 τότε ὁ Σαναβάσσαρος ἐκεῖνος παραγενόμενος ἐνεβάλετο τοὺς θεμελίους
τοῦ οἴκου κυρίου τοῦ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνου μέχρι τοῦ νῦν
οἰκοδομούμενος οὐκ ἔλαβεν συντέλειαν

20 νῦν οὖν εἰ κρίνεται βασιλεῦ ἐπισκεπήτω ἐν τοῖς βασιλικοῖς
βιβλιοφυλακίοις τοῦ κυρίου βασιλέως τοῖς ἐν Βαβυλῶνι

21 καὶ ἐὰν εὑρίσκηται μετὰ τῆς γνώμης Κύρου τοῦ βασιλέως γενομένην τὴν
οἰκοδομὴν τοῦ οἴκου κυρίου τοῦ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ κρίνηται τῷ κυρίῳ
βασιλεῖ ἡμῶν προσφωνησάτω ἡμῖν περὶ τούτων

22 τότε ὁ βασιλεὺς Δαρεῖος προσέταξεν ἐπισκέψασθαι ἐν τοῖς βασιλικοῖς
βιβλιοφυλακίοις τοῖς κειμένοις ἐν Βαβυλῶνι καὶ εὑρέθη ἐν Ἐκβατάνοις τῇ
βάρει τῇ ἐν Μηδίᾳ χώρᾳ τόμος εἷς ἐν ᾧ ὑπεμνημάτιστο τάδε

23 ἔτους πρώτου βασιλεύοντος Κύρου βασιλεὺς Κῦρος προσέταξεν τὸν οἶκον
τοῦ κυρίου τὸν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ οἰκοδομῆσαι ὅπου ἐπιθύουσιν διὰ πυρὸς
ἐνδελεχοῦς

24 οὗ τὸ ὕψος πήχεων ἑξήκοντα πλάτος πήχεων ἑξήκοντα διὰ δόμων λιθίνων
ξυστῶν τριῶν καὶ δόμου ξυλίνου ἐγχωρίου καινοῦ ἑνός καὶ τὸ δαπάνημα
δοθῆναι ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου Κύρου τοῦ βασιλέως

25 καὶ τὰ ἱερὰ σκεύη τοῦ οἴκου κυρίου τά τε χρυσᾶ καὶ τὰ ἀργυρᾶ ἃ
ἐξήνεγκεν Ναβουχοδονοσορ ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἀπήνεγκεν
εἰς Βαβυλῶνα ἀποκατασταθῆναι εἰς τὸν οἶκον τὸν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ οὗ ἦν
κείμενα ὅπως τεθῇ ἐκεῖ

26 προσέταξεν δὲ ἐπιμεληθῆναι Σισίννῃ ἐπάρχῳ Συρίας καὶ Φοινίκης καὶ
Σαθραβουζάνῃ καὶ τοῖς συνεταίροις καὶ τοῖς ἀποτεταγμένοις ἐν Συρίᾳ καὶ
Φοινίκῃ ἡγεμόσιν ἀπέχεσθαι τοῦ τόπου ἐᾶσαι δὲ τὸν παῖδα τοῦ κυρίου
Ζοροβαβελ ἔπαρχον δὲ τῆς Ιουδαίας καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους τῶν Ιουδαίων τὸν
οἶκον τοῦ κυρίου ἐκεῖνον οἰκοδομεῖν ἐπὶ τοῦ τόπου

27 κἀγὼ δὲ ἐπέταξα ὁλοσχερῶς οἰκοδομῆσαι καὶ ἀτενίσαι ἵνα συμποιῶσιν
τοῖς ἐκ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας τῆς Ιουδαίας μέχρι τοῦ ἐπιτελεσθῆναι τὸν οἶκον
τοῦ κυρίου

28 καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς φορολογίας Κοίλης Συρίας καὶ Φοινίκης ἐπιμελῶς σύνταξιν
δίδοσθαι τούτοις τοῖς ἀνθρώποις εἰς θυσίας τῷ κυρίῳ Ζοροβαβελ ἐπάρχῳ εἰς
ταύρους καὶ κριοὺς καὶ ἄρνας

29 ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ πυρὸν καὶ ἅλα καὶ οἶνον καὶ ἔλαιον ἐνδελεχῶς κατ᾽
ἐνιαυτόν καθὼς ἂν οἱ ἱερεῖς οἱ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ ὑπαγορεύσωσιν ἀναλίσκεσθαι
καθ᾽ ἡμέραν ἀναμφισβητήτως

30 ὅπως προσφέρωνται σπονδαὶ τῷ θεῷ τῷ ὑψίστῳ ὑπὲρ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τῶν
παίδων καὶ προσεύχωνται περὶ τῆς αὐτῶν ζωῆς

31 καὶ προσέταξεν ἵνα ὅσοι ἐὰν παραβῶσίν τι τῶν προειρημένων καὶ τῶν
προσγεγραμμένων ἢ καὶ ἀκυρώσωσιν λημφθῆναι ξύλον ἐκ τῶν ἰδίων αὐτοῦ καὶ
ἐπὶ τούτου κρεμασθῆναι καὶ τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτοῦ εἶναι βασιλικά

32 διὰ ταῦτα καὶ ὁ κύριος οὗ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐπικέκληται ἐκεῖ ἀφανίσαι
πάντα βασιλέα καὶ ἔθνος ὃς ἐκτενεῖ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ κωλῦσαι ἢ κακοποιῆσαι
τὸν οἶκον τοῦ κυρίου ἐκεῖνον τὸν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ

33 ἐγὼ βασιλεὺς Δαρεῖος δεδογμάτικα ἐπιμελῶς κατὰ ταῦτα γίγνεσθαι
