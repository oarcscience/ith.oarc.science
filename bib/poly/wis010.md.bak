### Wisdom 10

[Apo](../apo/wis010.md)

1 She preserved the first formed father of the world, that was created
alone, and brought him out of his fall,

2 And gave him power to rule all things.

3 But when the unrighteous went away from her in his anger, he perished
also in the fury wherewith he murdered his brother.

4 For whose cause the earth being drowned with the flood, wisdom again
preserved it, and directed the course of the righteous in a piece of
wood of small value.

5 Moreover, the nations in their wicked conspiracy being confounded, she
found out the righteous, and preserved him blameless unto God, and kept
him strong against his tender compassion toward his son.

6 When the ungodly perished, she delivered the righteous man, who fled
from the fire which fell down upon the five cities.

7 Of whose wickedness even to this day the waste land that smoketh is a
testimony, and plants bearing fruit that never come to ripeness: and a
standing pillar of salt is a monument of an unbelieving soul.

8 For regarding not wisdom, they gat not only this hurt, that they knew
not the things which were good; but also left behind them to the world a
memorial of their foolishness: so that in the things wherein they
offended they could not so much as be hid.

9 Rut wisdom delivered from pain those that attended upon her.

10 When the righteous fled from his brother's wrath she guided him in
right paths, shewed him the kingdom of God, and gave him knowledge of
holy things, made him rich in his travels, and multiplied the fruit of
his labours.

11 In the covetousness of such as oppressed him she stood by him, and
made him rich.

12 She defended him from his enemies, and kept him safe from those that
lay in wait, and in a sore conflict she gave him the victory; that he
might know that goodness is stronger than all.

13 When the righteous was sold, she forsook him not, but delivered him
from sin: she went down with him into the pit,

14 And left him not in bonds, till she brought him the sceptre of the
kingdom, and power against those that oppressed him: as for them that
had accused him, she shewed them to be liars, and gave him perpetual
glory.

15 She delivered the righteous people and blameless seed from the nation
that oppressed them.

16 She entered into the soul of the servant of the Lord, and withstood
dreadful kings in wonders and signs;

17 Rendered to the righteous a reward of their labours, guided them in a
marvellous way, and was unto them for a cover by day, and a light of
stars in the night season;

18 Brought them through the Red sea, and led them through much water:

19 But she drowned their enemies, and cast them up out of the bottom of
the deep.

20 Therefore the righteous spoiled the ungodly, and praised thy holy
name, O Lord, and magnified with one accord thine hand, that fought for
them.

21 For wisdom opened the mouth of the dumb, and made the tongues of them
that cannot speak eloquent.

1 αὕτη πρωτόπλαστον πατέρα κόσμου μόνον κτισθέντα διεφύλαξεν καὶ
ἐξείλατο αὐτὸν ἐκ παραπτώματος ἰδίου

2 ἔδωκέν τε αὐτῷ ἰσχὺν κρατῆσαι ἁπάντων

3 ἀποστὰς δὲ ἀπ᾽ αὐτῆς ἄδικος ἐν ὀργῇ αὐτοῦ ἀδελφοκτόνοις συναπώλετο
θυμοῖς

4 δι᾽ ὃν κατακλυζομένην γῆν πάλιν ἔσωσεν σοφία δι᾽ εὐτελοῦς ξύλου τὸν
δίκαιον κυβερνήσασα

5 αὕτη καὶ ἐν ὁμονοίᾳ πονηρίας ἐθνῶν συγχυθέντων ἔγνω τὸν δίκαιον καὶ
ἐτήρησεν αὐτὸν ἄμεμπτον θεῷ καὶ ἐπὶ τέκνου σπλάγχνοις ἰσχυρὸν ἐφύλαξεν

6 αὕτη δίκαιον ἐξαπολλυμένων ἀσεβῶν ἐρρύσατο φυγόντα καταβάσιον πῦρ
Πενταπόλεως

7 ἧς ἔτι μαρτύριον τῆς πονηρίας καπνιζομένη καθέστηκε χέρσος καὶ
ἀτελέσιν ὥραις καρποφοροῦντα φυτά ἀπιστούσης ψυχῆς μνημεῖον ἑστηκυῖα
στήλη ἁλός

8 σοφίαν γὰρ παροδεύσαντες οὐ μόνον ἐβλάβησαν τοῦ μὴ γνῶναι τὰ καλά ἀλλὰ
καὶ τῆς ἀφροσύνης ἀπέλιπον τῷ βίῳ μνημόσυνον ἵνα ἐν οἷς ἐσφάλησαν μηδὲ
λαθεῖν δυνηθῶσιν

9 σοφία δὲ τοὺς θεραπεύοντας αὐτὴν ἐκ πόνων ἐρρύσατο

10 αὕτη φυγάδα ὀργῆς ἀδελφοῦ δίκαιον ὡδήγησεν ἐν τρίβοις εὐθείαις
ἔδειξεν αὐτῷ βασιλείαν θεοῦ καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ γνῶσιν ἁγίων εὐπόρησεν αὐτὸν
ἐν μόχθοις καὶ ἐπλήθυνεν τοὺς πόνους αὐτοῦ

11 ἐν πλεονεξίᾳ κατισχυόντων αὐτὸν παρέστη καὶ ἐπλούτισεν αὐτόν

12 διεφύλαξεν αὐτὸν ἀπὸ ἐχθρῶν καὶ ἀπὸ ἐνεδρευόντων ἠσφαλίσατο καὶ ἀγῶνα
ἰσχυρὸν ἐβράβευσεν αὐτῷ ἵνα γνῷ ὅτι παντὸς δυνατωτέρα ἐστὶν εὐσέβεια

13 αὕτη πραθέντα δίκαιον οὐκ ἐγκατέλιπεν ἀλλὰ ἐξ ἁμαρτίας ἐρρύσατο αὐτόν

14 συγκατέβη αὐτῷ εἰς λάκκον καὶ ἐν δεσμοῖς οὐκ ἀφῆκεν αὐτόν ἕως ἤνεγκεν
αὐτῷ σκῆπτρα βασιλείας καὶ ἐξουσίαν τυραννούντων αὐτοῦ ψευδεῖς τε
ἔδειξεν τοὺς μωμησαμένους αὐτὸν καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ δόξαν αἰώνιον

15 αὕτη λαὸν ὅσιον καὶ σπέρμα ἄμεμπτον ἐρρύσατο ἐξ ἔθνους θλιβόντων

16 εἰσῆλθεν εἰς ψυχὴν θεράποντος κυρίου καὶ ἀντέστη βασιλεῦσιν φοβεροῖς
ἐν τέρασι καὶ σημείοις

17 ἀπέδωκεν ὁσίοις μισθὸν κόπων αὐτῶν ὡδήγησεν αὐτοὺς ἐν ὁδῷ θαυμαστῇ
καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτοῖς εἰς σκέπην ἡμέρας καὶ εἰς φλόγα ἄστρων τὴν νύκτα

18 διεβίβασεν αὐτοὺς θάλασσαν ἐρυθρὰν καὶ διήγαγεν αὐτοὺς δι᾽ ὕδατος
πολλοῦ

19 τοὺς δὲ ἐχθροὺς αὐτῶν κατέκλυσεν καὶ ἐκ βάθους ἀβύσσου ἀνέβρασεν
αὐτούς

20 διὰ τοῦτο δίκαιοι ἐσκύλευσαν ἀσεβεῖς καὶ ὕμνησαν κύριε τὸ ὄνομα τὸ
ἅγιόν σου τήν τε ὑπέρμαχόν σου χεῖρα ᾔνεσαν ὁμοθυμαδόν

21 ὅτι ἡ σοφία ἤνοιξεν στόμα κωφῶν καὶ γλώσσας νηπίων ἔθηκεν τρανάς

[Vul](../vul/wis010.md)

1 \[Hæc illum qui primus formatus est a Deo patre orbis terrarum,  
cum solus esset creatus, custodivit,  

2 et eduxit illum a delicto suo,  
et dedit illi virtutem continendi omnia.  

3 Ab hac ut recessit injustus in ira sua,  
per iram homicidii fraterni deperiit.  

4 Propter quem cum aqua deleret terram, sanavit iterum sapientia,  
per contemptibile lignum justum gubernans.  

5 Hæc et in consensu nequitiæ, cum se nationes contulissent,  
scivit justum, et conservavit sine querela Deo,  
et in filii misericordia fortem custodivit.  

6 Hæc justum a pereuntibus impiis liberavit fugientem,  
descendente igne in Pentapolim:  

7 quibus in testimonium nequitiæ  
fumigabunda constat deserta terra,  
et incerto tempore fructus habentes arbores:  
et incredibilis animæ memoria stans figmentum salis.  

8 Sapientiam enim prætereuntes,  
non tantum in hoc lapsi sunt ut ignorarent bona,  
sed et insipientiæ suæ reliquerunt hominibus memoriam,  
ut in his quæ peccaverunt nec latere potuissent.  

9 Sapientia autem hos qui se observant  
a doloribus liberavit.  

10 Hæc profugum iræ fratris justum deduxit per vias rectas,  
et ostendit illi regnum Dei,  
et dedit illi scientiam sanctorum;  
honestavit illum in laboribus,  
et complevit labores illius.  

11 In fraude circumvenientium illum affuit illi,  
et honestum fecit illum.  

12 Custodivit illum ab inimicis,  
et a seductoribus tutavit illum:  
et certamen forte dedit illi ut vinceret,  
et sciret quoniam omnium potentior est sapientia.  

13 Hæc venditum justum non dereliquit,  
sed a peccatoribus liberavit eum;  
descenditque cum illo in foveam,  

14 et in vinculis non dereliquit illum,  
donec afferret illi sceptrum regni,  
et potentiam adversus eos qui eum deprimebant:  
et mendaces ostendit qui maculaverunt illum,  
et dedit illi claritatem æternam.\]  

15 \[Hæc populum justum et semen sine querela liberavit  
a nationibus quæ illum deprimebant.  

16 Intravit in animam servi Dei,  
et stetit contra reges horrendos in portentis et signis.  

17 Et reddidit justis mercedem laborum suorum,  
et deduxit illos in via mirabili:  
et fuit illis in velamento diei,  
et in luce stellarum per noctem;  

18 transtulit illos per mare Rubrum,  
et transvexit illos per aquam nimiam.  

19 Inimicos autem illorum demersit in mare,  
et ab altitudine inferorum eduxit illos.  
Ideo justi tulerunt spolia impiorum,  

20 et decantaverunt, Domine, nomen sanctum tuum,  
et victricem manum tuam laudaverunt pariter:  

21 quoniam sapientia aperuit os mutorum,  
et linguas infantium fecit disertas.\]
