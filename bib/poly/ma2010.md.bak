### 2 Macabees 10

[Apo](../apo/ma2010.md)

1 Now Maccabeus and his company, the Lord guiding them, recovered the
temple and the city:

2 But the altars which the heathen had built in the open street, and
also the chapels, they pulled down.

3 And having cleansed the temple they made another altar, and striking
stones they took fire out of them, and offered a sacrifice after two
years, and set forth incense, and lights, and shewbread.

4 When that was done, they fell flat down, and besought the Lord that
they might come no more into such troubles; but if they sinned any more
against him, that he himself would chasten them with mercy, and that
they might not be delivered unto the blasphemous and barbarous nations.

5 Now upon the same day that the strangers profaned the temple, on the
very same day it was cleansed again, even the five and twentieth day of
the same month, which is Casleu.

6 And they kept the eight days with gladness, as in the feast of the
tabernacles, remembering that not long afore they had held the feast of
the tabernacles, when as they wandered in the mountains and dens like
beasts.

7 Therefore they bare branches, and fair boughs, and palms also, and
sang psalms unto him that had given them good success in cleansing his
place.

8 They ordained also by a common statute and decree, That every year
those days should be kept of the whole nation of the Jews.

9 And this was the end of Antiochus, called Epiphanes.

10 Now will we declare the acts of Antiochus Eupator, who was the son of
this wicked man, gathering briefly the calamities of the wars.

11 So when he was come to the crown, he set one Lysias over the affairs
of his realm, and appointed him his chief governor of Celosyria and
Phenice.

12 For Ptolemeus, that was called Macron, choosing rather to do justice
unto the Jews for the wrong that had been done unto them, endeavoured to
continue peace with them.

13 Whereupon being accused of the king's friends before Eupator, and
called traitor at every word because he had left Cyprus, that Philometor
had committed unto him, and departed to Antiochus Epiphanes, and seeing
that he was in no honourable place, he was so discouraged, that he
poisoned himself and died.

14 But when Gorgias was governor of the holds, he hired soldiers, and
nourished war continually with the Jews:

15 And therewithall the Idumeans, having gotten into their hands the
most commodious holds, kept the Jews occupied, and receiving those that
were banished from Jerusalem, they went about to nourish war.

16 Then they that were with Maccabeus made supplication, and besought
God that he would be their helper; and so they ran with violence upon
the strong holds of the Idumeans,

17 And assaulting them strongly, they won the holds, and kept off all
that fought upon the wall, and slew all that fell into their hands, and
killed no fewer than twenty thousand.

18 And because certain, who were no less than nine thousand, were fled
together into two very strong castles, having all manner of things
convenient to sustain the siege,

19 Maccabeus left Simon and Joseph, and Zaccheus also, and them that
were with him, who were enough to besiege them, and departed himself
unto those places which more needed his help.

20 Now they that were with Simon, being led with covetousness, were
persuaded for money through certain of those that were in the castle,
and took seventy thousand drachms, and let some of them escape.

21 But when it was told Maccabeus what was done, he called the governors
of the people together, and accused those men, that they had sold their
brethren for money, and set their enemies free to fight against them.

22 So he slew those that were found traitors, and immediately took the
two castles.

23 And having good success with his weapons in all things he took in
hand, he slew in the two holds more than twenty thousand.

24 Now Timotheus, whom the Jews had overcome before, when he had
gathered a great multitude of foreign forces, and horses out of Asia not
a few, came as though he would take Jewry by force of arms.

25 But when he drew near, they that were with Maccabeus turned
themselves to pray unto God, and sprinkled earth upon their heads, and
girded their loins with sackcloth,

26 And fell down at the foot of the altar, and besought him to be
merciful to them, and to be an enemy to their enemies, and an adversary
to their adversaries, as the law declareth.

27 So after the prayer they took their weapons, and went on further from
the city: and when they drew near to their enemies, they kept by
themselves.

28 Now the sun being newly risen, they joined both together; the one
part having together with their virtue their refuge also unto the Lord
for a pledge of their success and victory: the other side making their
rage leader of their battle

29 But when the battle waxed strong, there appeared unto the enemies
from heaven five comely men upon horses, with bridles of gold, and two
of them led the Jews,

30 And took Maccabeus betwixt them, and covered him on every side
weapons, and kept him safe, but shot arrows and lightnings against the
enemies: so that being confounded with blindness, and full of trouble,
they were killed.

31 And there were slain of footmen twenty thousand and five hundred, and
six hundred horsemen.

32 As for Timotheus himself, he fled into a very strong hold, called
Gawra, where Chereas was governor.

33 But they that were with Maccabeus laid siege against the fortress
courageously four days.

34 And they that were within, trusting to the strength of the place,
blasphemed exceedingly, and uttered wicked words.

35 Nevertheless upon the fifth day early twenty young men of Maccabeus'
company, inflamed with anger because of the blasphemies, assaulted the
wall manly, and with a fierce courage killed all that they met withal.

36 Others likewise ascending after them, whiles they were busied with
them that were within, burnt the towers, and kindling fires burnt the
blasphemers alive; and others broke open the gates, and, having received
in the rest of the army, took the city,

37 And killed Timotheus, that was hid in a certain pit, and Chereas his
brother, with Apollophanes.

38 When this was done, they praised the Lord with psalms and
thanksgiving, who had done so great things for Israel, and given them
the victory.

1 Μακκαβαῖος δὲ καὶ οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ τοῦ κυρίου προάγοντος αὐτοὺς τὸ μὲν
ἱερὸν ἐκομίσαντο καὶ τὴν πόλιν

2 τοὺς δὲ κατὰ τὴν ἀγορὰν βωμοὺς ὑπὸ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων δεδημιουργημένους ἔτι

5 ἐν ᾗ δὲ ἡμέρᾳ ὁ νεὼς ὑπὸ ἀλλοφύλων ἐβεβηλώθη συνέβη κατὰ τὴν αὐτὴν
ἡμέραν τὸν καθαρισμὸν γενέσθαι τοῦ ναοῦ τῇ πέμπτῃ καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ αὐτοῦ
μηνός ὅς ἐστιν Χασελευ

6 καὶ μετ᾽ εὐφροσύνης ἦγον ἡμέρας ὀκτὼ σκηνωμάτων τρόπον μνημονεύοντες
ὡς πρὸ μικροῦ χρόνου τὴν τῶν σκηνῶν ἑορτὴν ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσιν καὶ ἐν τοῖς
σπηλαίοις θηρίων τρόπον ἦσαν νεμόμενοι

7 διὸ θύρσους καὶ κλάδους ὡραίους ἔτι δὲ καὶ φοίνικας ἔχοντες ὕμνους
ἀνέφερον τῷ εὐοδώσαντι καθαρισθῆναι τὸν ἑαυτοῦ τόπον

8 ἐδογμάτισαν δὲ μετὰ κοινοῦ προστάγματος καὶ ψηφίσματος παντὶ τῷ τῶν
Ιουδαίων ἔθνει κατ᾽ ἐνιαυτὸν ἄγειν τάσδε τὰς ἡμέρας

9 καὶ τὰ μὲν τῆς Ἀντιόχου τοῦ προσαγορευθέντος Ἐπιφανοῦς τελευτῆς οὕτως
εἶχεν

10 νυνὶ δὲ τὰ κατὰ τὸν Εὐπάτορα Ἀντίοχον υἱὸν δὲ τοῦ ἀσεβοῦς γενόμενον
δηλώσομεν αὐτὰ συντέμνοντες τὰ συνέχοντα τῶν πολέμων κακά

11 οὗτος γὰρ παραλαβὼν τὴν βασιλείαν ἀνέδειξεν ἐπὶ τῶν πραγμάτων Λυσίαν
τινά Κοίλης δὲ Συρίας καὶ Φοινίκης στρατηγὸν πρώταρχον

12 Πτολεμαῖος γὰρ ὁ καλούμενος Μάκρων τὸ δίκαιον συντηρεῖν προηγούμενος
πρὸς τοὺς Ιουδαίους διὰ τὴν γεγονυῖαν εἰς αὐτοὺς ἀδικίαν ἐπειρᾶτο τὰ
πρὸς αὐτοὺς εἰρηνικῶς διεξάγειν

13 ὅθεν κατηγορούμενος ὑπὸ τῶν φίλων πρὸς τὸν Εὐπάτορα καὶ προδότης παρ᾽
ἕκαστα ἀκούων διὰ τὸ τὴν Κύπρον ἐμπιστευθέντα ὑπὸ τοῦ Φιλομήτορος
ἐκλιπεῖν καὶ πρὸς Ἀντίοχον τὸν Ἐπιφανῆ ἀναχωρῆσαι μήτε εὐγενῆ τὴν
ἐξουσίαν εὐγενίσας φαρμακεύσας ἑαυτὸν ἐξέλιπεν τὸν βίον

14 Γοργίας δὲ γενόμενος στρατηγὸς τῶν τόπων ἐξενοτρόφει καὶ παρ᾽ ἕκαστα
πρὸς τοὺς Ιουδαίους ἐπολεμοτρόφει

15 ὁμοῦ δὲ τούτῳ καὶ οἱ Ιδουμαῖοι ἐγκρατεῖς ἐπικαίρων ὀχυρωμάτων ὄντες
ἐγύμναζον τοὺς Ιουδαίους καὶ τοὺς φυγαδεύσαντας ἀπὸ Ιεροσολύμων
προσλαβόμενοι πολεμοτροφεῖν ἐπεχείρουν

16 οἱ δὲ περὶ τὸν Μακκαβαῖον ποιησάμενοι λιτανείαν καὶ ἀξιώσαντες τὸν
θεὸν σύμμαχον αὐτοῖς γενέσθαι ἐπὶ τὰ τῶν Ιδουμαίων ὀχυρώματα ὥρμησαν

17 οἷς καὶ προσβαλόντες εὐρώστως ἐγκρατεῖς ἐγένοντο τῶν τόπων πάντας τε
τοὺς ἐπὶ τῷ τείχει μαχομένους ἠμύναντο κατέσφαζόν τε τοὺς ἐμπίπτοντας
ἀνεῖλον δὲ οὐχ ἧττον τῶν δισμυρίων

18 συμφυγόντων δὲ οὐκ ἔλαττον τῶν ἐνακισχιλίων εἰς δύο πύργους ὀχυροὺς
εὖ μάλα καὶ πάντα τὰ πρὸς πολιορκίαν ἔχοντας

19 ὁ Μακκαβαῖος εἰς ἐπείγοντας τόπους ἀπολιπὼν Σιμωνα καὶ Ιωσηπον ἔτι δὲ
καὶ Ζακχαῖον καὶ τοὺς σὺν αὐτῷ ἱκανοὺς πρὸς τὴν τούτων πολιορκίαν αὐτὸς
ἐχωρίσθη

20 οἱ δὲ περὶ τὸν Σιμωνα φιλαργυρήσαντες ὑπό τινων τῶν ἐν τοῖς πύργοις
ἐπείσθησαν ἀργυρίῳ ἑπτάκις δὲ μυρίας δραχμὰς λαβόντες εἴασάν τινας
διαρρυῆναι

21 προσαγγελέντος δὲ τῷ Μακκαβαίῳ περὶ τοῦ γεγονότος συναγαγὼν τοὺς
ἡγουμένους τοῦ λαοῦ κατηγόρησεν ὡς ἀργυρίου πέπρακαν τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς τοὺς
πολεμίους κατ᾽ αὐτῶν ἀπολύσαντες

22 τούτους μὲν οὖν προδότας γενομένους ἀπέκτεινεν καὶ παραχρῆμα τοὺς δύο
πύργους κατελάβετο

23 τοῖς δὲ ὅπλοις τὰ πάντα ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν εὐοδούμενος ἀπώλεσεν ἐν τοῖς
δυσὶν ὀχυρώμασιν πλείους τῶν δισμυρίων

24 Τιμόθεος δὲ ὁ πρότερον ἡττηθεὶς ὑπὸ τῶν Ιουδαίων συναγαγὼν ξένας
δυνάμεις παμπληθεῖς καὶ τοὺς τῆς Ἀσίας γενομένους ἵππους συναθροίσας οὐκ
ὀλίγους παρῆν ὡς δοριάλωτον λημψόμενος τὴν Ιουδαίαν

25 οἱ δὲ περὶ τὸν Μακκαβαῖον συνεγγίζοντος αὐτοῦ πρὸς ἱκετείαν τοῦ θεοῦ
γῇ τὰς κεφαλὰς καταπάσαντες καὶ τὰς ὀσφύας σάκκοις ζώσαντες

αὐτοῖς γενόμενον ἐχθρεῦσαι τοῖς ἐχθροῖς αὐτῶν καὶ ἀντικεῖσθαι τοῖς
ἀντικειμένοις καθὼς ὁ νόμος διασαφεῖ

27 γενόμενοι δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς δεήσεως ἀναλαβόντες τὰ ὅπλα προῆγον ἀπὸ τῆς
πόλεως ἐπὶ πλεῖον συνεγγίσαντες δὲ τοῖς πολεμίοις ἐφ᾽ ἑαυτῶν ἦσαν

28 ἄρτι δὲ τῆς ἀνατολῆς διαχεομένης προσέβαλον ἑκάτεροι οἱ μὲν ἔγγυον

29 γενομένης δὲ καρτερᾶς μάχης ἐφάνησαν τοῖς ὑπεναντίοις ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ἐφ᾽
ἵππων χρυσοχαλίνων ἄνδρες πέντε διαπρεπεῖς καὶ ἀφηγούμενοι τῶν Ιουδαίων

30 οἳ καὶ τὸν Μακκαβαῖον μέσον λαβόντες καὶ σκεπάζοντες ταῖς ἑαυτῶν

[Vul](../vul/ma2010.md)

1 Machabæus autem, et qui cum eo erant, Domino se protegente, templum
quidem et civitatem recepit:

2 aras autem quas alienigenæ per plateas exstruxerant, itemque delubra
demolitus est:

3 et purgato templo, aliud altare fecerunt, et de ignitis lapidibus igne
concepto sacrificia obtulerunt post biennium, et incensum, et lucernas,
et panes propositionis posuerunt.

4 Quibus gestis, rogabant Dominum prostrati in terram, ne amplius
talibus malis inciderent: sed et, siquando peccassent, ut ab ipso mitius
corriperentur, et non barbaris ac blasphemis hominibus traderentur.

5 Qua die autem templum ab alienigenis pollutum fuerat, contigit eadem
die purificationem fieri, vigesima quinta mensis qui fuit Casleu.

6 Et cum lætitia diebus octo egerunt in modum tabernaculorum,
recordantes quod ante modicum temporis diem solemnem tabernaculorum in
montibus et in speluncis more bestiarum egerant.

7 Propter quod thyrsos, et ramos virides, et palmas præferebant ei qui
prosperavit mundari locum suum.

8 Et decreverunt communi præcepto et decreto universæ genti Judæorum
omnibus annis agere dies istos.

9 Et Antiochi quidem, qui appellatus est Nobilis, vitæ excessus ita se
habuit.  

10 Nunc autem de Eupatore Antiochi impii filio quæ gesta sunt
narrabimus, breviantes mala quæ in bellis gesta sunt.

11 Hic enim suscepto regno, constituit super negotia regni Lysiam
quemdam, Phœnicis et Syriæ militiæ principem.

12 Nam Ptolemæus, qui dicebatur Macer, justi tenax erga Judæos esse
constituit, et præcipue propter iniquitatem quæ facta erat in eos, et
pacifice agere cum eis.

13 Sed ob hoc accusatus ab amicis apud Eupatorem, cum frequenter
proditor audiret, eo quod Cyprum creditam sibi a Philometore
deseruisset, et ad Antiochum Nobilem translatus etiam ab eo recessisset,
veneno vitam finivit.

14 Gorgias autem cum esset dux locorum, assumptis advenis, frequenter
Judæos debellabat.

15 Judæi vero qui tenebant opportunas munitiones, fugatos ab Jerosolymis
suscipiebant, et bellare tentabant.

16 Hi vero qui erant cum Machabæo, per orationes Dominum rogantes ut
esset sibi adjutor, impetum fecerunt in munitiones Idumæorum:

17 multaque vi insistentes, loca obtinuerunt, occurrentes interemerunt,
et omnes simul non minus viginti millibus trucidaverunt.

18 Quidam autem cum confugissent in duas turres valde munitas, omnem
apparatum ad repugnandum habentes,

19 Machabæus ad eorum expugnationem relicto Simone, et Josepho, itemque
Zachæo, eisque qui cum ipsis erant satis multis, ipse ad eas quæ amplius
perurgebant pugnas conversus est.

20 Hi vero qui cum Simone erant, cupiditate ducti, a quibusdam qui in
turribus erant, suasi sunt pecunia: et septuaginta millibus didrachmis
acceptis, dimiserunt quosdam effugere.

21 Cum autem Machabæo nuntiatum esset quod factum est, principibus
populi congregatis accusavit quod pecunia fratres vendidissent,
adversariis eorum dimissis.

22 Hos igitur proditores factos interfecit, et confestim duas turres
occupavit.

23 Armis autem ac manibus omnia prospere agendo in duabus munitionibus
plus quam viginti millia peremit.  

24 At Timotheus, qui prius a Judæis fuerat superatus, convocato exercitu
peregrinæ multitudinis, et congregato equitatu Asiano, advenit quasi
armis Judæam capturus.

25 Machabæus autem et qui cum ipso erant, appropinquante illo,
deprecabantur Dominum, caput terra aspergentes, lumbosque ciliciis
præcincti,

26 ad altaris crepidinem provoluti, ut sibi propitius, inimicis autem
eorum esset inimicus, et adversariis adversaretur, sicut lex dicit.

27 Et ita post orationem, sumptis armis, longius de civitate
procedentes, et proximi hostibus effecti, resederunt.

28 Primo autem solis ortu utrique commiserunt: isti quidem victoriæ et
prosperitatis sponsorem cum virtute Dominum habentes: illi autem ducem
belli animum habebant.

29 Sed cum vehemens pugna esset, apparuerunt adversariis de cælo viri
quinque in equis, frenis aureis decori, ducatum Judæis præstantes:

30 ex quibus duo Machabæum medium habentes, armis suis circumseptum
incolumem conservabant: in adversarios autem tela et fulmina jaciebant,
ex quo et cæcitate confusi et repleti perturbatione, cadebant.

31 Interfecti sunt autem viginti millia quingenti, et equites sexcenti.

32 Timotheus vero confugit in Gazaram præsidium munitum, cui præerat
Chæreas.

33 Machabæus autem et qui cum eo erant, lætantes obsederunt præsidium
diebus quatuor.

34 At hi qui intus erant, loci firmitate confisi, supra modum
maledicebant, et sermones nefandos jactabant.

35 Sed cum dies quinta illucesceret, viginti juvenes ex his qui cum
Machabæo erant, accensi animis propter blasphemiam, viriliter
accesserunt ad murum, et feroci animo incedentes ascendebant:

36 sed et alii similiter ascendentes, turres portasque succendere
aggressi sunt, atque ipsos maledicos vivos concremare.

37 Per continuum autem biduum præsidio vastato, Timotheum occultantem se
in quodam repertum loco peremerunt: et fratrem illius Chæream et
Apollophanem occiderunt.

38 Quibus gestis, in hymnis et confessionibus benedicebant Dominum, qui
magna fecit in Israël, et victoriam dedit illis.
