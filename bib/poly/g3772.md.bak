G3772  
οὐρανός  
ouranos  
*oo-ran-os‘*  
Perhaps from the same as [3735](g3735.md) (through the idea of
*elevation*); the *sky*; by extension *heaven* (as the abode of God); by
implication *happiness*, *power*, *eternity*; specifically the *Gospel*
(*Christianity*): - air, heaven (\[-ly\]), sky.
