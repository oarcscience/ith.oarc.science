### 1 Esdras 1

[Apo](../apo/es1001.md)

1 And Josias held the feast of the passover in Jerusalem unto his Lord,
and offered the passover the fourteenth day of the first month;

2 Having set the priests according to their daily courses, being arrayed
in long garments, in the temple of the Lord.

3 And he spake unto the Levites, the holy ministers of Israel, that they
should hallow themselves unto the Lord, to set the holy ark of the Lord
in the house that king Solomon the son of David had built:

4 And said, Ye shall no more bear the ark upon your shoulders: now
therefore serve the Lord your God, and minister unto his people Israel,
and prepare you after your families and kindreds,

5 According as David the king of Israel prescribed, and according to the
magnificence of Solomon his son: and standing in the temple according to
the several dignity of the families of you the Levites, who minister in
the presence of your brethren the children of Israel,

6 Offer the passover in order, and make ready the sacrifices for your
brethren, and keep the passover according to the commandment of the
Lord, which was given unto Moses.

7 And unto the people that was found there Josias gave thirty thousand
lambs and kids, and three thousand calves: these things were given of
the king's allowance, according as he promised, to the people, to the
priests, and to the Levites.

8 And Helkias, Zacharias, and Syelus, the governors of the temple, gave
to the priests for the passover two thousand and six hundred sheep, and
three hundred calves.

9 And Jeconias, and Samaias, and Nathanael his brother, and Assabias,
and Ochiel, and Joram, captains over thousands, gave to the Levites for
the passover five thousand sheep, and seven hundred calves.

10 And when these things were done, the priests and Levites, having the
unleavened bread, stood in very comely order according to the kindreds,

11 And according to the several dignities of the fathers, before the
people, to offer to the Lord, as it is written in the book of Moses: and
thus did they in the morning.

12 And they roasted the passover with fire, as appertaineth: as for the
sacrifices, they sod them in brass pots and pans with a good savour,

13 And set them before all the people: and afterward they prepared for
themselves, and for the priests their brethren, the sons of Aaron.

14 For the priests offered the fat until night: and the Levites prepared
for themselves, and the priests their brethren, the sons of Aaron.

15 The holy singers also, the sons of Asaph, were in their order,
according to the appointment of David, to wit, Asaph, Zacharias, and
Jeduthun, who was of the king's retinue.

16 Moreover the porters were at every gate; it was not lawful for any to
go from his ordinary service: for their brethren the Levites prepared
for them.

17 Thus were the things that belonged to the sacrifices of the Lord
accomplished in that day, that they might hold the passover,

18 And offer sacrifices upon the altar of the Lord, according to the
commandment of king Josias.

19 So the children of Israel which were present held the passover at
that time, and the feast of sweet bread seven days.

20 And such a passover was not kept in Israel since the time of the
prophet Samuel.

21 Yea, all the kings of Israel held not such a passover as Josias, and
the priests, and the Levites, and the Jews, held with all Israel that
were found dwelling at Jerusalem.

22 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias was this passover kept.

23 And the works or Josias were upright before his Lord with an heart
full of godliness.

24 As for the things that came to pass in his time, they were written in
former times, concerning those that sinned, and did wickedly against the
Lord above all people and kingdoms, and how they grieved him
exceedingly, so that the words of the Lord rose up against Israel.

25 Now after all these acts of Josias it came to pass, that Pharaoh the
king of Egypt came to raise war at Carchamis upon Euphrates: and Josias
went out against him.

26 But the king of Egypt sent to him, saying, What have I to do with
thee, O king of Judea?

27 I am not sent out from the Lord God against thee; for my war is upon
Euphrates: and now the Lord is with me, yea, the Lord is with me hasting
me forward: depart from me, and be not against the Lord.

28 Howbeit Josias did not turn back his chariot from him, but undertook
to fight with him, not regarding the words of the prophet Jeremy spoken
by the mouth of the Lord:

29 But joined battle with him in the plain of Magiddo, and the princes
came against king Josias.

30 Then said the king unto his servants, Carry me away out of the
battle; for I am very weak. And immediately his servants took him away
out of the battle.

31 Then gat he up upon his second chariot; and being brought back to
Jerusalem died, and was buried in his father's sepulchre.

32 And in all Jewry they mourned for Josias, yea, Jeremy the prophet
lamented for Josias, and the chief men with the women made lamentation
for him unto this day: and this was given out for an ordinance to be
done continually in all the nation of Israel.

33 These things are written in the book of the stories of the kings of
Judah, and every one of the acts that Josias did, and his glory, and his
understanding in the law of the Lord, and the things that he had done
before, and the things now recited, are reported in the book of the
kings of Israel and Judea.

34 And the people took Joachaz the son of Josias, and made him king
instead of Josias his father, when he was twenty and three years old.

35 And he reigned in Judea and in Jerusalem three months: and then the
king of Egypt deposed him from reigning in Jerusalem.

36 And he set a tax upon the land of an hundred talents of silver and
one talent of gold.

37 The king of Egypt also made king Joacim his brother king of Judea and
Jerusalem.

38 And he bound Joacim and the nobles: but Zaraces his brother he
apprehended, and brought him out of Egypt.

39 Five and twenty years old was Joacim when he was made king in the
land of Judea and Jerusalem; and he did evil before the Lord.

40 Wherefore against him Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon came up, and
bound him with a chain of brass, and carried him into Babylon.

41 Nabuchodonosor also took of the holy vessels of the Lord, and carried
them away, and set them in his own temple at Babylon.

42 But those things that are recorded of him, and of his uncleaness and
impiety, are written in the chronicles of the kings.

43 And Joacim his son reigned in his stead: he was made king being
eighteen years old;

44 And reigned but three months and ten days in Jerusalem; and did evil
before the Lord.

45 So after a year Nabuchodonosor sent and caused him to be brought into
Babylon with the holy vessels of the Lord;

46 And made Zedechias king of Judea and Jerusalem, when he was one and
twenty years old; and he reigned eleven years:

47 And he did evil also in the sight of the Lord, and cared not for the
words that were spoken unto him by the prophet Jeremy from the mouth of
the Lord.

48 And after that king Nabuchodonosor had made him to swear by the name
of the Lord, he forswore himself, and rebelled; and hardening his neck,
his heart, he transgressed the laws of the Lord God of Israel.

49 The governors also of the people and of the priests did many things
against the laws, and passed all the pollutions of all nations, and
defiled the temple of the Lord, which was sanctified in Jerusalem.

50 Nevertheless the God of their fathers sent by his messenger to call
them back, because he spared them and his tabernacle also.

51 But they had his messengers in derision; and, look, when the Lord
spake unto them, they made a sport of his prophets:

52 So far forth, that he, being wroth with his people for their great
ungodliness, commanded the kings of the Chaldees to come up against
them;

53 Who slew their young men with the sword, yea, even within the compass
of their holy temple, and spared neither young man nor maid, old man nor
child, among them; for he delivered all into their hands.

54 And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small,
with the vessels of the ark of God, and the king's treasures, and
carried them away into Babylon.

55 As for the house of the Lord, they burnt it, and brake down the walls
of Jerusalem, and set fire upon her towers:

56 And as for her glorious things, they never ceased till they had
consumed and brought them all to nought: and the people that were not
slain with the sword he carried unto Babylon:

57 Who became servants to him and his children, till the Persians
reigned, to fulfil the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremy:

58 Until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths, the whole time of her
desolation shall she rest, until the full term of seventy years.

1 καὶ ἤγαγεν Ιωσιας τὸ πασχα ἐν Ιερουσαλημ τῷ κυρίῳ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔθυσεν τὸ
πασχα τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ πρώτου

2 στήσας τοὺς ἱερεῖς κατ᾽ ἐφημερίας ἐστολισμένους ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ τοῦ κυρίου

3 καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς Λευίταις ἱεροδούλοις τοῦ Ισραηλ ἁγιάσαι ἑαυτοὺς τῷ
κυρίῳ ἐν τῇ θέσει τῆς ἁγίας κιβωτοῦ τοῦ κυρίου ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ ᾧ ᾠκοδόμησεν
Σαλωμων ὁ τοῦ Δαυιδ ὁ βασιλεύς οὐκ ἔσται ὑμῖν ἆραι ἐπ᾽ ὤμων αὐτήν

4 καὶ νῦν λατρεύετε τῷ κυρίῳ θεῷ ὑμῶν καὶ θεραπεύετε τὸ ἔθνος αὐτοῦ
Ισραηλ καὶ ἑτοιμάσατε κατὰ τὰς πατριὰς καὶ τὰς φυλὰς ὑμῶν κατὰ τὴν
γραφὴν Δαυιδ βασιλέως Ισραηλ καὶ κατὰ τὴν μεγαλειότητα Σαλωμων τοῦ υἱοῦ
αὐτοῦ

5 καὶ στάντες ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ κατὰ τὴν μεριδαρχίαν τὴν πατρικὴν ὑμῶν τῶν
Λευιτῶν τῶν ἔμπροσθεν τῶν ἀδελφῶν ὑμῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ ἐν τάξει

6 θύσατε τὸ πασχα καὶ τὰς θυσίας ἑτοιμάσατε τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς ὑμῶν καὶ
ποιήσατε τὸ πασχα κατὰ τὸ πρόσταγμα τοῦ κυρίου τὸ δοθὲν τῷ Μωυσῇ

7 καὶ ἐδωρήσατο Ιωσιας τῷ λαῷ τῷ εὑρεθέντι ἀρνῶν καὶ ἐρίφων τριάκοντα
χιλιάδας μόσχους τρισχιλίους ταῦτα ἐκ τῶν βασιλικῶν ἐδόθη κατ᾽
ἐπαγγελίαν τῷ λαῷ καὶ τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν καὶ Λευίταις

8 καὶ ἔδωκεν Χελκιας καὶ Ζαχαριας καὶ Ησυηλος οἱ ἐπιστάται τοῦ ἱεροῦ
τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν εἰς πασχα πρόβατα δισχίλια ἑξακόσια μόσχους τριακοσίους

9 καὶ Ιεχονιας καὶ Σαμαιας καὶ Ναθαναηλ ὁ ἀδελφὸς καὶ Ασαβιας καὶ
Οχιηλος καὶ Ιωραμ χιλίαρχοι ἔδωκαν τοῖς Λευίταις εἰς πασχα πρόβατα
πεντακισχίλια μόσχους ἑπτακοσίους

10 καὶ ταῦτα τὰ γενόμενα εὐπρεπῶς ἔστησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται

11 ἔχοντες τὰ ἄζυμα κατὰ τὰς φυλὰς

12 καὶ κατὰ τὰς μεριδαρχίας τῶν πατέρων ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ λαοῦ προσενεγκεῖν
τῷ κυρίῳ κατὰ τὰ γεγραμμένα ἐν βιβλίῳ Μωυσῆ καὶ οὕτω τὸ πρωινόν

13 καὶ ὤπτησαν τὸ πασχα πυρὶ ὡς καθήκει καὶ τὰς θυσίας ἥψησαν ἐν τοῖς
χαλκείοις καὶ λέβησιν μετ᾽ εὐωδίας καὶ ἀπήνεγκαν πᾶσι τοῖς ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ

14 μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα ἡτοίμασαν ἑαυτοῖς τε καὶ τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν ἀδελφοῖς αὐτῶν
υἱοῖς Ααρων οἱ γὰρ ἱερεῖς ἀνέφερον τὰ στέατα ἕως ἀωρίας καὶ οἱ Λευῖται
ἡτοίμασαν ἑαυτοῖς καὶ τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν ἀδελφοῖς αὐτῶν υἱοῖς Ααρων

15 καὶ οἱ ἱεροψάλται υἱοὶ Ασαφ ἦσαν ἐπὶ τῆς τάξεως αὐτῶν κατὰ τὰ ὑπὸ
Δαυιδ τεταγμένα καὶ Ασαφ καὶ Ζαχαριας καὶ Εδδινους οἱ παρὰ τοῦ βασιλέως
καὶ οἱ θυρωροὶ ἐφ᾽ ἑκάστου πυλῶνος οὐκ ἔστιν παραβῆναι ἕκαστον τὴν
ἑαυτοῦ ἐφημερίαν οἱ γὰρ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτῶν οἱ Λευῖται ἡτοίμασαν αὐτοῖς

16 καὶ συνετελέσθη τὰ τῆς θυσίας τοῦ κυρίου ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἀχθῆναι
τὸ πασχα καὶ προσενεχθῆναι τὰς θυσίας ἐπὶ τὸ τοῦ κυρίου θυσιαστήριον
κατὰ τὴν ἐπιταγὴν τοῦ βασιλέως Ιωσιου

17 καὶ ἠγάγοσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ οἱ εὑρεθέντες ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τούτῳ τὸ πασχα
καὶ τὴν ἑορτὴν τῶν ἀζύμων ἡμέρας ἑπτά

18 καὶ οὐκ ἤχθη τὸ πασχα τοιοῦτο ἐν τῷ Ισραηλ ἀπὸ τῶν χρόνων Σαμουηλ τοῦ
προφήτου

19 καὶ πάντες οἱ βασιλεῖς τοῦ Ισραηλ οὐκ ἠγάγοσαν πασχα τοιοῦτον οἷον
ἤγαγεν Ιωσιας καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται καὶ οἱ Ιουδαῖοι καὶ πᾶς
Ισραηλ οἱ εὑρεθέντες ἐν τῇ κατοικήσει αὐτῶν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ

20 ὀκτωκαιδεκάτῳ ἔτει βασιλεύοντος Ιωσιου ἤχθη τὸ πασχα τοῦτο

21 καὶ ὠρθώθη τὰ ἔργα Ιωσιου ἐνώπιον τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ ἐν καρδίᾳ πλήρει
εὐσεβείας

22 καὶ τὰ κατ᾽ αὐτὸν δὲ ἀναγέγραπται ἐν τοῖς ἔμπροσθεν χρόνοις περὶ τῶν
ἡμαρτηκότων καὶ ἠσεβηκότων εἰς τὸν κύριον παρὰ πᾶν ἔθνος καὶ βασιλείαν
καὶ ἃ ἐλύπησαν αὐτὸν ἐν αἰσθήσει καὶ οἱ λόγοι τοῦ κυρίου ἀνέστησαν ἐπὶ
Ισραηλ

23 καὶ μετὰ πᾶσαν τὴν πρᾶξιν ταύτην Ιωσιου συνέβη Φαραω βασιλέα Αἰγύπτου
ἐλθόντα πόλεμον ἐγεῖραι ἐν Χαρκαμυς ἐπὶ τοῦ Εὐφράτου καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς
ἀπάντησιν αὐτῷ Ιωσιας

24 καὶ διεπέμψατο βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου πρὸς αὐτὸν λέγων τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί
ἐστιν βασιλεῦ τῆς Ιουδαίας

25 οὐχὶ πρὸς σὲ ἐξαπέσταλμαι ὑπὸ κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ ἐπὶ γὰρ τοῦ Εὐφράτου ὁ
πόλεμός μού ἐστιν καὶ νῦν κύριος μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ ἐστιν καὶ κύριος μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ
ἐπισπεύδων ἐστίν ἀπόστηθι καὶ μὴ ἐναντιοῦ τῷ κυρίῳ

26 καὶ οὐκ ἀπέστρεψεν ἑαυτὸν Ιωσιας ἐπὶ τὸ ἅρμα αὐτοῦ ἀλλὰ πολεμεῖν
αὐτὸν ἐπιχειρεῖ οὐ προσέχων ῥήμασιν Ιερεμιου προφήτου ἐκ στόματος κυρίου

27 ἀλλὰ συνεστήσατο πρὸς αὐτὸν πόλεμον ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ Μαγεδδαους καὶ
κατέβησαν οἱ ἄρχοντες πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Ιωσιαν

28 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοῖς παισὶν αὐτοῦ ἀποστήσατέ με ἀπὸ τῆς μάχης
ἠσθένησα γὰρ λίαν καὶ εὐθέως ἀπέστησαν αὐτὸν οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῆς
παρατάξεως

29 καὶ ἀνέβη ἐπὶ τὸ ἅρμα τὸ δευτέριον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀποκατασταθεὶς εἰς
Ιερουσαλημ μετήλλαξεν τὸν βίον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐτάφη ἐν τῷ πατρικῷ τάφῳ

30 καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ Ιουδαίᾳ ἐπένθησαν τὸν Ιωσιαν καὶ ἐθρήνησεν Ιερεμιας ὁ
προφήτης ὑπὲρ Ιωσιου καὶ οἱ προκαθήμενοι σὺν γυναιξὶν ἐθρηνοῦσαν αὐτὸν
ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης καὶ ἐξεδόθη τοῦτο γίνεσθαι αἰεὶ εἰς ἅπαν τὸ γένος
Ισραηλ

31 ταῦτα δὲ ἀναγέγραπται ἐν τῇ βύβλῳ τῶν ἱστορουμένων περὶ τῶν βασιλέων
τῆς Ιουδαίας καὶ τὸ καθ᾽ ἓν πραχθὲν τῆς πράξεως Ιωσιου καὶ τῆς δόξης
αὐτοῦ καὶ τῆς συνέσεως αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ νόμῳ κυρίου τά τε προπραχθέντα ὑπ᾽
αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ νῦν ἱστόρηται ἐν τῷ βυβλίῳ τῶν βασιλέων Ισραηλ καὶ Ιουδα

32 καὶ ἀναλαβόντες οἱ ἐκ τοῦ ἔθνους τὸν Ιεχονιαν υἱὸν Ιωσιου ἀνέδειξαν
βασιλέα ἀντὶ Ιωσιου τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ὄντα ἐτῶν εἴκοσι τριῶν

33 καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιουδα καὶ Ιερουσαλημ μῆνας τρεῖς καὶ ἀπεκατέστησεν
αὐτὸν βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου βασιλεύειν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ

34 καὶ ἐζημίωσεν τὸ ἔθνος ἀργυρίου ταλάντοις ἑκατὸν καὶ χρυσίου ταλάντῳ
ἑνί

35 καὶ ἀνέδειξεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου βασιλέα Ιωακιμ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ
βασιλέα τῆς Ιουδαίας καὶ Ιερουσαλημ

36 καὶ ἔδησεν Ιωακιμ τοὺς μεγιστᾶνας Ζαριον δὲ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ
συλλαβὼν ἀνήγαγεν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου

37 ἐτῶν δὲ ἦν εἴκοσι πέντε Ιωακιμ ὅτε ἐβασίλευσεν τῆς Ιουδαίας καὶ
Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον κυρίου

38 ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν δὲ ἀνέβη Ναβουχοδονοσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος καὶ δήσας αὐτὸν
ἐν χαλκείῳ δεσμῷ ἀπήγαγεν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα

39 καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἱερῶν σκευῶν τοῦ κυρίου λαβὼν Ναβουχοδονοσορ καὶ
ἀπενέγκας ἀπηρείσατο ἐν τῷ ναῷ αὐτοῦ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι

40 τὰ δὲ ἱστορηθέντα περὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ τῆς αὐτοῦ ἀκαθαρσίας καὶ δυσσεβείας
ἀναγέγραπται ἐν τῇ βίβλῳ τῶν χρόνων τῶν βασιλέων

41 καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἀντ᾽ αὐτοῦ Ιωακιμ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ὅτε γὰρ ἀνεδείχθη ἦν
ἐτῶν δέκα ὀκτώ

42 βασιλεύει δὲ μῆνας τρεῖς καὶ ἡμέρας δέκα ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἐποίησεν
τὸ πονηρὸν ἔναντι κυρίου

43 καὶ μετ᾽ ἐνιαυτὸν ἀποστείλας Ναβουχοδονοσορ μετήγαγεν αὐτὸν εἰς
Βαβυλῶνα ἅμα τοῖς ἱεροῖς σκεύεσιν τοῦ κυρίου

44 καὶ ἀνέδειξε Σεδεκιαν βασιλέα τῆς Ιουδαίας καὶ Ιερουσαλημ Σεδεκιαν
ὄντα ἐτῶν εἴκοσι ἑνός βασιλεύει δὲ ἔτη ἕνδεκα

45 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον κυρίου καὶ οὐκ ἐνετράπη ἀπὸ τῶν
ῥηθέντων λόγων ὑπὸ Ιερεμιου τοῦ προφήτου ἐκ στόματος τοῦ κυρίου

46 καὶ ὁρκισθεὶς ἀπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως Ναβουχοδονοσορ τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ κυρίου
ἐπιορκήσας ἀπέστη καὶ σκληρύνας αὐτοῦ τὸν τράχηλον καὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ
παρέβη τὰ νόμιμα κυρίου θεοῦ Ισραηλ

47 καὶ οἱ ἡγούμενοι δὲ τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ τῶν ἱερέων πολλὰ ἠσέβησαν καὶ
ἠνόμησαν ὑπὲρ πάσας τὰς ἀκαθαρσίας πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν καὶ ἐμίαναν τὸ ἱερὸν
τοῦ κυρίου τὸ ἁγιαζόμενον ἐν Ιεροσολύμοις

48 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ θεὸς τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν διὰ τοῦ ἀγγέλου αὐτοῦ
μετακαλέσαι αὐτούς καθὸ ἐφείδετο αὐτῶν καὶ τοῦ σκηνώματος αὐτοῦ

49 αὐτοὶ δὲ ἐξεμυκτήρισαν ἐν τοῖς ἀγγέλοις αὐτοῦ καὶ ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ ἐλάλησεν
κύριος ἦσαν ἐκπαίζοντες τοὺς προφήτας αὐτοῦ ἕως τοῦ θυμωθέντα αὐτὸν ἐπὶ
τῷ ἔθνει αὐτοῦ διὰ τὰ δυσσεβήματα προστάξαι ἀναβιβάσαι ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς τοὺς
βασιλεῖς τῶν Χαλδαίων

50 οὗτοι ἀπέκτειναν τοὺς νεανίσκους αὐτῶν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ περικύκλῳ τοῦ ἁγίου
αὐτῶν ἱεροῦ καὶ οὐκ ἐφείσαντο νεανίσκου καὶ παρθένου καὶ πρεσβύτου καὶ
νεωτέρου ἀλλὰ πάντας παρέδωκεν εἰς τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν

51 καὶ πάντα τὰ ἱερὰ σκεύη τοῦ κυρίου τὰ μεγάλα καὶ τὰ μικρὰ καὶ τὰς
κιβωτοὺς τοῦ κυρίου καὶ τὰς βασιλικὰς ἀποθήκας ἀναλαβόντες ἀπήνεγκαν εἰς
Βαβυλῶνα

52 καὶ ἐνεπύρισαν τὸν οἶκον τοῦ κυρίου καὶ ἔλυσαν τὰ τείχα Ιεροσολύμων
καὶ τοὺς πύργους αὐτῶν ἐνεπύρισαν ἐν πυρὶ

53 καὶ συνετέλεσαν πάντα τὰ ἔνδοξα αὐτῆς ἀχρεῶσαι καὶ τοὺς ἐπιλοίπους
ἀπήγαγεν μετὰ ῥομφαίας εἰς Βαβυλῶνα

54 καὶ ἦσαν παῖδες αὐτῷ καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ μέχρι τοῦ βασιλεῦσαι Πέρσας
εἰς ἀναπλήρωσιν τοῦ ῥήματος τοῦ κυρίου ἐν στόματι Ιερεμιου

55 ἕως τοῦ εὐδοκῆσαι τὴν γῆν τὰ σάββατα αὐτῆς πάντα τὸν χρόνον τῆς
ἐρημώσεως αὐτῆς σαββατιεῖ εἰς συμπλήρωσιν ἐτῶν ἑβδομήκοντα
