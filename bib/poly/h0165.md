H165  
אהי  
אֱהִי ‎ ‘ĕhı̂y  
*e-hee‘*  
Apparently an orthographical variation for [346](h0346) *where*. (Used
in [Hos 13:10](hos013.htm#010), [Hos 13:14](hos013.htm#014)). *“I*
*will* *be”* is often the rendering of the same Hebrew form from
[1961](h1961) - I will be ([Hos 13:10](hos013.htm#010), [Hos
13:14](hos013.htm#014)) \[which is often the rendering of the same
Hebrew form from [1961](h1961) .
