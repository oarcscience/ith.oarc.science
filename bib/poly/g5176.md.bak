G5176  
τρώγω  
trōgō  
*tro‘-go*  
Probably strengthened from a collateral form of the base of
[5134](g5134) and [5147](g5147.md) through the idea of *corrosion* or
*wear*; or perhaps rather of a base of [5167](g5167) and [5149](g5149.md)
through the idea of a *craunching* sound; to *gnaw* or *chew*, that is,
(genitive case) to *eat:* - eat.
