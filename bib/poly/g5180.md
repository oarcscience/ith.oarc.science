G5180  
τύπτω  
tuptō  
*toop‘-to*  
A primary verb (in a strengthened form); to “thump”, that is, *cudgel*
or *pummel* (properly with a stick or *bastinado*), but in any case by
*repeated* blows; thus differing from [3817](g3817) and [3960](g3960)
which denote a \[usually single\] blow with the hand or any instrument,
or [4141](g4141) with the *fist* \[or a *hammer*\], or [4474](g4474)
with the *palm*; as well as from [5177](g5177) an *accidental*
collision); by implication to *punish*; figuratively to *offend* (the
conscience): - beat, smite, strike, wound.
