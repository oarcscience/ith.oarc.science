A phrase combining [3588](g3588) with the present participle and
imperfect of [1510](g1510) and the present participle of [2064](g2064)
by means of [2532](g2532) *the* one *being* *and* *the* one that *was*
*and* *the* one *coming*, that is, *the* *Eternal*, as a divine epithet
of Christ. (Each “and” ([2532](g2532) was ommited from the phrase
because of limited space.): - which art (is, was), and (which) wast (is,
was), and art (is) to come (shalt be).
