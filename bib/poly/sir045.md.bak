### Sirach 45

[Apo](../apo/sir045.md)

1 And he brought out of him a merciful man, which found favour in the
sight of all flesh, even Moses, beloved of God and men, whose memorial
is blessed.

2 He made him like to the glorious saints, and magnified him, so that
his enemies stood in fear of him.

3 By his words he caused the wonders to cease, and he made him glorious
in the sight of kings, and gave him a commandment for his people, and
shewed him part of his glory.

4 He sanctified him in his faithfuless and meekness, and chose him out
of all men.

5 He made him to hear his voice, and brought him into the dark cloud,
and gave him commandments before his face, even the law of life and
knowledge, that he might teach Jacob his covenants, and Israel his
judgments.

6 He exalted Aaron, an holy man like unto him, even his brother, of the
tribe of Levi.

7 An everlasting covenant he made with him and gave him the priesthood
among the people; he beautified him with comely ornaments, and clothed
him with a robe of glory.

8 He put upon him perfect glory; and strengthened him with rich
garments, with breeches, with a long robe, and the ephod.

9 And he compassed him with pomegranates, and with many golden bells
round about, that as he went there might be a sound, and a noise made
that might be heard in the temple, for a memorial to the children of his
people;

10 With an holy garment, with gold, and blue silk, and purple, the work
of the embroidere, with a breastplate of judgment, and with Urim and
Thummim;

11 With twisted scarlet, the work of the cunning workman, with precious
stones graven like seals, and set in gold, the work of the jeweller,
with a writing engraved for a memorial, after the number of the tribes
of Israel.

12 He set a crown of gold upon the mitre, wherein was engraved Holiness,
an ornament of honour, a costly work, the desires of the eyes, goodly
and beautiful.

13 Before him there were none such, neither did ever any stranger put
them on, but only his children and his children's children perpetually.

14 Their sacrifices shall be wholly consumed every day twice
continually.

15 Moses consecrated him, and anointed him with holy oil: this was
appointed unto him by an everlasting covenant, and to his seed, so long
as the heavens should remain, that they should minister unto him, and
execute the office of the priesthood, and bless the people in his name.

16 He chose him out of all men living to offer sacrifices to the Lord,
incense, and a sweet savour, for a memorial, to make reconciliation for
his people.

17 He gave unto him his commandments, and authority in the statutes of
judgments, that he should teach Jacob the testimonies, and inform Israel
in his laws.

18 Strangers conspired together against him, and maligned him in the
wilderness, even the men that were of Dathan's and Abiron's side, and
the congregation of Core, with fury and wrath.

19 This the Lord saw, and it displeased him, and in his wrathful
indignation were they consumed: he did wonders upon them, to consume
them with the fiery flame.

20 But he made Aaron more honourable, and gave him an heritage, and
divided unto him the firstfruits of the increase; especially he prepared
bread in abundance:

21 For they eat of the sacrifices of the Lord, which he gave unto him
and his seed.

22 Howbeit in the land of the people he had no inheritance, neither had
he any portion among the people: for the Lord himself is his portion and
inheritance.

23 The third in glory is Phinees the son of Eleazar, because he had zeal
in the fear of the Lord, and stood up with good courage of heart: when
the people were turned back, and made reconciliation for Israel.

24 Therefore was there a covenant of peace made with him, that he should
be the chief of the sanctuary and of his people, and that he and his
posterity should have the dignity of the priesthood for ever:

25 According to the covenant made with David son of Jesse, of the tribe
of Juda, that the inheritance of the king should be to his posterity
alone: so the inheritance of Aaron should also be unto his seed.

26 God give you wisdom in your heart to judge his people in
righteousness, that their good things be not abolished, and that their
glory may endure for ever.

1 καὶ ἐξήγαγεν ἐξ αὐτοῦ ἄνδρα ἐλέους εὑρίσκοντα χάριν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς πάσης
σαρκὸς ἠγαπημένον ὑπὸ θεοῦ καὶ ἀνθρώπων Μωυσῆν οὗ τὸ μνημόσυνον ἐν
εὐλογίαις

2 ὡμοίωσεν αὐτὸν δόξῃ ἁγίων καὶ ἐμεγάλυνεν αὐτὸν ἐν φόβοις ἐχθρῶν

3 ἐν λόγοις αὐτοῦ σημεῖα κατέπαυσεν ἐδόξασεν αὐτὸν κατὰ πρόσωπον
βασιλέων ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ πρὸς λαὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔδειξεν αὐτῷ τῆς δόξης
αὐτοῦ

4 ἐν πίστει καὶ πραΰτητι αὐτὸν ἡγίασεν ἐξελέξατο αὐτὸν ἐκ πάσης σαρκός

5 ἠκούτισεν αὐτὸν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν γνόφον καὶ
ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ κατὰ πρόσωπον ἐντολάς νόμον ζωῆς καὶ ἐπιστήμης διδάξαι τὸν
Ιακωβ διαθήκην καὶ κρίματα αὐτοῦ τὸν Ισραηλ

6 Ααρων ὕψωσεν ἅγιον ὅμοιον αὐτῷ ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ ἐκ φυλῆς Λευι

7 ἔστησεν αὐτὸν διαθήκην αἰῶνος καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ἱερατείαν λαοῦ
ἐμακάρισεν αὐτὸν ἐν εὐκοσμίᾳ καὶ περιέζωσεν αὐτὸν περιστολὴν δόξης

8 ἐνέδυσεν αὐτὸν συντέλειαν καυχήματος καὶ ἐστερέωσεν αὐτὸν σκεύεσιν
ἰσχύος περισκελῆ καὶ ποδήρη καὶ ἐπωμίδα

9 καὶ ἐκύκλωσεν αὐτὸν ῥοΐσκοις χρυσοῖς κώδωσιν πλείστοις κυκλόθεν ἠχῆσαι
φωνὴν ἐν βήμασιν αὐτοῦ ἀκουστὸν ποιῆσαι ἦχον ἐν ναῷ εἰς μνημόσυνον υἱοῖς
λαοῦ αὐτοῦ

10 στολῇ ἁγίᾳ χρυσῷ καὶ ὑακίνθῳ καὶ πορφύρᾳ ἔργῳ ποικιλτοῦ λογείῳ
κρίσεως δήλοις ἀληθείας κεκλωσμένῃ κόκκῳ ἔργῳ τεχνίτου

11 λίθοις πολυτελέσιν γλύμματος σφραγῖδος ἐν δέσει χρυσίου ἔργῳ
λιθουργοῦ εἰς μνημόσυνον ἐν γραφῇ κεκολαμμένῃ κατ᾽ ἀριθμὸν φυλῶν Ισραηλ

12 στέφανον χρυσοῦν ἐπάνω κιδάρεως ἐκτύπωμα σφραγῖδος ἁγιάσματος καύχημα
τιμῆς ἔργον ἰσχύος ἐπιθυμήματα ὀφθαλμῶν κοσμούμενα

13 ὡραῖα πρὸ αὐτοῦ οὐ γέγονεν τοιαῦτα ἕως αἰῶνος οὐκ ἐνεδύσατο ἀλλογενὴς
πλὴν τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ μόνον καὶ τὰ ἔκγονα αὐτοῦ διὰ παντός

14 θυσίαι αὐτοῦ ὁλοκαρπωθήσονται καθ᾽ ἡμέραν ἐνδελεχῶς δίς

15 ἐπλήρωσεν Μωυσῆς τὰς χεῖρας καὶ ἔχρισεν αὐτὸν ἐν ἐλαίῳ ἁγίῳ ἐγενήθη
αὐτῷ εἰς διαθήκην αἰῶνος καὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ ἐν ἡμέραις οὐρανοῦ
λειτουργεῖν αὐτῷ ἅμα καὶ ἱερατεύειν καὶ εὐλογεῖν τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ
ὀνόματι

16 ἐξελέξατο αὐτὸν ἀπὸ παντὸς ζῶντος προσαγαγεῖν κάρπωσιν κυρίῳ θυμίαμα
καὶ εὐωδίαν εἰς μνημόσυνον ἐξιλάσκεσθαι περὶ τοῦ λαοῦ σου

17 ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ἐν ἐντολαῖς αὐτοῦ ἐξουσίαν ἐν διαθήκαις κριμάτων διδάξαι
τὸν Ιακωβ τὰ μαρτύρια καὶ ἐν νόμῳ αὐτοῦ φωτίσαι Ισραηλ

18 ἐπισυνέστησαν αὐτῷ ἀλλότριοι καὶ ἐζήλωσαν αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ἄνδρες οἱ
περὶ Δαθαν καὶ Αβιρων καὶ ἡ συναγωγὴ Κορε ἐν θυμῷ καὶ ὀργῇ

19 εἶδεν κύριος καὶ οὐκ εὐδόκησεν καὶ συνετελέσθησαν ἐν θυμῷ ὀργῆς
ἐποίησεν αὐτοῖς τέρατα καταναλῶσαι ἐν πυρὶ φλογὸς αὐτοῦ

20 καὶ προσέθηκεν Ααρων δόξαν καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ κληρονομίαν ἀπαρχὰς
πρωτογενημάτων ἐμέρισεν αὐτῷ ἄρτον πρώτοις ἡτοίμασεν πλησμονήν

21 καὶ γὰρ θυσίας κυρίου φάγονται ἃς ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ τε καὶ τῷ σπέρματι
αὐτοῦ

22 πλὴν ἐν γῇ λαοῦ οὐ κληρονομήσει καὶ μερὶς οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτῷ ἐν λαῷ αὐτὸς
γὰρ μερίς σου καὶ κληρονομία

23 καὶ Φινεες υἱὸς Ελεαζαρ τρίτος εἰς δόξαν ἐν τῷ ζηλῶσαι αὐτὸν ἐν φόβῳ
κυρίου καὶ στῆναι αὐτὸν ἐν τροπῇ λαοῦ ἐν ἀγαθότητι προθυμίας ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ
καὶ ἐξιλάσατο περὶ τοῦ Ισραηλ

24 διὰ τοῦτο ἐστάθη αὐτῷ διαθήκη εἰρήνης προστατεῖν ἁγίων καὶ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ
ἵνα αὐτῷ ᾖ καὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ ἱερωσύνης μεγαλεῖον εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας

25 καὶ διαθήκη τῷ Δαυιδ υἱῷ Ιεσσαι ἐκ φυλῆς Ιουδα κληρονομία βασιλέως
υἱοῦ ἐξ υἱοῦ μόνου κληρονομία Ααρων καὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ

26 δῴη ὑμῖν σοφίαν ἐν καρδίᾳ ὑμῶν κρίνειν τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ
ἵνα μὴ ἀφανισθῇ τὰ ἀγαθὰ αὐτῶν καὶ τὴν δόξαν αὐτῶν εἰς γενεὰς αὐτῶν

[Vul](../vul/sir045.md)

1 \[Dilectus Deo et hominibus Moyses,  
cujus memoria in benedictione est.  

2 Similem illum fecit in gloria sanctorum,  
et magnificavit eum in timore inimicorum,  
et in verbis suis monstra placavit.  

3 Glorificavit illum in conspectu regum,  
et jussit illi coram populo suo,  
et ostendit illi gloriam suam.  

4 In fide et lenitate ipsius sanctum fecit illum,  
et elegit eum ex omni carne.  

5 Audivit enim eum, et vocem ipsius,  
et induxit illum in nubem.  

6 Et dedit illi coram præcepta,  
et legem vitæ et disciplinæ,  
docere Jacob testamentum suum,  
et judicia sua Israël.\]  

7 \[Excelsum fecit Aaron fratrem ejus,  
et similem sibi, de tribu Levi.  

8 Statuit ei testamentum æternum,  
et dedit illi sacerdotium gentis,  
et beatificavit illum in gloria:  

9 et circumcinxit eum zona gloriæ,  
et induit eum stolam gloriæ,  
et coronavit eum in vasis virtutis.  

10 Circumpedes, et femoralia, et humerale posuit ei:  
et cinxit illum tintinnabulis aureis plurimis in gyro:  

11 dare sonitum in incessu suo,  
auditum facere sonitum in templo  
in memoriam filiis gentis suæ.  

12 Stolam sanctam auro, et hyacintho, et purpura,  
opus textile viri sapientis, judicio et veritate præditi:  

13 torto cocco opus artificis  
gemmis pretiosis figuratis in ligatura auri,  
et opere lapidarii sculptis,  
in memoriam secundum numerum tribuum Israël.  

14 Corona aurea super mitram ejus  
expressa signo sanctitatis, et gloria honoris:  
opus virtutis, et desideria oculorum ornata.  

15 Sic pulchra ante ipsum non fuerunt talia  
usque ad originem.  

16 Non est indutus illa alienigena aliquis,  
sed tantum filii ipsius soli,  
et nepotes ejus per omne tempus.  

17 Sacrificia ipsius  
consumpta sunt igne quotidie.  

18 Complevit Moyses manus ejus,  
et unxit illum oleo sancto.  

19 Factum est illi in testamentum æternum,  
et semini ejus, sicut dies cæli,  
fungi sacerdotio, et habere laudem,  
et glorificare populum suum in nomine ejus.  

20 Ipsum elegit ab omni vivente,  
offerre sacrificium Deo, incensum, et bonum odorem,  
in memoriam placare pro populo suo:  

21 et dedit illi in præceptis suis potestatem,  
in testamentis judiciorum:  
docere Jacob testimonia,  
et in lege sua lucem dare Israël.  

22 Quia contra illum steterunt alieni,  
et propter invidiam circumdederunt illum homines in deserto,  
qui erant cum Dathan et Abiron,  
et congregatio Core in iracundia.  

23 Vidit Dominus Deus, et non placuit illi,  
et consumpti sunt in impetu iracundiæ.  

24 Fecit illis monstra,  
et consumpsit illos in flamma ignis.  

25 Et addidit Aaron gloriam,  
et dedit illi hæreditatem,  
et primitias frugum terræ divisit illi.  

26 Panem ipsis in primis paravit in satietatem:  
nam et sacrificia Domini edent,  
quæ dedit illi et semini ejus.  

27 Ceterum in terra gentes non hæreditabit,  
et pars non est illi in gente:  
ipse est enim pars ejus, et hæreditas.\]  

28 \[Phinees, filius Eleazari, tertius in gloria est,  
imitando eum in timore Domini,  

29 et stare in reverentia gentis:  
in bonitate et alacritate animæ suæ placuit Deo pro Israël.  

30 Ideo statuit illi testamentum pacis,  
principem sanctorum et gentis suæ,  
ut sit illi et semini ejus sacerdotii dignitas in æternum.  

31 Et testamentum David regi filio Jesse de tribu Juda,  
hæreditas ipsi et semini ejus:  
ut daret sapientiam in cor nostrum,  
judicare gentem suam in justitia,  
ne abolerentur bona ipsorum:  
et gloriam ipsorum in gentem eorum æternam fecit.\]
