### 2 Macabees 14

[Apo](../apo/ma2014.md)

1 After three years was Judas informed, that Demetrius the son of
Seleucus, having entered by the haven of Tripolis with a great power and
navy,

2 Had taken the country, and killed Antiochus, and Lysias his protector.

3 Now one Alcimus, who had been high priest, and had defiled himself
wilfully in the times of their mingling with the Gentiles, seeing that
by no means he could save himself, nor have any more access to the holy
altar,

4 Came to king Demetrius in the hundred and one and fiftieth year,
presenting unto him a crown of gold, and a palm, and also of the boughs
which were used solemnly in the temple: and so that day he held his
peace.

5 Howbeit having gotten opportunity to further his foolish enterprize,
and being called into counsel by Demetrius, and asked how the Jews stood
affected, and what they intended, he answered thereunto:

6 Those of the Jews that he called Assideans, whose captain is Judas
Maccabeus, nourish war and are seditious, and will not let the rest be
in peace.

7 Therefore I, being deprived of mine ancestors' honour, I mean the high
priesthood, am now come hither:

8 First, verily for the unfeigned care I have of things pertaining to
the king; and secondly, even for that I intend the good of mine own
countrymen: for all our nation is in no small misery through the
unadvised dealing of them aforersaid.

9 Wherefore, O king, seeing knowest all these things, be careful for the
country, and our nation, which is pressed on every side, according to
the clemency that thou readily shewest unto all.

10 For as long as Judas liveth, it is not possible that the state should
be quiet.

11 This was no sooner spoken of him, but others of the king's friends,
being maliciously set against Judas, did more incense Demetrius.

12 And forthwith calling Nicanor, who had been master of the elephants,
and making him governor over Judea, he sent him forth,

13 Commanding him to slay Judas, and to scatter them that were with him,
and to make Alcimus high priest of the great temple.

14 Then the heathen, that had fled out of Judea from Judas, came to
Nicanor by flocks, thinking the harm and calamities ot the Jews to be
their welfare.

15 Now when the Jews heard of Nicanor's coming, and that the heathen
were up against them, they cast earth upon their heads, and made
supplication to him that had established his people for ever, and who
always helpeth his portion with manifestation of his presence.

16 So at the commandment of the captain they removed straightways from
thence, and came near unto them at the town of Dessau.

17 Now Simon, Judas' brother, had joined battle with Nicanor, but was
somewhat discomfited through the sudden silence of his enemies.

18 Nevertheless Nicanor, hearing of the manliness of them that were with
Judas, and the courageousness that they had to fight for their country,
durst not try the matter by the sword.

19 Wherefore he sent Posidonius, and Theodotus, and Mattathias, to make
peace.

20 So when they had taken long advisement thereupon, and the captain had
made the multitude acquainted therewith, and it appeared that they were
all of one mind, they consented to the covenants,

21 And appointed a day to meet in together by themselves: and when the
day came, and stools were set for either of them,

22 Ludas placed armed men ready in convenient places, lest some
treachery should be suddenly practised by the enemies: so they made a
peaceable conference.

23 Now Nicanor abode in Jerusalem, and did no hurt, but sent away the
people that came flocking unto him.

24 And he would not willingly have Judas out of his sight: for he love
the man from his heart

25 He prayed him also to take a wife, and to beget children: so he
married, was quiet, and took part of this life.

26 But Alcimus, perceiving the love that was betwixt them, and
considering the covenants that were made, came to Demetrius, and told
him that Nicanor was not well affected toward the state; for that he had
ordained Judas, a traitor to his realm, to be the king's successor.

27 Then the king being in a rage, and provoked with the accusations of
the most wicked man, wrote to Nicanor, signifying that he was much
displeased with the covenants, and commanding him that he should send
Maccabeus prisoner in all haste unto Antioch.

28 When this came to Nicanor's hearing, he was much confounded in
himself, and took it grievously that he should make void the articles
which were agreed upon, the man being in no fault.

29 But because there was no dealing against the king, he watched his
time to accomplish this thing by policy.

30 Notwithstanding, when Maccabeus saw that Nicanor began to be churlish
unto him, and that he entreated him more roughly than he was wont,
perceiving that such sour behaviour came not of good, he gathered
together not a few of his men, and withdrew himself from Nicanor.

31 But the other, knowing that he was notably prevented by Judas'
policy, came into the great and holy temple, and commanded the priests,
that were offering their usual sacrifices, to deliver him the man.

32 And when they sware that they could not tell where the man was whom
he sought,

33 He stretched out his right hand toward the temple, and made an oath
in this manner: If ye will not deliver me Judas as a prisoner, I will
lay this temple of God even with the ground, and I will break down the
altar, and erect a notable temple unto Bacchus.

34 After these words he departed. Then the priests lifted up their hands
toward heaven, and besought him that was ever a defender of their
nation, saying in this manner;

35 Thou, O Lord of all things, who hast need of nothing, wast pleased
that the temple of thine habitation should be among us:

36 Therefore now, O holy Lord of all holiness, keep this house ever
undefiled, which lately was cleansed, and stop every unrighteous mouth.

37 Now was there accused unto Nicanor one Razis, one of the elders of
Jerusalem, a lover of his countrymen, and a man of very good report, who
for his kindness was called a father of the Jews.

38 For in the former times, when they mingled not themselves with the
Gentiles, he had been accused of Judaism, and did boldly jeopard his
body and life with all vehemency for the religion of the Jews.

39 So Nicanor, willing to declare the hate that he bare unto the Jews,
sent above five hundred men of war to take him:

40 For he thought by taking him to do the Jews much hurt.

41 Now when the multitude would have taken the tower, and violently
broken into the outer door, and bade that fire should be brought to burn
it, he being ready to be taken on every side fell upon his sword;

42 Choosing rather to die manfully, than to come into the hands of the
wicked, to be abused otherwise than beseemed his noble birth:

43 But missing his stroke through haste, the multitude also rushing
within the doors, he ran boldly up to the wall, and cast himself down
manfully among the thickest of them.

44 But they quickly giving back, and a space being made, he fell down
into the midst of the void place.

45 Nevertheless, while there was yet breath within him, being inflamed
with anger, he rose up; and though his blood gushed out like spouts of
water, and his wounds were grievous, yet he ran through the midst of the
throng; and standing upon a steep rock,

46 When as his blood was now quite gone, he plucked out his bowels, and
taking them in both his hands, he cast them upon the throng, and calling
upon the Lord of life and spirit to restore him those again, he thus
died.

[Vul](../vul/ma2014.md)

1 Sed post triennii tempus, cognovit Judas et qui cum eo erant Demetrium
Seleuci cum multitudine valida et navibus per portam Tripolis ascendisse
ad loca opportuna,

2 et tenuisse regiones adversus Antiochum, et ducem ejus Lysiam.

3 Alcimus autem quidam, qui summus sacerdos fuerat, sed voluntarie
coinquinatus est temporibus commistionis, considerans nullo modo sibi
esse salutem neque accessum ad altare,

4 venit ad regem Demetrium centesimo quinquagesimo anno, offerens ei
coronam auream et palmam, super hæc et thallos, qui templi esse
videbantur. Et ipsa quidem die siluit.

5 Tempus autem opportunum dementiæ suæ nactus, convocatus a Demetrio ad
consilium, et interrogatus quibus rebus et consiliis Judæi niterentur,

6 respondit: Ipsi qui dicuntur Assidæi Judæorum, quibus præest Judas
Machabæus, bella nutriunt, et seditiones movent, nec patiuntur regnum
esse quietum:

7 nam et ego defraudatus parentum gloria (dico autem summo sacerdotio)
huc veni:

8 primo quidem utilitatibus regis fidem servans, secundo autem etiam
civibus consulens: nam illorum pravitate universum genus nostrum non
minime vexatur.

9 Sed oro his singulis, o rex, cognitis, et regioni et generi, secundum
humanitatem tuam pervulgatam omnibus, prospice:

10 nam, quamdiu superest Judas, impossibile est pacem esse negotiis.

11 Talibus autem ab hoc dictis, et ceteri amici hostiliter se habentes
adversus Judam, inflammaverunt Demetrium.

12 Qui statim Nicanorem præpositum elephantorum ducem misit in Judæam:

13 datis mandatis ut ipsum quidem Judam caperet: eos vero qui cum illo
erant, dispergeret, et constitueret Alcimum maximi templi summum
sacerdotem.

14 Tunc gentes quæ de Judæa fugerant Judam, gregatim se Nicanori
miscebant, miserias et clades Judæorum prosperitates rerum suarum
existimantes.

15 Audito itaque Judæi Nicanoris adventu, et conventu nationum,
conspersi terra rogabant eum qui populum suum constituit, ut in æternum
custodiret, quique suam portionem signis evidentibus protegit.

16 Imperante autem duce, statim inde moverunt, conveneruntque ad
castellum Dessau.

17 Simon vero frater Judæ commiserat cum Nicanore: sed conterritus est
repentino adventu adversariorum.  

18 Nicanor tamen, audiens virtutem comitum Judæ, et animi magnitudinem
quam pro patriæ certaminibus habebant, sanguine judicium facere
metuebat.

19 Quam ob rem præmisit Posidonium, et Theodotium, et Matthiam, ut
darent dextras atque acciperent.

20 Et cum diu de his consilium ageretur, et ipse dux ad multitudinem
retulisset, omnium una fuit sententia amicitiis annuere.

21 Itaque diem constituerunt, qua secreto inter se agerent: et singulis
sellæ prolatæ sunt, et positæ.

22 Præcepit autem Judas armatos esse locis opportunis, ne forte ab
hostibus repente mali aliquid oriretur: et congruum colloquium fecerunt.

23 Morabatur autem Nicanor Jerosolymis, nihilque inique agebat:
gregesque turbarum quæ congregatæ fuerant, dimisit.

24 Habebat autem Judam semper carum ex animo, et erat viro inclinatus.

25 Rogavitque eum ducere uxorem, filiosque procreare. Nuptias fecit:
quiete egit, communiterque vivebant.  

26 Alcimus autem, videns caritatem illorum ad invicem et conventiones,
venit ad Demetrium, et dicebat Nicanorem rebus alienis assentire,
Judamque regni insidiatorem successorem sibi destinasse.

27 Itaque rex exasperatus, et pessimis hujus criminationibus irritatus,
scripsit Nicanori, dicens graviter quidem se ferre de amicitiæ
conventione, jubere tamen Machabæum citius vinctum mittere Antiochiam.

28 Quibus cognitis, Nicanor consternabatur, et graviter ferebat, si ea
quæ convenerant irrita faceret, nihil læsus a viro:

29 sed quia regi resistere non poterat, opportunitatem observabat qua
præceptum perficeret.

30 At Machabæus, videns secum austerius agere Nicanorem, et consuetum
occursum ferocius exhibentem, intelligens non ex bono esse austeritatem
istam, paucis suorum congregatis, occultavit se a Nicanore.

31 Quod cum ille cognovit, fortiter se a viro præventum, venit ad
maximum et sanctissimum templum: et sacerdotibus solitas hostias
offerentibus, jussit sibi tradi virum.

32 Quibus cum juramento dicentibus nescire se ubi esset qui quærebatur,
extendens manum ad templum,

33 juravit, dicens: Nisi Judam mihi vinctum tradideritis, istud Dei
fanum in planitiem deducam, et altare effodiam, et templum hoc Libero
patri consecrabo.

34 Et his dictis abiit. Sacerdotes autem protendentes manus in cælum,
invocabant eum qui semper propugnator esset gentis ipsorum, hæc
dicentes:

35 Tu, Domine universorum, qui nullius indiges, voluisti templum
habitationis tuæ fieri in nobis.

36 Et nunc, Sancte sanctorum, omnium Domine, conserva in æternum
impollutam domum istam, quæ nuper mundata est.  

37 Razias autem quidam de senioribus ab Jerosolymis delatus est
Nicanori, vir amator civitatis, et bene audiens: qui pro affectu pater
Judæorum appellabatur.

38 Hic multis temporibus continentiæ propositum tenuit in Judaismo,
corpusque et animam tradere contentus pro perseverantia.

39 Volens autem Nicanor manifestare odium quod habebat in Judæos, misit
milites quingentos ut eum comprehenderent.

40 Putabat enim, si illum decepisset, se cladem Judæis maximam
illaturum.

41 Turbis autem irruere in domum ejus, et januam dirumpere: atque ignem
admovere cupientibus, cum jam comprehenderetur, gladio se petiit,

42 eligens nobiliter mori potius quam subditus fieri peccatoribus, et
contra natales suos indignis injuriis agi.

43 Sed cum per festinationem non certo ictu plagam dedisset, et turbæ
intra ostia irrumperent, recurrens audacter ad murum præcipitavit
semetipsum viriliter in turbas:

44 quibus velociter locum dantibus casui ejus, venit per mediam
cervicem.

45 Et cum adhuc spiraret, accensus animo, surrexit, et cum sanguis ejus
magno fluxu deflueret, et gravissimis vulneribus esset saucius, cursu
turbam pertransiit:

46 et stans supra quamdam petram præruptam, et jam exsanguis effectus,
complexus intestina sua, utrisque manibus projecit super turbas,
invocans dominatorem vitæ ac spiritus ut hæc illi iterum redderet: atque
ita vita defunctus est.
