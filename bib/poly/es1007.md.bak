### 1 Esdras 7

[Apo](../apo/es1007.md)

1 Then Sisinnes the governor of Celosyria and Phenice, and
Sathrabuzanes, with their companions following the commandments of king
Darius,

2 Did very carefully oversee the holy works, assisting the ancients of
the Jews and governors of the temple.

3 And so the holy works prospered, when Aggeus and Zacharias the
prophets prophesied.

4 And they finished these things by the commandment of the Lord God of
Israel, and with the consent of Cyrus, Darius, and Artexerxes, kings of
Persia.

5 And thus was the holy house finished in the three and twentieth day of
the month Adar, in the sixth year of Darius king of the Persians

6 And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and others
that were of the captivity, that were added unto them, did according to
the things written in the book of Moses.

7 And to the dedication of the temple of the Lord they offered an
hundred bullocks two hundred rams, four hundred lambs;

8 And twelve goats for the sin of all Israel, according to the number of
the chief of the tribes of Israel.

9 The priests also and the Levites stood arrayed in their vestments,
according to their kindreds, in the service of the Lord God of Israel,
according to the book of Moses: and the porters at every gate.

10 And the children of Israel that were of the captivity held the
passover the fourteenth day of the first month, after that the priests
and the Levites were sanctified.

11 They that were of the captivity were not all sanctified together: but
the Levites were all sanctified together.

12 And so they offered the passover for all them of the captivity, and
for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.

13 And the children of Israel that came out of the captivity did eat,
even all they that had separated themselves from the abominations of the
people of the land, and sought the Lord.

14 And they kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days, making merry
before the Lord,

15 For that he had turned the counsel of the king of Assyria toward
them, to strengthen their hands in the works of the Lord God of Israel.

1 τότε Σισίννης ὁ ἔπαρχος Κοίλης Συρίας καὶ Φοινίκης καὶ Σαθραβουζάνης
καὶ οἱ συνέταιροι κατακολουθήσαντες τοῖς ὑπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως Δαρείου
προσταγεῖσιν

2 ἐπεστάτουν τῶν ἱερῶν ἔργων ἐπιμελέστερον συνεργοῦντες τοῖς
πρεσβυτέροις τῶν Ιουδαίων καὶ ἱεροστάταις

3 καὶ εὔοδα ἐγίνετο τὰ ἱερὰ ἔργα προφητευόντων Αγγαιου καὶ Ζαχαριου τῶν
προφητῶν

4 καὶ συνετέλεσαν ταῦτα διὰ προστάγματος τοῦ κυρίου θεοῦ Ισραηλ

5 καὶ μετὰ τῆς γνώμης Κύρου καὶ Δαρείου καὶ Ἀρταξέρξου βασιλέως Περσῶν
συνετελέσθη ὁ οἶκος ὁ ἅγιος ἕως τρίτης καὶ εἰκάδος μηνὸς Αδαρ τοῦ ἕκτου
ἔτους βασιλέως Δαρείου

6 καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ
οἱ ἐκ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας οἱ προστεθέντες ἀκολούθως τοῖς ἐν τῇ Μωυσέως βίβλῳ

7 καὶ προσήνεγκαν εἰς τὸν ἐγκαινισμὸν τοῦ ἱεροῦ τοῦ κυρίου ταύρους
ἑκατόν κριοὺς διακοσίους ἄρνας τετρακοσίους

8 χιμάρους ὑπὲρ ἁμαρτίας παντὸς τοῦ Ισραηλ δώδεκα πρὸς ἀριθμὸν ἐκ τῶν
φυλάρχων τοῦ Ισραηλ δώδεκα

9 καὶ ἔστησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται ἐστολισμένοι κατὰ φυλὰς ἐπὶ τῶν
ἔργων τοῦ κυρίου θεοῦ Ισραηλ ἀκολούθως τῇ Μωυσέως βίβλῳ καὶ οἱ θυρωροὶ
ἐφ᾽ ἑκάστου πυλῶνος

10 καὶ ἠγάγοσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ τῶν ἐκ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας τὸ πασχα ἐν τῇ
τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ πρώτου μηνός ὅτι ἡγνίσθησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ
Λευῖται ἅμα

11 καὶ πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας οὐχ ἡγνίσθησαν ὅτι οἱ Λευῖται ἅμα
πάντες ἡγνίσθησαν

12 καὶ ἔθυσαν τὸ πασχα πᾶσιν τοῖς υἱοῖς τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας καὶ τοῖς
ἀδελφοῖς αὐτῶν τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν καὶ ἑαυτοῖς

13 καὶ ἐφάγοσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ οἱ ἐκ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας πάντες οἱ
χωρισθέντες ἀπὸ τῶν βδελυγμάτων τῶν ἐθνῶν τῆς γῆς ζητοῦντες τὸν κύριον

14 καὶ ἠγάγοσαν τὴν ἑορτὴν τῶν ἀζύμων ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας εὐφραινόμενοι ἔναντι
τοῦ κυρίου

15 ὅτι μετέστρεψεν τὴν βουλὴν τοῦ βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς
κατισχῦσαι τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὰ ἔργα κυρίου θεοῦ Ισραηλ
