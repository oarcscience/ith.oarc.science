### Sirach 48

[Apo](../apo/sir048.md)

1 Then stood up Elias the prophet as fire, and his word burned like a
lamp.

2 He brought a sore famine upon them, and by his zeal he diminished
their number.

3 By the word of the Lord he shut up the heaven, and also three times
brought down fire.

4 O Elias, how wast thou honoured in thy wondrous deeds! and who may
glory like unto thee!

5 Who didst raise up a dead man from death, and his soul from the place
of the dead, by the word of the most High:

6 Who broughtest kings to destruction, and honorable men from their bed:

7 Who heardest the rebuke of the Lord in Sinai, and in Horeb the
judgment of vengeance:

8 Who annointedst kings to take revenge, and prophets to succeed after
him:

9 Who was taken up in a whirlwind of fire, and in a chariot of fiery
horses:

10 Who wast ordained for reproofs in their times, to pacify the wrath of
the Lord's judgment, before it brake forth into fury, and to turn the
heart of the father unto the son, and to restore the tribes of Jacob.

11 Blessed are they that saw thee, and slept in love; for we shall
surely live.

12 Elias it was, who was covered with a whirlwind: and Eliseus was
filled with his spirit: whilst he lived, he was not moved with the
presence of any prince, neither could any bring him into subjection.

13 No word could overcome him; and after his death his body prophesied.

14 He did wonders in his life, and at his death were his works
marvellous.

15 For all this the people repented not, neither departed they from
their sins, till they were spoiled and carried out of their land, and
were scattered through all the earth: yet there remained a small people,
and a ruler in the house of David:

16 Of whom some did that which was pleasing to God, and some multiplied
sins.

17 Ezekias fortified his city, and brought in water into the midst
thereof: he digged the hard rock with iron, and made wells for waters.

18 In his time Sennacherib came up, and sent Rabsaces, and lifted up his
hand against Sion, and boasted proudly.

19 Then trembled their hearts and hands, and they were in pain, as women
in travail.

20 But they called upon the Lord which is merciful, and stretched out
their hands toward him: and immediately the Holy One heard them out of
heaven, and delivered them by the ministry of Esay.

21 He smote the host of the Assyrians, and his angel destroyed them.

22 For Ezekias had done the thing that pleased the Lord, and was strong
in the ways of David his father, as Esay the prophet, who was great and
faithful in his vision, had commanded him.

23 In his time the sun went backward, and he lengthened the king's life.

24 He saw by an excellent spirit what should come to pass at the last,
and he comforted them that mourned in Sion.

25 He shewed what should come to pass for ever, and secret things or
ever they came.

1 καὶ ἀνέστη Ηλιας προφήτης ὡς πῦρ καὶ ὁ λόγος αὐτοῦ ὡς λαμπὰς ἐκαίετο

2 ὃς ἐπήγαγεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς λιμὸν καὶ τῷ ζήλῳ αὐτοῦ ὠλιγοποίησεν αὐτούς

3 ἐν λόγῳ κυρίου ἀνέσχεν οὐρανόν κατήγαγεν οὕτως τρὶς πῦρ

4 ὡς ἐδοξάσθης Ηλια ἐν θαυμασίοις σου καὶ τίς ὅμοιός σοι καυχᾶσθαι

5 ὁ ἐγείρας νεκρὸν ἐκ θανάτου καὶ ἐξ ᾅδου ἐν λόγῳ ὑψίστου

6 ὁ καταγαγὼν βασιλεῖς εἰς ἀπώλειαν καὶ δεδοξασμένους ἀπὸ κλίνης αὐτῶν

7 ἀκούων ἐν Σινα ἐλεγμὸν καὶ ἐν Χωρηβ κρίματα ἐκδικήσεως

8 ὁ χρίων βασιλεῖς εἰς ἀνταπόδομα καὶ προφήτας διαδόχους μετ᾽ αὐτόν

9 ὁ ἀναλημφθεὶς ἐν λαίλαπι πυρὸς ἐν ἅρματι ἵππων πυρίνων

10 ὁ καταγραφεὶς ἐν ἐλεγμοῖς εἰς καιροὺς κοπάσαι ὀργὴν πρὸ θυμοῦ
ἐπιστρέψαι καρδίαν πατρὸς πρὸς υἱὸν καὶ καταστῆσαι φυλὰς Ιακωβ

11 μακάριοι οἱ ἰδόντες σε καὶ οἱ ἐν ἀγαπήσει κεκοιμημένοι καὶ γὰρ ἡμεῖς
ζωῇ ζησόμεθα

12 Ηλιας ὃς ἐν λαίλαπι ἐσκεπάσθη καὶ Ελισαιε ἐνεπλήσθη πνεύματος αὐτοῦ
καὶ ἐν ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐσαλεύθη ὑπὸ ἄρχοντος καὶ οὐ κατεδυνάστευσεν
αὐτὸν οὐδείς

13 πᾶς λόγος οὐχ ὑπερῆρεν αὐτόν καὶ ἐν κοιμήσει ἐπροφήτευσεν τὸ σῶμα
αὐτοῦ

14 καὶ ἐν ζωῇ αὐτοῦ ἐποίησεν τέρατα καὶ ἐν τελευτῇ θαυμάσια τὰ ἔργα
αὐτοῦ

15 ἐν πᾶσιν τούτοις οὐ μετενόησεν ὁ λαὸς καὶ οὐκ ἀπέστησαν ἀπὸ τῶν
ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν ἕως ἐπρονομεύθησαν ἀπὸ γῆς αὐτῶν καὶ διεσκορπίσθησαν ἐν
πάσῃ τῇ γῇ

16 καὶ κατελείφθη ὁ λαὸς ὀλιγοστός καὶ ἄρχων ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Δαυιδ τινὲς μὲν
αὐτῶν ἐποίησαν τὸ ἀρεστόν τινὲς δὲ ἐπλήθυναν ἁμαρτίας

17 Εζεκιας ὠχύρωσεν τὴν πόλιν αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰσήγαγεν εἰς μέσον αὐτῆς ὕδωρ
ὤρυξεν σιδήρῳ ἀκρότομον καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν κρήνας εἰς ὕδατα

18 ἐν ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ ἀνέβη Σενναχηριμ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ραψακην καὶ ἀπῆρεν
καὶ ἐπῆρεν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ Σιων καὶ ἐμεγαλαύχησεν ἐν ὑπερηφανίᾳ αὐτοῦ

19 τότε ἐσαλεύθησαν καρδίαι καὶ χεῖρες αὐτῶν καὶ ὠδίνησαν ὡς αἱ
τίκτουσαι

20 καὶ ἐπεκαλέσαντο τὸν κύριον τὸν ἐλεήμονα ἐκπετάσαντες τὰς χεῖρας
αὐτῶν πρὸς αὐτόν καὶ ὁ ἅγιος ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ταχὺ ἐπήκουσεν αὐτῶν καὶ
ἐλυτρώσατο αὐτοὺς ἐν χειρὶ Ησαιου

21 ἐπάταξεν τὴν παρεμβολὴν τῶν Ἀσσυρίων καὶ ἐξέτριψεν αὐτοὺς ὁ ἄγγελος
αὐτοῦ

22 ἐποίησεν γὰρ Εζεκιας τὸ ἀρεστὸν κυρίῳ καὶ ἐνίσχυσεν ἐν ὁδοῖς Δαυιδ
τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ἃς ἐνετείλατο Ησαιας ὁ προφήτης ὁ μέγας καὶ πιστὸς ἐν
ὁράσει αὐτοῦ

23 ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ ἀνεπόδισεν ὁ ἥλιος καὶ προσέθηκεν ζωὴν βασιλεῖ

24 πνεύματι μεγάλῳ εἶδεν τὰ ἔσχατα καὶ παρεκάλεσεν τοὺς πενθοῦντας ἐν
Σιων

25 ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος ὑπέδειξεν τὰ ἐσόμενα καὶ τὰ ἀπόκρυφα πρὶν ἢ
παραγενέσθαι αὐτά

[Vul](../vul/sir048.md)

1 \[Et surrexit Elias propheta quasi ignis,  
et verbum ipsius quasi facula ardebat.  

2 Qui induxit in illos famem:  
et irritantes illum invidia sua pauci facti sunt:  
non enim poterant sustinere præcepta Domini.  

3 Verbo Domini continuit cælum,  
et dejecit de cælo ignem ter.  

4 Sic amplificatus est Elias in mirabilibus suis.  
Et quis potest similiter sic gloriari tibi?  

5 qui sustulisti mortuum ab inferis de sorte mortis,  
in verbo Domini Dei:  

6 qui dejecisti reges ad pernicem,  
et confregisti facile potentiam ipsorum,  
et gloriosos de lecto suo:  

7 qui audis in Sina judicium,  
et in Horeb judicia defensionis:  

8 qui ungis reges ad pœnitentiam,  
et prophetas facis successores post te:  

9 qui receptus es in turbine ignis,  
in curru equorum igneorum:  

10 qui scriptus es in judiciis temporum,  
lenire iracundiam Domini,  
conciliare cor patris ad filium,  
et restituere tribus Jacob.  

11 Beati sunt qui te viderunt,  
et in amicitia tua decorati sunt.  

12 Nam nos vita vivimus tantum:  
post mortem autem non erit tale nomen nostrum.\]  

13 \[Elias quidem in turbine tectus est,  
et in Eliseo completus est spiritus ejus:  
in diebus suis non pertimuit principem,  
et potentia nemo vicit illum:  

14 nec superavit illum verbum aliquod,  
et mortuum prophetavit corpus ejus.  

15 In vita sua fecit monstra,  
et in morte mirabilia operatus est.\]  

16 \[In omnibus istis non pœnituit populus,  
et non recesserunt a peccatis suis,  
usque dum ejecti sunt de terra sua,  
et dispersi sunt in omnem terram:  

17 et relicta est gens perpauca,  
et princeps in domo David.  

18 Quidam ipsorum fecerunt quod placeret Deo:  
alii autem multa commiserunt peccata.  

19 Ezechias munivit civitatem suam,  
et induxit in medium ipsius aquam:  
et fodit ferro rupem,  
et ædificavit ad aquam puteum.  

20 In diebus ipsius ascendit Sennacherib,  
et misit Rabsacen, et sustulit manum suam contra illos:  
et extulit manum suam in Sion,  
et superbus factus est potentia sua.  

21 Tunc mota sunt corda et manus ipsorum:  
et doluerunt quasi parturientes mulieres.  

22 Et invocaverunt Dominum misericordem,  
et expandentes manus suas extulerunt ad cælum:  
et Sanctus, Dominus Deus, audivit cito vocem ipsorum.  

23 Non est commemoratus peccatorum illorum,  
neque dedit illos inimicis suis:  
sed purgavit eos in manu Isaiæ sancti prophetæ.  

24 Dejecit castra Assyriorum,  
et contrivit illos angelus Domini:  

25 nam fecit Ezechias quod placuit Deo,  
et fortiter ivit in via David patris sui,  
quam mandavit illi Isaias, propheta magnus,  
et fidelis in conspectu Dei.  

26 In diebus ipsius retro rediit sol,  
et addidit regi vitam.  

27 Spiritu magno vidit ultima,  
et consolatus est lugentes in Sion  
usque in sempiternum.  

28 Ostendit futura,  
et abscondita antequam evenirent.\]
