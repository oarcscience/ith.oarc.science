### Sirach 47

[Apo](../apo/sir047.md)

1 And after him rose up Nathan to prophesy in the time of David.

2 As is the fat taken away from the peace offering, so was David chosen
out of the children of Israel.

3 He played with lions as with kids, and with bears as with lambs.

4 Slew he not a giant, when he was yet but young? and did he not take
away reproach from the people, when he lifted up his hand with the stone
in the sling, and beat down the boasting of Goliath?

5 For he called upon the most high Lord; and he gave him strength in his
right hand to slay that mighty warrior, and set up the horn of his
people.

6 So the people honoured him with ten thousands, and praised him in the
blessings of the Lord, in that he gave him a crown of glory.

7 For he destroyed the enemies on every side, and brought to nought the
Philistines his adversaries, and brake their horn in sunder unto this
day.

8 In all his works he praised the Holy One most high with words of
glory; with his whole heart he sung songs, and loved him that made him.

9 He set singers also before the altar, that by their voices they might
make sweet melody, and daily sing praises in their songs.

10 He beautified their feasts, and set in order the solemn times until
the end, that they might praise his holy name, and that the temple might
sound from morning.

11 The Lord took away his sins, and exalted his horn for ever: he gave
him a covenant of kings, and a throne of glory in Israel.

12 After him rose up a wise son, and for his sake he dwelt at large.

13 Solomon reigned in a peaceable time, and was honoured; for God made
all quiet round about him, that he might build an house in his name, and
prepare his sanctuary for ever.

14 How wise wast thou in thy youth and, as a flood, filled with
understanding!

15 Thy soul covered the whole earth, and thou filledst it with dark
parables.

16 Thy name went far unto the islands; and for thy peace thou wast
beloved.

17 The countries marvelled at thee for thy songs, and proverbs, and
parables, and interpretations.

18 By the name of the Lord God, which is called the Lord God of Israel,
thou didst gather gold as tin and didst multiply silver as lead.

19 Thou didst bow thy loins unto women, and by thy body thou wast
brought into subjection.

20 Thou didst stain thy honour, and pollute thy seed: so that thou
broughtest wrath upon thy children, and wast grieved for thy folly.

21 So the kingdom was divided, and out of Ephraim ruled a rebellious
kingdom.

22 But the Lord will never leave off his mercy, neither shall any of his
works perish, neither will he abolish the posterity of his elect, and
the seed of him that loveth him he will not take away: wherefore he gave
a remnant unto Jacob, and out of him a root unto David.

23 Thus rested Solomon with his fathers, and of his seed he left behind
him Roboam, even the foolishness of the people, and one that had no
understanding, who turned away the people through his counsel. There was
also Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin, and shewed
Ephraim the way of sin:

24 And their sins were multiplied exceedingly, that they were driven out
of the land.

25 For they sought out all wickedness, till the vengeance came upon
them.

1 καὶ μετὰ τοῦτον ἀνέστη Ναθαν προφητεύειν ἐν ἡμέραις Δαυιδ

2 ὥσπερ στέαρ ἀφωρισμένον ἀπὸ σωτηρίου οὕτως Δαυιδ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ

3 ἐν λέουσιν ἔπαιξεν ὡς ἐν ἐρίφοις καὶ ἐν ἄρκοις ὡς ἐν ἄρνασι προβάτων

4 ἐν νεότητι αὐτοῦ οὐχὶ ἀπέκτεινεν γίγαντα καὶ ἐξῆρεν ὀνειδισμὸν ἐκ λαοῦ
ἐν τῷ ἐπᾶραι χεῖρα ἐν λίθῳ σφενδόνης καὶ καταβαλεῖν γαυρίαμα τοῦ Γολιαθ

5 ἐπεκαλέσατο γὰρ κύριον τὸν ὕψιστον καὶ ἔδωκεν ἐν τῇ δεξιᾷ αὐτοῦ κράτος
ἐξᾶραι ἄνθρωπον δυνατὸν ἐν πολέμῳ ἀνυψῶσαι κέρας λαοῦ αὐτοῦ

6 οὕτως ἐν μυριάσιν ἐδόξασαν αὐτὸν καὶ ᾔνεσαν αὐτὸν ἐν εὐλογίαις κυρίου
ἐν τῷ φέρεσθαι αὐτῷ διάδημα δόξης

7 ἐξέτριψεν γὰρ ἐχθροὺς κυκλόθεν καὶ ἐξουδένωσεν Φυλιστιιμ τοὺς
ὑπεναντίους ἕως σήμερον συνέτριψεν αὐτῶν κέρας

8 ἐν παντὶ ἔργῳ αὐτοῦ ἔδωκεν ἐξομολόγησιν ἁγίῳ ὑψίστῳ ῥήματι δόξης ἐν
πάσῃ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ ὕμνησεν καὶ ἠγάπησεν τὸν ποιήσαντα αὐτόν

9 καὶ ἔστησεν ψαλτῳδοὺς κατέναντι τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου καὶ ἐξ ἠχοῦς αὐτῶν
γλυκαίνειν μέλη

10 ἔδωκεν ἐν ἑορταῖς εὐπρέπειαν καὶ ἐκόσμησεν καιροὺς μέχρι συντελείας
ἐν τῷ αἰνεῖν αὐτοὺς τὸ ἅγιον ὄνομα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπὸ πρωίας ἠχεῖν τὸ ἁγίασμα

11 κύριος ἀφεῖλεν τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνύψωσεν εἰς αἰῶνα τὸ κέρας
αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ διαθήκην βασιλέων καὶ θρόνον δόξης ἐν τῷ Ισραηλ

12 μετὰ τοῦτον ἀνέστη υἱὸς ἐπιστήμων καὶ δι᾽ αὐτὸν κατέλυσεν ἐν πλατυσμῷ

13 Σαλωμων ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν ἡμέραις εἰρήνης ᾧ ὁ θεὸς κατέπαυσεν κυκλόθεν
ἵνα στήσῃ οἶκον ἐπ᾽ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ καὶ ἑτοιμάσῃ ἁγίασμα εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα

14 ὡς ἐσοφίσθης ἐν νεότητί σου καὶ ἐνεπλήσθης ὡς ποταμὸς συνέσεως

15 γῆν ἐπεκάλυψεν ἡ ψυχή σου καὶ ἐνέπλησας ἐν παραβολαῖς αἰνιγμάτων

16 εἰς νήσους πόρρω ἀφίκετο τὸ ὄνομά σου καὶ ἠγαπήθης ἐν τῇ εἰρήνῃ σου

17 ἐν ᾠδαῖς καὶ παροιμίαις καὶ παραβολαῖς καὶ ἐν ἑρμηνείαις ἀπεθαύμασάν
σε χῶραι

18 ἐν ὀνόματι κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ ἐπικεκλημένου θεοῦ Ισραηλ συνήγαγες ὡς
κασσίτερον τὸ χρυσίον καὶ ὡς μόλιβον ἐπλήθυνας ἀργύριον

19 παρανέκλινας τὰς λαγόνας σου γυναιξὶν καὶ ἐνεξουσιάσθης ἐν τῷ σώματί
σου

20 ἔδωκας μῶμον ἐν τῇ δόξῃ σου καὶ ἐβεβήλωσας τὸ σπέρμα σου ἐπαγαγεῖν
ὀργὴν ἐπὶ τὰ τέκνα σου καὶ κατανυγῆναι ἐπὶ τῇ ἀφροσύνῃ σου

21 γενέσθαι δίχα τυραννίδα καὶ ἐξ Εφραιμ ἄρξαι βασιλείαν ἀπειθῆ

22 ὁ δὲ κύριος οὐ μὴ καταλίπῃ τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐ μὴ διαφθείρῃ ἀπὸ τῶν
λόγων αὐτοῦ οὐδὲ μὴ ἐξαλείψῃ ἐκλεκτοῦ αὐτοῦ ἔκγονα καὶ σπέρμα τοῦ
ἀγαπήσαντος αὐτὸν οὐ μὴ ἐξάρῃ καὶ τῷ Ιακωβ ἔδωκεν κατάλειμμα καὶ τῷ
Δαυιδ ἐξ αὐτοῦ ῥίζαν

23 καὶ ἀνεπαύσατο Σαλωμων μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ κατέλιπεν μετ᾽
αὐτὸν ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος αὐτοῦ λαοῦ ἀφροσύνην καὶ ἐλασσούμενον συνέσει
Ροβοαμ ὃς ἀπέστησεν λαὸν ἐκ βουλῆς αὐτοῦ

24 καὶ Ιεροβοαμ υἱὸς Ναβατ ὃς ἐξήμαρτεν τὸν Ισραηλ καὶ ἔδωκεν τῷ Εφραιμ
ὁδὸν ἁμαρτίας καὶ ἐπληθύνθησαν αἱ ἁμαρτίαι αὐτῶν σφόδρα ἀποστῆσαι αὐτοὺς
ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς αὐτῶν

25 καὶ πᾶσαν πονηρίαν ἐξεζήτησαν ἕως ἐκδίκησις ἔλθῃ ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς

[Vul](../vul/sir047.md)

1 \[Post hæc surrexit Nathan,  
propheta in diebus David.  

2 Et quasi adeps separatus a carne,  
sic David a filiis Israël.  

3 Cum leonibus lusit quasi cum agnis,  
et in ursis similiter fecit sicut in agnis ovium, in juventute sua.  

4 Numquid non occidit gigantem,  
et abstulit opprobrium de gente?  

5 In tollendo manum,  
saxo fundæ dejecit exsultationem Goliæ:  

6 nam invocavit Dominum omnipotentem,  
et dedit in dextera ejus tollere hominem fortem in bello,  
et exaltare cornu gentis suæ.  

7 Sic in decem millibus glorificavit eum:  
et laudavit eum in benedictionibus Domini,  
in offerendo illi coronam gloriæ:  

8 contrivit enim inimicos undique,  
et extirpavit Philisthiim contrarios usque in hodiernum diem:  
contrivit cornu ipsorum usque in æternum.  

9 In omni opere dedit confessionem Sancto,  
et Excelso in verbo gloriæ.  

10 De omni corde suo laudavit Dominum:  
et dilexit Deum, qui fecit illum,  
et dedit illi contra inimicos potentiam:  

11 et stare fecit cantores contra altare,  
et in sono eorum dulces fecit modos.  

12 Et dedit in celebrationibus decus,  
et ornavit tempora usque ad consummationem vitæ,  
ut laudarent nomen sanctum Domini,  
et amplificarent mane Dei sanctitatem.  

13 Dominus purgavit peccata ipsius,  
et exaltavit in æternum cornu ejus:  
et dedit illi testamentum regni,  
et sedem gloriæ in Israël.\]  

14 \[Post ipsum surrexit filius sensatus,  
et propter illum dejecit omnem potentiam inimicorum.  

15 Salomon imperavit in diebus pacis,  
cui subjecit Deus omnes hostes,  
ut conderet domum in nomine suo,  
et pararet sanctitatem in sempiternum.  
Quemadmodum eruditus es in juventute tua,  

16 et impletus es, quasi flumen, sapientia,  
et terram retexit anima tua.  

17 Et replesti in comparationibus ænigmata:  
ad insulas longe divulgatum est nomen tuum,  
et dilectus es in pace tua.  

18 In cantilenis, et proverbiis,  
et comparationibus, et interpretationibus, miratæ sunt terræ:  

19 et in nomine Domini Dei,  
cui est cognomen Deus Israël.  

20 Collegisti quasi auricalcum aurum,  
et ut plumbum complesti argentum:  

21 et inclinasti femora tua mulieribus:  
potestatem habuisti in corpore tuo.  

22 Dedisti maculam in gloria tua,  
et profanasti semen tuum,  
inducere iracundiam ad liberos tuos,  
et incitari stultitiam tuam:  

23 ut faceres imperium bipartitum,  
et ex Ephraim imperare imperium durum.  

24 Deus autem non derelinquet misericordiam suam:  
et non corrumpet, nec delebit opera sua,  
neque perdet a stirpe nepotes electi sui,  
et semen ejus qui diligit Dominum non corrumpet.  

25 Dedit autem reliquum Jacob,  
et David de ipsa stirpe.  

26 Et finem habuit Salomon cum patribus suis.\]  

27 \[Et dereliquit post se de semine suo, gentis stultitiam,  

28 et imminutum a prudentia, Roboam,  
qui avertit gentem consilio suo:  

29 et Jeroboam filium Nabat, qui peccare fecit Israël,  
et dedit viam peccandi Ephraim:  
et plurima redundaverunt peccata ipsorum.  

30 Valde averterunt illos a terra sua.  

31 Et quæsivit omnes nequitias,  
usque dum perveniret ad illos defensio,  
et ab omnibus peccatis liberavit eos.\]
