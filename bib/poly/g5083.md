G5083  
τηρέω  
tēreō  
*tay-reh‘-o*  
From τηρός teros (a *watch*; perhaps akin to [2334](g2334.md) ; to *guard*
(from *loss* or *injury*, properly by keeping *the* *eye* upon; and thus
differing from [5442](g5442.md) which is properly to *prevent* escaping;
and from [2892](g2892.md) which implies a *fortress* or full military lines
of apparatus), that is, to *note* (a prophecy; figuratively to *fulfil*
a command); by implication to *detain* (in custody; figuratively to
*maintain*); by extension to *withhold* (for personal ends; figuratively
to *keep* *unmarried*): - hold fast, keep (-er), (ob-, pre-, re) serve,
watch.
