G4441  
πυνθάνομαι  
punthanomai  
*poon-than‘-om-ahee*  
Middle voice prolonged from πύθω puthō , a primary word, (which occurs
only as an alternate in certain tenses); to *question*, that is,
*ascertain* by inquiry (as a matter of *information* merely; and thus
differing from [2065](g2065) which properly means a *request* as a
favor; and from [154](g0154) which is strictly a *demand* of something
due; as well as from [2212](g2212) which implies a *search* for
something hidden; and from [1189](g1189) which involves the idea of
urgent *need*); by implication to *learn* (by casual intelligence): -
ask, demand, enquire, understand.
