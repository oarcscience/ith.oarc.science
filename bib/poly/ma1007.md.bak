### 1 Macabees 7

[Apo](../apo/ma1007.md)

1 In the hundred and one and fiftieth year Demetrius the son of Seleucus
departed from Rome, and came up with a few men unto a city of the sea
coast, and reigned there.

2 And as he entered into the palace of his ancestors, so it was, that
his forces had taken Antiochus and Lysias, to bring them unto him.

3 Wherefore, when he knew it, he said, Let me not see their faces.

4 So his host slew them. Now when Demetrius was set upon the throne of
his kingdom,

5 There came unto him all the wicked and ungodly men of Israel, having
Alcimus, who was desirous to be high priest, for their captain:

6 And they accused the people to the king, saying, Judas and his
brethren have slain all thy friends, and driven us out of our own land.

7 Now therefore send some man whom thou trustest, and let him go and see
what havock he hath made among us, and in the king's land, and let him
punish them with all them that aid them.

8 Then the king chose Bacchides, a friend of the king, who ruled beyond
the flood, and was a great man in the kingdom, and faithful to the king,

9 And him he sent with that wicked Alcimus, whom he made high priest,
and commanded that he should take vengeance of the children of Israel.

10 So they departed, and came with a great power into the land of Judea,
where they sent messengers to Judas and his brethren with peaceable
words deceitfully.

11 But they gave no heed to their words; for they saw that they were
come with a great power.

12 Then did there assemble unto Alcimus and Bacchides a company of
scribes, to require justice.

13 Now the Assideans were the first among the children of Israel that
sought peace of them:

14 For said they, One that is a priest of the seed of Aaron is come with
this army, and he will do us no wrong.

15 So he spake unto them, peaceably, and sware unto them, saying, we
will procure the harm neither of you nor your friends.

16 Whereupon they believed him: howbeit he took of them threescore men,
and slew them in one day, according to the words which he wrote,

17 The flesh of thy saints have they cast out, and their blood have they
shed round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.

18 Wherefore the fear and dread of them fell upon all the people, who
said, There is neither truth nor righteousness in them; for they have
broken the covenant and oath that they made.

19 After this, removed Bacchides from Jerusalem, and pitched his tents
in Bezeth, where he sent and took many of the men that had forsaken him,
and certain of the people also, and when he had slain them, he cast them
into the great pit.

20 Then committed he the country to Alcimus, and left with him a power
to aid him: so Bacchides went to the king.

21 But Alcimus contended for the high priesthood.

22 And unto him resorted all such as troubled the people, who, after
they had gotten the land of Juda into their power, did much hurt in
Israel.

23 Now when Judas saw all the mischief that Alcimus and his company had
done among the Israelites, even above the heathen,

24 He went out into all the coasts of Judea round about, and took
vengeance of them that had revolted from him, so that they durst no more
go forth into the country.

25 On the other side, when Alcimus saw that Judas and his company had
gotten the upper hand, and knew that he was not able to abide their
force, he went again to the king, and said all the worst of them that he
could.

26 Then the king sent Nicanor, one of his honourable princes, a man that
bare deadly hate unto Israel, with commandment to destroy the people.

27 So Nicanor came to Jerusalem with a great force; and sent unto Judas
and his brethren deceitfully with friendly words, saying,

28 Let there be no battle between me and you; I will come with a few
men, that I may see you in peace.

29 He came therefore to Judas, and they saluted one another peaceably.
Howbeit the enemies were prepared to take away Judas by violence.

30 Which thing after it was known to Judas, to wit, that he came unto
him with deceit, he was sore afraid of him, and would see his face no
more.

31 Nicanor also, when he saw that his counsel was discovered, went out
to fight against Judas beside Capharsalama:

32 Where there were slain of Nicanor's side about five thousand men, and
the rest fled into the city of David.

33 After this went Nicanor up to mount Sion, and there came out of the
sanctuary certain of the priests and certain of the elders of the
people, to salute him peaceably, and to shew him the burnt sacrifice
that was offered for the king.

34 But he mocked them, and laughed at them, and abused them shamefully,
and spake proudly,

35 And sware in his wrath, saying, Unless Judas and his host be now
delivered into my hands, if ever I come again in safety, I will burn up
this house: and with that he went out in a great rage.

36 Then the priests entered in, and stood before the altar and the
temple, weeping, and saying,

37 Thou, O Lord, didst choose this house to be called by thy name, and
to be a house of prayer and petition for thy people:

38 Be avenged of this man and his host, and let them fall by the sword:
remember their blasphemies, and suffer them not to continue any longer.

39 So Nicanor went out of Jerusalem, and pitched his tents in Bethhoron,
where an host out of Syria met him.

40 But Judas pitched in Adasa with three thousand men, and there he
prayed, saying,

41 O Lord, when they that were sent from the king of the Assyrians
blasphemed, thine angel went out, and smote an hundred fourscore and
five thousand of them.

42 Even so destroy thou this host before us this day, that the rest may
know that he hath spoken blasphemously against thy sanctuary, and judge
thou him according to his wickedness.

43 So the thirteenth day of the month Adar the hosts joined battle: but
Nicanor's host was discomfited, and he himself was first slain in the
battle.

44 Now when Nicanor's host saw that he was slain, they cast away their
weapons, and fled.

45 Then they pursued after them a day's journey, from Adasa unto Gazera,
sounding an alarm after them with their trumpets.

46 Whereupon they came forth out of all the towns of Judea round about,
and closed them in; so that they, turning back upon them that pursued
them, were all slain with the sword, and not one of them was left.

47 Afterwards they took the spoils, and the prey, and smote off Nicanors
head, and his right hand, which he stretched out so proudly, and brought
them away, and hanged them up toward Jerusalem.

48 For this cause the people rejoiced greatly, and they kept that day a
day of great gladness.

49 Moreover they ordained to keep yearly this day, being the thirteenth
of Adar.

50 Thus the land of Juda was in rest a little while.

1 ἔτους ἑνὸς καὶ πεντηκοστοῦ καὶ ἑκατοστοῦ ἐξῆλθεν Δημήτριος ὁ τοῦ
Σελεύκου ἐκ Ῥώμης καὶ ἀνέβη σὺν ἀνδράσιν ὀλίγοις εἰς πόλιν παραθαλασσίαν
καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐκεῖ

2 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἰσεπορεύετο εἰς οἶκον βασιλείας πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ
συνέλαβον αἱ δυνάμεις τὸν Ἀντίοχον καὶ τὸν Λυσίαν ἀγαγεῖν αὐτοὺς αὐτῷ

3 καὶ ἐγνώσθη αὐτῷ τὸ πρᾶγμα καὶ εἶπεν μή μοι δείξητε τὰ πρόσωπα αὐτῶν

4 καὶ ἀπέκτειναν αὐτοὺς αἱ δυνάμεις καὶ ἐκάθισεν Δημήτριος ἐπὶ θρόνου
βασιλείας αὐτοῦ

5 καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντες ἄνδρες ἄνομοι καὶ ἀσεβεῖς ἐξ Ισραηλ καὶ
Ἄλκιμος ἡγεῖτο αὐτῶν βουλόμενος ἱερατεύειν

6 καὶ κατηγόρησαν τοῦ λαοῦ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα λέγοντες ἀπώλεσεν Ιουδας καὶ
οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ πάντας τοὺς φίλους σου καὶ ἡμᾶς ἐσκόρπισεν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς
ἡμῶν

7 νῦν οὖν ἀπόστειλον ἄνδρα ᾧ πιστεύεις καὶ πορευθεὶς ἰδέτω τὴν
ἐξολέθρευσιν πᾶσαν ἣν ἐποίησεν ἡμῖν καὶ τῇ χώρᾳ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ
κολασάτω αὐτοὺς καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἐπιβοηθοῦντας αὐτοῖς

8 καὶ ἐπέλεξεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸν Βακχίδην τῶν φίλων τοῦ βασιλέως κυριεύοντα
ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ καὶ μέγαν ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ καὶ πιστὸν τῷ βασιλεῖ

9 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτὸν καὶ Ἄλκιμον τὸν ἀσεβῆ καὶ ἔστησεν αὐτῷ τὴν
ἱερωσύνην καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ ποιῆσαι τὴν ἐκδίκησιν ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ισραηλ

10 καὶ ἀπῇρον καὶ ἦλθον μετὰ δυνάμεως πολλῆς εἰς γῆν Ιουδα καὶ
ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους πρὸς Ιουδαν καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ λόγοις
εἰρηνικοῖς μετὰ δόλου

11 καὶ οὐ προσέσχον τοῖς λόγοις αὐτῶν εἶδον γὰρ ὅτι ἦλθαν μετὰ δυνάμεως
πολλῆς

12 καὶ ἐπισυνήχθησαν πρὸς Ἄλκιμον καὶ Βακχίδην συναγωγὴ γραμματέων
ἐκζητῆσαι δίκαια

13 καὶ πρῶτοι οἱ Ασιδαῖοι ἦσαν ἐν υἱοῖς Ισραηλ καὶ ἐπεζήτουν παρ᾽ αὐτῶν
εἰρήνην

14 εἶπον γάρ ἄνθρωπος ἱερεὺς ἐκ σπέρματος Ααρων ἦλθεν ἐν ταῖς δυνάμεσιν
καὶ οὐκ ἀδικήσει ἡμᾶς

15 καὶ ἐλάλησεν μετ᾽ αὐτῶν λόγους εἰρηνικοὺς καὶ ὤμοσεν αὐτοῖς λέγων οὐκ
ἐκζητήσομεν ὑμῖν κακὸν καὶ τοῖς φίλοις ὑμῶν

16 καὶ ἐνεπίστευσαν αὐτῷ καὶ συνέλαβεν ἐξ αὐτῶν ἑξήκοντα ἄνδρας καὶ
ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτοὺς ἐν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ κατὰ τὸν λόγον ὃν ἔγραψεν αὐτόν

17 σάρκας ὁσίων σου καὶ αἷμα αὐτῶν ἐξέχεαν κύκλῳ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ οὐκ ἦν
αὐτοῖς ὁ θάπτων

18 καὶ ἐπέπεσεν αὐτῶν ὁ φόβος καὶ ὁ τρόμος εἰς πάντα τὸν λαόν ὅτι εἶπον
οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἀλήθεια καὶ κρίσις παρέβησαν γὰρ τὴν στάσιν καὶ τὸν
ὅρκον ὃν ὤμοσαν

19 καὶ ἀπῆρεν Βακχίδης ἀπὸ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐν Βηθζαιθ καὶ
ἀπέστειλεν καὶ συνέλαβεν πολλοὺς ἀπὸ τῶν μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ αὐτομολησάντων
ἀνδρῶν καί τινας τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ ἔθυσεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸ φρέαρ τὸ μέγα

20 καὶ κατέστησεν τὴν χώραν τῷ Ἀλκίμῳ καὶ ἀφῆκεν μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ δύναμιν τοῦ
βοηθεῖν αὐτῷ καὶ ἀπῆλθεν Βακχίδης πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα

21 καὶ ἠγωνίσατο Ἄλκιμος περὶ τῆς ἀρχιερωσύνης

22 καὶ συνήχθησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντες οἱ ταράσσοντες τὸν λαὸν αὐτῶν καὶ
κατεκράτησαν γῆν Ιουδα καὶ ἐποίησαν πληγὴν μεγάλην ἐν Ισραηλ

23 καὶ εἶδεν Ιουδας πᾶσαν τὴν κακίαν ἣν ἐποίησεν Ἄλκιμος καὶ οἱ μετ᾽
αὐτοῦ ἐν υἱοῖς Ισραηλ ὑπὲρ τὰ ἔθνη

24 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς πάντα τὰ ὅρια τῆς Ιουδαίας κυκλόθεν καὶ ἐποίησεν
ἐκδίκησιν ἐν τοῖς ἀνδράσιν τοῖς αὐτομολήσασιν καὶ ἀνεστάλησαν τοῦ
ἐκπορεύεσθαι εἰς τὴν χώραν

25 ὡς δὲ εἶδεν Ἄλκιμος ὅτι ἐνίσχυσεν Ιουδας καὶ οἱ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔγνω
ὅτι οὐ δύναται ὑποστῆναι αὐτούς καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα καὶ
κατηγόρησεν αὐτῶν πονηρά

26 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Νικάνορα ἕνα τῶν ἀρχόντων αὐτοῦ τῶν ἐνδόξων
καὶ μισοῦντα καὶ ἐχθραίνοντα τῷ Ισραηλ καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ ἐξᾶραι τὸν
λαόν

27 καὶ ἦλθεν Νικάνωρ εἰς Ιερουσαλημ δυνάμει πολλῇ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν πρὸς
Ιουδαν καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ μετὰ δόλου λόγοις εἰρηνικοῖς λέγων

28 μὴ ἔστω μάχη ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ ὑμῶν ἥξω ἐν ἀνδράσιν ὀλίγοις ἵνα ἴδω
ὑμῶν τὰ πρόσωπα μετ᾽ εἰρήνης

29 καὶ ἦλθεν πρὸς Ιουδαν καὶ ἠσπάσαντο ἀλλήλους εἰρηνικῶς καὶ οἱ
πολέμιοι ἕτοιμοι ἦσαν ἐξαρπάσαι τὸν Ιουδαν

30 καὶ ἐγνώσθη ὁ λόγος τῷ Ιουδα ὅτι μετὰ δόλου ἦλθεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτόν καὶ
ἐπτοήθη ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἐβουλήθη ἔτι ἰδεῖν τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ

31 καὶ ἔγνω Νικάνωρ ὅτι ἀπεκαλύφθη ἡ βουλὴ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς
συνάντησιν τῷ Ιουδα ἐν πολέμῳ κατὰ Χαφαρσαλαμα

32 καὶ ἔπεσον τῶν παρὰ Νικάνορος ὡσεὶ πεντακόσιοι ἄνδρες καὶ ἔφυγον εἰς
τὴν πόλιν Δαυιδ

33 καὶ μετὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους ἀνέβη Νικάνωρ εἰς ὄρος Σιων καὶ ἐξῆλθον
ἀπὸ τῶν ἱερέων ἐκ τῶν ἁγίων καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων τοῦ λαοῦ ἀσπάσασθαι
αὐτὸν εἰρηνικῶς καὶ δεῖξαι αὐτῷ τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν τὴν προσφερομένην ὑπὲρ
τοῦ βασιλέως

34 καὶ ἐμυκτήρισεν αὐτοὺς καὶ κατεγέλασεν αὐτῶν καὶ ἐμίανεν αὐτοὺς καὶ
ἐλάλησεν ὑπερηφάνως

35 καὶ ὤμοσεν μετὰ θυμοῦ λέγων ἐὰν μὴ παραδοθῇ Ιουδας καὶ ἡ παρεμβολὴ
αὐτοῦ εἰς χεῖράς μου τὸ νῦν καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν ἐπιστρέψω ἐν εἰρήνῃ ἐμπυριῶ
τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον καὶ ἐξῆλθεν μετὰ θυμοῦ μεγάλου

36 καὶ εἰσῆλθον οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ ἔστησαν κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου καὶ
τοῦ ναοῦ καὶ ἔκλαυσαν καὶ εἶπον

37 σὺ ἐξελέξω τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον ἐπικληθῆναι τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῦ εἶναι
οἶκον προσευχῆς καὶ δεήσεως τῷ λαῷ σου

38 ποίησον ἐκδίκησιν ἐν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τούτῳ καὶ ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ αὐτοῦ καὶ
πεσέτωσαν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ μνήσθητι τῶν δυσφημιῶν αὐτῶν καὶ μὴ δῷς αὐτοῖς
μονήν

39 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Νικάνωρ ἐξ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐν Βαιθωρων καὶ
συνήντησεν αὐτῷ δύναμις Συρίας

40 καὶ Ιουδας παρενέβαλεν ἐν Αδασα ἐν τρισχιλίοις ἀνδράσιν καὶ
προσηύξατο Ιουδας καὶ εἶπεν

41 οἱ παρὰ τοῦ βασιλέως ὅτε ἐδυσφήμησαν ἐξῆλθεν ὁ ἄγγελός σου καὶ
ἐπάταξεν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἑκατὸν ὀγδοήκοντα πέντε χιλιάδας

42 οὕτως σύντριψον τὴν παρεμβολὴν ταύτην ἐνώπιον ἡμῶν σήμερον καὶ
γνώτωσαν οἱ ἐπίλοιποι ὅτι κακῶς ἐλάλησεν ἐπὶ τὰ ἅγιά σου καὶ κρῖνον
αὐτὸν κατὰ τὴν κακίαν αὐτοῦ

43 καὶ συνῆψαν αἱ παρεμβολαὶ εἰς πόλεμον τῇ τρισκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ μηνὸς Αδαρ
καὶ συνετρίβη ἡ παρεμβολὴ Νικάνορος καὶ ἔπεσεν αὐτὸς πρῶτος ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ

44 ὡς δὲ εἶδεν ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἔπεσεν Νικάνωρ ῥίψαντες τὰ ὅπλα
ἔφυγον

45 καὶ κατεδίωκον αὐτοὺς ὁδὸν ἡμέρας μιᾶς ἀπὸ Αδασα ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν εἰς
Γαζηρα καὶ ἐσάλπιζον ὀπίσω αὐτῶν ταῖς σάλπιγξιν τῶν σημασιῶν

46 καὶ ἐξῆλθον ἐκ πασῶν τῶν κωμῶν τῆς Ιουδαίας κυκλόθεν καὶ ὑπερεκέρων
αὐτούς καὶ ἀπέστρεφον οὗτοι πρὸς τούτους καὶ ἔπεσον πάντες ῥομφαίᾳ καὶ
οὐ κατελείφθη ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐδὲ εἷς

47 καὶ ἔλαβον τὰ σκῦλα καὶ τὴν προνομήν καὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Νικάνορος
ἀφεῖλον καὶ τὴν δεξιὰν αὐτοῦ ἣν ἐξέτεινεν ὑπερηφάνως καὶ ἤνεγκαν καὶ
ἐξέτειναν παρὰ τῇ Ιερουσαλημ

48 καὶ ηὐφράνθη ὁ λαὸς σφόδρα καὶ ἤγαγον τὴν ἡμέραν ἐκείνην ἡμέραν
εὐφροσύνης μεγάλην

49 καὶ ἔστησαν τοῦ ἄγειν κατ᾽ ἐνιαυτὸν τὴν ἡμέραν ταύτην τῇ
τρισκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ Αδαρ

50 καὶ ἡσύχασεν ἡ γῆ Ιουδα ἡμέρας ὀλίγας

[Vul](../vul/ma1007.md)

1 Anno centesimo quinquagesimo primo, exiit Demetrius Seleuci filius ab
urbe Roma, et ascendit cum paucis viris in civitatem maritimam, et
regnavit illic.

2 Et factum est, ut ingressus est domum regni patrum suorum,
comprehendit exercitus Antiochum et Lysiam, ut adducerent eos ad eum.

3 Et res ei innotuit, et ait: Nolite mihi ostendere faciem eorum.

4 Et occidit eos exercitus. Et sedit Demetrius super sedem regni sui.  

5 Et venerunt ad eum viri iniqui et impii ex Israël: et Alcimus dux
eorum, qui volebat fieri sacerdos.

6 Et accusaverunt populum apud regem, dicentes: Perdidit Judas et
fratres ejus omnes amicos tuos, et nos dispersit de terra nostra.

7 Nunc ergo mitte virum, cui credis, ut eat, et videat exterminium omne
quod fecit nobis, et regionibus regis: et puniat omnes amicos ejus, et
adjutores eorum.

8 Et elegit rex ex amicis suis Bacchidem, qui dominabatur trans flumen
magnum in regno, et fidelem regi: et misit eum,

9 ut videret exterminium quod fecit Judas: sed et Alcimum impium
constituit in sacerdotium, et mandavit ei facere ultionem in filios
Israël.

10 Et surrexerunt, et venerunt cum exercitu magno in terram Juda: et
miserunt nuntios, et locuti sunt ad Judam et ad fratres ejus verbis
pacificis in dolo.

11 Et non intenderunt sermonibus eorum: viderunt enim quia venerunt cum
exercitu magno.

12 Et convenerunt ad Alcimum et Bacchidem congregatio scribarum
requirere quæ justa sunt:

13 et primi, Assidæi qui erant in filiis Israël: et exquirebant ab eis
pacem.

14 Dixerunt enim: Homo sacerdos de semine Aaron venit; non decipiet nos:

15 et locutus est cum eis verba pacifica, et juravit illis, dicens: Non
inferemus vobis malum, neque amicis vestris.

16 Et crediderunt ei: et comprehendit ex eis sexaginta viros, et occidit
eos in una die, secundum verbum quod scriptum est:

17 Carnes sanctorum tuorum, et sanguinem ipsorum effuderunt in circuitu
Jerusalem, et non erat qui sepeliret.

18 Et incubuit timor et tremor in omnem populum: quia dixerunt: Non est
veritas, et judicium in eis: transgressi sunt enim constitutum, et
jusjurandum quod juraverunt.

19 Et movit Bacchides castra ab Jerusalem, et applicuit in Bethzecha: et
misit, et comprehendit multos ex eis qui a se effugerant: et quosdam de
populo mactavit, et in puteum magnum projecit.  

20 Et commisit regionem Alcimo, et reliquit cum eo auxilium in
adjutorium ipsi. Et abiit Bacchides ad regem:

21 et satis agebat Alcimus pro principatu sacerdotii sui:

22 et convenerunt ad eum omnes, qui perturbabant populum suum, et
obtinuerunt terram Juda, et fecerunt plagam magnam in Israël.

23 Et vidit Judas omnia mala quæ fecit Alcimus et qui cum eo erant
filiis Israël, multo plus quam gentes:

24 et exiit in omnes fines Judææ in circuitu, et fecit vindictam in
viros desertores, et cessaverunt ultra exire in regionem.  

25 Vidit autem Alcimus quod prævaluit Judas et qui cum eo erant, et
cognovit quia non potest sustinere eos: et regressus est ad regem, et
accusavit eos multis criminibus.

26 Et misit rex Nicanorem, unum ex principibus suis nobilioribus, qui
erat inimicitias exercens contra Israël: et mandavit ei evertere
populum.

27 Et venit Nicanor in Jerusalem cum exercitu magno, et misit ad Judam
et ad fratres ejus verbis pacificis cum dolo,

28 dicens: Non sit pugna inter me et vos: veniam cum viris paucis, ut
videam facies vestras cum pace.

29 Et venit ad Judam, et salutaverunt se invicem pacifice: et hostes
parati erant rapere Judam.

30 Et innotuit sermo Judæ quoniam cum dolo venerat ad eum: et
conterritus est ab eo, et amplius noluit videre faciem ejus.

31 Et cognovit Nicanor quoniam denudatum est consilium ejus: et exivit
obviam Judæ in pugnam juxta Capharsalama.

32 Et ceciderunt de Nicanoris exercitu fere quinque millia viri, et
fugerunt in civitatem David.

33 Et post hæc verba ascendit Nicanor in montem Sion: et exierunt de
sacerdotibus populi salutare eum in pace, et demonstrare ei
holocautomata, quæ offerebantur pro rege.

34 Et irridens sprevit eos, et polluit: et locutus est superbe,

35 et juravit cum ira, dicens: Nisi traditus fuerit Judas et exercitus
ejus in manus meas, continuo cum regressus fuero in pace, succendam
domum istam. Et exiit cum ira magna.

36 Et intraverunt sacerdotes, et steterunt ante faciem altaris et
templi, et flentes dixerunt:

37 Tu, Domine, elegisti domum istam ad invocandum nomen tuum in ea, ut
esset domus orationis et obsecrationis populo tuo:

38 fac vindictam in homine isto et exercitu ejus, et cadant in gladio:
memento blasphemias eorum, et ne dederis eis ut permaneant.

39 Et exiit Nicanor ab Jerusalem, et castra applicuit ad Bethoron: et
occurrit illi exercitus Syriæ.

40 Et Judas applicuit in Adarsa cum tribus millibus viris: et oravit
Judas, et dixit:

41 Qui missi erant a rege Sennacherib, Domine, quia blasphemaverunt te,
exiit angelus, et percussit ex eis centum octoginta quinque millia:

42 sic contere exercitum istum in conspectu nostro hodie: et sciant
ceteri quia male locutus est super sancta tua: et judica illum secundum
malitiam illius.

43 Et commiserunt exercitus prælium tertiadecima die mensis Adar: et
contrita sunt castra Nicanoris, et cecidit ipse primus in prælio.

44 Ut autem vidit exercitus ejus quia cecidisset Nicanor, projecerunt
arma sua, et fugerunt:

45 et persecuti sunt eos viam unius diei ab Adazer usquequo veniatur in
Gazara, et tubis cecinerunt post eos cum significationibus:

46 et exierunt de omnibus castellis Judææ in circuitu, et ventilabant
eos cornibus, et convertebantur iterum ad eos, et ceciderunt omnes
gladio, et non est relictus ex eis nec unus.

47 Et acceperunt spolia eorum in prædam: et caput Nicanoris
amputaverunt, et dexteram ejus, quam extenderat superbe, et attulerunt,
et suspenderunt contra Jerusalem.

48 Et lætatus est populus valde, et egerunt diem illam in lætitia magna.

49 Et constituit agi omnibus annis diem istam tertiadecima die mensis
Adar.

50 Et siluit terra Juda dies paucos.
