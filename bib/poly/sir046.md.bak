### Sirach 46

[Apo](../apo/sir046.md)

1 Jesus the son a Nave was valiant in the wars, and was the successor of
Moses in prophecies, who according to his name was made great for the
saving of the elect of God, and taking vengeance of the enemies that
rose up against them, that he might set Israel in their inheritance.

2 How great glory gat he, when he did lift up his hands, and stretched
out his sword against the cities!

3 Who before him so stood to it? for the Lord himself brought his
enemies unto him.

4 Did not the sun go back by his means? and was not one day as long as
two?

5 He called upon the most high Lord, when the enemies pressed upon him
on every side; and the great Lord heard him.

6 And with hailstones of mighty power he made the battle to fall
violently upon the nations, and in the descent \[of Beth-horon\] he
destroyed them that resisted, that the nations might know all their
strength, because he fought in the sight of the Lord, and he followed
the Mighty One.

7 In the time of Moses also he did a work of mercy, he and Caleb the son
of Jephunne, in that they withstood the congregation, and withheld the
people from sin, and appeased the wicked murmuring.

8 And of six hundred thousand people on foot, they two were preserved to
bring them in to the heritage, even unto the land that floweth with milk
and honey.

9 The Lord gave strength also unto Caleb, which remained with him unto
his old age: so that he entered upon the high places of the land, and
his seed obtained it for an heritage:

10 That all the children of Israel might see that it is good to follow
the Lord.

11 And concerning the judges, every one by name, whose heart went not a
whoring, nor departed from the Lord, let their memory be blessed.

12 Let their bones flourish out of their place, and let the name of them
that were honoured be continued upon their children.

13 Samuel, the prophet of the Lord, beloved of his Lord, established a
kingdom, and anointed princes over his people.

14 By the law of the Lord he judged the congregation, and the Lord had
respect unto Jacob.

15 By his faithfulness he was found a true prophet, and by his word he
was known to be faithful in vision.

16 He called upon the mighty Lord, when his enemies pressed upon him on
every side, when he offered the sucking lamb.

17 And the Lord thundered from heaven, and with a great noise made his
voice to be heard.

18 And he destroyed the rulers of the Tyrians, and all the princes cf
the Philistines.

19 And before his long sleep he made protestations in the sight of the
Lord and his anointed, I have not taken any man's goods, so much as a
shoe: and no man did accuse him.

20 And after his death he prophesied, and shewed the king his end, and
lifted up his voice from the earth in prophecy, to blot out the
wickedness of the people.

1 κραταιὸς ἐν πολέμῳ Ἰησοῦς Ναυη καὶ διάδοχος Μωυσῆ ἐν προφητείαις ὃς
ἐγένετο κατὰ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ μέγας ἐπὶ σωτηρίᾳ ἐκλεκτῶν αὐτοῦ ἐκδικῆσαι
ἐπεγειρομένους ἐχθρούς ὅπως κατακληρονομήσῃ τὸν Ισραηλ

2 ὡς ἐδοξάσθη ἐν τῷ ἐπᾶραι χεῖρας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐκτεῖναι ῥομφαίαν ἐπὶ
πόλεις

3 τίς πρότερος αὐτοῦ οὕτως ἔστη τοὺς γὰρ πολέμους κυρίου αὐτὸς ἐπήγαγεν

4 οὐχὶ ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ ἐνεποδίσθη ὁ ἥλιος καὶ μία ἡμέρα ἐγενήθη πρὸς δύο

5 ἐπεκαλέσατο τὸν ὕψιστον δυνάστην ἐν τῷ θλῖψαι αὐτὸν ἐχθροὺς κυκλόθεν
καὶ ἐπήκουσεν αὐτοῦ μέγας κύριος ἐν λίθοις χαλάζης δυνάμεως κραταιᾶς

6 κατέρραξεν ἐπ᾽ ἔθνος πόλεμον καὶ ἐν καταβάσει ἀπώλεσεν ἀνθεστηκότας
ἵνα γνῶσιν ἔθνη πανοπλίαν αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἐναντίον κυρίου ὁ πόλεμος αὐτοῦ

7 καὶ γὰρ ἐπηκολούθησεν ὀπίσω δυνάστου καὶ ἐν ἡμέραις Μωυσέως ἐποίησεν
ἔλεος αὐτὸς καὶ Χαλεβ υἱὸς Ιεφοννη ἀντιστῆναι ἔναντι ἐκκλησίας κωλῦσαι
λαὸν ἀπὸ ἁμαρτίας καὶ κοπάσαι γογγυσμὸν πονηρίας

8 καὶ αὐτοὶ δύο ὄντες διεσώθησαν ἀπὸ ἑξακοσίων χιλιάδων πεζῶν εἰσαγαγεῖν
αὐτοὺς εἰς κληρονομίαν εἰς γῆν ῥέουσαν γάλα καὶ μέλι

9 καὶ ἔδωκεν ὁ κύριος τῷ Χαλεβ ἰσχύν καὶ ἕως γήρους διέμεινεν αὐτῷ
ἐπιβῆναι αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸ ὕψος τῆς γῆς καὶ τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ κατέσχεν
κληρονομίαν

10 ὅπως ἴδωσιν πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ὅτι καλὸν τὸ πορεύεσθαι ὀπίσω
κυρίου

11 καὶ οἱ κριταί ἕκαστος τῷ αὐτοῦ ὀνόματι ὅσων οὐκ ἐξεπόρνευσεν ἡ καρδία
καὶ ὅσοι οὐκ ἀπεστράφησαν ἀπὸ κυρίου εἴη τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτῶν ἐν
εὐλογίαις

12 τὰ ὀστᾶ αὐτῶν ἀναθάλοι ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὐτῶν καὶ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῶν
ἀντικαταλλασσόμενον ἐφ᾽ υἱοῖς δεδοξασμένων αὐτῶν

13 ἠγαπημένος ὑπὸ κυρίου αὐτοῦ Σαμουηλ προφήτης κυρίου κατέστησεν
βασιλείαν καὶ ἔχρισεν ἄρχοντας ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ

14 ἐν νόμῳ κυρίου ἔκρινεν συναγωγήν καὶ ἐπεσκέψατο κύριος τὸν Ιακωβ

15 ἐν πίστει αὐτοῦ ἠκριβάσθη προφήτης καὶ ἐγνώσθη ἐν ῥήμασιν αὐτοῦ
πιστὸς ὁράσεως

16 καὶ ἐπεκαλέσατο τὸν κύριον δυνάστην ἐν τῷ θλῖψαι ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ
κυκλόθεν ἐν προσφορᾷ ἀρνὸς γαλαθηνοῦ

17 καὶ ἐβρόντησεν ἀπ᾽ οὐρανοῦ ὁ κύριος καὶ ἐν ἤχῳ μεγάλῳ ἀκουστὴν
ἐποίησεν τὴν φωνὴν αὐτοῦ

18 καὶ ἐξέτριψεν ἡγουμένους Τυρίων καὶ πάντας ἄρχοντας Φυλιστιιμ

19 καὶ πρὸ καιροῦ κοιμήσεως αἰῶνος ἐπεμαρτύρατο ἔναντι κυρίου καὶ
χριστοῦ αὐτοῦ χρήματα καὶ ἕως ὑποδημάτων ἀπὸ πάσης σαρκὸς οὐκ εἴληφα καὶ
οὐκ ἐνεκάλεσεν αὐτῷ ἄνθρωπος

20 καὶ μετὰ τὸ ὑπνῶσαι αὐτὸν προεφήτευσεν καὶ ὑπέδειξεν βασιλεῖ τὴν
τελευτὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνύψωσεν ἐκ γῆς τὴν φωνὴν αὐτοῦ ἐν προφητείᾳ
ἐξαλεῖψαι ἀνομίαν λαοῦ

[Vul](../vul/sir046.md)

1 \[Fortis in bello Jesus Nave, successor Moysi in prophetis,  
qui fuit magnus secundum nomen suum,  

2 maximus in salutem electorum Dei,  
expugnare insurgentes hostes,  
ut consequeretur hæreditatem Israël.  

3 Quam gloriam adeptus est in tollendo manus suas,  
et jactando contra civitates rhomphæas!  

4 Quis ante illum sic restitit?  
nam hostes ipse Dominus perduxit.  

5 An non in iracundia ejus impeditus est sol,  
et una dies facta est quasi duo?  

6 Invocavit Altissimum potentem,  
in oppugnando inimicos undique:  
et audivit illum magnus et sanctus Deus,  
in saxis grandinis virtutis valde fortis.  

7 Impetum fecit contra gentem hostilem,  
et in descensu perdidit contrarios:  

8 ut cognoscant gentes potentiam ejus,  
quia contra Deum pugnare non est facile.  
Et secutus est a tergo potentis:  

9 et in diebus Moysi misericordiam fecit,  
ipse, et Caleb filius Jephone,  
stare contra hostem, et prohibere gentem a peccatis,  
et perfringere murmur malitiæ.  

10 Et ipsi duo constituti a periculo liberati sunt  
a numero sexcentorum millium peditum,  
inducere illos in hæreditatem,  
in terram quæ manat lac et mel.  

11 Et dedit Dominus ipsi Caleb fortitudinem,  
et usque in senectutem permansit illi virtus,  
ut ascenderet in excelsum terræ locum,  
et semen ipsius obtinuit hæreditatem,  

12 ut viderent omnes filii Israël  
quia bonum est obsequi sancto Deo.\]  

13 \[Et judices singuli suo nomine, quorum non est corruptum cor,  
qui non aversi sunt a Domino,  

14 ut sit memoria illorum in benedictione,  
et ossa eorum pullulent de loco suo:  

15 et nomen eorum permaneat in æternum,  
permanens ad filios illorum, sanctorum virorum gloria.\]  

16 \[Dilectus a Domino Deo suo Samuel, propheta Domini,  
renovavit imperium,  
et unxit principes in gente sua.  

17 In lege Domini congregationem judicavit,  
et vidit Deus Jacob:  
et in fide sua probatus est propheta,  

18 et cognitus est in verbis suis fidelis,  
quia vidit Deum lucis.  

19 Et invocavit Dominum omnipotentem,  
in oppugnando hostes circumstantes undique,  
in oblatione agni inviolati.  

20 Et intonuit de cælo Dominus,  
et in sonitu magno auditam fecit vocem suam:  

21 et contrivit principes Tyriorum,  
et omnes duces Philisthiim:  

22 et ante tempus finis vitæ suæ et sæculi,  
testimonium præbuit in conspectu Domini et christi:  
pecunias et usque ad calceamenta ab omni carne non accepit,  
et non accusavit illum homo.  

23 Et post hoc dormivit: et notum fecit regi,  
et ostendit illi finem vitæ suæ:  
et exaltavit vocem suam de terra in prophetia,  
delere impietatem gentis.\]
