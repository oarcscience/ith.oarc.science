G4098  
πίπτω, πέτω  
piptō petō  
*pip‘-to,* *pet‘-o*  
The first is a reduplicated and contracted form of the second (which
occurs only as an alternate in certain tenses); probably akin to
[4072](g4072.md) through the idea of *alighting*; to *fall* (literally of
figuratively): - fail, fall (down), light on.
