### 2 Macabees 9

[Apo](../apo/ma2009.md)

1 About that time came Antiochus with dishonour out of the country of
Persia

2 For he had entered the city called Persepolis, and went about to rob
the temple, and to hold the city; whereupon the multitude running to
defend themselves with their weapons put them to flight; and so it
happened, that Antiochus being put to flight of the inhabitants returned
with shame.

3 Now when he came to Ecbatane, news was brought him what had happened
unto Nicanor and Timotheus.

4 Then swelling with anger. he thought to avenge upon the Jews the
disgrace done unto him by those that made him flee. Therefore commanded
he his chariotman to drive without ceasing, and to dispatch the journey,
the judgment of GOd now following him. For he had spoken proudly in this
sort, That he would come to Jerusalem and make it a common burying place
of the Jews.

5 But the Lord Almighty, the God of Isreal, smote him with an incurable
and invisible plague: or as soon as he had spoken these words, a pain of
the bowels that was remediless came upon him, and sore torments of the
inner parts;

6 And that most justly: for he had tormented other men's bowels with
many and strange torments.

7 Howbeit he nothing at all ceased from his bragging, but still was
filled with pride, breathing out fire in his rage against the Jews, and
commanding to haste the journey: but it came to pass that he fell down
from his chariot, carried violently; so that having a sore fall, all the
members of his body were much pained.

8 And thus he that a little afore thought he might command the waves of
the sea, (so proud was he beyond the condition of man) and weigh the
high mountains in a balance, was now cast on the ground, and carried in
an horselitter, shewing forth unto all the manifest power of God.

9 So that the worms rose up out of the body of this wicked man, and
whiles he lived in sorrow and pain, his flesh fell away, and the
filthiness of his smell was noisome to all his army.

10 And the man, that thought a little afore he could reach to the stars
of heaven, no man could endure to carry for his intolerable stink.

11 Here therefore, being plagued, he began to leave off his great pride,
and to come to the knowledge of himself by the scourge of God, his pain
increasing every moment.

12 And when he himself could not abide his own smell, he said these
words, It is meet to be subject unto God, and that a man that is mortal
should not proudly think of himself if he were God.

13 This wicked person vowed also unto the Lord, who now no more would
have mercy upon him, saying thus,

14 That the holy city (to the which he was going in haste to lay it even
with the ground, and to make it a common buryingplace,) he would set at
liberty:

15 And as touching the Jews, whom he had judged not worthy so much as to
be buried, but to be cast out with their children to be devoured of the
fowls and wild beasts, he would make them all equals to the citizens of
Athens:

16 And the holy temple, which before he had spoiled, he would garnish
with goodly gifts, and restore all the holy vessels with many more, and
out of his own revenue defray the charges belonging to the sacrifices:

17 Yea, and that also he would become a Jew himself, and go through all
the world that was inhabited, and declare the power of God.

18 But for all this his pains would not cease: for the just judgment of
God was come upon him: therefore despairing of his health, he wrote unto
the Jews the letter underwritten, containing the form of a supplication,
after this manner:

19 Antiochus, king and governor, to the good Jews his citizens wisheth
much joy, health, and prosperity:

20 If ye and your children fare well, and your affairs be to your
contentment, I give very great thanks to God, having my hope in heaven.

21 As for me, I was weak, or else I would have remembered kindly your
honour and good will returning out of Persia, and being taken with a
grievous disease, I thought it necessary to care for the common safety
of all:

22 Not distrusting mine health, but having great hope to escape this
sickness.

23 But considering that even my father, at what time he led an army into
the high countries. appointed a successor,

24 To the end that, if any thing fell out contrary to expectation, or if
any tidings were brought that were grievous, they of the land, knowing
to whom the state was left, might not be troubled:

25 Again, considering how that the princes that are borderers and
neighbours unto my kingdom wait for opportunities, and expect what shall
be the event. I have appointed my son Antiochus king, whom I often
committed and commended unto many of you, when I went up into the high
provinces; to whom I have written as followeth:

26 Therefore I pray and request you to remember the benefits that I have
done unto you generally, and in special, and that every man will be
still faithful to me and my son.

27 For I am persuaded that he understanding my mind will favourably and
graciously yield to your desires.

28 Thus the murderer and blasphemer having suffered most grievously, as
he entreated other men, so died he a miserable death in a strange
country in the mountains.

29 And Philip, that was brought up with him, carried away his body, who
also fearing the son of Antiochus went into Egypt to Ptolemeus
Philometor.

1 περὶ δὲ τὸν καιρὸν ἐκεῖνον ἐτύγχανεν Ἀντίοχος ἀναλελυκὼς ἀκόσμως ἐκ
τῶν περὶ τὴν Περσίδα τόπων

2 εἰσεληλύθει γὰρ εἰς τὴν λεγομένην Περσέπολιν καὶ ἐπεχείρησεν
ἱεροσυλεῖν καὶ τὴν πόλιν συνέχειν διὸ δὴ τῶν πληθῶν ὁρμησάντων ἐπὶ τὴν
τῶν ὅπλων βοήθειαν ἐτράπησαν καὶ συνέβη τροπωθέντα τὸν Ἀντίοχον ὑπὸ τῶν
ἐγχωρίων ἀσχήμονα τὴν ἀναζυγὴν ποιήσασθαι

3 ὄντι δὲ αὐτῷ κατ᾽ Ἐκβάτανα προσέπεσεν τὰ κατὰ Νικάνορα καὶ τοὺς περὶ
Τιμόθεον γεγονότα

4 ἐπαρθεὶς δὲ τῷ θυμῷ ᾤετο καὶ τὴν τῶν πεφυγαδευκότων αὐτὸν κακίαν εἰς
τοὺς Ιουδαίους ἐναπερείσασθαι διὸ συνέταξεν τὸν ἁρματηλάτην ἀδιαλείπτως
ἐλαύνοντα κατανύειν τὴν πορείαν τῆς ἐξ οὐρανοῦ δὴ κρίσεως συνούσης αὐτῷ
οὕτως γὰρ ὑπερηφάνως εἶπεν πολυάνδριον Ιουδαίων Ιεροσόλυμα ποιήσω
παραγενόμενος ἐκεῖ

5 ὁ δὲ παντεπόπτης κύριος ὁ θεὸς τοῦ Ισραηλ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν ἀνιάτῳ καὶ
ἀοράτῳ πληγῇ ἄρτι δὲ αὐτοῦ καταλήξαντος τὸν λόγον ἔλαβεν αὐτὸν ἀνήκεστος
τῶν σπλάγχνων ἀλγηδὼν καὶ πικραὶ τῶν ἔνδον βάσανοι

6 πάνυ δικαίως τὸν πολλαῖς καὶ ξενιζούσαις συμφοραῖς ἑτέρων σπλάγχνα
βασανίσαντα

7 ὁ δ᾽ οὐδαμῶς τῆς ἀγερωχίας ἔληγεν ἔτι δὲ καὶ τῆς ὑπερηφανίας
ἐπεπλήρωτο πῦρ πνέων τοῖς θυμοῖς ἐπὶ τοὺς Ιουδαίους καὶ κελεύων
ἐποξύνειν τὴν πορείαν συνέβη δὲ καὶ πεσεῖν αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἅρματος
φερομένου ῥοίζῳ καὶ δυσχερεῖ πτώματι περιπεσόντα πάντα τὰ μέλη τοῦ
σώματος ἀποστρεβλοῦσθαι

8 ὁ δ᾽ ἄρτι δοκῶν τοῖς τῆς θαλάσσης κύμασιν ἐπιτάσσειν διὰ τὴν ὑπὲρ
ἄνθρωπον ἀλαζονείαν καὶ πλάστιγγι τὰ τῶν ὀρέων οἰόμενος ὕψη στήσειν κατὰ
γῆν γενόμενος ἐν φορείῳ παρεκομίζετο φανερὰν τοῦ θεοῦ πᾶσιν τὴν δύναμιν
ἐνδεικνύμενος

9 ὥστε καὶ ἐκ τοῦ σώματος τοῦ δυσσεβοῦς σκώληκας ἀναζεῖν καὶ ζῶντος ἐν
ὀδύναις καὶ ἀλγηδόσιν τὰς σάρκας αὐτοῦ διαπίπτειν ὑπὸ δὲ τῆς ὀσμῆς αὐτοῦ
πᾶν τὸ στρατόπεδον βαρύνεσθαι τὴν σαπρίαν

10 καὶ τὸν μικρῷ πρότερον τῶν οὐρανίων ἄστρων ἅπτεσθαι δοκοῦντα
παρακομίζειν οὐδεὶς ἐδύνατο διὰ τὸ τῆς ὀσμῆς ἀφόρητον βάρος

11 ἐνταῦθα οὖν ἤρξατο τὸ πολὺ τῆς ὑπερηφανίας λήγειν τεθραυσμένος καὶ
εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν ἔρχεσθαι θείᾳ μάστιγι κατὰ στιγμὴν ἐπιτεινόμενος ταῖς
ἀλγηδόσιν

12 καὶ μηδὲ τῆς ὀσμῆς αὐτοῦ δυνάμενος ἀνέχεσθαι ταῦτ᾽ ἔφη δίκαιον
ὑποτάσσεσθαι τῷ θεῷ καὶ μὴ θνητὸν ὄντα ἰσόθεα φρονεῖν

13 ηὔχετο δὲ ὁ μιαρὸς πρὸς τὸν οὐκέτι αὐτὸν ἐλεήσοντα δεσπότην οὕτως
λέγων

14 τὴν μὲν ἁγίαν πόλιν ἣν σπεύδων παρεγίνετο ἰσόπεδον ποιῆσαι καὶ
πολυάνδριον οἰκοδομῆσαι ἐλευθέραν ἀναδεῖξαι

15 τοὺς δὲ Ιουδαίους οὓς διεγνώκει μηδὲ ταφῆς ἀξιῶσαι οἰωνοβρώτους δὲ
σὺν τοῖς νηπίοις ἐκρίψειν θηρίοις πάντας αὐτοὺς ἴσους Ἀθηναίοις ποιήσειν

16 ὃν δὲ πρότερον ἐσκύλευσεν ἅγιον νεὼ καλλίστοις ἀναθήμασιν κοσμήσειν
καὶ τὰ ἱερὰ σκεύη πολυπλάσια πάντα ἀποδώσειν τὰς δὲ ἐπιβαλλούσας πρὸς
τὰς θυσίας συντάξεις ἐκ τῶν ἰδίων προσόδων χορηγήσειν

17 πρὸς δὲ τούτοις καὶ Ιουδαῖον ἔσεσθαι καὶ πάντα τόπον οἰκητὸν
ἐπελεύσεσθαι καταγγέλλοντα τὸ τοῦ θεοῦ κράτος

18 οὐδαμῶς δὲ ληγόντων τῶν πόνων ἐπεληλύθει γὰρ ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν δικαία ἡ τοῦ
θεοῦ κρίσις τὰ κατ᾽ αὐτὸν ἀπελπίσας ἔγραψεν πρὸς τοὺς Ιουδαίους τὴν
ὑπογεγραμμένην ἐπιστολὴν ἱκετηρίας τάξιν ἔχουσαν περιέχουσαν δὲ οὕτως

19 τοῖς χρηστοῖς Ιουδαίοις τοῖς πολίταις πολλὰ χαίρειν καὶ ὑγιαίνειν καὶ
εὖ πράττειν βασιλεὺς καὶ στρατηγὸς Ἀντίοχος

20 εἰ ἔρρωσθε καὶ τὰ τέκνα καὶ τὰ ἴδια κατὰ γνώμην ἐστὶν ὑμῖν εἰς
οὐρανὸν τὴν ἐλπίδα ἔχων

21 ὑμῶν τὴν τιμὴν καὶ τὴν εὔνοιαν ἐμνημόνευον φιλοστόργως ἐπανάγων ἐκ
τῶν κατὰ τὴν Περσίδα τόπων καὶ περιπεσὼν ἀσθενείᾳ δυσχέρειαν ἐχούσῃ
ἀναγκαῖον ἡγησάμην φροντίσαι τῆς κοινῆς πάντων ἀσφαλείας

22 οὐκ ἀπογινώσκων τὰ κατ᾽ ἐμαυτόν ἀλλὰ ἔχων πολλὴν ἐλπίδα ἐκφεύξεσθαι
τὴν ἀσθένειαν

23 θεωρῶν δὲ ὅτι καὶ ὁ πατήρ καθ᾽ οὓς καιροὺς εἰς τοὺς ἄνω τόπους
ἐστρατοπέδευσεν ἀνέδειξεν τὸν διαδεξάμενον

24 ὅπως ἐάν τι παράδοξον ἀποβαίνῃ ἢ καὶ προσαγγελθῇ τι δυσχερές εἰδότες
οἱ κατὰ τὴν χώραν ᾧ καταλέλειπται τὰ πράγματα μὴ ἐπιταράσσωνται

25 πρὸς δὲ τούτοις κατανοῶν τοὺς παρακειμένους δυνάστας καὶ γειτνιῶντας
τῇ βασιλείᾳ τοῖς καιροῖς ἐπέχοντας καὶ προσδοκῶντας τὸ ἀποβησόμενον
ἀναδέδειχα τὸν υἱὸν Ἀντίοχον βασιλέα ὃν πολλάκις ἀνατρέχων εἰς τὰς ἐπάνω
σατραπείας τοῖς πλείστοις ὑμῶν παρεκατετιθέμην καὶ συνίστων γέγραφα δὲ
πρὸς αὐτὸν τὰ ὑπογεγραμμένα

26 παρακαλῶ οὖν ὑμᾶς καὶ ἀξιῶ μεμνημένους τῶν εὐεργεσιῶν κοινῇ καὶ κατ᾽
ἰδίαν ἕκαστον συντηρεῖν τὴν οὖσαν εὔνοιαν εἰς ἐμὲ καὶ τὸν υἱόν

27 πέπεισμαι γὰρ αὐτὸν ἐπιεικῶς καὶ φιλανθρώπως παρακολουθοῦντα τῇ ἐμῇ
προαιρέσει συμπεριενεχθήσεσθαι ὑμῖν

28 ὁ μὲν οὖν ἀνδροφόνος καὶ βλάσφημος τὰ χείριστα παθών ὡς ἑτέρους
διέθηκεν ἐπὶ ξένης ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσιν οἰκτίστῳ μόρῳ κατέστρεψεν τὸν βίον

29 παρεκομίζετο δὲ τὸ σῶμα Φίλιππος ὁ σύντροφος αὐτοῦ ὃς καὶ
διευλαβηθεὶς τὸν υἱὸν Ἀντιόχου πρὸς Πτολεμαῖον τὸν Φιλομήτορα εἰς
Αἴγυπτον διεκομίσθη

[Vul](../vul/ma2009.md)

1 Eodem tempore, Antiochus inhoneste revertebatur de Perside.

2 Intraverat enim in eam quæ dicitur Persepolis, et tentavit expoliare
templum, et civitatem opprimere: sed multitudine ad arma concurrente, in
fugam versi sunt: et ita contigit ut Antiochus post fugam turpiter
rediret.

3 Et cum venisset circa Ecbatanam, recognovit quæ erga Nicanorem et
Timotheum gesta sunt.

4 Elatus autem in ira, arbitrabatur se injuriam illorum qui se
fugaverant posse in Judæos retorquere: ideoque jussit agitari currum
suum sine intermissione agens iter, cælesti eum judicio perurgente, eo
quod ita superbe locutus est se venturum Jerosolymam, et congeriem
sepulchri Judæorum eam facturum.

5 Sed qui universa conspicit Dominus Deus Israël, percussit eum
insanabili et invisibili plaga. Ut enim finivit hunc ipsum sermonem,
apprehendit eum dolor dirus viscerum, et amara internorum tormenta:

6 et quidem satis juste, quippe qui multis et novis cruciatibus aliorum
torserat viscera, licet ille nullo modo a sua malitia cessaret.

7 Super hoc autem superbia repletus, ignem spirans animo in Judæos, et
præcipiens accelerari negotium, contigit illum impetu euntem de curru
cadere, et gravi corporis collisione membra vexari.

8 Isque qui sibi videbatur etiam fluctibus maris imperare, supra humanum
modum superbia repletus, et montium altitudines in statera appendere,
nunc humiliatus ad terram in gestatorio portabatur, manifestam Dei
virtutem in semetipso contestans:

9 ita ut de corpore impii vermes scaturirent, ac viventis in doloribus
carnes ejus effluerent, odore etiam illius et fœtore exercitus
gravaretur:

10 et qui paulo ante sidera cæli contingere se arbitrabatur, eum nemo
poterat propter intolerantiam fœtoris portare.  

11 Hinc igitur cœpit ex gravi superbia deductus ad agnitionem sui
venire, divina admonitus plaga, per momenta singula doloribus suis
augmenta capientibus.

12 Et cum nec ipse jam fœtorem suum ferre posset, ita ait: Justum est
subditum esse Deo, et mortalem non paria Deo sentire.

13 Orabat autem hic scelestus Dominum, a quo non esset misericordiam
consecuturus.

14 Et civitatem, ad quam festinans veniebat ut eam ad solum deduceret ac
sepulchrum congestorum faceret, nunc optat liberam reddere:

15 et Judæos, quos nec sepultura quidem se dignos habiturum, sed avibus
ac feris diripiendos traditurum, et cum parvulis exterminaturum dixerat,
æquales nunc Atheniensibus facturum pollicetur:

16 templum etiam sanctum, quod prius expoliaverat, optimis donis
ornaturum, et sancta vasa multiplicaturum, et pertinentes ad sacrificia
sumptus de redditibus suis præstaturum:

17 super hæc, et Judæum se futurum, et omnem locum terræ perambulaturum,
et prædicaturum Dei potestatem.

18 Sed non cessantibus doloribus (supervenerat enim in eum justum Dei
judicium), desperans scripsit ad Judæos in modum deprecationis epistolam
hæc continentem:

19 Optimis civibus Judæis plurimam salutem, et bene valere, et esse
felices, rex et principes Antiochus.

20 Si bene valetis, et filii vestri, et ex sententia vobis cuncta sunt,
maximas agimus gratias.

21 Et ego in infirmitate constitutus, vestri autem memor benigne
reversus de Persidis locis, et infirmitate gravi apprehensus,
necessarium duxi pro communi utilitate curam habere:

22 non desperans memetipsum, sed spem multam habens effugiendi
infirmitatem.

23 Respiciens autem quod et pater meus, quibus temporibus in locis
superioribus ducebat exercitum, ostendit qui post se susciperet
principatum:

24 ut si quid contrarium accideret, aut difficile nuntiaretur, scientes
hi qui in regionibus erant, cui esset rerum summa derelicta, non
turbarentur.

25 Ad hæc, considerans de proximo potentes quosque et vicinos temporibus
insidiantes, et eventum exspectantes, designavi filium meum Antiochum
regem, quem sæpe recurrens in superiora regna multis vestrum
commendabam: et scripsi ad eum quæ subjecta sunt.

26 Ora itaque vos, et peto memores beneficiorum publice et privatim, ut
unusquisque conservet fidem ad me et ad filium meum.

27 Confido enim eum modeste et humane acturum, et sequentem propositum
meum, et communem vobis fore.

28 Igitur homicida et blasphemus pessime percussus, et ut ipse alios
tractaverat, peregre in montibus miserabili obitu vita functus est.

29 Transferebat autem corpus Philippus collactaneus ejus: qui, metuens
filium Antiochi, ad Ptolemæum Philometorem in Ægyptum abiit.
