### Susanna 1

[Apo](../apo/sus001.md)

1 There dwelt a man in Babylon, called Joacim:

2 And he took a wife, whose name was Susanna, the daughter of Chelcias,
a very fair woman, and one that feared the Lord.

3 Her parents also were righteous, and taught their daughter according
to the law of Moses.

4 Now Joacim was a great rich man, and had a fair garden joining unto
his house: and to him resorted the Jews; because he was more honourable
than all others.

5 The same year were appointed two of the ancients of the people to be
judges, such as the Lord spake of, that wickedness came from Babylon
from ancient judges, who seemed to govern the people.

6 These kept much at Joacim's house: and all that had any suits in law
came unto them.

7 Now when the people departed away at noon, Susanna went into her
husband's garden to walk.

8 And the two elders saw her going in every day, and walking; so that
their lust was inflamed toward her.

9 And they perverted their own mind, and turned away their eyes, that
they might not look unto heaven, nor remember just judgments.

10 And albeit they both were wounded with her love, yet durst not one
shew another his grief.

11 For they were ashamed to declare their lust, that they desired to
have to do with her.

12 Yet they watched diligently from day to day to see her.

13 And the one said to the other, Let us now go home: for it is dinner
time.

14 So when they were gone out, they parted the one from the other, and
turning back again they came to the same place; and after that they had
asked one another the cause, they acknowledged their lust: then
appointed they a time both together, when they might find her alone.

15 And it fell out, as they watched a fit time, she went in as before
with two maids only, and she was desirous to wash herself in the garden:
for it was hot.

16 And there was no body there save the two elders, that had hid
themselves, and watched her.

17 Then she said to her maids, Bring me oil and washing balls, and shut
the garden doors, that I may wash me.

18 And they did as she bade them, and shut the garden doors, and went
out themselves at privy doors to fetch the things that she had commanded
them: but they saw not the elders, because they were hid.

19 Now when the maids were gone forth, the two elders rose up, and ran
unto her, saying,

20 Behold, the garden doors are shut, that no man can see us, and we are
in love with thee; therefore consent unto us, and lie with us.

21 If thou wilt not, we will bear witness against thee, that a young man
was with thee: and therefore thou didst send away thy maids from thee.

22 Then Susanna sighed, and said, I am straitened on every side: for if
I do this thing, it is death unto me: and if I do it not I cannot escape
your hands.

23 It is better for me to fall into your hands, and not do it, than to
sin in the sight of the Lord.

24 With that Susanna cried with a loud voice: and the two elders cried
out against her.

25 Then ran the one, and opened the garden door.

26 So when the servants of the house heard the cry in the garden, they
rushed in at the privy door, to see what was done unto her.

27 But when the elders had declared their matter, the servants were
greatly ashamed: for there was never such a report made of Susanna.

28 And it came to pass the next day, when the people were assembled to
her husband Joacim, the two elders came also full of mischievous
imagination against Susanna to put her to death;

29 And said before the people, Send for Susanna, the daughter of
Chelcias, Joacim's wife. And so they sent.

30 So she came with her father and mother, her children, and all her
kindred.

31 Now Susanna was a very delicate woman, and beauteous to behold.

32 And these wicked men commanded to uncover her face, (for she was
covered) that they might be filled with her beauty.

33 Therefore her friends and all that saw her wept.

34 Then the two elders stood up in the midst of the people, and laid
their hands upon her head.

35 And she weeping looked up toward heaven: for her heart trusted in the
Lord.

36 And the elders said, As we walked in the garden alone, this woman
came in with two maids, and shut the garden doors, and sent the maids
away.

37 Then a young man, who there was hid, came unto her, and lay with her.

38 Then we that stood in a corner of the garden, seeing this wickedness,
ran unto them.

39 And when we saw them together, the man we could not hold: for he was
stronger than we, and opened the door, and leaped out.

40 But having taken this woman, we asked who the young man was, but she
would not tell us: these things do we testify.

41 Then the assembly believed them as those that were the elders and
judges of the people: so they condemned her to death.

42 Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and said, O everlasting
God, that knowest the secrets, and knowest all things before they be:

43 Thou knowest that they have borne false witness against me, and,
behold, I must die; whereas I never did such things as these men have
maliciously invented against me.

44 And the Lord heard her voice.

45 Therefore when she was led to be put to death, the Lord raised up the
holy spirit of a young youth whose name was Daniel:

46 Who cried with a loud voice, I am clear from the blood of this woman.

47 Then all the people turned them toward him, and said, What mean these
words that thou hast spoken?

48 So he standing in the midst of them said, Are ye such fools, ye sons
of Israel, that without examination or knowledge of the truth ye have
condemned a daughter of Israel?

49 Return again to the place of judgment: for they have borne false
witness against her.

50 Wherefore all the people turned again in haste, and the elders said
unto him, Come, sit down among us, and shew it us, seeing God hath given
thee the honour of an elder.

51 Then said Daniel unto them, Put these two aside one far from another,
and I will examine them.

52 So when they were put asunder one from another, he called one of
them, and said unto him, O thou that art waxen old in wickedness, now
thy sins which thou hast committed aforetime are come to light.

53 For thou hast pronounced false judgment and hast condemned the
innocent and hast let the guilty go free; albeit the Lord saith, The
innocent and righteous shalt thou not slay.

54 Now then, if thou hast seen her, tell me, Under what tree sawest thou
them companying together? Who answered, Under a mastick tree.

55 And Daniel said, Very well; thou hast lied against thine own head;
for even now the angel of God hath received the sentence of God to cut
thee in two.

56 So he put him aside, and commanded to bring the other, and said unto
him, O thou seed of Chanaan, and not of Juda, beauty hath deceived thee,
and lust hath perverted thine heart.

57 Thus have ye dealt with the daughters of Israel, and they for fear
companied with you: but the daughter of Juda would not abide your
wickedness.

58 Now therefore tell me, Under what tree didst thou take them
companying together? Who answered, Under an holm tree.

59 Then said Daniel unto him, Well; thou hast also lied against thine
own head: for the angel of God waiteth with the sword to cut thee in
two, that he may destroy you.

60 With that all the assembly cried out with a loud voice, and praised
God, who saveth them that trust in him.

61 And they arose against the two elders, for Daniel had convicted them
of false witness by their own mouth:

62 And according to the law of Moses they did unto them in such sort as
they maliciously intended to do to their neighbour: and they put them to
death. Thus the innocent blood was saved the same day.

63 Therefore Chelcias and his wife praised God for their daughter
Susanna, with Joacim her husband, and all the kindred, because there was
no dishonesty found in her.

64 From that day forth was Daniel had in great reputation in the sight
of the people.

6 καὶ ἤρχοντο κρίσεις ἐξ ἄλλων πόλεων πρὸς αὐτούς

7 οὗτοι ἰδόντες γυναῖκα ἀστείαν τῷ εἴδει γυναῖκα ἀδελφοῦ αὐτῶν ἐκ τῶν
υἱῶν Ισραηλ ὄνομα Σουσανναν θυγατέρα Χελκιου γυναῖκα Ιωακιμ περιπατοῦσαν
ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς τὸ δειλινὸν καὶ ἐπιθυμήσαντες αὐτῆς

9 διέστρεψαν τὸν νοῦν αὐτῶν καὶ ἐξέκλιναν τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν τοῦ μὴ
βλέπειν εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν μηδὲ μνημονεύειν κριμάτων δικαίων

10 καὶ ἀμφότεροι ἦσαν κατανενυγμένοι περὶ αὐτῆς καὶ ἕτερος τῷ ἑτέρῳ οὐ
προσεποιεῖτο τὸ κακὸν τὸ ἔχον αὐτοὺς περὶ αὐτῆς οὐδὲ ἡ γυνὴ ἔγνω τὸ
πρᾶγμα τοῦτο

12 καὶ ὡς ἐγίνετο ὄρθρος ἐρχόμενοι ἔκλεπτον ἀλλήλους σπεύδοντες τίς
φανήσεται αὐτῇ πρότερος καὶ λαλήσει πρὸς αὐτήν

13 καὶ ἰδοὺ αὕτη κατὰ τὸ εἰωθὸς περιεπάτει καὶ ὁ εἷς τῶν πρεσβυτέρων
ἐληλύθει καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁ ἕτερος παρεγένετο καὶ εἷς τὸν ἕτερον ἀνέκρινε λέγων
τί σὺ οὕτως ὄρθρου ἐξῆλθες οὐ παραλαβών με καὶ ἐξωμολογήσαντο πρὸς
ἀλλήλους ἑκάτερος τὴν ὀδύνην αὐτοῦ

19 καὶ εἶπεν εἷς τῷ ἑτέρῳ πορευθῶμεν πρὸς αὐτήν καὶ συνθέμενοι
προσήλθοσαν αὐτῇ καὶ ἐξεβιάζοντο αὐτήν

22 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ἡ Ιουδαία οἶδα ὅτι ἐὰν πράξω τοῦτο θάνατός μοί ἐστι
καὶ ἐὰν μὴ πράξω οὐκ ἐκφεύξομαι τὰς χεῖρας ὑμῶν

23 κάλλιον δέ με μὴ πράξασαν ἐμπεσεῖν εἰς τὰς χεῖρας ὑμῶν ἢ ἁμαρτεῖν
ἐνώπιον κυρίου

28 οἱ δὲ παράνομοι ἄνδρες ἀπέστρεψαν ἀπειλοῦντες ἐν ἑαυτοῖς καὶ
ἐνεδρεύοντες ἵνα θανατώσουσιν αὐτήν καὶ ἐλθόντες ἐπὶ τὴν συναγωγὴν τῆς
πόλεως οὗ παρῳκοῦσαν καὶ συνήδρευσαν οἱ ὄντες ἐκεῖ πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ

29 καὶ ἀναστάντες οἱ δύο πρεσβύτεροι καὶ κριταὶ εἶπαν ἀποστείλατε ἐπὶ
Σουσανναν θυγατέρα Χελκιου ἥτις ἐστὶ γυνὴ Ιωακιμ οἱ δὲ εὐθέως ἐκάλεσαν
αὐτήν

30 ὡς δὲ παρεγενήθη ἡ γυνὴ σὺν τῷ πατρὶ ἑαυτῆς καὶ τῇ μητρί καὶ οἱ
παῖδες καὶ αἱ παιδίσκαι αὐτῆς ὄντες τὸν ἀριθμὸν πεντακόσιοι παρεγένοντο
καὶ τὰ παιδία Σουσαννας τέσσαρα

31 ἦν δὲ ἡ γυνὴ τρυφερὰ σφόδρα

32 καὶ προσέταξαν οἱ παράνομοι ἀποκαλύψαι αὐτήν ἵνα ἐμπλησθῶσι κάλλους
ἐπιθυμίας αὐτῆς

33 καὶ ἐκλαίοσαν οἱ παρ᾽ αὐτῆς πάντες καὶ ὅσοι αὐτὴν ᾔδεισαν πάντες

34 ἀναστάντες δὲ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι καὶ κριταὶ ἐπέθηκαν τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν ἐπὶ
τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτῆς

35 ἡ δὲ καρδία αὐτῆς ἐπεποίθει ἐπὶ κυρίῳ τῷ θεῷ αὐτῆς καὶ ἀνακύψασα
ἔκλαυσεν ἐν ἑαυτῇ λέγουσα  
κύριε ὁ θεὸς ὁ αἰώνιος ὁ εἰδὼς τὰ πάντα πρὶν γενέσεως αὐτῶν σὺ οἶδας ὅτι
οὐκ ἐποίησα ἃ πονηρεύονται οἱ ἄνομοι οὗτοι ἐπ᾽ ἐμοί καὶ εἰσήκουσε κύριος
τῆς δεήσεως αὐτῆς

36 οἱ δὲ δύο πρεσβύτεροι εἶπαν ἡμεῖς περιεπατοῦμεν ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ τοῦ
ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς

37 καὶ κυκλοῦντες τὸ στάδιον εἴδομεν ταύτην ἀναπαυομένην μετὰ ἀνδρὸς καὶ
στάντες ἐθεωροῦμεν αὐτοὺς ὁμιλοῦντας ἀλλήλοις

38 καὶ αὐτοὶ οὐκ ᾔδεισαν ὅτι εἱστήκειμεν τότε συνειπάμεθα ἀλλήλοις
λέγοντες μάθωμεν τίνες εἰσὶν οὗτοι

39 καὶ προσελθόντες ἐπέγνωμεν αὐτήν ὁ δὲ νεανίσκος ἔφυγε συγκεκαλυμμένος

40 ταύτης δὲ ἐπιλαβόμενοι ἐπηρωτῶμεν αὐτήν τίς ὁ ἄνθρωπος

41 καὶ οὐκ ἀπήγγειλεν ἡμῖν τίς ἦν ταῦτα μαρτυροῦμεν καὶ ἐπίστευσεν
αὐτοῖς ἡ συναγωγὴ πᾶσα ὡς πρεσβυτέρων ὄντων καὶ κριτῶν τοῦ λαοῦ

44 καὶ ἰδοὺ ἄγγελος κυρίου ἐκείνης ἐξαγομένης ἀπολέσθαι καὶ ἔδωκεν ὁ
ἄγγελος καθὼς προσετάγη πνεῦμα συνέσεως νεωτέρῳ ὄντι Δανιηλ

48 διαστείλας δὲ Δανιηλ τὸν ὄχλον καὶ στὰς ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν εἶπεν οὕτως
μωροί υἱοὶ Ισραηλ οὐκ ἀνακρίναντες οὐδὲ τὸ σαφὲς ἐπιγνόντες ἀπεκρίνατε
θυγατέρα Ισραηλ

51 καὶ νῦν διαχωρίσατέ μοι αὐτοὺς ἀπ᾽ ἀλλήλων μακράν ἵνα ἐτάσω αὐτούς

52 ὡς δὲ διεχωρίσθησαν εἶπεν Δανιηλ τῇ συναγωγῇ νῦν μὴ βλέψητε ὅτι οὗτοί
εἰσι πρεσβύτεροι λέγοντες οὐ μὴ ψεύσωνται ἀλλὰ ἀνακρινῶ αὐτοὺς κατὰ τὰ
ὑποπίπτοντά μοι καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸν ἕνα αὐτῶν καὶ προσήγαγον τὸν πρεσβύτερον
τῷ νεωτέρῳ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Δανιηλ ἄκουε ἄκουε πεπαλαιωμένε ἡμερῶν κακῶν
νῦν ἥκασί σου αἱ ἁμαρτίαι ἃς ἐποίεις τὸ πρότερον

53 πιστευθεὶς ἀκούειν καὶ κρίνειν κρίσεις θάνατον ἐπιφερούσας καὶ τὸν
μὲν ἀθῷον κατέκρινας τοὺς δὲ ἐνόχους ἠφίεις τοῦ κυρίου λέγοντος ἀθῷον
καὶ δίκαιον οὐκ ἀποκτενεῖς

54 νῦν οὖν ὑπὸ τί δένδρον καὶ ποταπῷ τοῦ παραδείσου τόπῳ ἑώρακας αὐτοὺς
ὄντας σὺν ἑαυτοῖς καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἀσεβής ὑπὸ σχῖνον

55 εἶπεν δὲ ὁ νεώτερος ὀρθῶς ἔψευσαι εἰς τὴν σεαυτοῦ ψυχήν ὁ γὰρ ἄγγελος
κυρίου σχίσει σου τὴν ψυχὴν σήμερον

56 καὶ τοῦτον μεταστήσας εἶπε προσαγαγεῖν αὐτῷ τὸν ἕτερον καὶ τούτῳ δὲ
εἶπεν διὰ τί διεστραμμένον τὸ σπέρμα σου ὡς Σιδῶνος καὶ οὐχ ὡς Ιουδα τὸ
κάλλος σε ἠπάτησεν ἡ μιαρὰ ἐπιθυμία

57 καὶ οὕτως ἐποιεῖτε θυγατράσιν Ισραηλ καὶ ἐκεῖναι φοβούμεναι ὡμιλοῦσαν
ὑμῖν ἀλλ᾽ οὐ θυγάτηρ Ιουδα ὑπέμεινε τὴν νόσον ὑμῶν ἐν ἀνομίᾳ ὑπενεγκεῖν

58 νῦν οὖν λέγε μοι ὑπὸ τί δένδρον καὶ ἐν ποίῳ τοῦ κήπου τόπῳ κατέλαβες
αὐτοὺς ὁμιλοῦντας ἀλλήλοις ὁ δὲ εἶπεν ὑπὸ πρῖνον

59 καὶ εἶπεν Δανιηλ ἁμαρτωλέ νῦν ὁ ἄγγελος κυρίου τὴν ῥομφαίαν ἕστηκεν
ἔχων ἕως ὁ λαὸς ἐξολεθρεύσει ὑμᾶς ἵνα καταπρίσῃ σε

60 καὶ πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγὴ ἀνεβόησεν ἐπὶ τῷ νεωτέρῳ ὡς ἐκ τοῦ ἰδίου στόματος
ὁμολόγους αὐτοὺς κατέστησεν ἀμφοτέρους ψευδομάρτυρας καὶ ὡς ὁ νόμος
διαγορεύει ἐποίησαν αὐτοῖς καθὼς ἐπονηρεύσαντο κατὰ τῆς ἀδελφῆς καὶ
ἐφίμωσαν αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐξαγαγόντες ἔρριψαν εἰς φάραγγα τότε ὁ ἄγγελος
κυρίου ἔρριψε πῦρ διὰ μέσου αὐτῶν καὶ ἐσώθη αἷμα ἀναίτιον ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
ἐκείνῃ

63 διὰ τοῦτο οἱ νεώτεροι ἀγαπητοὶ Ιακωβ ἐν τῇ ἁπλότητι αὐτῶν καὶ ἡμεῖς
φυλασσώμεθα εἰς υἱοὺς δυνατοὺς νεωτέρους εὐσεβήσουσι γὰρ νεώτεροι καὶ
ἔσται ἐν αὐτοῖς πνεῦμα ἐπιστήμης καὶ συνέσεως εἰς αἰῶνα αἰῶνος

1 καὶ ἦν ἀνὴρ οἰκῶν ἐν Βαβυλῶνι καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Ιωακιμ

2 καὶ ἔλαβεν γυναῖκα ᾗ ὄνομα Σουσαννα θυγάτηρ Χελκιου καλὴ σφόδρα καὶ
φοβουμένη τὸν κύριον

3 καὶ οἱ γονεῖς αὐτῆς δίκαιοι καὶ ἐδίδαξαν τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτῶν κατὰ τὸν
νόμον Μωυσῆ

4 καὶ ἦν Ιωακιμ πλούσιος σφόδρα καὶ ἦν αὐτῷ παράδεισος γειτνιῶν τῷ οἴκῳ
αὐτοῦ καὶ πρὸς αὐτὸν προσήγοντο οἱ Ιουδαῖοι διὰ τὸ εἶναι αὐτὸν
ἐνδοξότερον πάντων

5 καὶ ἀπεδείχθησαν δύο πρεσβύτεροι ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ κριταὶ ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ
ἐκείνῳ περὶ ὧν ἐλάλησεν ὁ δεσπότης ὅτι ἐξῆλθεν ἀνομία ἐκ Βαβυλῶνος ἐκ
πρεσβυτέρων κριτῶν οἳ ἐδόκουν κυβερνᾶν τὸν λαόν

6 οὗτοι προσεκαρτέρουν ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ Ιωακιμ καὶ ἤρχοντο πρὸς αὐτοὺς πάντες
οἱ κρινόμενοι

7 καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα ἀπέτρεχεν ὁ λαὸς μέσον ἡμέρας εἰσεπορεύετο Σουσαννα
καὶ περιεπάτει ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς

8 καὶ ἐθεώρουν αὐτὴν οἱ δύο πρεσβύτεροι καθ᾽ ἡμέραν εἰσπορευομένην καὶ
περιπατοῦσαν καὶ ἐγένοντο ἐν ἐπιθυμίᾳ αὐτῆς

9 καὶ διέστρεψαν τὸν ἑαυτῶν νοῦν καὶ ἐξέκλιναν τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν τοῦ
μὴ βλέπειν εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν μηδὲ μνημονεύειν κριμάτων δικαίων

10 καὶ ἦσαν ἀμφότεροι κατανενυγμένοι περὶ αὐτῆς καὶ οὐκ ἀνήγγειλαν
ἀλλήλοις τὴν ὀδύνην αὐτῶν

11 ὅτι ᾐσχύνοντο ἀναγγεῖλαι τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν αὐτῶν ὅτι ἤθελον συγγενέσθαι
αὐτῇ

12 καὶ παρετηροῦσαν φιλοτίμως καθ᾽ ἡμέραν ὁρᾶν αὐτήν

13 καὶ εἶπαν ἕτερος τῷ ἑτέρῳ πορευθῶμεν δὴ εἰς οἶκον ὅτι ἀρίστου ὥρα
ἐστίν καὶ ἐξελθόντες διεχωρίσθησαν ἀπ᾽ ἀλλήλων

14 καὶ ἀνακάμψαντες ἦλθον ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ καὶ ἀνετάζοντες ἀλλήλους τὴν
αἰτίαν ὡμολόγησαν τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν αὐτῶν καὶ τότε κοινῇ συνετάξαντο καιρὸν
ὅτε αὐτὴν δυνήσονται εὑρεῖν μόνην

15 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ παρατηρεῖν αὐτοὺς ἡμέραν εὔθετον εἰσῆλθέν ποτε
καθὼς ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτης ἡμέρας μετὰ δύο μόνων κορασίων καὶ ἐπεθύμησε
λούσασθαι ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ ὅτι καῦμα ἦν

16 καὶ οὐκ ἦν οὐδεὶς ἐκεῖ πλὴν οἱ δύο πρεσβύτεροι κεκρυμμένοι καὶ
παρατηροῦντες αὐτήν

17 καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς κορασίοις ἐνέγκατε δή μοι ἔλαιον καὶ σμῆγμα καὶ τὰς
θύρας τοῦ παραδείσου κλείσατε ὅπως λούσωμαι

18 καὶ ἐποίησαν καθὼς εἶπεν καὶ ἀπέκλεισαν τὰς θύρας τοῦ παραδείσου καὶ
ἐξῆλθαν κατὰ τὰς πλαγίας θύρας ἐνέγκαι τὰ προστεταγμένα αὐταῖς καὶ οὐκ
εἴδοσαν τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους ὅτι ἦσαν κεκρυμμένοι

19 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐξήλθοσαν τὰ κοράσια καὶ ἀνέστησαν οἱ δύο πρεσβῦται
καὶ ἐπέδραμον αὐτῇ

20 καὶ εἶπον ἰδοὺ αἱ θύραι τοῦ παραδείσου κέκλεινται καὶ οὐδεὶς θεωρεῖ
ἡμᾶς καὶ ἐν ἐπιθυμίᾳ σού ἐσμεν διὸ συγκατάθου ἡμῖν καὶ γενοῦ μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν

21 εἰ δὲ μή καταμαρτυρήσομέν σου ὅτι ἦν μετὰ σοῦ νεανίσκος καὶ διὰ τοῦτο
ἐξαπέστειλας τὰ κοράσια ἀπὸ σοῦ

22 καὶ ἀνεστέναξεν Σουσαννα καὶ εἶπεν στενά μοι πάντοθεν ἐάν τε γὰρ
τοῦτο πράξω θάνατός μοί ἐστιν ἐάν τε μὴ πράξω οὐκ ἐκφεύξομαι τὰς χεῖρας
ὑμῶν

23 αἱρετόν μοί ἐστιν μὴ πράξασαν ἐμπεσεῖν εἰς τὰς χεῖρας ὑμῶν ἢ ἁμαρτεῖν
ἐνώπιον κυρίου

24 καὶ ἀνεβόησεν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ Σουσαννα ἐβόησαν δὲ καὶ οἱ δύο πρεσβῦται
κατέναντι αὐτῆς

25 καὶ δραμὼν ὁ εἷς ἤνοιξεν τὰς θύρας τοῦ παραδείσου

26 ὡς δὲ ἤκουσαν τὴν κραυγὴν ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ οἱ ἐκ τῆς οἰκίας
εἰσεπήδησαν διὰ τῆς πλαγίας θύρας ἰδεῖν τὸ συμβεβηκὸς αὐτῇ

27 ἡνίκα δὲ εἶπαν οἱ πρεσβῦται τοὺς λόγους αὐτῶν κατῃσχύνθησαν οἱ δοῦλοι
σφόδρα ὅτι πώποτε οὐκ ἐρρέθη λόγος τοιοῦτος περὶ Σουσαννης

28 καὶ ἐγένετο τῇ ἐπαύριον ὡς συνῆλθεν ὁ λαὸς πρὸς τὸν ἄνδρα αὐτῆς
Ιωακιμ ἦλθον οἱ δύο πρεσβῦται πλήρεις τῆς ἀνόμου ἐννοίας κατὰ Σουσαννης
τοῦ θανατῶσαι αὐτὴν

29 καὶ εἶπαν ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ λαοῦ ἀποστείλατε ἐπὶ Σουσανναν θυγατέρα
Χελκιου ἥ ἐστιν γυνὴ Ιωακιμ οἱ δὲ ἀπέστειλαν

30 καὶ ἦλθεν αὐτὴ καὶ οἱ γονεῖς αὐτῆς καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῆς καὶ πάντες οἱ
συγγενεῖς αὐτῆς

31 ἡ δὲ Σουσαννα ἦν τρυφερὰ σφόδρα καὶ καλὴ τῷ εἴδει

32 οἱ δὲ παράνομοι ἐκέλευσαν ἀποκαλυφθῆναι αὐτήν ἦν γὰρ κατακεκαλυμμένη
ὅπως ἐμπλησθῶσιν τοῦ κάλλους αὐτῆς

33 ἔκλαιον δὲ οἱ παρ᾽ αὐτῆς καὶ πάντες οἱ ἰδόντες αὐτήν

34 ἀναστάντες δὲ οἱ δύο πρεσβῦται ἐν μέσῳ τῷ λαῷ ἔθηκαν τὰς χεῖρας ἐπὶ
τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτῆς

35 ἡ δὲ κλαίουσα ἀνέβλεψεν εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν ὅτι ἦν ἡ καρδία αὐτῆς
πεποιθυῖα ἐπὶ τῷ κυρίῳ

36 εἶπαν δὲ οἱ πρεσβῦται περιπατούντων ἡμῶν ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ μόνων
εἰσῆλθεν αὕτη μετὰ δύο παιδισκῶν καὶ ἀπέκλεισεν τὰς θύρας τοῦ παραδείσου
καὶ ἀπέλυσεν τὰς παιδίσκας

37 καὶ ἦλθεν πρὸς αὐτὴν νεανίσκος ὃς ἦν κεκρυμμένος καὶ ἀνέπεσε μετ᾽
αὐτῆς

38 ἡμεῖς δὲ ὄντες ἐν τῇ γωνίᾳ τοῦ παραδείσου ἰδόντες τὴν ἀνομίαν
ἐδράμομεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς

39 καὶ ἰδόντες συγγινομένους αὐτοὺς ἐκείνου μὲν οὐκ ἠδυνήθημεν ἐγκρατεῖς
γενέσθαι διὰ τὸ ἰσχύειν αὐτὸν ὑπὲρ ἡμᾶς καὶ ἀνοίξαντα τὰς θύρας
ἐκπεπηδηκέναι

40 ταύτης δὲ ἐπιλαβόμενοι ἐπηρωτῶμεν τίς ἦν ὁ νεανίσκος

41 καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν ἀναγγεῖλαι ἡμῖν ταῦτα μαρτυροῦμεν καὶ ἐπίστευσεν
αὐτοῖς ἡ συναγωγὴ ὡς πρεσβυτέροις τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ κριταῖς καὶ κατέκριναν
αὐτὴν ἀποθανεῖν

42 ἀνεβόησεν δὲ φωνῇ μεγάλῃ Σουσαννα καὶ εἶπεν ὁ θεὸς ὁ αἰώνιος ὁ τῶν
κρυπτῶν γνώστης ὁ εἰδὼς τὰ πάντα πρὶν γενέσεως αὐτῶν

43 σὺ ἐπίστασαι ὅτι ψευδῆ μου κατεμαρτύρησαν καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀποθνῄσκω μὴ
ποιήσασα μηδὲν ὧν οὗτοι ἐπονηρεύσαντο κατ᾽ ἐμοῦ

44 καὶ εἰσήκουσεν κύριος τῆς φωνῆς αὐτῆς

45 καὶ ἀπαγομένης αὐτῆς ἀπολέσθαι ἐξήγειρεν ὁ θεὸς τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἅγιον
παιδαρίου νεωτέρου ᾧ ὄνομα Δανιηλ

46 καὶ ἐβόησεν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ καθαρὸς ἐγὼ ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος ταύτης

47 ἐπέστρεψεν δὲ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ εἶπαν τίς ὁ λόγος οὗτος ὃν σὺ
λελάληκας

48 ὁ δὲ στὰς ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν εἶπεν οὕτως μωροί οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ οὐκ
ἀνακρίναντες οὐδὲ τὸ σαφὲς ἐπιγνόντες κατεκρίνατε θυγατέρα Ισραηλ

49 ἀναστρέψατε εἰς τὸ κριτήριον ψευδῆ γὰρ οὗτοι κατεμαρτύρησαν αὐτῆς

50 καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς μετὰ σπουδῆς καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι
δεῦρο κάθισον ἐν μέσῳ ἡμῶν καὶ ἀνάγγειλον ἡμῖν ὅτι σοὶ δέδωκεν ὁ θεὸς τὸ
πρεσβεῖον

51 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς Δανιηλ διαχωρίσατε αὐτοὺς ἀπ᾽ ἀλλήλων μακράν
καὶ ἀνακρινῶ αὐτούς

52 ὡς δὲ διεχωρίσθησαν εἷς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἑνός ἐκάλεσεν τὸν ἕνα αὐτῶν καὶ εἶπεν
πρὸς αὐτόν πεπαλαιωμένε ἡμερῶν κακῶν νῦν ἥκασιν αἱ ἁμαρτίαι σου ἃς
ἐποίεις τὸ πρότερον

53 κρίνων κρίσεις ἀδίκους καὶ τοὺς μὲν ἀθῴους κατακρίνων ἀπολύων δὲ τοὺς
αἰτίους λέγοντος τοῦ κυρίου ἀθῷον καὶ δίκαιον οὐκ ἀποκτενεῖς

54 νῦν οὖν ταύτην εἴπερ εἶδες εἰπόν ὑπὸ τί δένδρον εἶδες αὐτοὺς
ὁμιλοῦντας ἀλλήλοις ὁ δὲ εἶπεν ὑπὸ σχῖνον

55 εἶπεν δὲ Δανιηλ ὀρθῶς ἔψευσαι εἰς τὴν σεαυτοῦ κεφαλήν ἤδη γὰρ ἄγγελος
τοῦ θεοῦ λαβὼν φάσιν παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ σχίσει σε μέσον

56 καὶ μεταστήσας αὐτὸν ἐκέλευσεν προσαγαγεῖν τὸν ἕτερον καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ
σπέρμα Χανααν καὶ οὐκ Ιουδα τὸ κάλλος ἐξηπάτησέν σε καὶ ἡ ἐπιθυμία
διέστρεψεν τὴν καρδίαν σου

57 οὕτως ἐποιεῖτε θυγατράσιν Ισραηλ καὶ ἐκεῖναι φοβούμεναι ὡμίλουν ὑμῖν
ἀλλ᾽ οὐ θυγάτηρ Ιουδα ὑπέμεινεν τὴν ἀνομίαν ὑμῶν

58 νῦν οὖν λέγε μοι ὑπὸ τί δένδρον κατέλαβες αὐτοὺς ὁμιλοῦντας ἀλλήλοις
ὁ δὲ εἶπεν ὑπὸ πρῖνον

59 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ Δανιηλ ὀρθῶς ἔψευσαι καὶ σὺ εἰς τὴν σεαυτοῦ κεφαλήν
μένει γὰρ ὁ ἄγγελος τοῦ θεοῦ τὴν ῥομφαίαν ἔχων πρίσαι σε μέσον ὅπως
ἐξολεθρεύσῃ ὑμᾶς

60 καὶ ἀνεβόησεν πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγὴ φωνῇ μεγάλῃ καὶ εὐλόγησαν τῷ θεῷ τῷ
σῴζοντι τοὺς ἐλπίζοντας ἐπ᾽ αὐτόν

61 καὶ ἀνέστησαν ἐπὶ τοὺς δύο πρεσβύτας ὅτι συνέστησεν αὐτοὺς Δανιηλ ἐκ
τοῦ στόματος αὐτῶν ψευδομαρτυρήσαντας καὶ ἐποίησαν αὐτοῖς ὃν τρόπον
ἐπονηρεύσαντο τῷ πλησίον

62 ποιῆσαι κατὰ τὸν νόμον Μωυσῆ καὶ ἀπέκτειναν αὐτούς καὶ ἐσώθη αἷμα
ἀναίτιον ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ

63 Χελκιας δὲ καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ ᾔνεσαν τὸν θεὸν περὶ τῆς θυγατρὸς αὐτῶν
Σουσαννας μετὰ Ιωακιμ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς καὶ τῶν συγγενῶν πάντων ὅτι οὐχ
εὑρέθη ἐν αὐτῇ ἄσχημον πρᾶγμα

64 καὶ Δανιηλ ἐγένετο μέγας ἐνώπιον τοῦ λαοῦ ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἐκείνης καὶ
ἐπέκεινα
