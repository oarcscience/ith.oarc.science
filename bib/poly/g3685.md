G3685  
ὀνίνημι  
oninēmi  
*on-in‘-ay-mee*  
A prolonged form of an apparent primary verb ὄνομαι onomai ; for which
another prolonged form ὀνάω onaō is used as an alternate in some tenses
(unless indeed it be identical with the base of [3686](g3686.md) through
the idea of *notoriety*); to *gratify*, that is, (middle voice) to
*derive* *pleasure* or *advantage* from: - have joy.
