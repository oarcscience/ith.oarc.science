### Judith 1

[Apo](../apo/jdt001.md)

1 In the twelfth year of the reign of Nabuchodonosor, who reigned in
Nineve, the great city; in the days of Arphaxad, which reigned over the
Medes in Ecbatane,

2 And built in Ecbatane walls round about of stones hewn three cubits
broad and six cubits long, and made the height of the wall seventy
cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits:

3 And set the towers thereof upon the gates of it an hundred cubits
high, and the breadth thereof in the foundation threescore cubits:

4 And he made the gates thereof, even gates that were raised to the
height of seventy cubits, and the breadth of them was forty cubits, for
the going forth of his mighty armies, and for the setting in array of
his footmen:

5 Even in those days king Nabuchodonosor made war with king Arphaxad in
the great plain, which is the plain in the borders of Ragau.

6 And there came unto him all they that dwelt in the hill country, and
all that dwelt by Euphrates, and Tigris and Hydaspes, and the plain of
Arioch the king of the Elymeans, and very many nations of the sons of
Chelod, assembled themselves to the battle.

7 Then Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians sent unto all that dwelt in
Persia, and to all that dwelt westward, and to those that dwelt in
Cilicia, and Damascus, and Libanus, and Antilibanus, and to all that
dwelt upon the sea coast,

8 And to those among the nations that were of Carmel, and Galaad, and
the higher Galilee, and the great plain of Esdrelom,

9 And to all that were in Samaria and the cities thereof, and beyond
Jordan unto Jerusalem, and Betane, and Chelus, and Kades, and the river
of Egypt, and Taphnes, and Ramesse, and all the land of Gesem,

10 Until ye come beyond Tanis and Memphis, and to all the inhabitants of
Egypt, until ye come to the borders of Ethiopia.

11 But all the inhabitants of the land made light of the commandment of
Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians, neither went they with him to the
battle; for they were not afraid of him: yea, he was before them as one
man, and they sent away his ambassadors from them without effect, and
with disgrace.

12 Therefore Nabuchodonosor was very angry with all this country, and
sware by his throne and kingdom, that he would surely be avenged upon
all those coasts of Cilicia, and Damascus, and Syria, and that he would
slay with the sword all the inhabitants of the land of Moab, and the
children of Ammon, and all Judea, and all that were in Egypt, till ye
come to the borders of the two seas.

13 Then he marched in battle array with his power against king Arphaxad
in the seventeenth year, and he prevailed in his battle: for he
overthrew all the power of Arphaxad, and all his horsemen, and all his
chariots,

14 And became lord of his cities, and came unto Ecbatane, and took the
towers, and spoiled the streets thereof, and turned the beauty thereof
into shame.

15 He took also Arphaxad in the mountains of Ragau, and smote him
through with his darts, and destroyed him utterly that day.

16 So he returned afterward to Nineve, both he and all his company of
sundry nations being a very great multitude of men of war, and there he
took his ease, and banqueted, both he and his army, an hundred and
twenty days.

1 ἔτους δωδεκάτου τῆς βασιλείας Ναβουχοδονοσορ ὃς ἐβασίλευσεν Ἀσσυρίων
ἐν Νινευη τῇ πόλει τῇ μεγάλῃ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Αρφαξαδ ὃς ἐβασίλευσεν
Μήδων ἐν Ἐκβατάνοις

2 καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐπ᾽ Ἐκβατάνων κύκλῳ τείχη ἐκ λίθων λελαξευμένων εἰς
πλάτος πηχῶν τριῶν καὶ εἰς μῆκος πηχῶν ἓξ καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ ὕψος τοῦ
τείχους πηχῶν ἑβδομήκοντα καὶ τὸ πλάτος αὐτοῦ πηχῶν πεντήκοντα

3 καὶ τοὺς πύργους αὐτοῦ ἔστησεν ἐπὶ ταῖς πύλαις αὐτῆς πηχῶν ἑκατὸν καὶ
τὸ πλάτος αὐτῆς ἐθεμελίωσεν εἰς πήχεις ἑξήκοντα

4 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὰς πύλας αὐτῆς πύλας διεγειρομένας εἰς ὕψος πηχῶν
ἑβδομήκοντα καὶ τὸ πλάτος αὐτῆς πήχεις τεσσαράκοντα εἰς ἐξόδους δυνάμεως
δυνατῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ διατάξεις τῶν πεζῶν αὐτοῦ

5 καὶ ἐποίησεν πόλεμον ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ὁ βασιλεὺς
Ναβουχοδονοσορ πρὸς βασιλέα Αρφαξαδ ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ τῷ μεγάλῳ τοῦτό ἐστιν
πεδίον ἐν τοῖς ὁρίοις Ραγαυ

6 καὶ συνήντησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὴν ὀρεινὴν καὶ
πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὸν Εὐφράτην καὶ τὸν Τίγριν καὶ τὸν Ὑδάσπην καὶ
πεδία Αριωχ βασιλέως Ἐλυμαίων καὶ συνῆλθον ἔθνη πολλὰ εἰς παράταξιν υἱῶν
Χελεουδ

7 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ναβουχοδονοσορ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς
κατοικοῦντας τὴν Περσίδα καὶ ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας πρὸς δυσμαῖς
τοὺς κατοικοῦντας τὴν Κιλικίαν καὶ Δαμασκὸν καὶ τὸν Λίβανον καὶ
Ἀντιλίβανον καὶ πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας κατὰ πρόσωπον τῆς παραλίας

8 καὶ τοὺς ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι τοῦ Καρμήλου καὶ Γαλααδ καὶ τὴν ἄνω Γαλιλαίαν
καὶ τὸ μέγα πεδίον Εσδρηλων

9 καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ καὶ ταῖς πόλεσιν αὐτῆς καὶ πέραν τοῦ
Ιορδάνου ἕως Ιερουσαλημ καὶ Βατανη καὶ Χελους καὶ Καδης καὶ τοῦ ποταμοῦ
Αἰγύπτου καὶ Ταφνας καὶ Ραμεσση καὶ πᾶσαν γῆν Γεσεμ

10 ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν ἐπάνω Τάνεως καὶ Μέμφεως καὶ πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας
τὴν Αἴγυπτον ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν ἐπὶ τὰ ὅρια τῆς Αἰθιοπίας

11 καὶ ἐφαύλισαν πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν τὸ ῥῆμα
Ναβουχοδονοσορ βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων καὶ οὐ συνῆλθον αὐτῷ εἰς τὸν πόλεμον
ὅτι οὐκ ἐφοβήθησαν αὐτόν ἀλλ᾽ ἦν ἐναντίον αὐτῶν ὡς ἀνὴρ εἷς καὶ
ἀνέστρεψαν τοὺς ἀγγέλους αὐτοῦ κενοὺς ἐν ἀτιμίᾳ προσώπου αὐτῶν

12 καὶ ἐθυμώθη Ναβουχοδονοσορ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ταύτην σφόδρα καὶ ὤμοσε
κατὰ τοῦ θρόνου καὶ τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ εἰ μὴν ἐκδικήσειν πάντα τὰ ὅρια
τῆς Κιλικίας καὶ Δαμασκηνῆς καὶ Συρίας ἀνελεῖν τῇ ῥομφαίᾳ αὐτοῦ καὶ
πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν γῇ Μωαβ καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς Αμμων καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν
Ιουδαίαν καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν ἐπὶ τὰ ὅρια τῶν δύο
θαλασσῶν

13 καὶ παρετάξατο ἐν τῇ δυνάμει αὐτοῦ πρὸς Αρφαξαδ βασιλέα ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ
ἑπτακαιδεκάτῳ καὶ ἐκραταιώθη ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν πᾶσαν τὴν
δύναμιν Αρφαξαδ καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν ἵππον αὐτοῦ καὶ πάντα τὰ ἅρματα αὐτοῦ

14 καὶ ἐκυρίευσε τῶν πόλεων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀφίκετο ἕως Ἐκβατάνων καὶ ἐκράτησε
τῶν πύργων καὶ ἐπρονόμευσε τὰς πλατείας αὐτῆς καὶ τὸν κόσμον αὐτῆς
ἔθηκεν εἰς ὄνειδος αὐτῆς

15 καὶ ἔλαβε τὸν Αρφαξαδ ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσι Ραγαυ καὶ κατηκόντισεν αὐτὸν ἐν
ταῖς σιβύναις αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξωλέθρευσεν αὐτὸν ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ἐκείνης

16 καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν μετ᾽ αὐτῶν αὐτὸς καὶ πᾶς ὁ σύμμικτος αὐτοῦ πλῆθος
ἀνδρῶν πολεμιστῶν πολὺ σφόδρα καὶ ἦν ἐκεῖ ῥᾳθυμῶν καὶ εὐωχούμενος αὐτὸς
καὶ ἡ δύναμις αὐτοῦ ἐφ᾽ ἡμέρας ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι

[Vul](../vul/jdt001.md)

1 Arphaxad itaque, rex Medorum, subjugaverat multas gentes imperio suo,
et ipse ædificavit civitatem potentissimam, quam appellavit Ecbatanis,

2 ex lapidibus quadratis et sectis: fecit muros ejus in altitudinem
cubitorum septuaginta, et in latitudinem cubitorum triginta: turres vero
ejus posuit in altitudinem cubitorum centum.

3 Per quadrum vero earum latus utrumque vicenorum pedum spatio
tendebatur, posuitque portas ejus in altitudinem turrium:

4 et gloriabatur quasi potens in potentia exercitus sui, et in gloria
quadrigarum suarum.  

5 Anno igitur duodecimo regni sui, Nabuchodonosor rex Assyriorum, qui
regnabat in Ninive civitate magna, pugnavit contra Arphaxad, et obtinuit
eum

6 in campo magno qui appellatur Ragau, circa Euphraten, et Tigrin, et
Jadason, in campo Erioch regis Elicorum.

7 Tunc exaltatum est regnum Nabuchodonosor, et cor ejus elevatum est: et
misit ad omnes qui habitabant in Cilicia, et Damasco, et Libano,

8 et ad gentes quæ sunt in Carmelo et Cedar, et inhabitantes Galilæam in
campo magno Esdrelon,

9 et ad omnes qui erant in Samaria, et trans flumen Jordanem usque ad
Jerusalem, et omnem terram Jesse quousque perveniatur ad terminos
Æthiopiæ.

10 Ad hos omnes misit nuntios Nabuchodonosor rex Assyriorum:

11 qui omnes uno animo contradixerunt, et remiserunt eos vacuos, et sine
honore abjecerunt.

12 Tunc indignatus Nabuchodonosor rex adversus omnem terram illam,
juravit per thronum et regnum suum quod defenderet se de omnibus
regionibus his.
