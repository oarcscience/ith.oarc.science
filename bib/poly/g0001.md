G1  
Α  
A  
*al‘-fah*  
Of Hebrew origin; the first letter of the alphabet: figuratively only
(from its use as a numeral) the *first*. Often used (usually “an”,
before a vowel) also in composition (as a contraction from [427](g0427.md)
in the sense of *privation*; so in many words beginning with this
letter; occasionally in the sense of *union* (as a contraction of
[260](g0260.md) : - Alpha.
