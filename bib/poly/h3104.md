H3104  
יבל יובל  
יוֹבֵל יוֹבֵל ‎ yôbêl yôbêl  
*yo-bale‘,* *yo-bale‘*  
Apparently from [2986](h2986.md) the *blast* of a horn (from its
*continuous* sound); specifically the *signal* of the silver trumpets;
hence the instrument itself and the festival thus introduced: - jubile,
ram’s horn, trumpet.
