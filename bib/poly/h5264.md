H5264  
נסס  
נָסַס ‎ nâsas  
*naw-sas‘*  
A primitive root; to *gleam* from afar, that is, to *be* *conspicuous*
as a signal; or rather perhaps a denominative from [5251](h5251.md) (and
identical with [5263](h5263.md) through the idea of a flag as *fluttering*
in the wind); to *raise* *a* *beacon: -* lift up as an ensign, standard
bearer.
