G4496  
ῥίπτω  
rhiptō̄  
*hrip‘-to*  
A primary verb (perhaps rather akin to the base of [4474](g4474) through
the idea of sudden *motion*); to *fling* (properly with a quick *toss*,
thus differing from [906](g0906) which denotes a *deliberate* hurl; and
from τείνω teinō (see in [1614](g1614) , which indicates an *extended*
projection); by qualification, to *deposit* (as if a load); by extension
to *disperse:* - cast (down, out), scatter abroad, throw.
