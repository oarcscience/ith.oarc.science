σάρξ  
sarx  
*sarx*  
Probably from the base of [4563](g4563.md) *flesh* (as *stripped* of the
skin), that is, (strictly) the *meat* of an animal (as food), or (by
extension) the *body* (as opposed to the soul (or spirit), or as the
symbol of what is external, or as the means of kindred, or (by
implication) *human* *nature* (with its frailties (physically or
morally) and passions), or (specifically) a *human* *being* (as such): -
carnal (-ly, + -ly minded), flesh (\[-ly\]).
