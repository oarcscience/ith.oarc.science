G4486  
ῥήγνυμι, ῥήσσω  
rhēgnumi rhēssō  
*hrayg‘-noo-mee,* *hrace‘-so*  
Both are prolonged forms of ῥήκω rhēko (which appears only in certain
forms, and is itself probably a strengthened form of ἄγνυμι agnumi (see
in [2608](g2608) .md); to “break”, “wreck” or “crack”, that is,
(especially) to *sunder* (by *separation* of the parts; [2608](g2608.md)
being its intensive (with the preposition in compounds), and
[2352](g2352.md) a *shattering* to minute fragments; but not a *reduction*
to the constituent particles, like [3089](g3089.md) or *disrupt*,
*lacerate*; by implication to *convulse* (with *spasms*); figuratively
to *give* *vent* to joyful emotions: - break (forth), burst, rend,
tear.
