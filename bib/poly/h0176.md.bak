H176  
או או  
אוֹ אַו ‎ ‘ô ‘av  
*o,* *av*  
The first form is presumed to be the “constructive” or genitival form of
the second form which is short for [185](h0185.md) *desire* (and so
probably in [Pro 31:4](pro031.htm#004)); hence (by way of alternative.md)
*or*, also *if: -* also, and, either, if, at the least, X nor, or,
otherwise, then, whether.
