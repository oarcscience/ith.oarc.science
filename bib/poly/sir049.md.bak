### Sirach 49

[Apo](../apo/sir049.md)

1 The remembrance of Josias is like the composition of the perfume that
is made by the art of the apothecary: it is sweet as honey in all
mouths, and as musick at a banquet of wine.

2 He behaved himself uprightly in the conversion of the people, and took
away the abominations of iniquity.

3 He directed his heart unto the Lord, and in the time of the ungodly he
established the worship of God.

4 All, except David and Ezekias and Josias, were defective: for they
forsook the law of the most High, even the kings of Juda failed.

5 Therefore he gave their power unto others, and their glory to a
strange nation.

6 They burnt the chosen city of the sanctuary, and made the streets
desolate, according to the prophecy of Jeremias.

7 For they entreated him evil, who nevertheless was a prophet,
sanctified in his mother's womb, that he might root out, and afflict,
and destroy; and that he might build up also, and plant.

8 It was Ezekiel who saw the glorious vision, which was shewed him upon
the chariot of the cherubims.

9 For he made mention of the enemies under the figure of the rain, and
directed them that went right.

10 And of the twelve prophets let the memorial be blessed, and let their
bones flourish again out of their place: for they comforted Jacob, and
delivered them by assured hope.

11 How shall we magnify Zorobabel? even he was as a signet on the right
hand:

12 So was Jesus the son of Josedec: who in their time builded the house,
and set up an holy temple to the Lord, which was prepared for
everlasting glory.

13 And among the elect was Neemias, whose renown is great, who raised up
for us the walls that were fallen, and set up the gates and the bars,
and raised up our ruins again.

14 But upon the earth was no man created like Enoch; for he was taken
from the earth.

15 Neither was there a young man born like Joseph, a governor of his
brethren, a stay of the people, whose bones were regarded of the Lord.

16 Sem and Seth were in great honour among men, and so was Adam above
every living thing in creation.

1 μνημόσυνον Ιωσιου εἰς σύνθεσιν θυμιάματος ἐσκευασμένον ἔργῳ μυρεψοῦ ἐν
παντὶ στόματι ὡς μέλι γλυκανθήσεται καὶ ὡς μουσικὰ ἐν συμποσίῳ οἴνου

2 αὐτὸς κατευθύνθη ἐν ἐπιστροφῇ λαοῦ καὶ ἐξῆρεν βδελύγματα ἀνομίας

3 κατεύθυνεν πρὸς κύριον τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ ἐν ἡμέραις ἀνόμων κατίσχυσεν
τὴν εὐσέβειαν

4 πάρεξ Δαυιδ καὶ Εζεκιου καὶ Ιωσιου πάντες πλημμέλειαν ἐπλημμέλησαν
κατέλιπον γὰρ τὸν νόμον τοῦ ὑψίστου οἱ βασιλεῖς Ιουδα ἐξέλιπον

5 ἔδωκαν γὰρ τὸ κέρας αὐτῶν ἑτέροις καὶ τὴν δόξαν αὐτῶν ἔθνει ἀλλοτρίῳ

6 ἐνεπύρισαν ἐκλεκτὴν πόλιν ἁγιάσματος καὶ ἠρήμωσαν τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτῆς

7 ἐν χειρὶ Ιερεμιου ἐκάκωσαν γὰρ αὐτόν καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν μήτρᾳ ἡγιάσθη
προφήτης ἐκριζοῦν καὶ κακοῦν καὶ ἀπολλύειν ὡσαύτως οἰκοδομεῖν καὶ
καταφυτεύειν

8 Ιεζεκιηλ ὃς εἶδεν ὅρασιν δόξης ἣν ὑπέδειξεν αὐτῷ ἐπὶ ἅρματος χερουβιν

9 καὶ γὰρ ἐμνήσθη τῶν ἐχθρῶν ἐν ὄμβρῳ καὶ ἀγαθῶσαι τοὺς εὐθύνοντας ὁδούς

10 καὶ τῶν δώδεκα προφητῶν τὰ ὀστᾶ ἀναθάλοι ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὐτῶν
παρεκάλεσαν γὰρ τὸν Ιακωβ καὶ ἐλυτρώσαντο αὐτοὺς ἐν πίστει ἐλπίδος

11 πῶς μεγαλύνωμεν τὸν Ζοροβαβελ καὶ αὐτὸς ὡς σφραγὶς ἐπὶ δεξιᾶς χειρός

12 οὕτως Ἰησοῦς υἱὸς Ιωσεδεκ οἳ ἐν ἡμέραις αὐτῶν ᾠκοδόμησαν οἶκον καὶ
ἀνύψωσαν ναὸν ἅγιον κυρίῳ ἡτοιμασμένον εἰς δόξαν αἰῶνος

13 καὶ Νεεμιου ἐπὶ πολὺ τὸ μνημόσυνον τοῦ ἐγείραντος ἡμῖν τείχη
πεπτωκότα καὶ στήσαντος πύλας καὶ μοχλοὺς καὶ ἀνεγείραντος τὰ οἰκόπεδα
ἡμῶν

14 οὐδεὶς ἐκτίσθη ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς τοιοῦτος οἷος Ενωχ καὶ γὰρ αὐτὸς ἀνελήμφθη
ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς

15 οὐδὲ ὡς Ιωσηφ ἐγεννήθη ἀνὴρ ἡγούμενος ἀδελφῶν στήριγμα λαοῦ καὶ τὰ
ὀστᾶ αὐτοῦ ἐπεσκέπησαν

16 Σημ καὶ Σηθ ἐν ἀνθρώποις ἐδοξάσθησαν καὶ ὑπὲρ πᾶν ζῷον ἐν τῇ κτίσει
Αδαμ

[Vul](../vul/sir049.md)

1 \[Memoria Josiæ in compositionem odoris facta  
opus pigmentarii.  

2 In omni ore quasi mel indulcabitur ejus memoria,  
et ut musica in convivio vini.  

3 Ipse est directus divinitus in pœnitentiam gentis,  
et tulit abominationes impietatis.  

4 Et gubernavit ad Dominum cor ipsius,  
et in diebus peccatorum corroboravit pietatem.\]  

5 \[Præter David et Ezechiam et Josiam,  
omnes peccatum commiserunt:  

6 nam reliquerunt legem Altissimi reges Juda,  
et contempserunt timorem Dei.  

7 Dederunt enim regnum suum aliis,  
et gloriam suam alienigenæ genti.  

8 Incenderunt electam sanctitatis civitatem,  
et desertas fecerunt vias ipsius in manu Jeremiæ.  

9 Nam male tractaverunt illum  
qui a ventre matris consecratus est propheta,  
evertere, et eruere, et perdere,  
et iterum ædificare, et renovare:  

10 Ezechiel, qui vidit conspectum gloriæ  
quam ostendit illi in curru cherubim.  

11 Nam commemoratus est inimicorum in imbre,  
benefacere illis qui ostenderunt rectas vias.  

12 Et duodecim prophetarum ossa pullulent de loco suo:  
nam corroboraverunt Jacob,  
et redemerunt se in fide virtutis.\]  

13 \[Quomodo amplificemus Zorobabel?  
nam et ipse quasi signum in dextera manu:  

14 sic et Jesum filium Josedec,  
qui in diebus suis ædificaverunt domum,  
et exaltaverunt templum sanctum Domino,  
paratum in gloriam sempiternam.  

15 Et Nehemias in memoriam multi temporis,  
qui erexit nobis muros eversos,  
et stare fecit portas et seras,  
qui erexit domos nostras.\]  

16 \[Nemo natus est in terra qualis Henoch,  
nam et ipse receptus est a terra:  

17 neque ut Joseph, qui natus est homo princeps fratrum,  
firmamentum gentis, rector fratrum, stabilimentum populi:  

18 et ossa ipsius visitata sunt,  
et post mortem prophetaverunt.  

19 Seth et Sem apud homines gloriam adepti sunt,  
et super omnem animam in origine Adam.\]
