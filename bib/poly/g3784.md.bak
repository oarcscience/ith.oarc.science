opheilō opheileō  
*of-i‘-lo,* *of-i-leh‘-o*  
Including its prolonged form (second form) used in certain tenses.
Probably from the base of [3786](g3786.md) (through the idea of
*accruing*); to *owe* (pecuniarily); figuratively to *be* *under*
*obligation* (*ought*, *must*, *should*); morally to *fail* in duty: -
behove, be bound, (be) debt (-or), (be) due (-ty), be guilty (indebted),
(must) need (-s), ought, owe, should. See also [3785](g3785.md)
