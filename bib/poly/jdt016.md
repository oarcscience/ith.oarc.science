### Judith 16

[Apo](../apo/jdt016.md)

1 Then Judith began to sing this thanksgiving in all Israel, and all the
people sang after her this song of praise.

2 And Judith said, Begin unto my God with timbrels, sing unto my Lord
with cymbals: tune unto him a new psalm: exalt him, and call upon his
name.

3 For God breaketh the battles: for among the camps in the midst of the
people he hath delivered me out of the hands of them that persecuted me.

4 Assur came out of the mountains from the north, he came with ten
thousands of his army, the multitude whereof stopped the torrents, and
their horsemen have covered the hills.

5 He bragged that he would burn up my borders, and kill my young men
with the sword, and dash the sucking children against the ground, and
make mine infants as a prey, and my virgins as a spoil.

6 But the Almighty Lord hath disappointed them by the hand of a woman.

7 For the mighty one did not fall by the young men, neither did the sons
of the Titans smite him, nor high giants set upon him: but Judith the
daughter of Merari weakened him with the beauty of her countenance.

8 For she put off the garment of her widowhood for the exaltation of
those that were oppressed in Israel, and anointed her face with
ointment, and bound her hair in a tire, and took a linen garment to
deceive him.

9 Her sandals ravished his eyes, her beauty took his mind prisoner, and
the fauchion passed through his neck.

10 The Persians quaked at her boldness, and the Medes were daunted at
her hardiness.

11 Then my afflicted shouted for joy, and my weak ones cried aloud; but
they were astonished: these lifted up their voices, but they were
overthrown.

12 The sons of the damsels have pierced them through, and wounded them
as fugatives' children: they perished by the battle of the Lord.

13 I will sing unto the Lord a new song: O Lord, thou art great and
glorious, wonderful in strength, and invincible.

14 Let all creatures serve thee: for thou spakest, and they were made,
thou didst send forth thy spirit, and it created them, and there is none
that can resist thy voice.

15 For the mountains shall be moved from their foundations with the
waters, the rocks shall melt as wax at thy presence: yet thou art
merciful to them that fear thee.

16 For all sacrifice is too little for a sweet savour unto thee, and all
the fat is not sufficient for thy burnt offering: but he that feareth
the Lord is great at all times.

17 Woe to the nations that rise up against my kindred! the Lord Almighty
will take vengeance of them in the day of judgment, in putting fire and
worms in their flesh; and they shall feel them, and weep for ever.

18 Now as soon as they entered into Jerusalem, they worshipped the Lord;
and as soon as the people were purified, they offered their burnt
offerings, and their free offerings, and their gifts.

19 Judith also dedicated all the stuff of Holofernes, which the people
had given her, and gave the canopy, which she had taken out of his
bedchamber, for a gift unto the Lord.

20 So the people continued feasting in Jerusalem before the sanctuary
for the space of three months and Judith remained with them.

21 After this time every one returned to his own inheritance, and Judith
went to Bethulia, and remained in her own possession, and was in her
time honourable in all the country.

22 And many desired her, but none knew her all the days of her life,
after that Manasses her husband was dead, and was gathered to his
people.

23 But she increased more and more in honour, and waxed old in her
husband's house, being an hundred and five years old, and made her maid
free; so she died in Bethulia: and they buried her in the cave of her
husband Manasses.

24 And the house of Israel lamented her seven days: and before she died,
she did distribute her goods to all them that were nearest of kindred to
Manasses her husband, and to them that were the nearest of her kindred.

25 And there was none that made the children of Israel any more afraid
in the days of Judith, nor a long time after her death.

1 καὶ εἶπεν Ιουδιθ ἐξάρχετε τῷ θεῷ μου ἐν τυμπάνοις ᾄσατε τῷ κυρίῳ ἐν
κυμβάλοις ἐναρμόσασθε αὐτῷ ψαλμὸν καὶ αἶνον ὑψοῦτε καὶ ἐπικαλεῖσθε τὸ
ὄνομα αὐτοῦ

2 ὅτι θεὸς συντρίβων πολέμους κύριος ὅτι εἰς παρεμβολὰς αὐτοῦ ἐν μέσῳ
λαοῦ ἐξείλατό με ἐκ χειρὸς καταδιωκόντων με

3 ἦλθεν Ασσουρ ἐξ ὀρέων ἀπὸ βορρᾶ ἦλθεν ἐν μυριάσι δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ ὧν τὸ
πλῆθος αὐτῶν ἐνέφραξεν χειμάρρους καὶ ἡ ἵππος αὐτῶν ἐκάλυψεν βουνούς

4 εἶπεν ἐμπρήσειν τὰ ὅριά μου καὶ τοὺς νεανίσκους μου ἀνελεῖν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ
καὶ τὰ θηλάζοντά μου θήσειν εἰς ἔδαφος καὶ τὰ νήπιά μου δώσειν εἰς
προνομὴν καὶ τὰς παρθένους μου σκυλεῦσαι

5 κύριος παντοκράτωρ ἠθέτησεν αὐτοὺς ἐν χειρὶ θηλείας

6 οὐ γὰρ ὑπέπεσεν ὁ δυνατὸς αὐτῶν ὑπὸ νεανίσκων οὐδὲ υἱοὶ τιτάνων
ἐπάταξαν αὐτόν οὐδὲ ὑψηλοὶ γίγαντες ἐπέθεντο αὐτῷ ἀλλὰ Ιουδιθ θυγάτηρ
Μεραρι ἐν κάλλει προσώπου αὐτῆς παρέλυσεν αὐτόν

7 ἐξεδύσατο γὰρ στολὴν χηρεύσεως αὐτῆς εἰς ὕψος τῶν πονούντων ἐν Ισραηλ
ἠλείψατο τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς ἐν μυρισμῷ

8 καὶ ἐδήσατο τὰς τρίχας αὐτῆς ἐν μίτρᾳ καὶ ἔλαβεν στολὴν λινῆν εἰς
ἀπάτην αὐτοῦ

9 τὸ σανδάλιον αὐτῆς ἥρπασεν ὀφθαλμὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸ κάλλος αὐτῆς
ᾐχμαλώτισεν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ διῆλθεν ὁ ἀκινάκης τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ

10 ἔφριξαν Πέρσαι τὴν τόλμαν αὐτῆς καὶ Μῆδοι τὸ θράσος αὐτῆς ἐταράχθησαν

11 τότε ἠλάλαξαν οἱ ταπεινοί μου καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν οἱ ἀσθενοῦντές μου καὶ
ἐπτοήθησαν ὕψωσαν τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῶν καὶ ἀνετράπησαν

12 υἱοὶ κορασίων κατεκέντησαν αὐτοὺς καὶ ὡς παῖδας αὐτομολούντων
ἐτίτρωσκον αὐτούς ἀπώλοντο ἐκ παρατάξεως κυρίου μου

13 ὑμνήσω τῷ θεῷ μου ὕμνον καινόν κύριε μέγας εἶ καὶ ἔνδοξος θαυμαστὸς
ἐν ἰσχύι ἀνυπέρβλητος

14 σοὶ δουλευσάτω πᾶσα ἡ κτίσις σου ὅτι εἶπας καὶ ἐγενήθησαν ἀπέστειλας
τὸ πνεῦμά σου καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὃς ἀντιστήσεται τῇ φωνῇ σου

15 ὄρη γὰρ ἐκ θεμελίων σὺν ὕδασιν σαλευθήσεται πέτραι δ᾽ ἀπὸ προσώπου
σου ὡς κηρὸς τακήσονται ἔτι δὲ τοῖς φοβουμένοις σε σὺ εὐιλατεύσεις
αὐτοῖς

16 ὅτι μικρὸν πᾶσα θυσία εἰς ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας καὶ ἐλάχιστον πᾶν στέαρ εἰς
ὁλοκαύτωμά σοι ὁ δὲ φοβούμενος τὸν κύριον μέγας διὰ παντός

17 οὐαὶ ἔθνεσιν ἐπανιστανομένοις τῷ γένει μου κύριος παντοκράτωρ
ἐκδικήσει αὐτοὺς ἐν ἡμέρᾳ κρίσεως δοῦναι πῦρ καὶ σκώληκας εἰς σάρκας
αὐτῶν καὶ κλαύσονται ἐν αἰσθήσει ἕως αἰῶνος

18 ὡς δὲ ἤλθοσαν εἰς Ιερουσαλημ προσεκύνησαν τῷ θεῷ καὶ ἡνίκα ἐκαθαρίσθη
ὁ λαός ἀνήνεγκαν τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ ἑκούσια αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ
δόματα

19 καὶ ἀνέθηκεν Ιουδιθ πάντα τὰ σκεύη Ολοφέρνου ὅσα ἔδωκεν ὁ λαὸς αὐτῇ
καὶ τὸ κωνώπιον ὃ ἔλαβεν ἑαυτῇ ἐκ τοῦ κοιτῶνος αὐτοῦ εἰς ἀνάθημα τῷ θεῷ
ἔδωκεν

20 καὶ ἦν ὁ λαὸς εὐφραινόμενος ἐν Ιερουσαλημ κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν ἁγίων ἐπὶ
μῆνας τρεῖς καὶ Ιουδιθ μετ᾽ αὐτῶν κατέμεινεν

21 μετὰ δὲ τὰς ἡμέρας ταύτας ἀνέζευξεν ἕκαστος εἰς τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ
καὶ Ιουδιθ ἀπῆλθεν εἰς Βαιτυλουα καὶ κατέμεινεν ἐπὶ τῆς ὑπάρξεως αὐτῆς
καὶ ἐγένετο κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν αὐτῆς ἔνδοξος ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ

22 καὶ πολλοὶ ἐπεθύμησαν αὐτήν καὶ οὐκ ἔγνω ἀνὴρ αὐτὴν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας
τῆς ζωῆς αὐτῆς ἀφ᾽ ἧς ἡμέρας ἀπέθανεν Μανασσης ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς καὶ
προσετέθη πρὸς τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ

23 καὶ ἦν προβαίνουσα μεγάλη σφόδρα καὶ ἐγήρασεν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς
αὐτῆς ἔτη ἑκατὸν πέντε καὶ ἀφῆκεν τὴν ἅβραν αὐτῆς ἐλευθέραν καὶ ἀπέθανεν
εἰς Βαιτυλουα καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὴν ἐν τῷ σπηλαίῳ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς Μανασση

24 καὶ ἐπένθησεν αὐτὴν οἶκος Ισραηλ ἡμέρας ἑπτά καὶ διεῖλεν τὰ ὑπάρχοντα
αὐτῆς πρὸ τοῦ ἀποθανεῖν αὐτὴν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔγγιστα Μανασση τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς
καὶ τοῖς ἔγγιστα τοῦ γένους αὐτῆς

25 καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἔτι ὁ ἐκφοβῶν τοὺς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Ιουδιθ καὶ
μετὰ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν αὐτὴν ἡμέρας πολλάς

[Vul](../vul/jdt016.md)

1 Tunc cantavit canticum hoc Domino Judith, dicens:

2 \[Incipite Domino in tympanis;  
cantate Domino in cymbalis;  
modulamini illi psalmum novum:  
exaltate, et invocate nomen ejus.  

3 Dominus conterens bella,  
Dominus nomen est illi.  

4 Qui posuit castra sua in medio populi sui,  
ut eriperet nos de manu omnium inimicorum nostrorum.  

5 Venit Assur ex montibus ab aquilone  
in multitudine fortitudinis suæ:  
cujus multitudo obturavit torrentes,  
et equi eorum cooperuerunt valles.  

6 Dixit se incensurum fines meos,  
et juvenes meos occisurum gladio;  
infantes meos dare in prædam,  
et virgines in captivitatem.  

7 Dominus autem omnipotens nocuit eum,  
et tradidit eum in manus feminæ, et confodit eum.  

8 Non enim cecidit potens eorum a juvenibus,  
nec filii Titan percusserunt eum,  
nec excelsi gigantes opposuerunt se illi:  
sed Judith filia Merari in specie faciei suæ dissolvit eum.  

9 Exuit enim se vestimento viduitatis,  
et induit se vestimento lætitiæ  
in exultatione filiorum Israël.  

10 Unxit faciem suam unguento,  
et colligavit cincinnos suos mitra;  
accepit stolam novem ad decipiendum illum.  

11 Sandalia ejus rapuerunt oculos ejus;  
pulchritudo ejus captivam fecit animam ejus:  
amputavit pugione cervicem ejus.  

12 Horruerunt Persæ constantiam ejus,  
et Medi audaciam ejus.  

13 Tunc ululaverunt castra Assyriorum,  
quando apparuerunt humiles mei, arescentes in siti.  

14 Filii puellarum compunxerunt eos,  
et sicut pueros fugientes occiderunt eos:  
perierunt in prælio a facie Domini Dei mei.  

15 Hymnum cantemus Domino;  
hymnum novum cantemus Deo nostro.  

16 Adonai Domine, magnus es tu,  
et præclarus in virtute tua:  
et quem superare nemo potest.  

17 Tibi serviat omnis creatura tua,  
quia dixisti, et facta sunt;  
misisti spiritum tuum, et creata sunt:  
et non est qui resistat voci tuæ.  

18 Montes a fundamentis movebuntur cum aquis;  
petræ, sicut cera, liquescent ante faciem tuam.  

19 Qui autem timent te,  
magni erunt apud te per omnia.  

20 Væ genti insurgenti super genus meum:  
Dominus enim omnipotens vindicabit in eis;  
in die judicii visitabit illos.  

21 Dabit enim ignem et vermes in carnes eorum,  
ut urantur et sentiant usque in sempiternum.\]  

22 Et factum est post hæc, omnis populus post victoriam venit in
Jerusalem adorare Dominum: et mox ut purificati sunt, obtulerunt omnes
holocausta, et vota, et repromissiones suas.

23 Porro Judith universa vasa bellica Holofernis, quæ dedit illi
populus, et conopeum quod ipsa sustulerat de cubili ipsius, obtulit in
anathema oblivionis.

24 Erat autem populus jucundus secundum faciem sanctorum: et per tres
menses gaudium hujus victoriæ celebratum est cum Judith.

25 Post dies autem illos, unusquisque rediit in domum suam: et Judith
magna facta est in Bethulia, et præclarior erat universæ terræ Israël.

26 Erat enim virtuti castitas adjuncta, ita ut non cognosceret virum
omnibus diebus vitæ suæ, ex quo defunctus est Manasses vir ejus.

27 Erat autem, diebus festis, procedens cum magna gloria.

28 Mansit autem in domo viri sui annos centum quinque, et dimisit abram
suam liberam: et defuncta est ac sepulta cum viro suo in Bethulia.

29 Luxitque illam omnis populus diebus septem.

30 In omni autem spatio vitæ ejus non fuit qui perturbaret Israël, et
post mortem ejus annis multis.

31 Dies autem victoriæ hujus festivitatis ab Hebræis in numero sanctorum
dierum accipitur, et colitur a Judæis ex illo tempore usque in præsentem
diem.
