### 1 Esdras 9

[Apo](../apo/es1009.md)

1 Then Esdras rising from the court of the temple went to the chamber of
Joanan the son of Eliasib,

2 And remained there, and did eat no meat nor drink water, mourning for
the great iniquities of the multitude.

3 And there was a proclamation in all Jewry and Jerusalem to all them
that were of the captivity, that they should be gathered together at
Jerusalem:

4 And that whosoever met not there within two or three days according as
the elders that bare rule appointed, their cattle should be seized to
the use of the temple, and himself cast out from them that were of the
captivity.

5 And in three days were all they of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin
gathered together at Jerusalem the twentieth day of the ninth month.

6 And all the multitude sat trembling in the broad court of the temple
because of the present foul weather.

7 So Esdras arose up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed the law
in marrying strange wives, thereby to increase the sins of Israel.

8 And now by confessing give glory unto the Lord God of our fathers,

9 And do his will, and separate yourselves from the heathen of the land,
and from the strange women.

10 Then cried the whole multitude, and said with a loud voice, Like as
thou hast spoken, so will we do.

11 But forasmuch as the people are many, and it is foul weather, so that
we cannot stand without, and this is not a work of a day or two, seeing
our sin in these things is spread far:

12 Therefore let the rulers of the multitude stay, and let all them of
our habitations that have strange wives come at the time appointed,

13 And with them the rulers and judges of every place, till we turn away
the wrath of the Lord from us for this matter.

14 Then Jonathan the son of Azael and Ezechias the son of Theocanus
accordingly took this matter upon them: and Mosollam and Levis and
Sabbatheus helped them.

15 And they that were of the captivity did according to all these
things.

16 And Esdras the priest chose unto him the principal men of their
families, all by name: and in the first day of the tenth month they sat
together to examine the matter.

17 So their cause that held strange wives was brought to an end in the
first day of the first month.

18 And of the priests that were come together, and had strange wives,
there were found:

19 Of the sons of Jesus the son of Josedec, and his brethren; Matthelas
and Eleazar, and Joribus and Joadanus.

20 And they gave their hands to put away their wives and to offer rams
to make reconcilement for their errors.

21 And of the sons of Emmer; Ananias, and Zabdeus, and Eanes, and
Sameius, and Hiereel, and Azarias.

22 And of the sons of Phaisur; Elionas, Massias Israel, and Nathanael,
and Ocidelus and Talsas.

23 And of the Levites; Jozabad, and Semis, and Colius, who was called
Calitas, and Patheus, and Judas, and Jonas.

24 Of the holy singers; Eleazurus, Bacchurus.

25 Of the porters; Sallumus, and Tolbanes.

26 Of them of Israel, of the sons of Phoros; Hiermas, and Eddias, and
Melchias, and Maelus, and Eleazar, and Asibias, and Baanias.

27 Of the sons of Ela; Matthanias, Zacharias, and Hierielus, and
Hieremoth, and Aedias.

28 And of the sons of Zamoth; Eliadas, Elisimus, Othonias, Jarimoth, and
Sabatus, and Sardeus.

29 Of the sons of Babai; Johannes, and Ananias and Josabad, and
Amatheis.

30 Of the sons of Mani; Olamus, Mamuchus, Jedeus, Jasubus, Jasael, and
Hieremoth.

31 And of the sons of Addi; Naathus, and Moosias, Lacunus, and Naidus,
and Mathanias, and Sesthel, Balnuus, and Manasseas.

32 And of the sons of Annas; Elionas and Aseas, and Melchias, and
Sabbeus, and Simon Chosameus.

33 And of the sons of Asom; Altaneus, and Matthias, and Baanaia,
Eliphalet, and Manasses, and Semei.

34 And of the sons of Maani; Jeremias, Momdis, Omaerus, Juel, Mabdai,
and Pelias, and Anos, Carabasion, and Enasibus, and Mamnitanaimus,
Eliasis, Bannus, Eliali, Samis, Selemias, Nathanias: and of the sons of
Ozora; Sesis, Esril, Azaelus, Samatus, Zambis, Josephus.

35 And of the sons of Ethma; Mazitias, Zabadaias, Edes, Juel, Banaias.

36 All these had taken strange wives, and they put them away with their
children.

37 And the priests and Levites, and they that were of Israel, dwelt in
Jerusalem, and in the country, in the first day of the seventh month: so
the children of Israel were in their habitations.

38 And the whole multitude came together with one accord into the broad
place of the holy porch toward the east:

39 And they spake unto Esdras the priest and reader, that he would bring
the law of Moses, that was given of the Lord God of Israel.

40 So Esdras the chief priest brought the law unto the whole multitude
from man to woman, and to all the priests, to hear law in the first day
of the seventh month.

41 And he read in the broad court before the holy porch from morning
unto midday, before both men and women; and the multitude gave heed unto
the law.

42 And Esdras the priest and reader of the law stood up upon a pulpit of
wood, which was made for that purpose.

43 And there stood up by him Mattathias, Sammus, Ananias, Azarias,
Urias, Ezecias, Balasamus, upon the right hand:

44 And upon his left hand stood Phaldaius, Misael, Melchias, Lothasubus,
and Nabarias.

45 Then took Esdras the book of the law before the multitude: for he sat
honourably in the first place in the sight of them all.

46 And when he opened the law, they stood all straight up. So Esdras
blessed the Lord God most High, the God of hosts, Almighty.

47 And all the people answered, Amen; and lifting up their hands they
fell to the ground, and worshipped the Lord.

48 Also Jesus, Anus, Sarabias, Adinus, Jacubus, Sabateas, Auteas,
Maianeas, and Calitas, Asrias, and Joazabdus, and Ananias, Biatas, the
Levites, taught the law of the Lord, making them withal to understand
it.

49 Then spake Attharates unto Esdras the chief priest. and reader, and
to the Levites that taught the multitude, even to all, saying,

50 This day is holy unto the Lord; (for they all wept when they heard
the law:)

51 Go then, and eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send part to them
that have nothing;

52 For this day is holy unto the Lord: and be not sorrowful; for the
Lord will bring you to honour.

53 So the Levites published all things to the people, saying, This day
is holy to the Lord; be not sorrowful.

54 Then went they their way, every one to eat and drink, and make merry,
and to give part to them that had nothing, and to make great cheer;

55 Because they understood the words wherein they were instructed, and
for the which they had been assembled.

1 καὶ ἀναστὰς Εσδρας ἀπὸ τῆς αὐλῆς τοῦ ἱεροῦ ἐπορεύθη εἰς τὸ παστοφόριον
Ιωαναν τοῦ Ελιασιβου

2 καὶ αὐλισθεὶς ἐκεῖ ἄρτου οὐκ ἐγεύσατο οὐδὲ ὕδωρ ἔπιεν πενθῶν ὑπὲρ τῶν
ἀνομιῶν τῶν μεγάλων τοῦ πλήθους

3 καὶ ἐγένετο κήρυγμα ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ Ιουδαίᾳ καὶ Ιερουσαλημ πᾶσι τοῖς ἐκ τῆς
αἰχμαλωσίας συναχθῆναι εἰς Ιερουσαλημ

4 καὶ ὅσοι ἂν μὴ ἀπαντήσωσιν ἐν δυσὶν ἢ τρισὶν ἡμέραις κατὰ τὸ κρίμα τῶν
προκαθημένων πρεσβυτέρων ἀνιερωθήσονται τὰ κτήνη αὐτῶν καὶ αὐτὸς
ἀλλοτριωθήσεται ἀπὸ τοῦ πλήθους τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας

5 καὶ ἐπισυνήχθησαν οἱ ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς Ιουδα καὶ Βενιαμιν ἐν τρισὶν ἡμέραις
εἰς Ιερουσαλημ οὗτος ὁ μὴν ἔνατος τῇ εἰκάδι τοῦ μηνός

6 καὶ συνεκάθισαν πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος ἐν τῇ εὐρυχώρῳ τοῦ ἱεροῦ τρέμοντες διὰ
τὸν ἐνεστῶτα χειμῶνα

7 καὶ ἀναστὰς Εσδρας εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ὑμεῖς ἠνομήσατε καὶ συνῳκίσατε
γυναῖκας ἀλλογενεῖς τοῦ προσθεῖναι ἁμαρτίαν τῷ Ισραηλ

8 καὶ νῦν δότε ὁμολογίαν δόξαν τῷ κυρίῳ θεῷ τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν

9 καὶ ποιήσατε τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ καὶ χωρίσθητε ἀπὸ τῶν ἐθνῶν τῆς γῆς καὶ
ἀπὸ τῶν γυναικῶν τῶν ἀλλογενῶν

10 καὶ ἐφώνησαν ἅπαν τὸ πλῆθος καὶ εἶπον μεγάλῃ τῇ φωνῇ οὕτως ὡς εἴρηκας
ποιήσομεν

11 ἀλλὰ τὸ πλῆθος πολὺ καὶ ἡ ὥρα χειμερινή καὶ οὐκ ἰσχύομεν στῆναι
αἴθριοι καὶ οὐχ εὕρομεν καὶ τὸ ἔργον ἡμῖν οὐκ ἔστιν ἡμέρας μιᾶς οὐδὲ δύο
ἐπὶ πλεῖον γὰρ ἡμάρτομεν ἐν τούτοις

12 στήτωσαν δὲ οἱ προηγούμενοι τοῦ πλήθους καὶ πάντες οἱ ἐκ τῶν
κατοικιῶν ἡμῶν ὅσοι ἔχουσιν γυναῖκας ἀλλογενεῖς παραγενηθήτωσαν λαβόντες
χρόνον

13 καὶ ἑκάστου δὲ τόπου τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους καὶ τοὺς κριτὰς ἕως τοῦ λῦσαι
τὴν ὀργὴν τοῦ κυρίου ἀφ᾽ ἡμῶν τοῦ πράγματος τούτου

14 Ιωναθας Αζαηλου καὶ Ιεζιας Θοκανου ἐπεδέξαντο κατὰ ταῦτα καὶ
Μοσολλαμος καὶ Λευις καὶ Σαββαταιος συνεβράβευσαν αὐτοῖς

15 καὶ ἐποίησαν κατὰ πάντα ταῦτα οἱ ἐκ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας

16 καὶ ἐπελέξατο ἑαυτῷ Εσδρας ὁ ἱερεὺς ἄνδρας ἡγουμένους τῶν πατριῶν
αὐτῶν κατ᾽ ὄνομα πάντας καὶ συνεκάθισαν τῇ νουμηνίᾳ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ
δεκάτου ἐτάσαι τὸ πρᾶγμα

17 καὶ ἤχθη ἐπὶ πέρας τὰ κατὰ τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς ἐπισυνέχοντας γυναῖκας
ἀλλογενεῖς ἕως τῆς νουμηνίας τοῦ πρώτου μηνός

18 καὶ εὑρέθησαν τῶν ἱερέων οἱ ἐπισυναχθέντες ἀλλογενεῖς γυναῖκας
ἔχοντες

προεκάθητο γὰρ ἐπιδόξως ἐνώπιον πάντων

46 καὶ ἐν τῷ λῦσαι τὸν νόμον πάντες ὀρθοὶ ἔστησαν καὶ εὐλόγησεν Εσδρας
τῷ κυρίῳ θεῷ ὑψίστῳ θεῷ σαβαωθ παντοκράτορι

47 καὶ ἐπεφώνησεν πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος αμην καὶ ἄραντες ἄνω τὰς χεῖρας

ἐδίδασκον τὸν νόμον κυρίου καὶ πρὸς τὸ πλῆθος ἀνεγίνωσκον τὸν νόμον τοῦ
κυρίου ἐμφυσιοῦντες ἅμα τὴν ἀνάγνωσιν

49 καὶ εἶπεν Ατταρατης Εσδρα τῷ ἀρχιερεῖ καὶ ἀναγνώστῃ καὶ τοῖς Λευίταις
τοῖς διδάσκουσι τὸ πλῆθος ἐπὶ πάντας

50 ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη ἐστὶν ἁγία τῷ κυρίῳ καὶ πάντες ἔκλαιον ἐν τῷ ἀκοῦσαι τοῦ
νόμου

51 βαδίσαντες οὖν φάγετε λιπάσματα καὶ πίετε γλυκάσματα καὶ ἀποστείλατε
ἀποστολὰς τοῖς μὴ ἔχουσιν

52 ἁγία γὰρ ἡ ἡμέρα τῷ κυρίῳ καὶ μὴ λυπεῖσθε ὁ γὰρ κύριος δοξάσει ὑμᾶς

53 καὶ οἱ Λευῖται ἐκέλευον τῷ δήμῳ παντὶ λέγοντες ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη ἁγία μὴ
λυπεῖσθε

54 καὶ ᾤχοντο πάντες φαγεῖν καὶ πιεῖν καὶ εὐφραίνεσθαι καὶ δοῦναι
ἀποστολὰς τοῖς μὴ ἔχουσιν καὶ εὐφρανθῆναι μεγάλως

55 ὅτι καὶ ἐνεφυσιώθησαν ἐν τοῖς ῥήμασιν οἷς ἐδιδάχθησαν καὶ
ἐπισυνήχθησαν
