שׁלשׁ  
שָׁלַשׁ ‎ shâlash  
*shaw-lash‘*  
A primitive root perhaps originally to *intensify*, that is, *treble*;
but apparently used only as denominative from [7969](h7969) to *be*
(causatively *make*) *triplicate* (by restoration, in portions, strands,
days or years): - do the third time, (divide into, stay) three (days,
-fold, parts, years old).
