phileō  
*fil-eh‘-o*  
From [5384](g5384.md) to *be* *a* *friend* *to* (*fond* *of* \[an
individual or an object\]), that is, *have* *affection* for (denoting
*personal* attachment, as a matter of sentiment or feeling; while
[25](g0025.md) is wider, embracing especially the judgment and the
*deliberate* assent of the will as a matter of principle, duty and
propriety: the two thus stand related very much as [2309](g2309.md) and
[1014](g1014) or as [2372](g2372) and [3563](g3563.md) respectively; the
former being chiefly of the *heart* and the latter of the *head*);
specifically to *kiss* (as a mark of tenderness): - kiss, love.
