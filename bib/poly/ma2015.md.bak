### 2 Macabees 15

[Apo](../apo/ma2015.md)

1 But Nicanor, hearing that Judas and his company were in the strong
places about Samaria, resolved without any danger to set upon them on
the sabbath day.

2 Nevertheless the Jews that were compelled to go with him said, O
destroy not so cruelly and barbarously, but give honour to that day,
which he, that seeth all things, hath honoured with holiness above all
other days.

3 Then the most ungracious wretch demanded, if there were a Mighty one
in heaven, that had commanded the sabbath day to be kept.

4 And when they said, There is in heaven a living Lord, and mighty, who
commanded the seventh day to be kept:

5 Then said the other, And I also am mighty upon earth, and I command to
take arms, and to do the king's business. Yet he obtained not to have
his wicked will done.

6 So Nicanor in exceeding pride and haughtiness determined to set up a
publick monument of his victory over Judas and them that were with him.

7 But Maccabeus had ever sure confidence that the Lord would help him:

8 Wherefore he exhorted his people not to fear the coming of the heathen
against them, but to remember the help which in former times they had
received from heaven, and now to expect the victory and aid, which
should come unto them from the Almighty.

9 And so comforting them out of the law and the prophets, and withal
putting them in mind of the battles that they won afore, he made them
more cheerful.

10 And when he had stirred up their minds, he gave them their charge,
shewing them therewithall the falsehood of the heathen, and the breach
of oaths.

11 Thus he armed every one of them, not so much with defence of shields
and spears, as with comfortable and good words: and beside that, he told
them a dream worthy to be believed, as if it had been so indeed, which
did not a little rejoice them.

12 And this was his vision: That Onias, who had been high priest, a
virtuous and a good man, reverend in conversation, gentle in condition,
well spoken also, and exercised from a child in all points of virtue,
holding up his hands prayed for the whole body of the Jews.

13 This done, in like manner there appeared a man with gray hairs, and
exceeding glorious, who was of a wonderful and excellent majesty.

14 Then Onias answered, saying, This is a lover of the brethren, who
prayeth much for the people, and for the holy city, to wit, Jeremias the
prophet of God.

15 Whereupon Jeremias holding forth his right hand gave to Judas a sword
of gold, and in giving it spake thus,

16 Take this holy sword, a gift from God, with the which thou shalt
wound the adversaries.

17 Thus being well comforted by the words of Judas, which were very
good, and able to stir them up to valour, and to encourage the hearts of
the young men, they determined not to pitch camp, but courageously to
set upon them, and manfully to try the matter by conflict, because the
city and the sanctuary and the temple were in danger.

18 For the care that they took for their wives, and their children,
their brethren, and folks, was in least account with them: but the
greatest and principal fear was for the holy temple.

19 Also they that were in the city took not the least care, being
troubled for the conflict abroad.

20 And now, when as all looked what should be the trial, and the enemies
were already come near, and the army was set in array, and the beasts
conveniently placed, and the horsemen set in wings,

21 Maccabeus seeing the coming of the multitude, and the divers
preparations of armour, and the fierceness of the beasts, stretched out
his hands toward heaven, and called upon the Lord that worketh wonders,
knowing that victory cometh not by arms, but even as it seemeth good to
him, he giveth it to such as are worthy:

22 Therefore in his prayer he said after this manner; O Lord, thou didst
send thine angel in the time of Ezekias king of Judea, and didst slay in
the host of Sennacherib an hundred fourscore and five thousand:

23 Wherefore now also, O Lord of heaven, send a good angel before us for
a fear and dread unto them;

24 And through the might of thine arm let those be stricken with terror,
that come against thy holy people to blaspheme. And he ended thus.

25 Then Nicanor and they that were with him came forward with trumpets
and songs.

26 But Judas and his company encountered the enemies with invocation and
prayer.

27 So that fighting with their hands, and praying unto God with their
hearts, they slew no less than thirty and five thousand men: for through
the appearance of God they were greatly cheered.

28 Now when the battle was done, returning again with joy, they knew
that Nicanor lay dead in his harness.

29 Then they made a great shout and a noise, praising the Almighty in
their own language.

30 And Judas, who was ever the chief defender of the citizens both in
body and mind, and who continued his love toward his countrymen all his
life, commanded to strike off Nicanor's head, and his hand with his
shoulder, and bring them to Jerusalem.

31 So when he was there, and called them of his nation together, and set
the priests before the altar, he sent for them that were of the tower,

32 And shewed them vile Nicanor's head, and the hand of that blasphemer,
which with proud brags he had stretched out against the holy temple of
the Almighty.

33 And when he had cut out the tongue of that ungodly Nicanor, he
commanded that they should give it by pieces unto the fowls, and hang up
the reward of his madness before the temple.

34 So every man praised toward the heaven the glorious Lord, saying,
Blessed be he that hath kept his own place undefiled.

35 He hanged also Nicanor's head upon the tower, an evident and manifest
sign unto all of the help of the Lord.

36 And they ordained all with a common decree in no case to let that day
pass without solemnity, but to celebrate the thirtieth day of the
twelfth month, which in the Syrian tongue is called Adar, the day before
Mardocheus' day.

37 Thus went it with Nicanor: and from that time forth the Hebrews had
the city in their power. And here will I make an end.

38 And if I have done well, and as is fitting the story, it is that
which I desired: but if slenderly and meanly, it is that which I could
attain unto.

39 For as it is hurtful to drink wine or water alone; and as wine
mingled with water is pleasant, and delighteth the taste: even so speech
finely framed delighteth the ears of them that read the story. And here
shall be an end.

1 ὁ δὲ Νικάνωρ μεταλαβὼν τοὺς περὶ τὸν Ιουδαν ὄντας ἐν τοῖς κατὰ

7 ὁ δὲ Μακκαβαῖος ἦν ἀδιαλείπτως πεποιθὼς μετὰ πάσης ἐλπίδος ἀντιλήμψεως
τεύξασθαι παρὰ τοῦ κυρίου

8 καὶ παρεκάλει τοὺς σὺν αὐτῷ μὴ δειλιᾶν τὴν τῶν ἐθνῶν ἔφοδον ἔχοντας δὲ

9 καὶ παραμυθούμενος αὐτοὺς ἐκ τοῦ νόμου καὶ τῶν προφητῶν προσυπομνήσας
δὲ αὐτοὺς καὶ τοὺς ἀγῶνας οὓς ἦσαν ἐκτετελεκότες προθυμοτέρους αὐτοὺς
κατέστησεν

10 καὶ τοῖς θυμοῖς διεγείρας αὐτοὺς παρήγγειλεν ἅμα παρεπιδεικνὺς τὴν
τῶν ἐθνῶν ἀθεσίαν καὶ τὴν τῶν ὅρκων παράβασιν

11 ἕκαστον δὲ αὐτῶν καθοπλίσας οὐ τὴν ἀσπίδων καὶ λογχῶν ἀσφάλειαν ὡς
τὴν ἐν τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς λόγοις παράκλησιν καὶ προσεξηγησάμενος ὄνειρον
ἀξιόπιστον ὕπαρ τι πάντας ηὔφρανεν

12 ἦν δὲ ἡ τούτου θεωρία τοιάδε Ονιαν τὸν γενόμενον ἀρχιερέα ἄνδρα καλὸν
καὶ ἀγαθόν αἰδήμονα μὲν τὴν ἀπάντησιν πρᾶον δὲ τὸν τρόπον καὶ λαλιὰν

13 εἶθ᾽ οὕτως ἐπιφανῆναι ἄνδρα πολιᾷ καὶ δόξῃ διαφέροντα θαυμαστὴν δέ

14 ἀποκριθέντα δὲ τὸν Ονιαν εἰπεῖν ὁ φιλάδελφος οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ πολλὰ
προσευχόμενος περὶ τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ τῆς ἁγίας πόλεως Ιερεμιας ὁ τοῦ θεοῦ
προφήτης

15 προτείναντα δὲ Ιερεμιαν τὴν δεξιὰν παραδοῦναι τῷ Ιουδα ῥομφαίαν

ἀρετὴν παρορμῆσαι καὶ ψυχὰς νέων ἐπανδρῶσαι διέγνωσαν μὴ στρατεύεσθαι

πράγματα διὰ τὸ καὶ τὴν πόλιν καὶ τὰ ἅγια καὶ τὸ ἱερὸν κινδυνεύειν

18 ἦν γὰρ ὁ περὶ γυναικῶν καὶ τέκνων ἔτι δὲ ἀδελφῶν καὶ συγγενῶν ἐν
ἥττονι μέρει κείμενος αὐτοῖς μέγιστος δὲ καὶ πρῶτος ὁ περὶ τοῦ
καθηγιασμένου ναοῦ φόβος

19 ἦν δὲ καὶ τοῖς ἐν τῇ πόλει κατειλημμένοις οὐ πάρεργος ἀγωνία
ταρασσομένοις τῆς ἐν ὑπαίθρῳ προσβολῆς

20 καὶ πάντων ἤδη προσδοκώντων τὴν ἐσομένην κρίσιν καὶ ἤδη προσμειξάντων
τῶν πολεμίων καὶ τῆς στρατιᾶς ἐκταγείσης καὶ τῶν θηρίων ἐπὶ μέρος
εὔκαιρον ἀποκατασταθέντων τῆς τε ἵππου κατὰ κέρας τεταγμένης

21 συνιδὼν ὁ Μακκαβαῖος τὴν τῶν πληθῶν παρουσίαν καὶ τῶν ὅπλων τὴν
ποικίλην παρασκευὴν τήν τε τῶν θηρίων ἀγριότητα ἀνατείνας τὰς χεῖρας εἰς

22 ἔλεγεν δὲ ἐπικαλούμενος τόνδε τὸν τρόπον σύ δέσποτα ἀπέστειλας τὸν
ἄγγελόν σου ἐπὶ Εζεκιου τοῦ βασιλέως τῆς Ιουδαίας καὶ ἀνεῖλεν ἐκ τῆς

23 καὶ νῦν δυνάστα τῶν οὐρανῶν ἀπόστειλον ἄγγελον ἀγαθὸν ἔμπροσθεν ἡμῶν
εἰς δέος καὶ τρόμον

24 μεγέθει βραχίονός σου καταπλαγείησαν οἱ μετὰ βλασφημίας παραγινόμενοι
ἐπὶ τὸν ἅγιόν σου λαόν καὶ οὗτος μὲν ἐν τούτοις ἔληξεν

25 οἱ δὲ περὶ τὸν Νικάνορα μετὰ σαλπίγγων καὶ παιάνων προσῆγον

26 οἱ δὲ περὶ τὸν Ιουδαν μετὰ ἐπικλήσεως καὶ εὐχῶν συνέμειξαν τοῖς
πολεμίοις

27 καὶ ταῖς μὲν χερσὶν ἀγωνιζόμενοι ταῖς δὲ καρδίαις πρὸς τὸν θεὸν
εὐχόμενοι κατέστρωσαν οὐδὲν ἧττον μυριάδων τριῶν καὶ πεντακισχιλίων τῇ
τοῦ θεοῦ μεγάλως εὐφρανθέντες ἐπιφανείᾳ

28 γενόμενοι δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς χρείας καὶ μετὰ χαρᾶς ἀναλύοντες ἐπέγνωσαν
προπεπτωκότα Νικάνορα σὺν τῇ πανοπλίᾳ

29 γενομένης δὲ κραυγῆς καὶ ταραχῆς εὐλόγουν τὸν δυνάστην τῇ πατρίῳ φωνῇ

30 καὶ προσέταξεν ὁ καθ᾽ ἅπαν σώματι καὶ ψυχῇ πρωταγωνιστὴς ὑπὲρ τῶν
πολιτῶν ὁ τὴν τῆς ἡλικίας εὔνοιαν εἰς ὁμοεθνεῖς διαφυλάξας τὴν τοῦ
Νικάνορος κεφαλὴν ἀποτεμόντας καὶ τὴν χεῖρα σὺν τῷ ὤμῳ φέρειν εἰς
Ιεροσόλυμα

31 παραγενόμενος δὲ ἐκεῖ καὶ συγκαλέσας τοὺς ὁμοεθνεῖς καὶ τοὺς ἱερεῖς
πρὸ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου στήσας μετεπέμψατο τοὺς ἐκ τῆς ἄκρας

32 καὶ ἐπιδειξάμενος τὴν τοῦ μιαροῦ Νικάνορος κεφαλὴν καὶ τὴν χεῖρα τοῦ
δυσφήμου ἣν ἐκτείνας ἐπὶ τὸν ἅγιον τοῦ παντοκράτορος οἶκον ἐμεγαλαύχησεν

33 καὶ τὴν γλῶσσαν τοῦ δυσσεβοῦς Νικάνορος ἐκτεμὼν ἔφη κατὰ μέρος δώσειν

38 καὶ εἰ μὲν καλῶς εὐθίκτως τῇ συντάξει τοῦτο καὶ αὐτὸς ἤθελον εἰ δὲ
εὐτελῶς καὶ μετρίως τοῦτο ἐφικτὸν ἦν μοι

39 καθάπερ γὰρ οἶνον κατὰ μόνας πίνειν ὡσαύτως δὲ καὶ ὕδωρ πάλιν

[Vul](../vul/ma2015.md)

1 Nicanor autem, ut comperit Judam esse in locis Samariæ, cogitavit cum
omni impetu die sabbati committere bellum.

2 Judæis vero qui illum per necessitatem sequebantur, dicentibus: Ne ita
ferociter et barbare feceris, sed honorem tribue diei sanctificationis,
et honora eum qui universa conspicit:

3 ille infelix interrogavit si est potens in cælo, qui imperavit agi
diem sabbatorum.

4 Et respondentibus illis: Est Dominus vivus ipse in cælo potens, qui
jussit agi septimam diem:

5 at ille ait: Et ego potens sum super terram qui impero sumi arma, et
negotia regis impleri. Tamen non obtinuit ut consilium perficeret.

6 Et Nicanor quidem cum summa superbia erectus, cogitaverat commune
trophæum statuere de Juda.  

7 Machabæus autem semper confidebat cum omni spe auxilium sibi a Deo
affuturum:

8 et hortabatur suos ne formidarent ad adventum nationum, sed in mente
haberent adjutoria sibi facta de cælo, et nunc sperarent ab Omnipotente
sibi affuturam victoriam.

9 Et allocutus eos de lege et prophetis, admonens etiam certamina quæ
fecerant prius, promptiores constituit eos:

10 et ita animis eorum erectis simul ostendebat gentium fallaciam, et
juramentorum prævaricationem.

11 Singulos autem illorum armavit, non clypei et hastæ munitione, sed
sermonibus optimis et exhortationibus, exposito digno fide somnio, per
quod universos lætificavit.

12 Erat autem hujuscemodi visus: Oniam, qui fuerat summus sacerdos,
virum bonum et benignum, verecundum visu, modestum moribus, et eloquio
decorum, et qui a puero in virtutibus exercitatus sit, manus
protendentem orare pro omni populo Judæorum.

13 Post hoc apparuisse et alium virum ætate et gloria mirabilem, et
magni decoris habitudine circa illum.

14 Respondentem vero Oniam dixisse: Hic est fratrum amator, et populi
Israël: hic est qui multum orat pro populo et universa sancta civitate,
Jeremias propheta Dei.

15 Extendisse autem Jeremiam dextram, et dedisse Judæ gladium aureum,
dicentem:

16 Accipe sanctum gladium munus a Deo, in quo dejicies adversarios
populi mei Israël.

17 Exhortati itaque Judæ sermonibus bonis valde, de quibus extolli
posset impetus, et animi juvenum confortari, statuerunt dimicare et
confligere fortiter: ut virtus de negotiis judicaret, eo quod civitas
sancta et templum periclitarentur.

18 Erat enim pro uxoribus et filiis, itemque pro fratribus et cognatis,
minor sollicitudo: maximus vero et primus pro sanctitate timor erat
templi.

19 Sed et eos qui in civitate erant, non minima sollicitudo habebat pro
his qui congressuri erant.

20 Et cum jam omnes sperarent judicium futurum, hostesque adessent atque
exercitus esset ordinatus, bestiæ equitesque opportuno in loco
compositi,

21 considerans Machabæus adventum multitudinis, et apparatum varium
armorum, et ferocitatem bestiarum, extendens manus in cælum, prodigia
facientem Dominum invocavit, qui non secundum armorum potentiam, sed
prout ipsi placet, dat dignis victoriam.

22 Dixit autem invocans hoc modo: Tu Domine, qui misisti angelum tuum
sub Ezechia rege Juda, et interfecisti de castris Sennacherib centum
octoginta quinque millia:

23 et nunc, dominator cælorum, mitte angelum tuum bonum ante nos in
timore et tremore magnitudinis brachii tui,

24 ut metuant qui cum blasphemia veniunt adversus sanctum populum tuum.
Et hic quidem ita peroravit.  

25 Nicanor autem et qui cum ipso erant, cum tubis et canticis
admovebant.

26 Judas vero et qui cum eo erant, invocato Deo, per orationes congressi
sunt:

27 manu quidem pugnantes, sed Dominum cordibus orantes, prostraverunt
non minus triginta quinque millia, præsentia Dei magnifice delectati.

28 Cumque cessassent, et cum gaudio redirent, cognoverunt Nicanorem
ruisse cum armis suis.

29 Facto itaque clamore, et perturbatione excitata, patria voce
omnipotentem Dominum benedicebant.

30 Præcepit autem Judas, qui per omnia corpore et animo mori pro civibus
paratus erat, caput Nicanoris, et manum cum humero abscissam,
Jerosolymam perferri.

31 Quo cum pervenisset, convocatis contribulibus et sacerdotibus ad
altare, accersiit et eos qui in arce erant.

32 Et ostenso capite Nicanoris, et manu nefaria quam extendens contra
domum sanctam omnipotentis Dei magnifice gloriatus est.

33 Linguam etiam impii Nicanoris præcisam jussit particulatim avibus
dari: manum autem dementis contra templum suspendi.

34 Omnes igitur cæli benedixerunt Dominum, dicentes: Benedictus qui
locum suum incontaminatum servavit.

35 Suspendit autem Nicanoris caput in summa arce, ut evidens esset, et
manifestum signum auxilii Dei.

36 Itaque omnes communi consilio decreverunt nullo modo diem istum
absque celebritate præterire:

37 habere autem celebritatem tertiadecima die mensis Adar, quod dicitur
voce syriaca, pridie Mardochæi diei.  

38 Igitur his erga Nicanorem gestis, et ex illis temporibus ab Hebræis
civitate possessa, ego quoque in his faciam finem sermonis.

39 Et si quidem bene, et ut historiæ competit, hoc et ipse velim: sin
autem minus digne, concedendum est mihi.

40 Sicut enim vinum semper bibere, aut semper aquam, contrarium est;
alternis autem uti, delectabile: ita legentibus si semper exactus sit
sermo, non erit gratus. Hic ergo erit consummatus.
