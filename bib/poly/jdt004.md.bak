### Judith 4

[Apo](../apo/jdt004.md)

1 Now the children of Israel, that dwelt in Judea, heard all that
Holofernes the chief captain of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians had
done to the nations, and after what manner he had spoiled all their
temples, and brought them to nought.

2 Therefore they were exceedingly afraid of him, and were troubled for
Jerusalem, and for the temple of the Lord their God:

3 For they were newly returned from the captivity, and all the people of
Judea were lately gathered together: and the vessels, and the altar, and
the house, were sanctified after the profanation.

4 Therefore they sent into all the coasts of Samaria, and the villages
and to Bethoron, and Belmen, and Jericho, and to Choba, and Esora, and
to the valley of Salem:

5 And possessed themselves beforehand of all the tops of the high
mountains, and fortified the villages that were in them, and laid up
victuals for the provision of war: for their fields were of late reaped.

6 Also Joacim the high priest, which was in those days in Jerusalem,
wrote to them that dwelt in Bethulia, and Betomestham, which is over
against Esdraelon toward the open country, near to Dothaim,

7 Charging them to keep the passages of the hill country: for by them
there was an entrance into Judea, and it was easy to stop them that
would come up, because the passage was straight, for two men at the
most.

8 And the children of Israel did as Joacim the high priest had commanded
them, with the ancients of all the people of Israel, which dwelt at
Jerusalem.

9 Then every man of Israel cried to God with great fervency, and with
great vehemency did they humble their souls:

10 Both they, and their wives and their children, and their cattle, and
every stranger and hireling, and their servants bought with money, put
sackcloth upon their loins.

11 Thus every man and women, and the little children, and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, fell before the temple, and cast ashes upon
their heads, and spread out their sackcloth before the face of the Lord:
also they put sackcloth about the altar,

12 And cried to the God of Israel all with one consent earnestly, that
he would not give their children for a prey, and their wives for a
spoil, and the cities of their inheritance to destruction, and the
sanctuary to profanation and reproach, and for the nations to rejoice
at.

13 So God heard their prayers, and looked upon their afflictions: for
the people fasted many days in all Judea and Jerusalem before the
sanctuary of the Lord Almighty.

14 And Joacim the high priest, and all the priests that stood before the
Lord, and they which ministered unto the Lord, had their loins girt with
sackcloth, and offered the daily burnt offerings, with the vows and free
gifts of the people,

15 And had ashes on their mitres, and cried unto the Lord with all their
power, that he would look upon all the house of Israel graciously.

1 καὶ ἤκουσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν τῇ Ιουδαίᾳ πάντα ὅσα
ἐποίησεν Ολοφέρνης τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ὁ ἀρχιστράτηγος Ναβουχοδονοσορ βασιλέως
Ἀσσυρίων καὶ ὃν τρόπον ἐσκύλευσεν πάντα τὰ ἱερὰ αὐτῶν καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὰ
εἰς ἀφανισμόν

2 καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν σφόδρα σφόδρα ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ καὶ περὶ Ιερουσαλημ
καὶ τοῦ ναοῦ κυρίου θεοῦ αὐτῶν ἐταράχθησαν

3 ὅτι προσφάτως ἦσαν ἀναβεβηκότες ἐκ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας καὶ νεωστὶ πᾶς ὁ
λαὸς συνελέλεκτο τῆς Ιουδαίας καὶ τὰ σκεύη καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον καὶ ὁ
οἶκος ἐκ τῆς βεβηλώσεως ἡγιασμένα ἦν

4 καὶ ἀπέστειλαν εἰς πᾶν ὅριον Σαμαρείας καὶ Κωνα καὶ Βαιθωρων καὶ
Βελμαιν καὶ Ιεριχω καὶ εἰς Χωβα καὶ Αισωρα καὶ τὸν αὐλῶνα Σαλημ

5 καὶ προκατελάβοντο πάσας τὰς κορυφὰς τῶν ὀρέων τῶν ὑψηλῶν καὶ
ἐτείχισαν τὰς ἐν αὐτοῖς κώμας καὶ παρέθεντο εἰς ἐπισιτισμὸν εἰς
παρασκευὴν πολέμου ὅτι προσφάτως ἦν τὰ πεδία αὐτῶν τεθερισμένα

6 καὶ ἔγραψεν Ιωακιμ ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας ὃς ἦν ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐν
Ιερουσαλημ τοῖς κατοικοῦσι Βαιτυλουα καὶ Βαιτομεσθαιμ ἥ ἐστιν ἀπέναντι
Εσδρηλων κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ πεδίου τοῦ πλησίον Δωθαϊμ

7 λέγων διακατασχεῖν τὰς ἀναβάσεις τῆς ὀρεινῆς ὅτι δι᾽ αὐτῶν ἦν ἡ
εἴσοδος εἰς τὴν Ιουδαίαν καὶ ἦν εὐχερῶς διακωλῦσαι αὐτοὺς προσβαίνοντας
στενῆς τῆς προσβάσεως οὔσης ἐπ᾽ ἄνδρας τοὺς πάντας δύο

8 καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ καθὰ συνέταξεν αὐτοῖς Ιωακιμ ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ
μέγας καὶ ἡ γερουσία παντὸς δήμου Ισραηλ οἳ ἐκάθηντο ἐν Ιερουσαλημ

9 καὶ ἀνεβόησαν πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ισραηλ πρὸς τὸν θεὸν ἐν ἐκτενείᾳ μεγάλῃ καὶ
ἐταπείνωσαν τὰς ψυχὰς αὐτῶν ἐν ἐκτενείᾳ μεγάλῃ

10 αὐτοὶ καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ νήπια αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ κτήνη αὐτῶν καὶ
πᾶς πάροικος καὶ μισθωτὸς καὶ ἀργυρώνητος αὐτῶν ἐπέθεντο σάκκους ἐπὶ τὰς
ὀσφύας αὐτῶν

11 καὶ πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ισραηλ καὶ γυνὴ καὶ τὰ παιδία οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν
Ιερουσαλημ ἔπεσον κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ ναοῦ καὶ ἐσποδώσαντο τὰς κεφαλὰς
αὐτῶν καὶ ἐξέτειναν τοὺς σάκκους αὐτῶν κατὰ πρόσωπον κυρίου

12 καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον σάκκῳ περιέβαλον καὶ ἐβόησαν πρὸς τὸν θεὸν Ισραηλ
ὁμοθυμαδὸν ἐκτενῶς τοῦ μὴ δοῦναι εἰς διαρπαγὴν τὰ νήπια αὐτῶν καὶ τὰς
γυναῖκας εἰς προνομὴν καὶ τὰς πόλεις τῆς κληρονομίας αὐτῶν εἰς ἀφανισμὸν
καὶ τὰ ἅγια εἰς βεβήλωσιν καὶ ὀνειδισμὸν ἐπίχαρμα τοῖς ἔθνεσιν

13 καὶ εἰσήκουσεν κύριος τῆς φωνῆς αὐτῶν καὶ εἰσεῖδεν τὴν θλῖψιν αὐτῶν
καὶ ἦν ὁ λαὸς νηστεύων ἡμέρας πλείους ἐν πάσῃ τῇ Ιουδαίᾳ καὶ Ιερουσαλημ
κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν ἁγίων κυρίου παντοκράτορος

14 καὶ Ιωακιμ ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας καὶ πάντες οἱ παρεστηκότες ἐνώπιον κυρίου
ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ λειτουργοῦντες κυρίῳ σάκκους περιεζωσμένοι τὰς ὀσφύας
αὐτῶν προσέφερον τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν τοῦ ἐνδελεχισμοῦ καὶ τὰς εὐχὰς καὶ τὰ
ἑκούσια δόματα τοῦ λαοῦ

15 καὶ ἦν σποδὸς ἐπὶ τὰς κιδάρεις αὐτῶν καὶ ἐβόων πρὸς κύριον ἐκ πάσης
δυνάμεως εἰς ἀγαθὸν ἐπισκέψασθαι πᾶν οἶκον Ισραηλ

[Vul](../vul/jdt004.md)

1 Tunc audientes hæc filii Israël qui habitabant in terra Juda,
timuerunt valde a facie ejus.

2 Tremor et horror invasit sensus eorum, ne hoc faceret Jerusalem et
templo Domini, quod fecerat ceteris civitatibus et templis earum.

3 Et miserunt in omnem Samariam per circuitum usque Jericho, et
præoccupaverunt omnes vertices montium:

4 et muris circumdederunt vicos suos, et congregaverunt frumenta in
præparationem pugnæ.

5 Sacerdos etiam Eliachim scripsit ad universos qui erant contra
Esdrelon, quæ est contra faciem campi magni juxta Dothain, et universos
per quos viæ transitus esse poterat,

6 ut obtinerent ascensus montium, per quos via esse poterat ad
Jerusalem, et illic custodirent ubi angustum iter esse poterat inter
montes.

7 Et fecerunt filii Israël secundum quod constituerat eis sacerdos
Domini Eliachim.

8 Et clamavit omnis populus ad Dominum instantia magna, et humiliaverunt
animas suas in jejuniis et orationibus, ipsi et mulieres eorum.

9 Et induerunt se sacerdotes ciliciis, et infantes prostraverunt contra
faciem templi Domini, et altare Domini operuerunt cilicio:

10 et clamaverunt ad Dominum Deum Israël unanimiter ne darentur in
prædam infantes eorum, et uxores eorum in divisionem, et civitates eorum
in exterminium, et sancta eorum in pollutionem, et fierent opprobrium
gentibus.

11 Tunc Eliachim sacerdos Domini magnus circuivit omnem Israël,
allocutusque est eos,

12 dicens: Scitote quoniam exaudiet Dominus preces vestras, si manentes
permanseritis in jejuniis et orationibus in conspectu Domini.

13 Memores estote Moysi servi Domini, qui Amalec confidentem in virtute
sua, et in potentia sua, et in exercitu suo, et in clypeis suis, et in
curribus suis, et in equitibus suis, non ferro pugnando, sed precibus
sanctis orando dejecit:

14 sic erunt universi hostes Israël, si perseveraveritis in hoc opere
quod cœpistis.

15 Ad hanc igitur exhortationem ejus deprecantes Dominum, permanebant in
conspectu Domini,

16 ita ut etiam hi qui offerebant Domino holocausta, præcincti ciliciis
offerrent sacrificia Domino, et erat cinis super capita eorum.

17 Et ex toto corde suo omnes orabant Deum, ut visitaret populum suum
Israël.
