### CHAP. XVI.

The first sunrise. Adam and Eve think it is a fire coming to burn them.

AFTER this Adam and Eve ceased not to stand in the cave, praying and
weeping, until the morning dawned upon them.

2 And when they saw the light returned to them, they restrained from
fear, and strengthened their hearts.

3 Then Adam began to come out of the cave. And when he came to the mouth
of it, and stood and turned his face towards the east, and saw the sun
rise in glowing rays, and felt the heat thereof on his body, he was
afraid of it, and thought in his heart that this flame came forth to
plague him.

4 He wept then, and smote upon his breast, and fell upon the earth on
his face, and made his request, saying:--

5 "O Lord, plague me not, neither consume me, nor yet take away my life
from the earth."

6 For he thought the sun was God.

7 Inasmuch as while he was in the garden and heard the voice of God and
the sound He made in the garden, and feared Him, Adam never saw the
brilliant light of the sun, neither did the flaming heat thereof touch
his body.

8 Therefore was he afraid of the sun when flaming rays of it reached
him. He thought God meant to plague him therewith all the days He had
decreed for him.

9 For Adam also said in his thoughts, as God did not plague us with
darkness, behold, He has caused this sun to rise and to plague us with
burning heat.

10 But while he was thus thinking in his heart, the Word of God came
unto him and said:--

11 "O Adam, arise and stand up. This sun is not God; but it has been
created to give light by day, of which I spake unto thee in the cave
saying, 'that the dawn would break forth, and there would be light by
day.'

12 "But I am God who comforted thee in the night."

13 And God ceased to commune with Adam.
