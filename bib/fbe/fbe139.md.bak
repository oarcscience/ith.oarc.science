### XXXII.

After Adam's sin God sends him away into the earth 'whence I took thee,'
but does not wish to ruin him for all years to come.

I SAID to him: 'Earth thou art, and into the earth whence I took thee
thou shalt go, and I will not ruin thee, but send thee whence I took
thee.

2 Then I can again take thee at My second coming!

3 And I blessed all my creatures visible and invisible. And Adam was
five and half hours in paradise.

4 And I blessed the seventh day, which is the Sabbath, on which he
rested from all his works.
