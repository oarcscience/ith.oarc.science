### CHAP. VII.

Seth marries Aklia. Adam lives to see grand children and
great-grand-children.

WHEN our father Adam saw that Seth was of a perfect heart, he wished him
to marry; lest the enemy should appear to him another time, and overcome
him.

2 So Adam said to his son Seth, "I wish, O my son, that thou wed thy
sister Aklia, Abel's sister, that she may bear thee children, who shall
replenish the earth, according to God's promise to us.

3 "Be not afraid, O my son; there is no disgrace in it. I wish thee to
marry, from fear lest the enemy overcome thee."

4 Seth, however, did not wish to marry; but in obedience to his father
and mother, he said not a word.

5 So Adam married him to Aklia. And he was fifteen years old.

6 But when he was twenty years of age, he begat a son, whom he called
Enos; and then begat other children than him.

7 Then Enos grew up, married, and begat Cainan.

8 Cainan also grew up, married, and begat Mahalaleel.

9 Those fathers were born during Adam's life-time, and dwelt by the Cave
of Treasures.

10 Then were the days of Adam nine hundred and thirty years, and those
of Mahalaleel one hundred. But Mahalaleel, when he was grown up, loved
fasting, praying, and with hard labours, until the end of our father
Adam's days drew near.
