### CHAP. XXVIII.

The Devil pretends to lead Adam and Eve to the water to bathe.

BUT when the wily Satan saw them, that they were going to the garden, he
gathered together his host, and came in appearance upon a cloud, intent
on deceiving them.

2 But when Adam and Eve saw him thus in a vision, they thought they were
angels of God come to comfort them about their having left the garden,
or to bring them back again into it.

3 And Adam spread his hands unto God, beseeching Him to make him
understand what they were.

4 Then Satan, the hater of all good, said unto Adam, "O Adam, I am an
angel of the great God; and, behold the hosts that surround me.

5 "God has sent me and them to take thee and bring thee to the border of
the garden northwards; to the shore of the clear sea, and bathe thee and
Eve in it, and raise you to your former gladness, that ye return again
to the garden."

6 These words sank into the heart of Adam and Eve.

7 Yet God withheld His Word from Adam, and did not make him understand
at once, but waited to see his strength; whether he would be overcome as
Eve was when in the garden, or whether he would prevail.

8 Then Satan called to Adam and Eve, and said, "Behold, we go to the sea
of water," and they began to go.

9 And Adam and Eve followed them at some little distance.

10 But when they came to the mountain to the north of the garden, a very
high mountain, without any steps to the top of it, the Devil drew near
to Adam and Eve, and made them go up to the top in reality, and not in a
vision; wishing, as he did, to throw them down and kill them, and to
wipe off their name from the earth; so that this earth should remain to
him and his hosts alone.
