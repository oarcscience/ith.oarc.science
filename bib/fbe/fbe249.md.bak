# FOURTH BOOK OF MACCABEES

THIS book is like a fearful peal of thunder echoing out of the dim
horrors of ancient tyranny. It is a chapter based on persecution by
Antiochus, the tyrant of Syria, whom some called Epiphanes, The Madman.
Roman history of the first centuries records two such tyrants--the
other, Caligula, the Second Brilliant Madman.

The form of this writing is that of an oration. So carefully timed are
the risings and fallings of the speech; so devastating are its
arguments; so unfaltering is its logic; so deep its thrusts; so cool its
reasoning--that it takes its place as a sample of the sheerest
eloquence.

The keynote is--Courage. The writer begins with an impassioned statement
of the Philosophy of Inspired Reason. We like to think of this twentieth
Century as the Age of Reason and contrast it with the Age of Myths--yet
a writing such as this is a challenge to such an assumption. We find a
writer who probably belonged to the first century before the Christian
Era stating a clear-cut philosophy of Reason that is just as potent
today as it was two thousand years ago.

The setting of the observations in the torture chambers is unrelenting.
On our modern ears attuned to gentler things it strikes appallingly. The
detail's of the successive tortures (suggesting the instruments of the
Spanish Inquisition centuries later) are elaborated in a way shocking to
our taste. Even the emergence of the stoical characters of the Old man,
the Seven Brothers, and the Mother, does nothing to soften the ferocity
with which this orator conjures Courage.

The ancient Fathers of the Christian Church carefully preserved this
book (we have it from a Syrian translation) as a work of high moral
value and teaching, and it was undoubtedly familiar to many of the early
Christian martyrs, who were aroused to the pitch of martyrdom by reading
it.
