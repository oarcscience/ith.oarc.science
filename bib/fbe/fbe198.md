### ODE 3.

The first words of this Ode have disappeared.

1 .    .    .   I put on:  
2 And his members are with him. And on them do I stand, and He loves
me:  
3 For I should not have known how to love the Lord, if He had not loved
me.  
4 For who is able to distinguish love, except the one that is loved?  
5 I love the Beloved, and my soul loves Him:  
6 And where His rest is, there also am I;  
7 And I shall be no stranger, for with the Lord Most High and Merciful
there is no grudging.  
8 I have been united to I-run, for the Lover has found the Beloved,  
9 And because I shall love Him that, is the Son, I shall become a son;  
10 For he that is joined to Him that is immortal, will also himself
become immortal;  
11 And he who has pleasure in the Living One, will become living.  
12 This is the Spirit of the Lord, which doth not lie, which teacheth
the sons of men to know His ways.  
13 Be wise and understanding and vigilant. Hallelujah.
