### ODE 26.

Remarkable praise.

1 I poured out praise to the Lord, for I am His:  
2 And I will speak His holy song, for my heart is with Him.  
3 For His harp is in my hands, and the Odes of His rest shall not be
silent.  
4 I will cry unto him from my whole heart: I will praise and exalt Him
with all my members.  
5 For from the east and even to the west is His praise:  
6 And from the south and even to the north is the confession of Him:  
7 And from the top of the hills to their utmost bound is His
perfection.  
8 Who can write the Psalms of the Lord, or who read them?  
9 Or who can train his soul for life, that his soul may be saved,  
10 Or who can rest on the Most High, so that with His mouth he may
speak?  
11 Who is able to interpret the wonders of the Lord?  
12 For he who could interpret would be dissolved and would become that
which is interpreted.  
13 For it suffices to know and to rest: for in rest the singers stand,  
14 Like a river which has an abundant fountain, and flows to the help of
them that seek it. Hallelujah.
