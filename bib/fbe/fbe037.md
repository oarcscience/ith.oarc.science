### CHAP. XXXII.

Adam and Eve go into the water to pray.

AND Adam and Eve remained in the Cave of Treasures until the seventh
day; they neither ate of the fruit of the earth, nor drank water.

2 And when it dawned on the eighth day, Adam said to Eve, "O Eve, we
prayed God to give us somewhat from the garden, and He sent His angels
who brought us what we had desired.

3 "But now, arise, let us go to the sea of water we saw at first, and
let us stand in it, praying that God will again be favourable to us and
take us back to the garden; or give us something; or that He will give
us comfort in some other land than this in which we are."

4 Then Adam and Eve came out of the cave, went and stood on the border
of the sea in which they had before thrown themselves, and Adam said to
Eve:--

5 "Come, go down into this place, and come not out of it until the end
of thirty days, when I shall come to thee. And pray to God with fervent
heart and a sweet voice, to forgive us.

6 "And I will go to another place, and go down into it, and do like
thee."

7 Then Eve went down into the water, as Adam had commanded her. Adam
also went down into the water; and they stood praying; and besought the
Lord to forgive them their offence, and to restore them to their former
state.

8 And they stood thus praying, unto the end of the five-and-thirty days.
