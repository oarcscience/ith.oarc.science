### XLVIII.

Of the sun's passage along the seven circles.

THAT the sun go along the seven heavenly circles, which are the,
appointment of one hundred and eighty-two thrones, that it go down on a
short day, and again one hundred and eighty-two, that it go down on a
big day, and he has two thrones on which he rests, revolving hither and
thither above the thrones of the months, from the seventeenth day of the
month Tsivan it goes down to the month Thevan, from the seventeenth of
Thevan it goes up.

3 And thus it goes close to the earth, then the earth is and makes grow
its fruit, and when it goes away, then the earth is sad, and trees and
all fruits have no florescence.

4 All this he measured, with good measurement of hours, and fixed a
measure by his wisdom, of the visible and the invisible.

5 From the invisible he made all things visible, himself being
invisible.

6 Thus I make known to you, my children, and distribute the books to
your children, into all your generations, and amongst the nations who
shall have the sense to fear God, let them receive them, and may they
come to love them more than any food or earthly sweets, and read them
and apply themselves to them.

7 And those who understand not the Lord, who fear not God, who accept
not, but reject, who do not receive them (*sc*. the books), a terrible
judgement awaits these.

8 Blessed is the man who shall bear their yoke and shall drag them
along, for he shall be released on the day of the great judgement.
