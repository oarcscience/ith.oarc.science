<p align="CENTER">The beauty of God's creation</i>.</p> 
<p>1 As the work of the husbandman is the ploughshare: and the work of the steersman is the guidance of the ship:<br> 2 So also my work is the Psalm of the Lord: my craft and my occupation are in His praises:<br> 3 Because His love bath nourished my heart, and even to my lips His fruits He poured out.<br> 4 For my love is the Lord, and therefore I will sing unto Him:<br> 5 For I am made strong in His praise, and I have faith in Him.<br> 6 I will open my mouth and His spirit will utter in me the glory of the Lord and His beauty; the work of His hands and the operation of His fingers:<br> 7 The multitude of His mercies and the strength of His word.<br> 8 For the word of the Lord searches out all things, both the invisible and that which reveals His thought;<br> 9 For the eye sees His works, and the ear hears His thought;<br> 10 He spread out the earth and He settled the waters in the sea:<br> 11 He measured the heavens and fixed the stars: and He established the creation and set it up:<br> 12 And He rested from His works:<br> 13 And created things run in their courses, and do their works:<br> 14 And they know not how to stand and be idle; and His heavenly hosts are subject to His word.<br> 15 The treasure-chamber of the light is the sun, and the treasury of the darkness is the night:<br> 16 And He made the sun for the day that it may be bright, but night brings darkness over the face of the land;<br> 17 And their alternations one to the other speak the beauty of God:<br> IS And there is nothing that is without the Lord; for He was before any thing came into being:<br> 19 And the worlds were made by His word, and by the thought of His heart. Glory and honour to His name. Hallelujah.</p>
