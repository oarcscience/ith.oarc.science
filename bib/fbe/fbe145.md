### XXXVIII.

Mathusal continued to have hope and to await his father Enoch at his
couch day and night.

AND the Lord said to those men who first led me up: 'Let Enoch go down
on to earth with you, and await him till the determined day.'

2 And they placed me by night on my couch.

3 And Mathusal expecting my coming, keeping watch by day and by night at
my couch, was filled with awe when he heard my coming, and I told him,
'Let all my household come together, that I tell them everything.'
