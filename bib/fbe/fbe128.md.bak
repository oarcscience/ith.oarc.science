### XXI.

Of how the angels here left Enoch, at the end of the seventh Heaven, and
went away from him unseen.

AND the cherubim and seraphim standing about the throne, the six-winged
and many-eyed ones do not depart, standing before the Lord's face doing
his will, and cover his whole throne, singing with gentle voice before
the Lord's face: 'Holy, holy, holy, Lord Ruler *of* Sabaoth, heavens and
earth are full of Thy glory.'

2 When I saw all these things, those men said to me: 'Enoch, thus far is
it commanded us to journey with thee,' and those men went away from me
and thereupon I saw them not.

3 And I remained alone at the end of the seventh heaven and became
afraid, and fell on my face and said to myself: 'Woe is me, what has
befallen me?'

4 And the Lord sent one of his glorious ones, the archangel Gabriel, and
*he* said to me: 'Have courage, Enoch, do not fear, arise before the
Lord's face into eternity, arise, come with me.'

5 And I answered him, and said in myself: 'My Lord, my soul is departed
from me, from terror and trembling,' and I called to the men who led me
up to this place, on them I relied, and *it is* with them I go before
the Lord's face.

6 And Gabriel caught me up, as a leaf caught up by the wind, and placed
me before the Lord's face.

7 And I saw the eighth Heaven, which is called in the Hebrew tongue
Muzaloth, changer of the seasons, of drought, and of wet, and of the
twelve signs of the zodiac, which are above the seventh Heaven.

8 And I saw the ninth Heaven, which is called in Hebrew Kuchavim, where
are the heavenly homes of the twelve signs of the zodiac.
