### CHAP. XII.

Seth's family affairs. His death. The headship of Enos. How the outcast
branch of Adam's family fared.

THEN Seth, the just, called his son Enos, and Cainan, son of Enos, and
Mahalaleel, son of Cainan, and said unto them:--

2 "As my end is near, I wish to build a roof over the altar on which
gifts are offered."

3 They hearkened to his commandment and went out, all of them, both old
and young, and worked hard at it, and built a beautiful roof over the
altar.

4 And Seth's thought in so doing, was that a blessing should come upon
his children on the

mountain; and that he should present an offering for them before his
death.

5 Then when the building of the roof was completed, he commanded them to
make offerings. They worked diligently at these, and brought them to
Seth their father who took them and offered them upon the altar; and
prayed God to accept their offerings, to have mercy on the souls of his
children, and to keep them from the hand of Satan.

6 And God accepted his offering, and sent His blessing upon him and upon
his children. And then God made a promise to Seth, saying, "At the end
of the great five days and a half, concerning which I have made a
promise to thee and to thy father, I will send My Word and save thee and
thy seed."

7 Then Seth and his children, and his children's children, met together,
and came down from the altar, and went to the Cave of Treasures--where
they prayed, and blessed themselves in the body of our father Adam, and
anointed themselves with it.

8 But Seth abode in the Cave of Treasures, a few days, and then
suffered--sufferings unto death.

9 Then Enos, his first-born son, came to him, with Cainan, his son, and
Mahalaleel, Cainan's son, and Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, and Enoch,
Jared's son, with their wives and children to receive a blessing from
Seth.

10 Then Seth prayed over them, and blessed them, and adjured them by the
blood of Abel the just, saying, "I beg of you, my children, not to let
one of you go down from this Holy and pure Mountain.

11 Make no fellowship with the children of Cain the murderer and the
sinner, who killed his brother; for ye know, O my children, that we flee
from him, and from all his sin with all our might because he killed his
brother Abel."

12 After having said this, Seth blessed Enos, his first-born son, and
commanded him habitually to minister in purity before the body of our
father Adam, all the days of his life; then, also, to go at times to the
altar which he Seth had built. And he commanded him to feed his people
in righteousness, in judgment and purity all the days of his life.

13 Then the limbs of Seth were loosened; his hands and feet lost all
power; his mouth became dumb and unable to speak; and he gave up the
ghost and died the day after his nine hundred and twelfth year; on the
twenty-seventh day of the month Abib; Enoch being then twenty years old.

14 Then they wound up [carefully](errata.htm#2.md) the body of Seth, and
embalmed him with sweet spices, and laid him in the Cave of Treasures,
on the right side of our father Adam's body, and they mourned for him
forty days. They offered gifts for him, as they had done for our father
Adam.

15 After the death of Seth Enos rose at the head of his people, whom he
fed in righteousness, and judgment, as his father had commanded him.

16 But by the time Enos was eight hundred and twenty years old, Cain had
a large progeny; for they married frequently, being given to animal
lusts; until the land below the mountain, was filled with them.
