### LIII.

\[*Let us not say: 'Our father is before God, he will stand forward for
us on the day of judgement,' for there father cannot help son, nor yet
son father*.\]

AND now, my children, do not say: 'Our father is standing before God,
and is praying for our sins,' for there is there no helper of any man
who has sinned.

2 You see how I wrote all works of every man, before his creation, *all*
that is done amongst all men for all time, and none can tell or relate
my handwriting, because the Lord sees all the imaginings of man, how
they are vain, where they lie in the treasure-houses of the heart.

3 And now, my children, mark well all the words of your father, that I
tell you, lest you regret, saying: 'Why did our father not tell us?'
