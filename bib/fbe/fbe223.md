### ODE 29.

Again reminiscent of the Psalms, of David.

1 The Lord is my hope: in Him I shall not be confounded.  
2 For according to His praise He made me, and according to His goodness
even so He gave unto me:  
3 And according to His mercies He exalted me: and according to His
excellent beauty He set me on high:  
4 And brought me up out of the depths of Sheol: and from the mouth of
death He drew me:  
5 And thou didst lay my enemies low, and He justified me by His grace.  
6 For I believed in the Lord's Messiah: and it appeared to me that He is
the Lord;  
7 And He showed him His sign: and He led me by His light, and gave me
the rod of His power;  
8 That I might subdue the imaginations of the peoples; and the power of
the men of might to bring them low:  
9 To make war by His word, and to take victory by His power.  
10 And the Lord overthrew my enemy by His word: and <span
id="page_135">p. 135</span> he became like the stubble which the wind
carries away;  
11 And I gave praise to the Most High because He exalted me His servant
and the son of His handmaid. Hallelujah.
