### CHAP. IX.

The death of Adam.

WHEN Adam had ended his commandment to Seth, his limbs were loosened,
his hands and feet lost all power, his mouth became dumb, and his tongue
ceased altogether to speak. He closed his eyes and gave up the ghost.

2 But when his children saw that he was dead, they threw themselves over
him, men and women, old and young, weeping.

3 The death of Adam took place at the end of nine hundred and thirty
years that be lived upon the earth; on the fifteenth day of Barmudeh,
after the reckoning of an epact of the sun, at the ninth hour.

4 It was on a Friday, the very day on which be was created, and on which
he rested; and the hour at which he died, was the same as that at which
he came out of the garden.

5 Then Seth wound him up well, and embalmed him with plenty of sweet
spices, from sacred trees and from the Holy Mountain; and be laid his
body on the eastern side of the inside of the cave, the side of the
incense; and placed in front of him a lamp-stand kept burning.

6 Then his children stood before him weeping and wailing over him the
whole night until break of day.

7 Then Seth and big son Enos, and Cainan, the son of Enos, went out and
took good offerings to present unto the Lord, and they came to the altar
upon which Adam offered gifts to God, when he did offer.

8 But Eve said to them "Wait until we have first asked God to accept our
offering, and to keep by Him the Soul of Adam His servant, and to take
it up to rest."

9 And they all stood up an prayed.
