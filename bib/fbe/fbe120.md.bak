THOSE men bore me away to the east, and placed me at the sun's gates,
where the sun goes forth according to the regulation of the seasons and
the circuit of the months of the whole year, and the number of the hours
day and night,

quarter of one stadium, and I measured *them* truly, and understood
their size *to be* so much, through which the sun goes forth, and goes
to the west, and is made even, and rises throughout all the months, and
turns back again from the six gates according to the succession of the
seasons; thus *the period* of the whole year is finished after the
returns of the four seasons,
