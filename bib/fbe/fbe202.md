### ODE 8.

Note the sudden transition from the person of the Psalmist to the person
of the Lord (v. 10). This is like the canonical Psalter in style.

1 Open ye, open ye your hearts to the exultation of the Lord:  
2 And let your love be multiplied from the heart and even to the lips,  
3 To bring forth fruit to the Lord \[fruit\], holy \[fruit\], and to
talk with watchfulness in His light.  
4 Rise up, and stand erect, ye who sometime were brought low:  
5 Tell forth ye who were in silence, that your mouth hath been opened.  
6 Ye, therefore, that were despised, be henceforth lifted up, because
your righteousness hath been exalted.  
7 For the right hand of the Lord is with you: and He is your helper:  
8 And peace was prepared for you, before ever your war was.  
9 Hear the word of truth, and receive the knowledge of the Most High.  
10 Your flesh has not known what I am saying to you neither have your
hearts known what I am showing to you.  
11 Keep my secret, ye who are kept by it:  
12 Keep my faith, ye who are kept by it.  
13 And understand my knowledge, ye who know me in truth.  
14 Love me with affection, ye who love:  
15 For I do not turn away my face from them that are mine;  
16 For I know them, and before they came into being I took knowledge of
them, and on their faces I set my seal:  
17 I fashioned their members: my own breasts I prepared for them, that
they might drink my holy milk and live thereby.  
181 took pleasure in them and am not ashamed of them:  
19 For my workmanship are they and the strength of my thoughts:  
20 Who then shall rise up against my handiwork, or who is there that is
not subject to them?  
21 I willed and fashioned mind and heart: and they are mine, and by my
own right hand I set my elect ones:  
22 And my righteousness goeth before them and they shall not be deprived
of my name, for it is with them.  
23 Ask, and abound and abide in the love of the Lord,  
24 And yet beloved ones in the Beloved: those who are kept, in Him that
liveth:  
25 And they that are saved in Him that was saved;  
26 And ye shall be found incorrupt in all ages to the name of your
Father. Hallelujah.
