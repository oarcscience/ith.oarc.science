### ODE 40.

A song of praise without equal.

1 As the honey distills from the comb of the bees,  
2 And the milk flows from the woman that loves her children;  
3 So also is my hope on Thee, my God.  
4 As the fountain gushes out its water,  
5 So my heart gushes out the praise of the Lord and my lips utter praise
to Him, and my tongue His psalms. <span id="page_139">p. 139</span>  
6 And my face exults with His gladness, and my spirit exults in His
love, and my soul shines in Him:  
7 And reverence confides in Him; and redemption in Him stands assured:  
8 And His inheritance is immortal life, and those who participate in it
are incorrupt. Hallelujah.
