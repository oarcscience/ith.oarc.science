### ODE 18.

A man who had a spiritual experience brings a message.

1 My heart was lifted up in the love of the Most High and was enlarged:
that I might praise Him for His name's sake.  
2 My members were strengthened that they might not fall from His
strength.  
3 Sicknesses removed from my body, and it stood to the Lord by His will.
For His kingdom is true.  
4 O Lord, for the sake of them that are deficient do not remove thy word
from me!  
5 Neither for the sake of their works do thou restrain from me thy
perfection!  
6 Let not the luminary be conquered by the darkness; nor let truth flee
away from falsehood.  
7 Thou wilt appoint me to victory; our Salvation is thy right hand. And
thou wilt receive men from all quarters.  
8 And thou wilt preserve whosoever is held in evils:  
9 Thou art my God. Falsehood and death are not in thy mouth:  
10 For thy will is perfection; and vanity thou knowest not,  
11 Nor does it know thee.  
12 And error thou knowest not,  
13 Neither does it know thee.  
14 And ignorance appeared like a blind man; and like the foam of the
sea,  
15 And they supposed of that vain thing that it was something great;  
16 And they too came in likeness of it and became vain; and those have
understood who have known and meditated;  
17 And they have not been corrupt in their imagination; for such were in
the mind of the Lord;  
18 And they mocked at them that were walking in error;  
19 And they spake truth from the inspiration which the Most High
breathed into them; Praise and great comeliness to His name Hallelujah.
