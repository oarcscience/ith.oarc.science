### LVI.

Methosalam asks of his father blessing, that he (*sc*. Methosalam) may
make him (*sc*. Enoch) food to eat.

METHOSALAM having answered his father Enoch, said: 'What is agreeable to
thy eyes, father, that I may make before thy face, that thou mayst bless
our dwellings, and thy sons, and that thy people may be made glorious
through thee, and then *that* thou mayst depart thus, as the Lord said?,

2 Enoch answered to his son Methosalam *and* said: 'Hear, child, from
the time when the Lord anointed me with the ointment of his glory,
*there has been no food* in me, and my soul remembers not earthly
enjoyment, neither do I want anything earthly!
