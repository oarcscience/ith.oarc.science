### CHAP. VI.

God's admonition to Adam and Eve in which he points out how and why they
sinned.

BUT God looked upon them; for they had killed themselves through great
grief.

2 But He would raise them and comfort them.

3 He, therefore, sent His Word unto them; that they should stand and be
raised forthwith.

4 And the Lord said unto Adam and Eve, "You transgressed of your own
free will, until you came out of the garden in which I had placed you.

5 "Of your own free will have you transgressed through your desire for
divinity, greatness, and an exalted state, such as I have; so that I
deprived you of the bright nature in which you then were, and I made you
come out of the garden to this land, rough and full of trouble.

6 "If only you had not transgressed My commandment and had kept My law,
and had not eaten of the fruit of the tree, near which I told you not to
come! And there were fruit trees in the garden better than that one.

7 "But the wicked Satan who continued not in his first estate, nor kept
his faith; in whom was no good intent towards Me, and who though I had
created him, yet set Me at naught, and sought the Godhead, so that I
hurled him down from heaven,--he it is who made the tree appear pleasant
in your eyes, until you ate of it, by hearkening to him.

8 "Thus have you transgressed My commandment, and therefore have I
brought upon you all these sorrows.

9 "For I am God the Creator, who, when I created My creatures, did not
intend to destroy them. But after they had sorely roused My anger, I
punished them with grievous plagues, until they repent.

10 "But, if on the contrary, they still continue hardened in their
transgression, they shall be under a curse for ever."
