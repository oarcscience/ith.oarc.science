### XXXIV.

God convicts the idolaters and sodomitic fornicators, and therefore
brings down a deluge upon them.

THEY have rejected my commandments and my yoke, worthless seed has come
up, not fearing God, and they would not bow down to me, but have begun
to bow down to vain gods, and denied my unity, and have laden the whole
earth with untruths, offences, abominable lecheries namely one with
another, and all manner of other unclean wickednesses, which are
disgusting to relate.

2 And therefore I will bring down a deluge upon the earth and will
destroy all men, and the whole earth will crumble together into great
darkness.
