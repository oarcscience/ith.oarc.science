### ODE 10.

A vigorous little Ode in which Christ Himself is the speaker.

1 The Lord hath directed my mouth by His word: and He hath opened my
heart by His light: and He hath caused to dwell in me His deathless
life;  
2 And gave me that I might speak the fruit of His peace:  
3 To convert the souls of them who are willing to come to Him; and to
lead captive a good captivity for freedom.  
4 I was strengthened and made mighty and took the world captive;  
5 And it became to me for the praise of the Most High, and of God my
Father.  
6 And the Gentiles were gathered together who were scattered abroad.  
7 And I was unpolluted by my love for them, because they confessed me in
high places: and the traces of the light were set upon their heart:  
8 And they walked in my life and were saved and became my people for
ever and ever. Hallelujah.
