### CHAP. X.

Their bodies need water after they leave the Garden.

THEN God, merciful and gracious, looked upon them thus lying in the
water, and nigh unto death, and sent an angel, who brought them out of
the water, and laid them on the seashore as dead.

2 Then the angel went up to God, was welcome, and said, "O God, Thy
creatures have breathed their last."

3 Then God sent His Word unto Adam and Eve, who raised them from their
death.

4 And Adam said, after he was raised, "O God, while we were in the
garden we did not require, or care for this water; but since we came to
this land we cannot do without it."

5 Then God said to Adam, "While thou wast under My command and wast a
bright angel, thou knewest not this water.

6 "But after that thou hast transgressed My commandment, thou canst not
do without water, wherein to wash thy body and make it grow; for it is
now like that of beasts, and is in want of water."

7 When Adam and Eve heard these words from God, they wept a bitter cry;
and Adam entreated God to let him return into the garden, and look at it
a second time.

8 But God said unto Adam, "I have made thee a promise; when that promise
is fulfilled, I will bring thee back into the garden, thee and thy
righteous seed."

9 And God ceased to commune with Adam.
