<p align="CENTER">The Devil pretends to lead Adam and Eve to the water to bathe</i>.</p> 
<p>BUT when the wily Satan saw them, that they were going to the garden, he gathered together his host, and came in appearance upon a cloud, intent on deceiving them.</p> 
<p>2 But when Adam and Eve saw him thus in a vision, they thought they were angels of God come to comfort them about their having left the garden, or to bring them back again into it.</p> 
<p>3 And Adam spread his hands unto God, beseeching Him to make him understand what they were.</p> 
<p>4 Then Satan, the hater of all good, said unto Adam, "O Adam, I am an angel of the great God; and, behold the hosts that surround me.</p> 
<p>5 "God has sent me and them to take thee and bring thee to the border of the garden northwards; to the shore of the clear sea, and bathe thee and Eve in it, and raise you to your former gladness, that ye return again to the garden."</p> 
<p>6 These words sank into the heart of Adam and Eve.</p> 
<p>7 Yet God withheld His Word from Adam, and did not make him understand at once, but waited to see his strength; whether he would be overcome as Eve was when in the garden, or whether he would prevail.</p> 
<p>8 Then Satan called to Adam and Eve, and said, "Behold, we go to the sea of water," and they began to go.</p> 
<p>9 And Adam and Eve followed them at some little distance.</p> 
<p>10 But when they came to the mountain to the north of the garden, a very high mountain, without any steps to the top of it, the Devil drew near to Adam and Eve, and made them go up to the top in reality, and not in a vision; wishing, as he did, to throw them down and kill them, and to wipe off their name from the earth; so that this earth should remain to him and his hosts alone.</p>
