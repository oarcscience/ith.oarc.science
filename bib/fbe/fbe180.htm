<p align="CENTER">A conversation of Solomon with the Men-pleasers</i>.</p> 
<p>Wherefore sittest thou, O profane man, in the council of the pious,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that thy heart is far removed from the Lord,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Provoking with transgressions the God of Israel?<br> Extravagant in speech, extravagant in outward seeming beyond all men,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Is he that is severe of speech in condemning sinners in judgement.<br> And his hand is first upon him as though he acted in zeal,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And yet he is himself guilty in respect of manifold sins and of wantonness.<br> His eyes are upon every woman without distinction;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His tongue lieth when he maketh contract with an oath.<br> By night and in secret he sinneth as though unseen,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With his eyes he talketh to every woman of evil compacts.<br> He is swift to enter every house with cheerfulness as though guileless.</p> 
<p>Let God remove those that live in hypocrisy in the company of the pious,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Even the life of such an one with corruption of his flesh and penury.<br> Let God reveal the deeds of the men-pleasers,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The deeds of such an one with laughter and derision;<br> That the pious may count righteous the judgement of their God,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;When sinners are removed from before the righteous,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Even the man-pleaser who uttereth law guilefully.<br> And their eyes are fixed upon any man's house that is still secure,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That they may, like the Serpent, destroy the wisdom of . . . with words of transgressors,<br> His words are deceitful that he may accomplish his wicked desire.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;He never ceaseth from scattering families as though they were orphans,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, he layeth waste a house on account of his lawless desire.<br> He deceiveth with words, saying, There is none that seeth, or judgeth.<br> He fills one house with lawlessness,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And then his eyes are fixed upon the next house,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To destroy it with words that give wing to desire.<br> Yet with all these his soul like Sheol, is not sated.</p> 
<p>Let his portion, O Lord, be dishonoured before thee;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Let him go forth groaning, and come home cursed.<br> Let his life be spent in anguish, and penury, and want, O Lord; <a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="green">p. 109</font></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Let his sleep be beset with pains and his awaking with perplexities.<br> Let sleep be withdrawn from his eyelids at night;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Let him fail dishonourably in every work of his hands.<br> Let him come home empty-handed to his house,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And his house be void of everything wherewith he could sate his appetite.<br> Let his old age be spent in childless loneliness until his removal by death.</p> 
<p>Let the flesh of the men-pleasers be rent by wild beasts,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And let the bones of the lawless lie dishonoured in the sight of the sun.<br> Let ravens peck out the eyes of the hypocrites.<br> For they have laid waste many houses of men, in dishonour,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And scattered them in their lust;<br> And they have not remembered God,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nor feared God in all these things;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;But they have provoked God's anger and vexed Him.<br> May He remove them from off the earth,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Because with deceit they beguiled the souls of the flawless.</p> 
<p>Blessed are they that fear the Lord in their flawlessness;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord shall deliver them from guileful men and sinners,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And deliver us from every stumbling-block of the lawless (men).<br> Let God destroy them that insolently work all unrighteousness,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For a great and mighty judge is the Lord our God in righteousness.</p> 
<p>Let Thy mercy, O Lord, be upon all them that love Thee.</p>
