### XX.

Hence they took Enoch into the Seventh Heaven.

AND those two men lifted me up thence on to the seventh Heaven, and I
saw there a very great light, and fiery troops of great archangels,
incorporeal forces, and dominions, orders and governments, cherubim and
seraphim, thrones and many-eyed ones, nine regiments, the Ioanit
stations of light, and I became afraid, and began to tremble with great
terror, and those men took me, and led me after them, and said to me:

2 'Have courage, Enoch, do not fear,' and showed me the Lord from afar,
sitting on His very high throne. For what is there on the tenth heaven,
since the Lord dwells here?

3 On the tenth heaven is God, in the Hebrew tongue he is called Aravat.

4 And all the heavenly troops would come and stand on the ten steps
according to their rank, and would bow down to the Lord, and would again
go to their places in joy and felicity, singing songs in the boundless
light with small and tender voices, gloriously serving him.
