### LV.

Here Enoch shows his sons, telling them with tears: 'My children, the
hour has approached for me to go up on to heaven; behold, the angels are
standing before me.'

MY children, behold, the day of my term and the time nave approached.

2 For the angels who shall go with me are standing before me and urge me
to my departure from you; they are standing here on earth, awaiting what
has been told them.

3 For to-morrow I shall go up on to heaven, to the uppermost Jerusalem
to my eternal inheritance.

4 Therefore I bid you do before the Lord's face all *his* good pleasure.
