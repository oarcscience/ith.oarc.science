*The Forgotten Books of Eden*, by Rutherford H. Platt, Jr., \[1926\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### L.

Of how none born on earth can remain hidden nor his work remain
concealed, but he (sc. God) bids us be meek, to endure attack and
insult, and not to offend widows and orphans.

I HAVE put everyman's work in writing and none born on earth can remain
hidden nor his works remain concealed.

2 I see all things.

3 Now therefore, my children, in patience and meekness spend the number
of your days, that you inherit endless life.

4 Endure for the sake of the Lord every wound, every injury, every evil
word and attack.

5 If ill-requitals befall you, return *them* not either to neighbour or
enemy, because the Lord will return *them* for you and be your avenger
on the day of great judgement, that there be no avenging here among men.

6 Whoever of you spends gold or silver for his brother's sake, he will
receive ample treasure in the world to come.

7 Injure not widows nor orphans nor strangers, lest God's wrath come
upon you.
