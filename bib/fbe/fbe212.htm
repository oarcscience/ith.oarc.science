<p>1 My heart was lifted up in the love of the Most High and was enlarged: that I might praise Him for His name's sake.<br> 2 My members were strengthened that they might not fall from His strength.<br> 3 Sicknesses removed from my body, and it stood to the Lord by His will. For His kingdom is true.<br> 4 O Lord, for the sake of them that are deficient do not remove thy word from me!<br> 5 Neither for the sake of their works do thou restrain from me thy perfection!<br> 6 Let not the luminary be conquered by the darkness; nor let truth flee away from falsehood.<br> 7 Thou wilt appoint me to victory; our Salvation is thy right hand. And thou wilt receive men from all quarters.<br> 8 And thou wilt preserve whosoever is held in evils:<br> 9 Thou art my God. Falsehood and death are not in thy mouth:<br> 10 For thy will is perfection; and vanity thou knowest not,<br> 11 Nor does it know thee.<br> 12 And error thou knowest not,<br> 13 Neither does it know thee.<br> 14 And ignorance appeared like a blind man; and like the foam of the sea,<br> 15 And they supposed of that vain thing that it was something great;<br> 16 And they too came in likeness of it and became vain; and those have understood who have known and meditated;<br> 17 And they have not been corrupt in their imagination; for such were in the mind of the Lord;<br> 18 And they mocked at them that were walking in error;<br> 19 And they spake truth from the inspiration which the Most High breathed into them; Praise and great comeliness to His name Hallelujah.</p>
