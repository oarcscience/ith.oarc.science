<p align="CENTER">The Third Son of Jacob and Leah</i>.</p> <h3 align="CENTER" align="center">CHAP. I.</h3> <i>
<p align="CENTER">Levi, the third son of Jacob and Leah. A mystic and dreamer of dreams, a prophet</i>.</p> 
<p>THE copy of the words of Levi, the things which he ordained unto his sons, according to all that they should do, and what things should befall them until the day of judgement.</p> 
<p>2 He was sound in health when he called them to him; for it had been revealed to him that he should die.</p> 
<p>3 And when they were gathered together he said to them:</p> 
<p>4 I, Levi, was born in Haran, and I came with my father to Shechem.</p> 
<p>5 And I was young, about twenty years of age, when, with Simeon, I wrought vengeance on Hamor for our sister Dinah.</p> 
<p>6 And when I was feeding the flocks in Abel-Maul, the spirit of understand of the Lord came upon me, and I saw all men corrupting their way, and that unrighteousness</p> 
<p><a name="page_227"><font size="1" color="green">p. 227</font></A></p> 
<p>had built for itself walls, and lawlessness sat upon towers.</p> 
<p>7 And I was grieving for the race of the sons of men, and I prayed to the Lord that I might be saved.</p> 
<p>8 Then there fell upon me a sleep, and I beheld a high mountain, and I was upon it.</p> 
<p>9 And behold the heavens were opened, and an angel of God said to me, Levi, enter.</p> 
<p>10 And I entered from the first heaven, and I saw there a great sea hanging.</p> 
<p>11 And further I saw a second heaven far brighter and more brilliant, for there was a boundless light also therein,</p> 
<p>12 And I said to the angel, Why is this so? And the angel said to me, Marvel not at this, for thou shalt see another heaven more brilliant and incomparable.</p> 
<p>13 And when thou hast ascended thither, Thou shalt stand near the Lord, and shalt be His minister, and shalt, declare His mysteries to men, and shalt proclaim concerning Him that shall redeem Israel.</p> 
<p>14 And by thee and Judah shall the Lord appear among men, saving every race of men.</p> 
<p>15 And from the Lord's portion shall be thy life, and He shall be thy field and vineyard, and fruits, gold, and silver.</p> 
<p>16 Hear, therefore, regarding the heavens which have been shown to thee.</p> 
<p>17 The lowest is for this cause gloomy unto thee, in that it beholds all the unrighteous deeds of men.</p> 
<p>18 And it has fire, snow, and ice made ready for the day of judgement, in the righteous judgement of God; for in it are all the spirits of the retributions for vengeance on men.</p> 
<p>19 And in the second are the hosts Of the armies which are ordained for the day of judgement, to work vengeance on the spirits of deceit and of Beliar.</p> 
<p>20 And above them are the holy ones.</p> 
<p>21 And in the highest of all dwelleth the Great Glory, far above all holiness.</p> 
<p>22 In the heaven next to it are the archangels, who minister and make propitiation to the Lord for all the sins of ignorance of the righteous;</p> 
<p>23 Offering to the Lord a sweet smelling savour, a reasonable and a bloodless offering.</p> 
<p>24 And in the heaven below this are the angels who bear answers to the angels of the presence of the Lord.</p> 
<p>25 And in the heaven next to this are thrones and dominions, in which always they offer praise to God.</p> 
<p>26 When, therefore, the Lord looketh upon us, all of us are shaken; yea, the heavens, and the earth, and the abysses are shaken at the presence of His majesty.</p> 
<p>27 But the sons of men, having no perception of these things, sin and provoke the Most High.</p>
