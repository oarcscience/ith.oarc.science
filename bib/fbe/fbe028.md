### CHAP. XXIII.

Adam and Eve gird themselves and make the first altar ever built.

THEN Adam wept more and said, "O God, have mercy on me, so far as to
take upon Thee, that which I will do."

2 But God took His Word from Adam and Eve.

3 Then Adam and Eve stood on their feet; and Adam said to Eve "Gird
thyself, and I also will gird myself." And she girded herself, as Adam
told her.

4 Then Adam and Eve took stones and placed them in the shape of an
altar; and they took leaves from the trees outside the garden, with
which they wiped, from the face of the rock, the blood they had spilled.

5 But that which had dropped on the sand, they took together with the
dust wherewith it was mingled and offered it upon the altar as an
offering unto God.

6 Then Adam and Eve stood under the altar and wept, thus entreating God,
"Forgive us our trespass <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0) and our sin,
and look upon us with Thine eye of mercy. For when we were in the garden
our praises and our hymns went up before Thee without ceasing.

7 "But when we came into this strange land, pure praise was no longer
ours, nor righteous prayer, nor understanding hearts, nor sweet
thoughts, nor just counsels, nor long discernment, nor upright feelings,
neither is our bright nature left us. But our body is changed from the
similitude in which it was at first, when we were created.

8 "Yet now look upon our blood which is offered upon these stones, and
accept it at our hands, like the praise we used to sing unto Thee at
first, when in the garden."

9 And Adam began to make more requests unto God.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[16:1](fbe028.htm#fr_0) ORIGINAL OF THE LORD'S
PRAYER SAID TO BE USED ABOUT 150 YEARS BEFORE OUR LORD: Our Father, Who
art in Heaven, be gracious unto us, O Lord our God, hallowed be Thy
Name, and let the remembrance of Thee be glorified in Heaven above and
upon earth here below.

Let Thy kingdom reign over us now and forever. The Holy Men of old said
remit and forgive unto all men whatsoever they have done unto me. And
lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil thing; for
Thine is the kingdom and Thou shalt reign in glory forever and
forevermore, AMEN.
