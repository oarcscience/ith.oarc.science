### ODE 9.

We shall never know surely whether the wars referred to here are
spiritual or actual outward wars.

1 Open your ears and I will speak to you. Give me <span id="page_125">p.
125</span> your souls that I may also give you my soul,  
2 The word of the Lord and His good pleasures, the holy thought which He
has devised concerning his Messiah.  
3 For in the will of the Lord is your salvation, and His thought is
everlasting life; and your end is immortality.  
q Be enriched in God the Father, and receive the thought of the Most
High.  
5 Be strong and be redeemed by His grace.  
6 For I announce to you peace, to you His saints;  
7 That none of those who hear may fall in war, and that those again who
have known Him may not perish, and that those who receive may not be
ashamed.  
8 An everlasting crown for ever is Truth. Blessed are they who set it on
their heads:  
9 A stone of great price is it; and there have been wars on account of
the crown.  
10 And righteousness hath taken it and hath given it to you.  
11 Put on the crown in the true covenant of the Lord.  
12 And all those who have conquered shall be written in His book.  
13 For their book is victory which is yours. And she (Victory) sees you
before her and wills that you shall be saved. Hallelujah.
