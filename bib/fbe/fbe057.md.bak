### CHAP. LII.

Adam and Eve sew the first shirt.

AFTER this Adam and Eve said no more, but wept before God on account of
their creation, and of their bodies that required an earthly covering.

2 Then Adam said unto Eve, "O Eve, this is the skin of beasts with which
we shall be covered. But when we have put it on, behold, a token of
death shall have come upon us, inasmuch as the owners of these skins
have died, and have wasted away. So also shall we die, and pass away."

3 Then Adam and Eve took the skins, and went back to the Cave of
Treasures; and when in it, they stood and prayed as they were wont.

4 And they thought how they could make garments of those skins; for they
had no skill for it.

5 Then God sent to them His angel to show them how to work it out. And
the angel said to Adam, "Go forth, and bring some palm-thorns." Then
Adam went out, and brought some, as the angel had commanded him.

6 Then the angel began before them to work out the skins, after the
manner of one who prepares a shirt. And he took the thorns and stuck
them into the skins, before their eyes.

7 Then the angel again stood up and prayed God that the thorns in those
skins should be hidden, so as to be, as it were, sewn with one thread.

8 And so it was, by God's order; they became garments for Adam and Eve,
and He clothed them withal.

9 From that time the nakedness of their bodies was covered from the
sight of each other's eyes.

10 And this happened at the end of the fifty-first day.

11 Then when Adam's and Eve's bodies were covered, they stood and
prayed, and sought mercy of the Lord, and forgiveness, and gave Him
thanks for that He had had mercy on them, and had covered their
nakedness. And they ceased not from prayer the whole of that night.

12 Then when the mom dawned at the rising of the sun, they said their
prayers after their custom; and then went out of the cave.

13 And Adam said unto Eve, "Since we know not what there is to the
westward of this cave, let us go forth and see it to-day." Then they
came forth and went towards the western border.
