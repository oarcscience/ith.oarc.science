### ODE 12.

An exceptionally high level of spiritual thought.

1 He hath filled me with words of truth; that I may speak the same;  
2 And like the flow of waters flows truth from my mouth, and my lips
show forth His fruit.  
3 And He has caused His knowledge to abound in me, because the mouth of
the Lord is the true Word, and the door of His light;  
4 And the Most High hath given it to His words, which are the
interpreters of His own beauty, and the repeaters of His praise, and the
confessors of His counsel, and the heralds of His thought, and the
chasteners of His servants.  
5 For the swiftness of the Word is inexpressible, and like its
expression is its swiftness and force;  
6 And its course knows no limit. Never doth it fail, but it stands sure,
and it knows not descent nor the way of it.  
7 For as its work is, so is its end: for it is light and the dawning of
thought;  
8 And by it the worlds talk one to the other; and in the Word there were
those that were silent; <span id="page_127">p. 127</span>  
9 And from it came love and concord; and they spake one to the other
whatever was theirs; and they were penetrated by the Word;  
10 And they knew Him who made them, because they were in concord; for
the mouth of the Most High spake to them; and His explanation ran by
means of it:  
11 For the dwelling-place of the Word is man: and its truth is love.  
12 Blessed are they who by means thereof have understood everything, and
have known the Lord in His truth. Hallelujah.
