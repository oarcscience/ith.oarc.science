### ODE 11.

A beautiful sketch of Paradise regained and the blessedness of those who
have returned to the privileges of the fallen Adam.

1 My heart was cloven and its flower appeared; and grace sprang up in
it: and it brought forth fruit to the Lord,  
2 For the Most High clave my heart by His Holy Spirit and searched my
affection towards Him: and filled me with His love.  
3 And His opening of me became my salvation; and I ran in His way in His
peace, even in the way of truth:  
4 From the beginning and even to the end I acquired His knowledge:  
5 And I was established upon the rock of truth, where He had set me up:

6 And speaking waters touched my lips from the fountain of the Lord
plenteously:  
7 And I drank and was inebriated with the living water that doth not
die;  
8 And my inebriation was not one without knowledge, but I forsook vanity
and turned to the Most High my God,  
9 And I was enriched by His bounty, and I forsook the folly which is
diffused over the earth; and I stripped it off and cast it from me:  
10 And the Lord renewed me in His raiment, and possessed me by His
light, and from above He gave me rest in incorruption;  
11 And I became like the land which blossoms and rejoices in its
fruits:  
12 And the Lord was like the sun shining on the face of the land;  
13 He lightened my eyes, and my face received the dew; and my nostrils
enjoyed the pleasant odour of the Lord;  
14 And He carried me to His Paradise; where is the abundance of the
pleasure of the Lord;  
15 And I worshipped the Lord on account of His glory; and I said,
Blessed, O Lord, are they who are planted in thy land! and those who
have a place in thy Paradise;  
16 And they grow by the fruits of the trees. And they have changed from
darkness to light.  
17 Behold! all thy servants are fair, who do good works, and turn away
from wickedness to the pleasantness that is thine:  
18 And they have turned back the bitterness of the trees from them, when
they were planted in thy, land;  
19 And everything became like a relic of thyself, and memorial for ever
of thy faithful works.  
20 For there is abundant room in thy Paradise, and nothing is useless
therein;  
21 But everything is filled with fruit; glory be to thee, O God, the
delight of Paradise for ever. Hallelujah.
