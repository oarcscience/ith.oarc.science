### LI.

Enoch instructs his sons, that they hide not treasures in the earth, but
bids them give alms to the poor.

STRETCH out your hands to the poor according to your strength.

2 Hide not your silver in the earth.

3 Help the faithful man in affliction, and affliction will not find you
in the time of your trouble.

4 And every grievous and cruel yoke that come upon you bear all for the
sake of the Lord, and thus you will find your reward in the day of
judgement.

5 It is good to go morning, midday, and evening into the Lord's
dwelling, for the glory of your creator.

6 Because every breathing thing glorifies him, and every creature
visible and invisible returns him praise.
