*The Forgotten Books of Eden*, by Rutherford H. Platt, Jr., \[1926\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### XII.

Of the very marvellous elements of the sun.

AND I looked and saw other flying elements of the sun, whose names *are*
Phoenixes and Chalkydri, marvellous and wonderful, with feet and tails
in the form of a lion, and a crocodile's head, their appearance *is*
empurpled, like the rainbow; their size *is* nine hundred measures,
their wings *are like* those of angels, each *has* twelve, and they
attend and accompany the sun, bearing heat and dew, as it is ordered
them from God.

2 Thus *the sun* revolves and goes, and rises under the heaven, and its
course goes under the earth with the light of its rays incessantly.
