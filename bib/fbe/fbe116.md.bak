### IX.

The showing to Enoch of the place of the righteous and compassionate.

THIS place, O Enoch, is prepared for the righteous, who endure all
manner of offence from those that exasperate their souls, who avert
their eyes from iniquity, and make righteous judgement, and give bread
to the hungering, and cover the naked with clothing, and raise up the
fallen, and help injured orphans, and who walk without fault before the
face of the Lord, and serve him alone, and for them is prepared this
place for eternal inheritance.
