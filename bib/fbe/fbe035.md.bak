### CHAP. XXX.

Adam receives the first worldly goods.

AFTER these things, God commanded the angel Gabriel to go down to the
garden, and say to the cherub who kept it, "Behold, God has commanded me
to come into the garden, and to take thence sweet smelling incense, and
give it to Adam."

2 Then the angel Gabriel went down by God's order to the garden, and
told the cherub as God had commanded him.

3 The cherub then said, "Well." And Gabriel went in and took the
incense.

4 Then God commanded His angel Raphael to go down to the garden, and
speak to the cherub about some myrrh, to give to Adam.

5 And the angel Raphael went down and told the cherub as God had
commanded him, and the cherub said, "Well." Then Raphael went in and
took the myrrh.

6 The golden rods were from the Indian sea, where there are precious
stones. The incense was from the eastern border of the garden; and the
myrrh from the western border, whence bitterness came upon Adam.

7 And the angels brought these three things to God, by the Tree of Life,
in the garden.

8 Then God said to the angels, "Dip them in the spring of water; then
take them and sprinkle their water over Adam and Eve, that they be a
little comforted in their sorrow, and give them to Adam and Eve.

9 And the angels did as God had commanded them, and they gave all those
things to Adam and Eve on the top of the mountain upon which Satan had
placed them, when he sought to make an end of them.

10 And when Adam saw the golden rods, the incense and the myrrh, he was
rejoiced and wept because he thought that the gold was a token of the
kingdom whence he had come, that the incense was a token of the bright
light which had been taken from him, and that the myrrh was a token of
the sorrow in which he was.
