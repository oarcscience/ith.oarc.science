### XXIV.

Of the great secrets of God, which God revealed and told to Enoch, and
spoke with him face to face.

AND the Lord summoned me, and said to me: 'Enoch, sit down on my left
with Gabriel.'

2 And I bowed down to the

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lord, and the Lord
spoke to me: Enoch, beloved, all thou seest, all things that are
standing finished I tell to thee even before the very beginning, all
that I created from non-being, and visible things from invisible.

3 Hear, Enoch, and take in these my words, for not to My angels have I
told my secret, and I have not told them their rise, nor my endless
realm, nor have they understood my creating, which I tell thee to-day.

4 For before all things were visible, I alone used to go about in the
invisible things, like the sun from east to west, and from west to east.

5 But even the sun has peace in itself, while I found no peace, because
I was creating all things, and I conceived the thought of placing
foundations, and of creating visible creation.
