### CHAP. XXXVIII.

"*When 5500 years are fulfilled* . . . ."

AFTER these things the Word of God came to Adam, and said unto him:--

2 "O Adam, as to the fruit of the Tree of Life, for which thou askest, I
will not give it thee now, but when the 5500 years are fulfilled. Then
will I give thee of the fruit of the Tree of Life, and thou shalt eat,
and live for ever, thou, and Eve, and thy righteous seed.

3 "But these forty-three days cannot make amends for the hour in which
thou didst transgress My commandment.

4 "O Adam, I gave thee to eat of the fig-tree in which thou didst hide
thyself. Go and eat of it, thou and Eve.

5 "I will not deny thy request, neither will I disappoint thy hope;
therefore, bear up unto the fulfilment of the covenant I made with
thee."

6 And God withdrew His Word from Adam.
