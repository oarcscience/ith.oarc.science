### ODE 25.

Back again to personal experience.

1 I was rescued from my bonds and unto thee, my God, I fled:  
2 For thou art the right hand of my Salvation and my helper.  
3 Thou hast restrained those that rise up against me,  
4 And I shall see him no more: because thy face was with me, which saved
me by thy grace.  
5 But I was despised and rejected in the eye of many: and I was in their
eyes like lead,  
6 And strength was mine from thyself and help.  
7 Thou didst set me a lamp at my right hand and at my left: and in me
there shall be nothing that is not bright:  
8 And I was clothed with the covering of thy Spirit, and thou didst
remove from me my raiment of skin;  
9 For thy right hand lifted me up and removed sickness from me:  
10 And I became mighty in: the truth, and holy by thy righteousness; and
all my adversaries were afraid of me;  
11 And I became admirable by the name of the Lord, and was justified by
His gentleness, and His rest is for ever and ever. Hallelujah.
