### CHAP. XXIX.

God tells Adam of the Devil's purpose. (v. 4).

BUT when the merciful God saw that Satan wished to kill Adam with his
manifold devices, and saw that Adam was meek and without guile, God
spake unto Satan in a loud voice, and cursed him.

2 Then he and his hosts fled, and Adam and Eve remained standing on the
top of the mountain, whence they saw below them the wide world, high
above which they were. But they saw none of the host which anon were by
them.

3 They wept, both Adam and Eve, before God, and begged for forgiveness
of Him.

4 Then came the Word from God to Adam, and said unto him, "Know thou and
understand concerning this Satan, that he seeks to deceive thee and thy
seed after thee."

5 And Adam wept before the Lord God, and begged and entreated Him to
give him something from the garden, as a token to him, wherein to be
comforted.

6 And God looked upon Adam's thought, and sent the angel Michael as far
as the sea that reaches unto India, to take

from thence golden rods and bring them to Adam.

7 This did God in His wisdom, in order that these golden rods, being
with Adam in the cave, should shine forth with light in the night around
him, and put an end to his fear of the darkness.

8 Then the angel Michael went down by God's order, took golden rods, as
God had commanded him, and brought them to God.
