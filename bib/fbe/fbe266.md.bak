# The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs

THE following twelve books are biographies written between 107 and 137
B.C. They are a forceful exposition, showing how a Pharisee with a rare
gift of writing secured publicity by using the names of the greatest men
of ancient times. "There were intellectual giants in those days" and the
Twelve Patriarchs were the Intellectual Giants!

Each is here made to tell his life story. When he is on his deathbed he
calls all his children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren about
him, and proceeds without reservation to lay bare his experiences for
the moral guidance of his hearers. If he fell into sin he tells all
about it and then counsels them not to err as he did. If he was
virtuous, he shows what rewards were his.

When you look beyond the unvarnished--almost brutally frank--passages of
the text, you will discern a remarkable attestation of the expectations
of the Messiah which existed a hundred years before Christ. And there is
another element of rare value in this strange series. As Dr. R. H.
Charles says in his scholarly work on the Pseudepigrapha: its ethical
teaching "has achieved a real immortality by influencing the thought and
diction of the writers of the New Testament, and even those of our Lord.
This ethical teaching, which is very much higher and purer than that of
the Old Testament, is yet its true spiritual child and helps to bridge
the chasm that divides the ethics of the Old and New Testaments."

The instances of the influence of these writings on the New Testament
are notable in the Sermon on the Mount which reflects the spirit and
even uses phrases from these Testaments. St. Paul appears to have
borrowed so freely that it seems as though he must have carried a copy
of the Testaments with him on his travels.

Thus, the reader has before him in these pages what is at once striking
for its blunt primitive style and valuable as some of the actual source
books of the Bible.
