### XXV.

God relates to Enoch, how out of the very lowest darkness comes down the
visible and invisible.

I COMMANDED in the very lowest *parts*, that visible things should come
down from invisible, and Adoil came down very great, and I beheld him,
and lo! he had a belly of great light.

2 And I said to him: 'Become undone, Adoil, and let the visible *come*
out of thee.'

3 And he came undone, and a great light came out. And I *was* in the
midst of the great light, and as there is born light from light, there
came forth a great age, and showed all creation, which I had thought to
create.

4 And I saw that *it was* good.

5 And I placed for myself a throne, and took my seat on it, and said to
the light: 'Go thou up higher and fix thyself high above the throne, and
be a foundation to the highest things.'

6 And above the light there is nothing else, and then I bent up and
looked up from my throne.
