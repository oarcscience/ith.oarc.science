### THE BOOK OF THE SECRETS OF ENOCH.

THIS new fragment of early literature came to light through certain
manuscripts which were recently found in Russia and Servia and so far as
is yet known has been preserved only in Slavonic. Little is known of its
origin except that in its present form it was written somewhere about
the beginning of the Christian era. Its final editor was a Greek and the
place of its composition Egypt. Its value lies in the unquestioned
influence which it has exerted on the writers of the New Testament. Some
of the dark passages of the latter being all but inexplicable without
its aid.

Although the very knowledge that such a book ever existed was lost for
probably 1200 years, it nevertheless was much used by both Christian and
heretic in the early centuries and forms a most valuable document in any
study of the forms of early Christianity.

The writing appeals to the reader who thrills to lend wings to his
thoughts and fly to mystical realms. Here is a strange dramatization of
eternity--with views on Creation, Anthropology, and Ethics. As the world
was made in six days, so its history would be accomplished in 6,000
years (or 6,000,000 years), and this would be followed by 1,000 years of
rest (possibly when the balance of conflicting moral forces has been
struck and human life has reached the ideal state). At its close would
begin the 8th Eternal Day, when time should be no more.
