### CHAP. V.

A description of the city and the countryside. Compare Verse 11 with
conditions of today. Verses 89-41 reveal how the ancients estimate a
scholar and a gentleman.

THE size of the city is of moderate dimensions.

2 It is about forty furlongs <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) in
circumference, as far as one could conjecture.

3 It has its towers arranged in the shape of a theatre, with
thoroughfares leading between them now the crossroads of the lower
towers are visible but those of the upper towers are more frequented.

4 For the ground ascends, since the city is built upon a mountain.

5 There are steps too which lead up to the crossroads, and some people
are always going up, and others down and they keep as far apart from
each other as possible on the road because of those who are bound by the
rules of purity, lest they should touch anything which is unlawful.

6 It was not without reason that the original founders of the city built
it in due proportions, for they possessed clear insight *with regard to
what was required*.

7 For the country is extensive and beautiful.

8 Some parts of it are level, especially the districts which belong to
Samaria, as it is called, and which border on the land of the Idumeans,
other parts are mountainous, especially those which are contiguous to
the land of Judea.

9 The people therefore are bound to devote themselves to agriculture and
the cultivation of the soil that by this means they may have a plentiful
supply of crops.

10 In this way cultivation of every kind is carried on and an abundant
harvest reaped in the whole of the aforesaid land.

11 The cities which are large and enjoy a corresponding prosperity are
well-populated, but they neglect the country districts, since all men
are inclined to a life of enjoyment, for every one has a natural
tendency towards the pursuit of pleasure.

12 The same thing happened in Alexandria, which excels all cities in
size and prosperity.

13 Country people by migrating from the rural districts and settling in
the city brought agriculture into disrepute: and so to prevent them from
settling *in the city*, the king issued orders that they should not stay
in it for more than twenty days. <span id="fr_6"></span>[2](#fn_6.md)

14 And in the same way he gave the judges written instructions, that if
it was necessary to issue a summons against *any one who lived in the
country*, the case must be settled within five days.

15 And since he considered the matter one of great importance, he
appointed also legal officers for every district with their assistants,
that the farmers and their advocates might not in the interests of
business empty the granaries of the city, I mean, of the produce of
husbandry.

16 I have permitted this digression because it was Eleazar who pointed
out with great

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

clearness the points which have been mentioned.

17 For great is the energy which they expend on the tillage of the soil.

18 For the land is thickly planted with multitudes of olive trees, with
crops of corn and pulse, with vines too, and there is abundance of
honey.

19 Other kinds of fruit trees and dates do not count compared with
these.

20 There are cattle of all kinds in great quantities and a rich
pasturage for them.

21 Wherefore they rightly recognise that the country districts need a
large population, and the relations between the city and the villages
are properly regulated.

22 A great quantity of spices and precious stones and gold is brought
into the country by the Arabs.

23 For the country is well adapted not only for agriculture but also for
commerce, and the city is rich in the arts and lacks none of the
merchandise which is brought across the sea.

24 It possesses too suitable and commodious harbours at Askalon, Joppa,
and Gaza, as well m at Ptolemais which was founded by the King and holds
a central position compared with the other places named, being not far
distant from any of them.

25 The country produces everything in abundance, since it is well
watered in all directions and well protected *from storms*.

26 The river Jordan, as it is called, which never runs dry, flows
through the land.

27 Originally the country contained not less than 60 million
acres--though afterwards the neighbouring peoples made incursions
against it--and 600,000 men were settled upon it in farms of a hundred
acres each.

28 The river like the Nile rises in harvest-time and irrigates a large
portion of the land.

29 Near the district belonging to the people of Ptolemais it issues into
another river and this flows out into the sea.

30 Other mountain torrents, as they are called, flow down into the plain
and encompass the parts about Gaza and the district of Ashdod.

31 The country is encircled by a natural fence and is very difficult to
attack and cannot be assailed by large forces, owing to the narrow
passes, with theft overhanging precipices and deep ravines, and the
rugged character of the mountainous regions which surround all the land.

32 We were told that from the neighbouring mountains of Arabia copper
and iron were formerly obtained.

33 This was stopped, however, at the time of the *Persian* rule, since
the authorities of the time spread abroad a false report that the
working of the mines was useless and expensive in order to prevent their
country from being destroyed by the mining in these districts and
possibly taken away from them owing to the Persian rule, since by the
assistance of this false report they found an excuse for entering the
district.

34 I have now, my dear brother Philocrates, given you all the essential
information upon this subject in brief form.

35 I shall describe the work of translation in the sequel.

36 The High Priest selected men of the finest character and the highest
culture, such as one would expect from their noble parentage.

37 They were men who had not only acquired proficiency in Jewish
literature but had studied most carefully that of the Greeks as well.

38 They were specially qualified therefore for serving on embassies

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

and they undertook this duty whenever it was necessary.

39 They possessed a great facility for conferences and the discussion of
problems connected with the law.

40 They espoused the middle course--and this is always the best course
to pursue.

41 They abjured the rough and uncouth manner, but they were altogether
above pride and never assumed an air of superiority over others, and in
conversation they were ready to listen and give an appropriate answer to
every question.

42 And all of them carefully observed this rule and were anxious above
everything else to excel each other in its observance and they were all
of them worthy of their leader and of his virtue.

43 And one could observe how they loved Eleazar by their unwillingness
to be torn away from him and how he loved them.

44 Far besides the letter which he wrote to the king concerning their
safe return, he also earnestly besought Andreas to work *for the same
end* and urged me, too, to assist to the best of my ability.

45 And although we promised to give our best attention to the matter, he
said that he was still greatly distressed, for he knew that the king out
of the goodness of his nature considered it his highest privilege,
whenever he heard of a man who was superior to his fellows in culture
and wisdom, to summon him to his court.

46 For I have heard of a fine saying of his to the effect that by
securing just and prudent men about his person he would secure the
greatest protection for his kingdom, since such friends would
unreservedly give him the most beneficial advice.

47 And the men who were now being sent to him by Eleazar undoubtedly
possessed these qualities.

48 And he frequently asserted upon oath that he would never let the men
go if it were merely some private interest of his own that constituted
the impelling motive-but it was for the common advantage of all the
citizens that he was sending them.

49 For, *he explained*, the good life consists in the keeping of the
enactments of the law, and this end is achieved much more by hearing
than by reading.

50 From this and other similar statements it was clear what his feelings
towards them were.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_5"></span>[154:1](fbe242.htm#fr_5.md) A furlong is 1/8 mile
(i. e. 220 yards).

<span id="fn_6"></span>[154:2](fbe242.htm#fr_6.md) This account of the
measures adopted at Alexandria to prevent the depopulation of the
countryside through migrations into the city is an interesting
revelation that the question was as acute 2000 years ago as it is today.
