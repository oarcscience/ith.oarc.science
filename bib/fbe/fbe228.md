### ODE 34.

True poetry--pure and simple.

1 No way is hard where there is a simple heart.  
2 Nor is there any wound where the thoughts are upright:  
3 Nor is there any storm in the depth of the illuminated thought:  
4 Where one is surrounded on every side by beauty, there is nothing that
is divided.  
5 The likeness of what is below is that which is above; for everything
is above: what is below is nothing but the imagination of those that are
without knowledge.  
6 Grace has been revealed for your salvation. Believe and live and be
saved. Hallelujah.
