### CHAP. X.

"*Adam was the first....*"

AND when they had ended their prayer, the Word of God came and comforted
them concerning their father Adam.

2 After this, they offered their gifts for themselves and for their
father.

3 And when they had ended their offering, the Word of God came to Seth,
the eldest among them, saying unto him, "O Seth, Seth, Seth, three
times. As I was with thy father, so also shall I be with thee, until the
fulfilment of the promise I made him-thy father saying, I will send My
Word and save thee and thy seed.

4 But as to thy father Adam, keep thou the commandment he gave thee; and
sever thy seed from that of Cain thy brother."

5 And God withdrew His Word from Seth.

6 Then Seth, Eve, and their children, came down from the mountain to the
Cave of Treasures.

7 But Adam was the first whose soul died in the land of Eden, in the
Cave of Treasures; for no one died before him, but his son Abel, who
died murdered.

8 Then all the children of Adam rose up, and wept over their father
Adam, and made offerings to him, one hundred and forty days.
