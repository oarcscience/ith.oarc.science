### X.

Here they showed Enoch the terrible place and various tortures.

AND those two men led me upon to the Northern side, and showed me there
a very terrible place, and *there were* all manner of tortures in that
place: cruel darkness and unillumined gloom, and there is no light
there, but murky fire constantly flameth aloft, and *there is* a fiery
river coming forth, and that whole place is everywhere fire, and
everywhere *there is* frost and ice, thirst and shivering, while the
bonds are very cruel, and the angels fearful and merciless, bearing
angry weapons, merciless torture, and I said:

2 'Woe, woe, how very terrible is this place.'

3 And those men said to me: This place, O Enoch, is prepared for those
who dishonour God, who on earth practise sin against nature, which is
child-corruption after the sodomitic fashion, magic-making, enchantments
and devilish witchcrafts, and who boast of their wicked deeds, stealing,
lies, calumnies, envy, rancour, fornication, murder, and who, accursed,
steal the souls of men, who, seeing the poor take away their goods and
themselves wax rich, injuring them for other men's goods; who being able
to satisfy the empty, made the hungering to die; being able to clothe,
stripped the naked; and who knew not their creator, and bowed down to
soulless (sc. lifeless) Gods, who cannot see nor hear, vain gods, who
also built hewn images and bow down to unclean handiwork, for all these
is prepared this place amongst these, for eternal inheritance.
