### VIII.

Some remarkable similes of war creeping on Jerusalem. A survey of the
sins that brought all this trouble.

Distress and the sound of war hath my ear heard,  
  The sound of a trumpet announcing slaughter and calamity,  
The sound of much people as of an exceeding high wind,  
  As a tempest with mighty fire sweeping through the Negeb.  
And I said in my heart, Surely God judgeth us;  
  A sound I hear moving towards Jerusalem, the holy city  
My loins were broken at what I heard, my knees tottered;  
  My heart was afraid, my bones were dismayed like flax.  
I said: They establish their ways in righteousness.

I thought upon the judgments of God since the creation of heaven and
earth;  
  I held God righteous in His judgements which have been from of old.  
God bare their sins in the full light of day;  
  All the earth came to know the righteous judgements of God.  
In secret places underground their iniquities were committed to provoke
Him to anger;  
They wrought confusion, son with mother and father with daughter;  
  They committed adultery, every man with his neighhour's wife.  
They concluded covenants with one another with an oath touching these
things;  
  They plundered the sanctuary of God, as though there was no avenger.  
They trode the altar of the Lord, coming straight from all manner of
uncleanness;  
  And with menstrual blood they defiled the sacrifices, as though these
were common flesh.  
They left no sin undone, wherein they surpassed not the heathen.

Therefore God mingled for them a spirit of wandering;  
  And gave them to drink a cup of undiluted wine, that they might become
drunken.  
He brought him that is from the end of the earth, that smiteth
mightily;  
  He decreed war against Jerusalem, and against her land.  
The princes of the land went to meet him with joy: they said unto him:  
  Blessed be thy way! Come ye, enter ye in with peace.  
They made the rough ways even, before his entering in;  
  They opened the gates to Jerusalem, they crowned its walls.

As a father entereth the house of his sons, so he entered Jerusalem in
peace;  
  He established his feet there in great safety.  
He captured her fortresses and the wall of Jerusalem;  
  For God Himself led him in safety, while they wandered.  
He destroyed their princes and every one wise in counsel;  
  He poured out the blood of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, like the
water of uncleanness. <span id="page_112">p. 112</span>  
He led away their sons and daughters, whom they had begotten in
defilement.

They did according to their uncleanness, even as their fathers had
done:  
  They defiled Jerusalem and the things that had been hallowed to the
name of God.  
But God hath shown Himself righteous in His judgements upon the nations
of the earth;  
  And the pious servants of God are like innocent lambs in their
midst.  
Worthy to be praised is the Lord that judgeth the whole earth in His
righteousness.

Behold, now, O God, Thou hast shown us Thy judgement in Thy
righteousness;  
  Our eyes have seen Thy judgements, O God.  
We have justified Thy name that is honoured for ever;  
  For Thou are the God of righteousness, judging Israel with chastening.

Turn, O God, Thy mercy upon us, and have pity upon us;  
  Gather together the dispersed of Israel, with mercy and goodness;  
For Thy faithfulness is with us,  
And though we have stiffened our neck, yet Thou art our chastener;  
  Overlook us not, O our God, lest the nations swallow us up, as though
there were none to deliver.

But Thou art our God from the beginning,  
  And upon Thee is our hope set, O Lord;  
And we will not depart from Thee,  
  For good are Thy judgements upon us.  
Ours and our children's be Thy good pleasure for ever;  
  O Lord, our Saviour, we shall never more be moved.  
The Lord is worthy to be praised for His judgements with the mouth of
His pious ones;  
  And blessed be Israel of the Lord for ever.
