*The Forgotten Books of Eden*, by Rutherford H. Platt, Jr., \[1926\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### XLV.

God shows how he does not want from men sacrifices, nor burnt-offerings,
but pure and contrite hearts.

WHOEVER hastens to make offering before the Lord's face, the Lord for
his part will hasten that offering by granting of his work.

2 But whoever increases his lamp before the Lord's face and make not
true judgement, the Lord will *not* increase his treasure in the realm
of the highest.

3 When the Lord demands bread, or candles, or flesh (*sc*. cattle), or
any other sacrifice, then that is nothing; but God demands pure hearts,
and with all that *only* tests the heart of man.
