### ODE 42.

The Odes of Solomon, the Son of David, are ended with the following
exquisite verses.

1 I stretched out my hands and approached my Lord:  
2 For the stretching of my hands is His sign:  
3 My expansion is the outspread tree which was set up on the way of the
Righteous One.  
4 And I became of no account to those who did not take hold of me; and I
shall be with those who love me.  
5 All my persecutors are dead; and they sought after me who hoped in me,
because I was alive:  
6 And I rose up and am with them; and I will speak by their mouths.  
7 For they have despised those who persecuted them;  
8 And I lifted up over them the yoke of my love;  
9 Like the arm of the bridegroom over the bride,  
10 So was my yoke over those that know me:  
11 And as the couch that is spread in the house of the bridegroom and
bride,  
12 So is my love over those that believe in me. <span id="page_140">p.

13 And I was not rejected though I was reckoned to be so.  
14 I did not perish, though they devised it against me.  
15 Sheol saw me and was made miserable:  
16 Death cast me up, and many along with me.  
17 I had gall and bitterness, and I went down with him to the utmost of
his depth:  
18 And the feet and the head he let go, for they were not able to endure
my face:  
19 And I made a congregation of living men amongst his dead men, and I
spake with them by living lips:  
20 Because my word shall not be void:  
21 And those who had died ran towards me: and they cried and said, Son
of God, have pity on us, and do with us according to thy kindness,  
22 And bring us out from the bonds of darkness: and open to us the door
by which we shall come out to thee.  
23 For we see that our death has not touched thee.  
24 Let us also be redeemed with thee: for thou art our Redeemer.  
25 And I heard their voice; and my name I sealed upon their heads:  
26 For they are free men and they are mine. Hallelujah.
