### ODE 28.

This Ode is a musical gem.

1 As the wings of doves over their nestlings; and the mouth of their
nestlings towards their mouths.  
2 So also are the wings of the Spirit over my heart:  
3 My heart is delighted and exults: like the babe who exults in the womb
of his mother:  
4 I believed; therefore I was at rest; for faithful is He in whom I have
believed:  
5 He has richly blessed me and my head is with Him: and the sword shall
not divide me from Him, nor the scimitar;  
6 For I am ready before destruction comes; and I have been set on His
immortal pinions:  
7 And He showed me His sign: forth and given me to drink, and from that
life is the spirit within me, and it cannot die, for it lives.  
8 They who saw me marvelled at me, because I was persecuted, and they
supposed that I was swallowed up: for I seemed to them as one of the
lost;  
9 And my oppression became my salvation; and I was their reprobation
because there was no zeal in me;  
10 Because I did good to every man I was hated,  
11 And they came round me like mad dogs, who ignorantly attack their
masters,  
12 For their thought is corrupt and their understanding perverted.  
13 But I was carrying water in my right hand, and their bitterness I
endured by my sweetness;  
14 And I did not perish, for I was not their brother nor was my birth
like theirs.  
15 And they sought for my death and did not find it: for I was older
than the memorial of them;  
16 And vainly did they make attack upon me and those who, without
reward, came after me:  
17 They sought to destroy the memorial of him who was before them.  
18 For the thought of the Most High cannot be anticipated; and His heart
is superior to all wisdom. Hallelujah.
