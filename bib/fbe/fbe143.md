### XXXVI.

God commanded Enoch to live on earth thirty days, to give instruction to
his sons and to his children's children. After thirty days he was again
taken on to heaven.

NOW, Enoch, I give thee the term. of thirty days to spend in thy house,
and tell thy sons and all thy household, that all may hear from my face
what is told them by thee, that they may read and understand, how there
is no other God but me.

2 And that they may always keep my commandments, and begin to read and
take in the books of thy handwriting.

3 And after thirty days I s all send my angel for thee, and he will take
thee from earth and from thy sons to me.
