### ODE 21.

A remarkable explanation of the "coats of skin" in the third chapter of
Genesis.

1 My arms I lifted up to the Most High, even to the <span
id="page_131">p. 131</span> grace of the Lord: because He had cast off
my bonds from me: and my Helper had lifted me up to His grace and to His
salvation:  
2 And I put off darkness and clothed myself with light,  
3 And my soul acquired a body free from sorrow or affliction or pains.  
4 And increasingly helpful to me was the thought of the Lord, and His
fellowship in incorruption:  
5 And I was lifted up in His light; and I served before Him,  
6 And I became near to Him, praising and confessing Him;  
7 My heart ran over and was found in my mouth: and it arose upon my
lips; and the exultation of the Lord increased on my face, and His
praise likewise. Hallelujah.
