### XVII.

Of the singings of the angels, which it is impossible to describe.

IN the midst of the heavens I saw armed soldiers, serving the Lord, with
tympana and organs, with incessant voice, with sweet voice, with sweet
and incessant voice and various singing, which it is impossible to
describe, and which astonishes every mind, so wonderful and marvellous
is the singing of those angels, and I was delighted listening to it.
