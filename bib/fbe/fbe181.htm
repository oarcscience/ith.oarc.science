<p align="CENTER">A statement of the philosophy of the indestructibility of matter. One of the tenets of modern physics</i>.</p> 
<p>O Lord God, I will praise Thy name with joy,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of them that know Thy righteous judgements.<br> For Thou art good and merciful, the refuge of the poor;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;When I cry to Thee, do not silently disregard me.<br> For no man taketh spoil from a mighty man;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Who, then, can take aught of a that Thou hast made, except Thou Thyself givest?<br> For man and his portion lie before Thee in the balance;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;He cannot add to, so as to enlarge, what has been prescribed by Thee.</p> 
<p>O God, when we are in distress we call upon Thee for help,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And Thou dost not turn back our petition, for Thou art our God.<br> Cause not Thy hand to be heavy upon us,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Lest through necessity we sin.<br> Even though Thou restore us not, we will not keep away;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;But unto Thee will we come.<br> For if I hunger, unto Thee will I cry, O God;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And <i>Thou</i> wilt give to me.</p> 
<p>Birds and fish dost Thou nourish,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In that Thou givest rain to the steppes that green grass may spring up,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;So to prepare fodder in the steppe for every living thing;<br> And if they hunger, unto Thee do they lift up their face.<br> Kings and rulers and peoples <i>Thou</i> dost nourish, O God;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And who is the help of the poor and needy, if not Thou, O Lord? <a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="green">p. 110</font></A><br> And Thou wilt hearken--for who is good and gentle but thou?--<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Making glad the soul of the humble by opening Thine hand in mercy.</p> 
<p>Man's goodness is bestowed grudgingly and ...;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And if he repeat it without murmuring, even that is marvellous.<br> But Thy gift is great in goodness and wealth,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And he whose hope is set on Thee shall have no lack of gifts.<br> Upon the whole earth is Thy mercy, O Lord, in goodness.</p> 
<p>Happy is he whom God remembereth in granting to him a due sufficiency;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;If a man abound overmuch, he sinneth.<br> Sufficient are moderate means with righteousness,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And hereby the blessing of the Lord becomes abundance with righteousness.<br> They that fear the Lord rejoice in good gifts,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And thy goodness is upon Israel in Thy kingdom.</p> 
<p>Blessed is the glory of the Lord, for He is our king.</p>
