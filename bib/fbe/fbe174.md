### LXVII.

The Lord let out darkness on to earth and covered the people and Enoch,
and he was taken up on high, and light came again in the heaven.

WHEN Enoch had talked to the people, the Lord sent out darkness on to
the earth, and there was darkness, and it covered those men standing
with Enoch, and they took Enoch up on to the highest heaven, where the
Lord is; and he received him and placed him before his face, and the
darkness went off from the earth, and light came again.

2 And the people saw and understood not how Enoch had been taken, and
glorified God, and found a roll in which was traced 'the invisible God';
and all went to their homes.
