<p align="CENTER">"<i>About sunset on the 53rd day</i> . . . ."</p> 
<p>THEN Adam and Eve spread their hands unto God, praying and entreating Him to drive Satan away from them; that he do them no violence, and do not force them to deny God.</p> 
<p>2 Then God sent to them at once His angel, who drove away Satan--from them. This happened about sunset, on the fifty-third day after they had come out of the garden.</p> 
<p>3 Then Adam and Eve went into the cave, and stood up and turned their faces to the earth, to pray to God.</p> 
<p>4 But ere they prayed Adam said unto Eve, "Lo, thou hast seen what temptations have befallen us in this land. Come, let us arise, and ask God to forgive us the sins we have committed; and we will not come out until the end of the day next to the fortieth. And if we die herein, He will save us."</p> 
<p>5 Then Adam and Eve arose, and joined together in entreating God.</p> 
<p>6 They abode thus praying in the cave; neither did they come out of it, by night or by day, until their prayers went up out of their mouths, like a flame of fire.</p>
