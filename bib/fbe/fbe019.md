### CHAP. XIV.

The earliest prophecy of the coming of Christ.

THEN Adam said unto God: "O Lord, take Thou my soul, and let me not see
this gloom any more; or remove me to some place where there is no
darkness."

2 But God the Lord said to Adam, "Verily I say unto thee, this darkness
will pass from thee, every day I have determined for thee, until the
fulfilment of My covenant; when I will save thee and bring thee back
again into the garden, into the abode of light thou longest for, wherein
is no darkness. I will bring thee, to it--in the kingdom of heaven."

3 Again said God unto Adam, "All this misery that thou hast been made to
take upon thee because of thy transgression, will not free thee from the
hand of Satan, and will not save thee.

4 "But I will. When I shall come down from heaven, and shall become
flesh of thy seed, and take upon Me the infirmity from which thou
sufferest, then the darkness that came upon thee in this cave shall come
upon Me in the grave, when I am in the flesh of thy seed.

5 "And I, who am without years, shall be subject to the reckoning of
years, of times, of months, and of days, and I shall be reckoned as one
of the sons of men, in order to save thee."

6 And God ceased to commune with Adam.
