<p>Like the Psalms of David in their exultation because of freedom</i>.</p> 
<p>1 He who brought me down from on high, also brought me up from the regions below;<br> 2 And He who gathers together the things that are betwixt is He also who cast me down:<br> 3 He who scattered my enemies had existed from ancient and my adversaries:<br> 4 He who gave me authority over bonds that I might loose them;<br> 5 He that overthrew by my hands the dragon with seven heads: and thou hast set me over his roots that I might destroy his seed.<br> 6 Thou wast there and didst help me, and in every place thy name was a rampart me<br> 7 Thy right hand destroyed his wicked poison; and thy hand levelled the way for those who believe in thee.<br> 8 And thou didst choose them from the graves and didst separate them from the dead.<br> 9 Thou didst take dead bones and didst cover them with bodies.<br> 10 They were motionless, and thou didst give them energy for life.<br> 11 Thy way was without corruption, and thy face; thou didst bring thy world to corruption: that everything might be dissolved, and then renewed,<br> 12 And that the foundation for everything might be thy rock: and on it thou didst build thy kingdom; and it became the dwelling place of the saints. Hallelujah.</p>
