### ODE 19.

Fantastic and not in harmony with the other Odes. The reference to a
painless Virgin Birth is notable.

1 A cup of milk was offered to me: and I drank it in the sweetness of
the delight of the Lord.  
2 The Son is the cup, and He who was milked is the Father:  
3 And the Holy Spirit milked Him: because His breasts were full, and it
was necessary for Him that His milk should be sufficiently released;  
4 And the Holy Spirit opened His bosom and mingled the milk from the two
breasts of the Father; and gave the mixture to the world without their
knowing:  
5 And they who receive in its fulness are the ones on the right hand.  
6 The Spirit opened the womb of the Virgin and she received conception
and brought forth; and the Virgin became a Mother with many mercies;  
7 And she travailed and brought forth a Son, without incurring pain;  
8 And because she was not sufficiently prepared, and she had not sought
a midwife (for He brought her to bear) she brought forth, as if she were
a man, of her own will;  
9 And she brought Him forth openly, and acquired Him with great
dignity,  
10 And loved Him in His swaddling clothes and guarded Him kindly, and
showed Him in Majesty. Hallelujah.
