### CHAP. VIII.

The "Bright Nature" of man is taken away.

THEN Adam wept and said, "O God, when we dwelt in the garden, and our
hearts were lifted up, we saw the angels that sang praises in heaven,
but now we do not see as we were used to do; nay, when we entered the
cave, all creation became hidden from us."

2 Then God the Lord said unto Adam, "When thou wast under subjection to
Me, thou hadst a bright nature within thee, and for that reason couldst
thou see things afar off. But after thy transgression thy bright nature
was withdrawn from thee; and it was not left to thee to see things afar
off, but only near at hand; after the ability of the flesh; for it is
brutish."

3 When Adam and Eve had heard these words from God, they went their way;
praising and worshipping Him with a sorrowful heart.

4 And God ceased to commune with them.
