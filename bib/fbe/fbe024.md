### CHAP. XIX.

Beasts made subject to Adam.

BUT Adam and Eve wept before God. And Adam said unto Him:--

2 "O Lord, when I was in the cave, I said this to Thee, my Lord, that
the beasts of the field would rise and devour me, and cut off my life
from the earth."

3 Then Adam, by reason of what had befallen him, smote upon his breast,
and fell upon the earth like a corpse; then came to him the Word of God,

who raised him, and said unto him,

4 "O Adam, not one of these beasts will be able to hurt thee; because
when I made the beasts and other moving things come to thee in the cave,
I did not let the serpent come with them, lest it should rise against
you, make you tremble; and the fear of it should fall into your hearts.

5 "For I knew that that accursed one is wicked; therefore would I not
let it come near you with the other beasts.

6 "But now strengthen thy heart and fear not. I am with thee unto the
end of the days I have determined on thee."
