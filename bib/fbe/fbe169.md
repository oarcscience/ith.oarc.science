### LXII.

Of how it is fitting to bring one's gift with faith, because there is no
repentance after death.

BLESSED is the man who in his patience brings his gifts with faith
before the Lord's face, because he will find forgiveness of sins.

2 But if he take back his words before the time, there is no repentance
for him; and if the time pass and he do not of his own will what is
promised, there is no repentance after death.

3 Because every work which man does before the time, is all deceit
before men, and sin before God.
