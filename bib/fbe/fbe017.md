### CHAP. XII.

How darkness came between Adam and Eve.

THEN Adam smote upon his breast, he and Eve, and they mourned the whole
night until dawn drew near, and they sighed over the length of the night
in Miyazia.

2 And Adam beat himself, and threw himself on the ground in the cave,
from bitter grief, and because of the darkness, and lay there as dead.

3 But Eve heard the noise he made in falling upon the earth. And she
felt about for him with her hands, and found him like a corpse.

4 Then she was afraid, speechless, and remained by him.

5 But the merciful Lord looked on the death of Adam, and on Eve's
silence from fear of the darkness.

6 And the Word of God came unto Adam and raised him from his death, and
opened Eve's mouth that she might speak.

7 Then Adam arose in the cave and said, "O God, wherefore has light
departed from us, and darkness come over us? Wherefore dost Thou leave
us in this long darkness? Why wilt Thou plague us thus?

8 "And this darkness, O Lord, where was it ere it came upon us? It is
such, that we cannot see each other.

9 "For, so long as we were in the garden, we neither saw nor even knew
what darkness is. I was not hidden from Eve, neither was she hidden from
me, until now that she cannot see me; and no darkness came upon us, to
separate us from each other.

10 "But she and I were both in one bright light. I saw her and she saw
me. Yet now since we came into this cave, darkness has come upon us, and
parted us asunder, so that I do not see her, and she does not see me.

11 "O Lord, wilt Thou then plague us with this darkness?"
