### CHAP. XX.

Adam wishes to protect Eve.

THEN Adam wept and said, "O God, remove us to some other place, that the
serpent may not come again near us, and rise against us. Lest it find
Thy handmaid Eve alone and kill her; for its eyes are hideous and evil."

2 But God said to Adam and Eve, "Henceforth fear not, I will not let it
come near you; I have driven it away from you, from this mountain;
neither will I leave in it aught to hurt you."

3 Then Adam and Eve worshipped before God 'and gave Him thanks, and
praised Him for having delivered them from death.
