### ODE 38.

A beautiful description of the power of truth.

1 I went up to the light of truth as if into a chariot:  
2 And the Truth took me and led me: and carried me across pits and
gulleys; and from the rocks and the waves it preserved me:  
3 And it became to me a haven of Salvation: and set me on the arms of
immortal life:  
4 And it went with me and made me rest, and suffered me not to wander,
because it was the Truth;  
5 And I ran no risk, because I walked with Him;  
6 And I did not make an error in anything because I obeyed the Truth.  
7 For Error flees away from it, and meets it not: but the Truth proceeds
in the right path, and  
8 Whatever I did not know, it made clear to me, all the poisons of
error, and the plagues of death which they think to be sweetness:  
9 And I saw the destroyer of destruction, when the bride who is
corrupted is adorned: and the [bridegroom](errata.htm#5) who corrupts
and is corrupted;  
10 And I asked the Truth 'Who are these?'; and He said to me, 'This is
the deceiver and the error:  
11 And they are alike in the beloved and in his bride: and they lead
astray and corrupt the whole world:  
12 And they invite many to the banquet, <span id="page_138">p.
138</span>  
13 And give them to drink of the wine of their intoxication, and remove
their wisdom and knowledge, and so they make them without
intelligence;  
14 And then they leave them; and then these go about like madmen
corrupting: seeing that-they are without heart, nor do they seek for
it!  
15 And I was made wise so as not to fall into the hands of the deceiver;
and I congratulated myself because the Truth went with me,  
16 And I was established and lived and was redeemed,  
17 And my foundations were laid on the hand of the Lord: because He
established me.  
18 For He set the root and watered it and fixed it and blessed it; and
its fruits are for ever.  
19 It struck deep and sprung up and spread out, and was full and
enlarged;  
20 And the Lord alone was glorified in His planting and in His
husbandry: by His care and by the blessing of His lips,  
21 By the beautiful planting of His right hand: and by the discovery of
His planting, and by the thought of His mind. Hallelujah.
