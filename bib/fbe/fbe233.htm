<p>One of the few allusions to events in the Gospels--that of our Lord walking on the Sea of Galilee</i>.</p> 
<p>1 Great rivers are the power of the Lord:<br> 2 And they carry headlong those who despise Him: and entangle their paths:<br> 3 And they sweep away their fords, and catch their bodies and destroy their lives.<br> 4 For they are more swift than lightning and more rapid, and those who cross them in faith are not moved;<br> 5 And those who walk on them without blemish shall not be afraid.<br> 6 For the sign in them is the Lord; and the sign is the way of those who cross in the name of the Lord;<br> 7 Put on, therefore, the name of the Most High, and know Him, and you shall cross without danger, for the rivers will be subject to you.<br> 8 The Lord has bridged them by His word; and He walked and crossed them on foot:<br> 9 And His footsteps stand firm on the water, and are not injured; they are as firm as a tree that is truly set up.<br> 10 And the waves were lifted up on this side and on that, but the footsteps of our Lord Messiah stand firm and are not obliterated and are not defaced.<br> 11 And a way has been appointed for those who cross after Him and for those who adhere to the course of faith in Him and worship His name. Hallelujah.</p>
