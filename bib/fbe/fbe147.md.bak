### XL.

Enoch admonishes his children truly of all things from the Lord's lips,
how he saw and heard and wrote down.

AND now, my children, I know all things, for this is from the Lord's
lips, and this my eyes have seen, from beginning to end.

2 I know all things, and have written all things into books, the heavens
and their end, and their plenitude, and all the armies and their
marchings.

3 I have measured and described the stars, the great countless multitude
*of them*.

4 What man has seen their revolutions, and their entrances? For not even
the angels see their number, while I have written all their names.

5 And I measured the sun's

circle, and measured its rays, counted the hours, I wrote down too all'
things that go over the earth I have written the things that are
nourished, and all seed sown and unsown, which the earth produces and
all plants, and every grass and every flower, and their sweet smells,
and their names, and the dwelling-places of the clouds, and their
composition, and their wings, and how they bear rain and raindrops.

6 And I investigated all things, and wrote the road of the thunder and
of the lightning, and they showed me the keys and their guardians, their
rise, the way they go; it is let out in measure (*sc*. gently) by a
chain, lest by a heavy chain and violence it hurl down the angry clouds
and destroy all things on earth.

7 I wrote the treasure-houses of the snow, and the store-houses of the
cold and the frosty airs, and I observed their season's key-holder, he
fills the clouds with them, and does not exhaust the treasure-houses.

8 And I wrote the resting-places of the winds and observed and saw how
their key-holders bear weighing-scales and measures; first, they put
them in *one* weighing-scale, then in the other the weights and let them
out according to measure cunningly over the whole earth, lest by heavy
breathing they make the earth to rock.

9 And I measured out the whole earth, its mountains, and all hills,
fields, trees, stones, rivers, all existing things I wrote down, the
height from earth to the seventh heaven, and downwards to the very
lowest hell, and the judgement-place, and the very great, open and
weeping hell.

10 And I saw how the prisoners are in pain, expecting the limitless
judgement.

11 And I wrote down all those being judged by the judge, and all their
judgements (*sc*. sentences) and all their works.
