### CHAP. I.

At the time of the Jewish Captivity in Egypt, Ptolemy Philadelphus
reveals himself as the first great bibliophile. He desires to have all
the books in the world in his library; in order to get the Laws of Moses
he offers to trade 100,000 captives for that work exclaiming, "It is a
small boon indeed!"

SINCE I have collected *material* for a memorable history of my visit to
Eleazar the High Priest of the Jews, and because you, Philocrates, as
you lose no opportunity of reminding me, have set great store upon
receiving an account of the motives and object of my mission, I have
attempted to draw up clear exposition of the matter for you, for I
perceive that you possess a natural love of learning, a *quality* which
is the highest possession of man--to be constantly attempting 'to add to
his stock of knowledge and acquirements' whether through the study of
history or by actually participating in the events themselves.

2 It is by this means, by taking up into itself the noblest elements,
that the soul is established in purity, and having fixed its aim on
piety, the noblest goal of all, it uses this as its infallible guide and
so acquires a definite purpose.

3 It was my devotion to the pursuit of religious knowledge that led me
to undertake the embassy to the man I have mentioned, who was held in
the highest esteem by his own citizens and by others, both for his
virtue and his majesty, and who had in his possession documents of the
highest value to the Jews in his own country and in foreign lands for
the interpretation of the divine law, for their laws are written on
leather parchments in Jewish characters.

4 This embassy then I undertook with enthusiasm, having first of all
found an opportunity of pleading with the king on behalf of the Jewish
captives who had been transported from Judea to Egypt by the king's
father, when he first obtained possession of this city and conquered the
land of Egypt.

5 It is worth while that I should tell you this story, too, since I am
convinced that you, with your disposition towards holiness and your
sympathy with men who are living in accordance with the holy law, will
all the

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

more readily listen to the account which I purpose to set forth, since
you yourself have lately come to us from the island and are anxious to
hear everything that tends to build up the soul.

6 On a former occasion too, I sent you a record of the facts which I
thought worth relating about the Jewish race,--the record which I had
obtained from the most learned high priests of the most learned land of
Egypt.

7 As you are so eager to acquire the knowledge of those things which can
benefit the mind, I' feel it incumbent upon me to impart to you *all the
information in my power*.

8 *I should feel the same duty* towards all who possessed the same
disposition but I feel it especially towards you since you have
aspirations which are so noble, and since you are not only my brother in
character, no less than in blood, but are one with me as well in the
pursuit of goodness.

9 For neither the pleasure derived from gold nor any other of the
possessions which are prized by shallow minds confers the same benefit
as the pursuit of culture and the study which we expend in securing it.

10 But that I may not weary you by a too lengthy introduction, I will
proceed at once to the substance of my narrative.

11 Demetrius of Phalerum, the president of the king's library, received
vast sum of money, for the purpose of collecting together, as far as he
possibly could, all the books in the world.

12 By means of purchase and transcription, he carried out, to the best
of his ability, the purpose of the king.

13 On one occasion when I was present he was asked, How many thousand
books are there *in the library*? and he replied, 'More than two hundred
thousand, O king, and I shall make endeavour in the immediate future *to
gather together* the remainder also, so that the total of five hundred
thousand may be reached. I am told that the laws of the Jews are worth
transcribing and deserve a place in your library!

14 'What is to prevent you from doing this?' replied the king.
'Everything that is necessary has been placed at your disposal!

15 'They need to be translated,' answered Demetrius 'for in the country
of the Jews they use a peculiar alphabet (just as the Egyptians, too,
have a special form of letters) and speak a peculiar dialect.

16 They are supposed to use the Syriac tongue, but this is not the case;
their language is quite different.'

17 And the king when he understood all the facts of the case ordered a
letter to be written to the Jewish High Priest that his purpose (which
has already been described) might be accomplished.

18 Thinking that the time had come to press the demand, which I had
often laid before Sosibius of Tarentum and Andreas, the chief of the
bodyguard, for the emancipation of the Jews who had been transported
from Judea by the king's father--for when by a combination of good
fortune and courage he had brought his attack on the whole district of
Coele-Syria and Phoenicia to a successful issue, in the process of
terrorising the country into subjection, he transported some of his foes
and others he reduced to captivity.

19 The number of those whom he transported from the country of the Jews
to Egypt amounted to no less than a hundred thousand.

20 Of these he armed thirty thousand picked men and settled

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

them in garrisons in the country districts.

21 (And even before this time large numbers of Jews had come into Egypt
with the Persian, and in an earlier period still others had been sent
*to Egypt* to help Psammetichus in his campaign against the king of the
Ethiopians. But these were nothing like so numerous as the captives whom
Ptolemy the son of Lagus transported.)

22 As I have already said Ptolemy picked out the best of these, the men
who were in the prime of life and distinguished for their courage, and
armed them, but the great mass of the others, those who were too old or
too young for this purpose, and the women too, he reduced to slavery,
not that he wished to do this of his own free will, but he was compelled
by his soldiers who claimed them as a reward for the services which they
had rendered in war.

23 Having, as has already been stated, obtained an opportunity for
securing their emancipation, I addressed the king with the following
arguments. 'Let us not be so unreasonable as to allow our deeds to give
the lie to our words.

24 Since the law which we wish not only to transcribe but also to
translate belongs to the whole Jewish race, what justification shall we
be able to find for our embassy while such vast numbers of them remain
in a state of slavery in your kingdom?

25 In the perfection and wealth of your clemency release those who are
held in such miserable bondage, since as I have been at pains to
discover, the God who gave them their law is the God who maintains your
kingdom.

26 They worship the same God--the Lord and Creator of the Universe, as
all other men, as we ourselves, O king, though we call him by different
names, such as Zeus <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md) or Dis.

27 This name was very appropriately bestowed upon him by our first
ancestors, in order to signify that He, through whom all things are
endowed with life and come into being, is necessarily the Rider and Lord
of the Universe.

28 Set all mankind an example of magnanimity by releasing those who are
held in bondage.'

29 After a brief interval, while I was offering up an earnest prayer to
God that He would so dispose the mind of the king that all the captives
might be set at liberty--(for the human race, being the creation of God,
is swayed and influenced by Him.

30 Therefore with many divers prayers I called upon Him who ruleth the
heart that *the king* might be constrained to grant my request.

31 For I had great hopes with regard to the salvation of the men since I
was assured that God would grant a fulfilment of my prayer.

32 For when men from pure motives plan some action in the interest of
righteousness and the performance of noble deeds, Almighty God brings
their efforts and purposes to a successful issue)--*the king* raised his
head and looking up at me with a cheerful countenance asked, 'How many
thousands do you think they will number?'

33 Andreas, who was standing near, replied, 'A little more than a
hundred thousand.'

34 'It is a small boon indeed,' said the king, 'that Aristeas asks of
us!'

35 Then Sosibius and some others who were present said

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Yes, but it will
be a fit tribute to your magnanimity for you to offer the
enfranchisement of these men as an act of devotion to the supreme God.

36 You have been greatly honoured by Almighty God and exalted above all
your forefathers in glory and it is only fitting that you should render
to Him the greatest thank-offering in your power.'

37 Extremely pleased *with these arguments* he gave orders that an
addition should be made to the wages *of the soldiers by the amount of
the redemption money*, that twenty drachmae should be paid *to the
owners* for every slave, that a public order should be issued and that
registers of the captives should be attached to it.

38 He showed the greatest enthusiasm in the business, for it was God who
had brought our purpose to fulfilment in its entirety and constrained
him to redeem not only those who had come into Egypt with the army of
his father but any who had come before that time or had been
subsequently brought into the kingdom.

39 It was pointed out to him that the ransom money would exceed four
hundred talents.

40 I think it will be useful to insert a copy of the decree, for in this
way the magnanimity of the king, who was empowered by God to save such
vast multitudes, will be made clearer and more manifest.

41 The decree of the king ran as follows: 'All who served in the army of
our father in the campaign against Syria and Phoenicia and in the attack
upon the country of the Jews and became possessed of Jewish captives and
brought them back to the city of *Alexandria* and the land *of Egypt* or
sold them to others--and in the same way any captives who were in our
land before that time or were brought hither afterwards--all who possess
such captives are required to set them at liberty at once, receiving
twenty drachmae per head as ransom money.

42 The soldiers will receive this money as a gift added to their wages,
the others from the king's treasury.

43 We think that it was against our father's will and against all
propriety that they should have been made captives and that the
devastation of their land and the transportation of the Jews to Egypt
was an act of military wantonness.

44 The spoil which fell to the soldiers on the field *of battle* was all
the booty which they should have claimed.

45 To reduce the people to slavery in addition was an act of absolute
injustice.

46 Wherefore, since it is acknowledged that we are accustomed to render
justice to all men and especially to those who are unfairly in a
condition of servitude, and since we strive to deal fairly with all men
according to the demands of justice and piety, we have decreed, in
reference to the persons of the Jews who are in any condition of bondage
in any part of our dominion, that those who possess them shall receive
the stipulated sum of money and set them at liberty and that no man
shall show any tardiness in discharging his obligations.

47 Within three days after the publication of this decree, they must
make lists *of slaves* for the officers appointed to carry out our will,
and immediately produce the persons *of the captives*.

48 For we consider that it will be advantageous to us and to our affairs
that the matter should be brought to a conclusion.

49 Any one who likes may give information about any who disobey the
decree, on condition

that if the man is proved guilty he will become his slave; his property,
however, will be handed over to the royal treasury.'

50 When the decree was brought to be read over to the king for his
approval, it contained all the other provisions except the phrase 'any
captives who were in the land before that time or were brought hither
afterwards,' and in his magnanimity and the largeness of his heart the
king inserted this clause and gave orders that the grant of money
required for the redemption should be deposited in full with the
paymasters of the forces and the royal bankers, and so the matter was
decided and the decree ratified within seven days.

51 The grant for the redemption amounted to more than six hundred and
sixty talents; for many infants at the breast were emancipated together
with their mothers.

52 When the question was raised whether the sum of twenty talents was to
be paid for these, the king ordered that it should be done, and thus he
carried out his decision in the most comprehensive way.
