### CHAP. XLII.

A promise of the Water of Life. The third prophecy of the coming of
Christ.

THEN came the Word of God to Adam, and said unto him:--

2 "O Adam, as to what thou sayest, 'Bring me into a land where there is
rest,' it is not another land than this, but it is the kingdom of heaven
where alone there is rest.

3 "But thou canst not make thy entrance into it at present; but only
after thy judgment is past and fulfilled.

4 "Then will I make thee go up into the kingdom of heaven, thee and thy
righteous seed; and I will give thee and them the rest thou askest for
at present.

5 "And if thou saidst, 'Give me of the Water of Life that I may drink
and live'--it cannot be this day, but on the day that I shall descend
into hell, and break the gates of brass, and bruise in pieces the
kingdoms of iron.

6 "Then will I in mercy save thy soul and the souls of the righteous, to
give them rest in My garden. And that shall be when the end of the world
is come.

7 "And, again, as regards the Water of Life thou seekest, it will not be
granted thee this day; but on the day that I shall shed My blood upon
thy head in the land of Golgotha.

8 "For My blood shall be the Water of Life unto thee, at that time, and
not to thee alone, but unto all those of thy seed who shall believe in
Me; that it be unto them for rest for ever."

9 The Lord said again unto Adam, "O Adam, when thou wast in the garden,
these trials did not come to thee

10 "But since thou didst transgress My commandment, all these sufferings
have come upon thee.

11\. "Now, also, does thy flesh require food and drink; drink then of
that water that flows by thee on the face of the earth."

12 Then God withdrew His Word from Adam.

13 And Adam and Eve worshipped the Lord, and returned from the river of
water to the cave. It was noon-day; and when they drew near to the cave,
they saw a large fire by it.
