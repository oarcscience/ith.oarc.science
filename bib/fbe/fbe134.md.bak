### XXVII.

Of how God founded the water, and surrounded it with light, and
established on it seven islands.

AND I commanded that there should be taken from light and darkness, and
I said: 'Be thick,' and it became thus

and I spread it out with the light, and it became water, and I spread it
out over the darkness, below the light, and then I made firm the waters,
that is to say

the bottomless, and I made foundation of light around the water, and
created seven circles from inside, and imaged it (*sc*. the water) like
crystal wet and dry, that is to say like glass, *and* the circumcession
of the waters and the other elements, and I showed each one of them its
road, and the seven stars each one of them in its heaven, that they go
thus, and I saw that it was good.

2 And I separated between light and between darkness, that is to say in
the midst of the water hither and thither, and I said to the light, that
it should be the day, and to the darkness, that it should be the night,
and there was evening and there was morning the first day.
