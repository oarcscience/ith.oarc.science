<p align="CENTER">"<i>What is his beauty that you should have followed him</i>?"</p> 
<p>WHEN Adam heard these words from God, he took Eve and removed from the northern end of the garden to the south of it, by the river of water, where they once fasted.</p> 
<p>2 But as they were going in the way, and before they reached</p> 
<p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="green">p. 34</font></A></p> 
<p>that place, Satan, the wicked one, had heard the Word of God communing with Adam respecting his covering.</p> 
<p>3 It grieved him, and he hastened to the place where the sheep-skins were, with the intention of taking them and throwing them into the sea, or of burning them with fire, that Adam and Eve should not find them.</p> 
<p>4 But as he was about to take them, the Word of God came from heaven, and bound him by the side of those skins until Adam and Eve came near him. But as they neared him they were afraid of him, and of his hideous look.</p> 
<p>5 Then came the Word of God to Adam and Eve, and said to them, "This is he who was hidden in the serpent, and who deceived you, and stripped you of the garment of light and glory in which you were.</p> 
<p>6 "This is he who promised you majesty and divinity. Where, then, is the beauty that was on him? Where is his divinity? Where is his light? Where is the glory that rested on him?</p> 
<p>7 "Now his figure is hideous; he is become abominable among angels; and he has come to be called Satan.</p> 
<p>8 "O Adam I he wished to take from you this earthly garment of sheep-skins, and to destroy it, and not let you be covered with it.</p> 
<p>9 "What, then, is his beauty that you should have followed him? And what have you gained by hearkening to him? See his evil works and then look at Me; at Me, your Creator, and at the good deeds I do you.</p> 
<p>10 "See, I bound him until you came and saw him and beheld his weakness, that no power is left with him."</p> 
<p>11 And God released him from his bonds.</p>
