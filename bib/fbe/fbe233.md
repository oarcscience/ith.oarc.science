### ODE 39.

One of the few allusions to events in the Gospels--that of our Lord
walking on the Sea of Galilee.

1 Great rivers are the power of the Lord:  
2 And they carry headlong those who despise Him: and entangle their
paths:  
3 And they sweep away their fords, and catch their bodies and destroy
their lives.  
4 For they are more swift than lightning and more rapid, and those who
cross them in faith are not moved;  
5 And those who walk on them without blemish shall not be afraid.  
6 For the sign in them is the Lord; and the sign is the way of those who
cross in the name of the Lord;  
7 Put on, therefore, the name of the Most High, and know Him, and you
shall cross without danger, for the rivers will be subject to you.  
8 The Lord has bridged them by His word; and He walked and crossed them
on foot:  
9 And His footsteps stand firm on the water, and are not injured; they
are as firm as a tree that is truly set up.  
10 And the waves were lifted up on this side and on that, but the
footsteps of our Lord Messiah stand firm and are not obliterated and are
not defaced.  
11 And a way has been appointed for those who cross after Him and for
those who adhere to the course of faith in Him and worship His name.
Hallelujah.
