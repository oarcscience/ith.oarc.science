<p>God gives over paradise to Adam, and gives him a command to see the heavens opened, and that he should see the angels singing the song of victory</i>.</p> 
<p>ADAM has life on earth, and I created a garden in Eden in the east, that he should observe the testament and keep the command.</p> 
<p>2 I made the heavens open to him, that he should see the angels singing the song of victory, and the gloomless light.</p> 
<p>3 And he was continuously in paradise, and the devil understood that I wanted to create another world, because Adam was lord on earth, to rule and control it.</p> 
<p>4 The devil is the evil spirit of the lower places, as a fugitive he made Sotona from the heavens as his name was Satanail, thus he became different from the angels, <i>but his nature</i> did not change <i>his</i> intelligence as far as <i>his</i> understanding of righteous and sinful <i>things</i>.</p> 
<p>5 And he understood his condemnation and the sin which he had sinned before, therefore he conceived thought against Adam, in such form he entered and seduced Eva, but did not touch Adam.</p> 
<p>6 But I cursed ignorance, but what I had blessed previously, those I did not curse, I cursed not man, nor the earth, nor other creatures, but man's evil fruit, and his works.</p>
