### III.

Of Enoch's assumption; how the angels took him into the first heaven.

IT came to pass, when Enoch had told his sons, that the angels took him
on to their wings and bore him up on to the first heaven and placed him
on the clouds. And there I looked, and again I looked higher, and saw
the ether, and they placed me on the first heaven and showed me a very
great Sea, greater than the earthly sea.
