### CHAP. XLVII.

The Devil's own Scheming.

THEN Adam and Eve came into the cave, yet trembling at the fire that had
scorched their bodies. So Adam said to Eve:--

2 "Lo, the fire has burnt our flesh in this world; but how will it be
when we are dead, and Satan shall punish our souls? Is not our
deliverance long and far off, unless God come, and in mercy to us fulfil
His promise?"

3 Then Adam and Eve passed into the cave, blessing themselves for coming
into it once more. For it was in their thoughts, that they never should
enter it, when they saw the fire around it.

4 But as the sun was setting the fire was still burning and nearing Adam
and Eve in the cave, so that they could not sleep in it. After the sun
had set, they went out of it. This was the forty-seventh day after they
came out of the garden.

5 Adam and Eve then came under the top of hill by the garden to sleep,
as they were wont.

6 And they stood and prayed God to forgive them their sins, and then
fell asleep under the summit of the mountain.

7 But Satan, the hater of all good, thought within himself: Whereas God
has promised salvation to Adam by covenant, and that He would deliver
him out of all the hardships that have befallen him-but has not promised
me by covenant, and will not deliver me out of my hardships; nay, since
He has promised him that He should make him and his seed dwell in the
kingdom in which I once was--I will kill Adam.

8 The earth shall be rid of him; and shall be left to me alone; so that
when he is dead

he may not have any seed left to inherit the kingdom that shall remain
my own realm; God will then be in want of me, and He will restore me to
it with my hosts.
