### ODE 5.

This Ode has strangely appeared in a speech by Salome in another ancient
work called the Pistis Sophia.

1 I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, because I love thee;  
2 O Most High, thou wilt not forsake me, for thou art my hope:  
3 Freely I have received thy grace, I shall live thereby:  
4 My persecutors will come and not see me:  
5 A cloud of darkness shall fall on their eyes; and an air of thick
gloom shall darken them:  
6 And they shall have no light to see: they may not take hold upon me.  
7 Let their counsel become thick darkness, and what I have cunningly
devised, let it return upon their own heads:  
8 For they have devised a counsel, and it did not succeed:  
9 For my hope is upon the Lord, and I will not fear, and because the
Lord is my salvation, I will not fear:  
10 And He is as a garland on my head and I shall not be moved; even if
everything should be shaken, I stand firm;  
11 And if all things visible should perish, I shall not die; because the
Lord is with me and I am with Him. Hallelujah.

### ODE 6.

First century universalism is revealed in an interesting way in verse
10.

1 As the hand moves over the harp, and the strings speak.  
2 So speaks in my members the Spirit of the Lord, and I speak by His
love.  
3 For it destroys what is foreign, and everything that is bitter:  
4 For thus it was from the beginning and will be to the end, that
nothing should be His adversary, and nothing should stand up against
Him.  
5 The Lord has multiplied the knowledge of Himself, and is zealous that
these things should be known, which by His grace have been given to
us.  
6 And the praise of His name He gave us: our spirits praise His holy
Spirit.  
7 For there went forth a stream and became a river great and broad;  
8 For it flooded and broke up everything and it brought (water) to the
Temple:  
9 And the restrainers of the children of men were not able to restrain
it, nor the arts of those whose business it is to restrain waters;  
10 For it spread over the face of the whole earth, and filled
everything: and all the thirsty upon earth were given to drink of it;  
11 And thirst was relieved and quenched: for from the Most High the
draught was given.  
12 Blessed then are the ministers of that draught who are entrusted with
that water of His:  
13 They have assuaged the dry lips, and the will that had fainted they
have raised up;  
14 And souls that were near departing they have caught back from
death:  
15 And limbs that had fallen they straightened and set up: <span

16 They gave strength for their feebleness and light to their eyes:  
17 For everyone knew them in the Lord, and they lived by the water of
life for ever. Hallelujah.
