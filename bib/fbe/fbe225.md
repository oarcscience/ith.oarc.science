### ODE 31.

A song that Marcus Aurelius might have known when he said "*Be like the
promontory against which the waves continually break*."

1 The abysses were dissolved before the Lord: and darkness was destroyed
by His appearance:  
2 Error went astray and perished at His hand: and folly found no path to
walk in, and was submerged by the truth of the Lord.  
3 He opened His mouth and spake grace and joy: and He spake a new song
of praise to His name:  
4 And He lifted up His voice to the Most High, and offered to Him the
sons that were with Him.  
5 And His face was justified, for thus His holy Father had given to
Him.  
6 Come forth, ye that have been afflicted and receive joy, and possess
your souls by His grace; and take to you immortal life.  
7 And they made me a debtor when I rose up, me who had been a debtor:
and they divided my spoil, though nothing was due to them.  
8 But I endured and held my peace and was silent, as if not, moved by
them.  
9 But I stood unshaken like a firm rock which is beaten by the waves and
endures.  
10 And I bore their bitterness for humility's sake:  
11 In order, that I might redeem my people, and inherit it and that I
might not make void my promises to the fathers, to whom I promised the
salvation of their seed. Hallelujah.
