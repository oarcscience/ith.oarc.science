### ODE 41.

We discover that the writer may be a Gentile (v. 8).

1 All the Lord's children will praise Him, and will collect the truth of
His faith.  
2 And His children shall be known to Him. Therefore we will sing in His
love:  
3 We live in the Lord by His grace: and life we receive in His
Messiah:  
4 For a great day has shined upon us: and marvellous is He who has given
us of His glory.  
5 Let us, therefore, all of us unite together in the name of the Lord,
and let us honour Him in His goodness,  
6 And let our faces shine in His light: and let our hearts meditate in
His love by night and by day.  
7 Let us exult with the joy of the Lord.  
8 All those will be astonished that see me. For from another race am
I:  
9 For the Father of truth remembered me: He who possessed me from the
beginning:  
10 For His bounty begat me, and the thought of His heart:  
11 And His Word is with us in all our way;  
12 The Saviour who makes alive and does not reject our souls-;  
13 The man who was humbled, and exalted by His own righteousness,  
14 The Son of the Most High appeared in the perfection of His Father;  
15 And light dawned from the Word that was beforetime in Him;  
16 The Messiah is truly one; and He was known before the foundation of
the world,  
17 That He might save souls for ever by the truth of His name: a new
song arises from those who love Him. Hallelujah.
