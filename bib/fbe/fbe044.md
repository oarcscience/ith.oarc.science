### CHAP. XXXIX.

Adam is cautious--but too late.

THEN Adam returned to Eve, and said to her, "Arise, and take a fig for
thyself, and I will take another; and let us go to our cave."

2 Then Adam and Eve took each a fig and went towards the cave; the time
was about the setting of the sun; and their thoughts made them long to
eat of the fruit.

3 But Adam said to Eve, "I am afraid to eat of this fig. I know not what
may come upon me from it."

4 So Adam wept, and stood praying before God, saying, "Satisfy my
hunger, without my having to eat this fig; for after I have eaten it,
what will it profit me? And what shall I desire and ask of Thee, O God,
when it is gone?"

5 And he said again, "I am afraid to eat of it; for I know not what will
befall me through it."
