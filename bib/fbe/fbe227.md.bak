### ODE 33.

A virgin stands and proclaims (v. 5).

1 Again Grace ran and forsook corruption, and came down in Him to bring
it to nought;  
2 And He destroyed perdition from before Him, and devastated all its
order;  
3 And He stood on a lofty summit and uttered His voice from one end of
the earth to the other:  
4 And drew to Him all those who obeyed Him; and there did not appear as
it were an evil person.  
5 But there stood a perfect virgin who was proclaiming and calling and
saying,  
6 O ye sons of men, return ye, and ye daughters of men, come ye:  
7 And forsake the ways of that corruption and draw near unto me, and I
will enter into you, and will bring you forth from perdition,  
8 And make you wise in the ways of truth: that you be not destroyed nor
perish:  
9 Hear ye me and be redeemed. For the grace of God I am telling among
you: and by my means you shall be redeemed and become blessed.  
10 I am your judge; and they who have put me on shall not be injured:
but they shall possess the new world that is incorrupt:  
11 My chosen ones walk in me, and my ways I will make known to them that
seek me, and I will make them trust in my name. Hallelujah.
