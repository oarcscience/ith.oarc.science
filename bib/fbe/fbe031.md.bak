### CHAP. XXVI.

A beautiful prophecy of eternal life and joy (v. 15). The fall of night.

THEN Adam took Eve, and they began to return to the Cave of Treasures
where they dwelt. But when they neared

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

it and saw it from afar, heavy sorrow fell upon Adam and Eve when they
looked at it.

2 Then Adam said to Eve, "When we were on the mountain we were comforted
by the Word of God that conversed with us; and the light that came from
the east, shone over us.

3 "But now the Word of God is hidden from us; and the light that shone
over us is so changed as to disappear, and let darkness and sorrow come
upon us.

4 "And we are forced to enter this cave which is like a prison, wherein
darkness covers us, so that we are parted from each other; and thou
canst not see me, neither can I see thee."

5 When Adam had said these words, they wept and spread their hands
before God; for they were full of sorrow.

6 And they entreated God to bring the sun to them, to shine on them, so
that darkness return not upon them, and they come not again under this
covering of rock. And they wished to die rather than see the darkness.

7 Then God looked upon Adam and Eve and upon their great sorrow, and
upon all they had done with a fervent heart, on account of all the
trouble they were in, instead of their former well-being, and on account
of all the misery that came upon them in a strange land.

8 Therefore God was not wroth with them; nor impatient with them; but He
was longsuffering and forbearing towards them, as towards the children
He had created.

9 Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said unto him, "Adam, as for
the sun, if I were to take it and bring it to thee, days, hours, years
and months would all come to naught, and the covenant I have made with
thee, would never be fulfilled.

10 "But thou shouldest then be turned and left in a long plague, and no
salvation would be left to thee for ever.

11 "Yea, rather, bear long and calm thy soul while thou abidest night
and day; until the fulfilment of the days, and the time of My covenant
is come.

12 "Then shall I come and save thee, O Adam, for I do not wish that thou
be afflicted.

13 "And when I look at all the good things in which thou didst live, and
why thou camest out of them, then would I willingly show thee mercy.

14 "But I cannot alter the covenant that has gone out of My mouth; else
would I have brought thee back into the garden.

15 "When, however, the covenant is fulfilled, then shall I show thee and
thy seed mercy, and bring thee into a land of gladness, where there is
neither sorrow nor suffering; but abiding joy and gladness, and light
that never fails, and praises that never cease; and a beautiful garden
that shall never pass away."

16 And God said again unto Adam, "Be long-suffering and enter the cave,
for the darkness, of which thou wast afraid, shall only be twelve hours
long; and when ended, light shall arise."

17 Then when Adam heard these words from God, he and Eve worshipped
before Him, and their hearts were comforted. They returned into the cave
after their custom, while tears flowed from their eyes, sorrow and
wailing came from their hearts, and they wished their soul would leave
their body.

18 And Adam and Eve stood praying, until the darkness of night came upon
them, and Adam was hid from Eve, and she from him.

19 And they remained standing in prayer.
