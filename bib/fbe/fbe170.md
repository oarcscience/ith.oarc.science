### LXIII.

Of how not to despise the poor, but to share with them equally, lest
thou be murmured against before God.

WHEN man clothes the naked and fills the hungry, he will find reward
from God.

2 But if his heart murmur, he commits a double evil: ruin of himself and
of that which he gives; and for him there will be no finding of reward
on account of that.

3 And if his own heart is filled with his food and his own flesh (*sc*.
clothed) with his clothing he commits contempt, and forfeit all his
endurance of poverty, and will not find reward of his good deeds.

4 Every proud and magniloquent man is hateful to the Lord, and every
false speech, clothed in untruth; it will be cut with the blade of the
sword of death, and thrown into the fire, and shall burn for all time.'
