### LIX.

Enoch instructs his sons wherefore they may not touch beef because of
what comes from it.

WHOEVER defiles the soul of beasts, defiles his own soul.

2 For man brings clean animals to make sacrifice for sin, that he may
have cure of his soul.

3 And if they bring for sacrifice clean animals, and birds, man has
cure, he cures his soul.

4 All is given you for food, bind it by the four feet, that is to make
good the cure, he cures his soul.

5 But whoever kills beast without wounds, kills his own soul and defiles
his own flesh.

6 And he who does any beast any injury whatsoever, in secret, it is evil
practice, and he defiles his own soul.
