*The Forgotten Books of Eden*, by Rutherford H. Platt, Jr., \[1926\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### XXIII.

Of Enoch's writing, how he wrote his wonderful journeyings and the
heavenly apparitions and himself wrote three hundred and sixty-six
books.

AND he was telling me all the works of heaven, earth and sea, and all
the elements, their passages and goings, and the thunderings of the
thunders, the sun and moon, the goings and changes of the stars, the
seasons, years, days, and hours, the risings of the wind, the numbers of
the angels, and the formation of their songs, and all human things, the
tongue of every human song and life, the commandments, instructions, and
sweet-voiced singings, and all things that it is fitting to learn.

2 And Pravuil told me: 'All the things that I have told thee, we have
written. Sit and write all the souls of mankind, however many of them
are born, and the places prepared for them to eternity; for all souls
are prepared to eternity, before the formation of the world.'

3 And all double thirty days and thirty nights, and I wrote out all
things exactly, and wrote three hundred and sixty-six books.
