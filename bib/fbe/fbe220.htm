<p align="CENTER">Remarkable praise</i>.</p> 
<p>1 I poured out praise to the Lord, for I am His:<br> 2 And I will speak His holy song, for my heart is with Him.<br> 3 For His harp is in my hands, and the Odes of His rest shall not be silent.<br> 4 I will cry unto him from my whole heart: I will praise and exalt Him with all my members.<br> 5 For from the east and even to the west is His praise:<br> 6 And from the south and even to the north is the confession of Him:<br> 7 And from the top of the hills to their utmost bound is His perfection.<br> 8 Who can write the Psalms of the Lord, or who read them?<br> 9 Or who can train his soul for life, that his soul may be saved,<br> 10 Or who can rest on the Most High, so that with His mouth he may speak?<br> 11 Who is able to interpret the wonders of the Lord?<br> 12 For he who could interpret would be dissolved and would become that which is interpreted.<br> 13 For it suffices to know and to rest: for in rest the singers stand,<br> 14 Like a river which has an abundant fountain, and flows to the help of them that seek it. Hallelujah.</p>
