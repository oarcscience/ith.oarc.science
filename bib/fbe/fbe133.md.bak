### XXVI.

God summons from the very lowest a second time that Archas, heavy and
very red should come forth.

AND I summoned the very lowest a second time, and said: 'Let Archas come
forth hard,' and he came forth hard from the invisible.

2 And Archas came forth, hard, heavy, and very red.

3 And I said: 'Be opened, Archas, and let there be born from thee,' and
he came undone, an age came forth, very great and very dark, bearing the
creation of all lower things, and I saw that *it was* good and said to
him:

4 'Go thou down below, and make thyself firm, and be for a foundation
for the lower things,' and it happened and he went down and fixed
himself, and became the foundation for the lower things, and below the
darkness there is nothing else.
