### ODE 14.

This Ode is as beautiful in style as the canonical Psalter.

1 As the eyes of a son to his father, so are my eyes, O Lord, at all
times towards thee.  
2 For with thee are my consolations and my delight.  
3 Turn not away thy mercies from me, O Lord: and take not thy kindness
from me.  
4 Stretch out to me, O Lord, at all times thy right hand: and be my
guide even unto the end, according to thy good pleasure.  
5 Let me be well-pleasing before thee, because of thy glory and because
of thy name:  
6 Let me be preserved from evil, and let thy meekness, O Lord, abide
with me, and the fruits of thy love.  
7 Teach me the Psalms of thy truth, that I may bring forth fruit in
thee:  
8 And open to me the harp of thy Holy Spirit, that with all its notes I
may praise thee, O Lord.  
9 And according to the multitude of thy tender mercies, so thou shalt
give to me; and hasten to grant our petitions; and thou art able for all
our needs. Hallelujah.
