### ODE 35.

"*No cradled child more softly lies than I: come soon, eternity*."

1 The dew of the Lord in quietness He distilled upon me:  
2 And the cloud of peace He caused to rise over my head, which guarded
me continually;  
3 It was to me for salvation: everything was shaken and they were
affrighted;  
4 And there came forth from them a smoke and a judgment; and I was
keeping quiet in the order of the Lord:  
5 More than shelter was He to me, and more than foundation.  
6 And I was carried like a child by his mother: and He gave me milk, the
dew of the Lord:  
7 And I grew great by His bounty, and rested in His perfection,  
8 And I spread out my hands in the lifting up of my soul: and I was made
right with the Most High, and I was redeemed with Him. Hallelujah.
