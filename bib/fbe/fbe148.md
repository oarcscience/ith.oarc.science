### XLI.

Of how Enoch lamented Adam's sin.

AND I saw all forefathers from *all* time with Adam and Eva, and I
sighed and broke into tears and said of the ruin of their dishonour:

2\. 'Woe is me for my infirmity and *for that* of my forefathers,' and
thought in my, heart and said:

3 'Blessed *is* the man who has not been born or who has been born and
shall not sin before the Lord's face, that he come not into this place,
nor bring the yoke of this place!
