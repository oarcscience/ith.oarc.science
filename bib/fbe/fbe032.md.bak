### CHAP. XXVII.

The second tempting of Adam and Eve. The devil takes on the form of a
beguiling light.

WHEN Satan, the hater of all good, saw how they continued in prayer, and
how God communed with them, and comforted them, and how He had accepted
their offering--Satan made an apparition.

2 He began with transforming his hosts; in his hands was a flashing
fire, and they were in a great light.

3 He then placed his throne near the mouth of the cave because he could
not enter into it by reason of their prayers. And he shed light into the
cave, until the cave glistened over Adam and Eve; while his hosts began
to sing praises.

4 And Satan did this, in order that when Adam saw the light, he should
think within himself that it was a heavenly light, and that Satan's
hosts were angels; and that God had sent them to watch at the cave, and
to give him light in the darkness.

5 So that when Adam came out of the cave and saw them, and Adam and Eve
bowed to Satan, then he would overcome Adam thereby, and a second time
humble him before God.

6 When, therefore, Adam and Eve saw the light, fancying it was real,
they strengthened their hearts; yet, as they were trembling, Adam said
to Eve:--

7 "Look at that great light, and at those many songs of praise, and at
that host standing outside that do not come in to us, do not tell us
what they say, or whence they come, or what is the meaning of this
light; what those praises are; wherefore they have been sent hither, and
why they do not come in.

8 "If they were from God, they would come to us in the cave, and would
tell us their errand."

9 Then Adam stood up and prayed unto God with a fervent heart, and
said:--

10 "O Lord, is there in the world another god than Thou, who created
angels and filled them with light, and sent them to keep us, who would
come with them?

11 "But, lo, we see these hosts that stand at the mouth of the cave;
they are in a great light; they sing loud praises. If they are of some
other god than Thou, tell me; and if they are sent by Thee, inform me of
the reason for which Thou hast sent them."

12 No sooner had Adam said this, than an angel from God appeared unto
him in the cave, who said unto him, "O Adam, fear not. This is Satan and
his hosts; he wishes to deceive you as he deceived you at first. For the
first time, he was hidden in the serpent; but this time he is come to
you in the similitude of an angel of light; in order that, when you
worshipped him, he might enthrall you, in the very presence of God."

13 Then the angel went from Adam, and seized Satan at the opening of the
cave, and stripped him of the feint he had assumed, and brought him in
his own hideous form to Adam and Eve; who were afraid of him when they
saw him.

14 And the angel said to Adam, "This hideous form has been his ever
since God made him fall from heaven. He could not have come near you in
it; therefore did he transform himself into an angel of light."

15 Then the angel drove away Satan and his hosts from Adam and Eve, and
said unto them, "Fear not; God who created you, will strengthen you."

16 And the angel went from them.

17 But Adam and Eve remained

standing in the cave; no consolation came to them; they were divided in
their thoughts.

18 And when it was morning they prayed; and then went out to seek the
garden. For their hearts were towards it, and they could get no
consolation for having left it.
