<P>LXIV. Then Saul took thought, saying: I will surely take away the sorcerers out of the land of Israel. So shall men remember me after my departure. And Saul scattered all the sorcerers <TABLE ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%" CELLPADDING=8>

 out of the land. And God said: Behold, Saul hath taken away the sorcerers out of the land, not because of the fear of me, but that he might make himself a name. Behold, whom he hath scattered, unto them let him resort, and get divination from them, because he hath no prophets.</P>
<P>2. At that time the Philistines said every man to his neighbour: Behold, Samuel the prophet is dead and there is none that prayeth for Israel. David, also, which fought for them, is become Saul's adversary and is not with them. Now, therefore, let us arise and fight mightily against them, and avenge the blood of our fathers. And the Philistines assembled themselves and came <I>up</I> to battle. 3. And when Saul saw that Samuel was dead and David was not with him, his hands were loosened. And he inquired of the Lord, and <TABLE ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%" CELLPADDING=8>

 Saul said unto the people: Let us seek out a diviner and inquire of him that which I have in mind. And the people answered him: Behold, now there is a woman named Sedecla,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_160"></A><A HREF="#fn_159"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the daughter of Debin (<I>or</I> Adod) the Madianite, which deceived the people of Israel with sorceries: and lo she <TABLE ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%" CELLPADDING=8>

 dwelleth in Endor. 4. And Saul put on vile raiment and went unto her, he and two men with him, by night and said unto her: Raise up unto me Samuel. And she said: I am afraid of the king Saul. And Saul said unto her: Thou shalt not be harmed of Saul in this matter. And Saul said within himself: When I was king in Israel, even though the Gentiles saw me not, yet knew they that I was Saul. And Saul asked the woman, saying: Hast thou seen Saul at any time? And she said: Oftentimes. And Saul went out and wept and said: Lo, now I know that my beauty is changed, and that the glory of my kingdom is passed from me.</P>

 that she cried out and said: Behold, <I>thou art Saul, wherefore hast thou deceived me</I>? And he said unto her: <I>Fear not, but tell me what thou sawest</I>. And she said: Lo, these 40 years have I raised up the dead for the Philistines, but this appearance hath not been seen, neither shall it be seen hereafter. 6. And Saul said unto her: What is his form? And she said: Thou inquirest of me</P>

For it is not ye that have brought me up, but the precept&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_162"></A><A HREF="#fn_161"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> which God spake unto me while I yet lived, that I should come and tell thee that thou hadst sinned yet the second time in neglecting God.
