heard them and gave rain abundantly, and it was so, when the rain
descended upon the earth, that the bow appeared in the cloud, and the
dwellers upon earth saw the memorial of the covenant and fell upon their
faces and sacrificed, offering burnt offerings unto the Lord.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

of his brother was Jectan.

10\. *And Jectan begat Helmadam and Salastra and Mazaam, Rea, Dura,
Uzia, Deglabal, Mimoel, Sabthphin, Evilac, Iubab*.

Zepheram, Aculon, Sachar, Siphaz, Nabi, Suri, Seciur, Phalacus, Rapho,
Phalthia, Zaldephal, Zaphis, and Arteman, Heliphas. These are the sons
of Phalech, and these are their names, and they took them wives of the
daughters of Jectan and begat sons and daughters and filled the earth.

11\. But Ragau took him to wife Melcha the daughter of Ruth, and she
begat him Seruch. And when the day of her delivery came she said: Of
this child shall be born in the fourth generation one who shall set his
dwelling on high, and shall be called perfect, and undefiled, and he
shall be the father of nations, and his covenant shall not be broken,
and his seed shall be multiplied for ever.

16\.  <span id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md) Then began they that dwelt on
the earth to look upon the stars, and began to prognosticate by them and
to make divination, and to make their sons and daughters pass through
the fire. But Seruch and his sons walked not according to them.

17\. And these are the generations of Noe upon the earth according to
their languages and their tribes, out of whom the nations were divided
upon the earth after the flood.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_26"></span>[82:2](bap20.htm#fr_26.md) IV. The variants in the
forms and divisions of the names are many. In the Appendix on Readings I
have pointed out the Biblical equivalents. It is obvious that some names
and words have dropped out of *Philo*. In the translation I have
introduced very few corrections.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[86:1](bap20.htm#fr_27.md) IV. 16. As is noted in
the Introduction, this verse contradicts Jubilees on the subject of
Serug, and implicitly rejects the story that Terah, Abraham's father,
was an idolater.
