### CHAPTER XIX.

XIX\. At that time Moses slew the nations, and gave half of the spoils
to the people, and he began to declare to them the words of the law
which God spake to them in Oreb. 2. And he spake to them, saying: Lo, I
sleep with my fathers, and shall go

|                 |
|-----------------|
| Dt. 31:27, etc. |

unto my people. But I know that ye will arise and forsake the words that
were ordained unto you by me, and God will be wroth with you and forsake
you and depart out of your land, and bring against you them that hate
you, and they shall have dominion over you, but not unto the end, for he
will remember the covenant which he made with your fathers. 3. But then
both ye and your sons and

|                       |
|-----------------------|
| Asc. Mos. 11:9 *sqq*. |

all your generations after you will arise and seek the day of my death
and will say in their heart: Who will give us a shepherd like unto
Moses, or such another judge to the children of Israel, to pray for our
sins at all times, <span id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_84.md) and to be heard
for our

|                |
|----------------|
| Dt. 4:26, etc. |

iniquities? 4. <span id="fr_85"></span>[2](#fn_85.md) Howbeit, *this day I
call heaven and earth to witness against you*, for the heaven shall hear
this and the earth shall take it in with her ears, that God hath
revealed the end of the world,

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

that he might covenant with you upon his high places, and hath kindled
an everlasting lamp among you. Remember, ye wicked, how that when I
spake unto you, ye answered saying: All that God hath said unto us we
will hear and do. But if we transgress or corrupt our ways, he shall
call a witness against us and cut us off. 5. But know ye that ye did eat
the bread of angels 40 years. And now behold I do bless your tribes,
before my end come. But ye, know ye my labour wherein I have laboured
with you since the day ye came up out of the land of Egypt.

6\. And when he had so said, God spake unto him the third time, saying:
Behold, thou goest to sleep with thy fathers, and this people will arise
and seek me, and will forget my law wherewith I have enlightened them,
and I shall forsake their

|                 |
|-----------------|
| Dt. 32:52, 34:4 |

seed for a season. 7. But unto thee will I show the land before thou
die, but thou shall not enter therein in this age, lest thou see the
graven images whereby this people will be deceived and led out of the
way. I will show thee the place wherein they shall serve me 740 (*l*.
850) years. And thereafter it shall be delivered into the hand of their
enemies, and they shall destroy it, and strangers shall compass it
about, and it shall be in that day as it was in the day when I brake the
tables of the covenant which I made with thee in Oreb: and when they
sinned, that which was written therein vanished away. Now that day was
the 17th day of the 4th month.

8\. And Moses went up into Mount Oreb, as God had bidden him, and
prayed, saying: Behold, I have fulfilled the time of my life, even 120
years. And now I pray thee let thy mercy be with thy people and let thy
compassion be continued upon thine heritage, Lord, and thy
long-suffering in thy

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

place upon the race of thy choosing, for thou hast loved them more than
all. 9. And thou knowest that I was a shepherd of sheep, and when I fed
the flock in the desert, I brought them unto thy Mount Oreb, and then
first saw I thine angel in fire out of the bush; but thou calledst me
out of the bush, and I feared and turned away my face, and thou sentest
me unto them, and didst deliver them out of Egypt, and their enemies
thou didst sink in the water. And thou gavest them a law and judgements
whereby they should live. *For what man is he that hath*

|                 |
|-----------------|
| 1 K. 8:45, etc. |

*not sinned against thee*? How shall thine heritage be established
except thou have mercy on them? Or who shall yet be born without sin?
Yet wilt thou correct them for a season, but not in anger.

10\. Then the Lord shewed him the land and all that is therein and said:
This is the land which

|          |
|----------|
| Dt. 34:1 |

I will give to my people. And he shewed him the place from whence the
clouds draw up water to water all the earth, and the place whence the
river receiveth his water, and the land of Egypt, and the place of the
firmament, from whence the holy land only drinketh. <span
id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_86.md) He shewed him also the place from whence
it rained manna for the people, and even unto the paths of paradise. And
he shewed him the measures of the sanctuary, and the number of the
offerings, and the sign whereby men shall interpret (*lit*. begin to
look; upon) the heaven, and said: These are the things which were
forbidden to the sons of men because they sinned. 11. And now, thy rod
wherewith the

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

signs were wrought shall be for a witness between me and my people. And
when they sin I shall be wroth with them and remember my rod, and spare
them according to my mercy, and thy rod shall be in my sight for a
remembrance all the days, <span id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_87.md) and shall
be like unto the bow wherein I made a covenant with Noe when he came out
of the ark, saying: I will set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a
sign between me and men that the water of a flood be no more upon the
earth. 12. But thee will I take hence and give thee sleep <span
id="fr_88"></span>[2](#fn_88.md) with thy fathers and give thee rest in thy
slumber, and bury thee in peace, and all the angels shall lament for
thee, and the hosts *of heaven* shall be sorrowful. But there shall not
any, of angels or men, know thy sepulchre wherein thou art to be buried,
but thou shalt rest therein until I visit the world, and raise thee up
and thy fathers out of the earth \[of Egypt\] <span
id="fr_89"></span>[3](#fn_89.md) wherein ye shall sleep, and ye shall come
together and dwell in an immortal habitation that is not subject unto
time. 13. But this heaven shall be in my sight as a fleeting cloud, and
like yesterday when it is past, and it shall be when I draw near to
visit the world, I will command the years and charge the times, and they
shall be shortened, and the stars shall be hastened, and the light of

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

the sun make speed to set, neither shall the light of the moon endure,
because I will hasten to raise up you that sleep, that in the place of
sanctification which I shewed thee, all they that can live may dwell
therein.

14\. And Moses said: If I may ask yet one thing of thee, O Lord,
according to the multitude of thy mercy, be not wroth with me. And shew
me what measure of time hath passed by and what remaineth. 15. And the
Lord said to him: An instant, the topmost part of a hand, <span
id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90.md) the fulness of a moment, <span
id="fr_91"></span>[2](#fn_91.md) and the drop of a cup. And time hath
fulfilled all. For 4½ have passed by, and 2½ remain. <span
id="fr_92"></span>[3](#fn_92.md)

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

|          |
|----------|
| Dt. 34:6 |

16\. And Moses when he heard was filled with under standing, and his
likeness was changed gloriously: *and he died* in glory according *to
the mouth of the Lord, and he buried him* as he had promised him, and
the angels lamented at his death, and lightnings and torches and arrows
went before him with one accord. And on that day the hymn of the hosts
was not said because of the departure of Moses. Neither was there any
day like unto it since the Lord made man upon earth, neither shall there
be any such for ever, that he should make the hymn of the angels to
cease because of a man; for he loved him greatly; and he buried him with
his own hands on an high place of the earth, and in the light of the
whole world.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_84"></span>[127:1](bap35.htm#fr_84.md) XIX. 3. *to pray for
our sins at all times*. cf. *Assumption of Moses*, 11:11, 11:17; 12:3.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[127:2](bap35.htm#fr_85.md) 4. DCCXL. years of the
MSS. should, as Dr. Cohn suggests, be changed to DCCCL. From the death
of Moses to the building of the first temple 440 years are reckoned, and
from thence to its destruction 410. The *Seder Olam Rabbah* XI. reckons
seventeen Jubilees (850 years) from the entrance into the Holy Land to
the Captivity (Cohn, p. 327, note).

<span id="fn_86"></span>[129:1](bap35.htm#fr_86.md) 10. *the place of the
firmament from whence the holy land only drinketh*. cf. Babylonian
Talmud *Taanith* I (tr. Rodkinson, p. 24). "The land of Israel is
watered by the Lord himself, while the rest of the world is watered by a
messenger. . . The land of Israel is watered by rain, while the rest of
the world is watered by the residue remaining in the clouds."

<span id="fn_87"></span>[130:1](bap35.htm#fr_87.md) 11. The rod of Moses is
to be transported to heaven and to become a sign like the rainbow.
Perhaps the Milky Way is meant. No such tradition is cited in Mr. I.
Abrahams' interesting paper on "The Rod of Moses," in *Papers read
before the Jews' College Literary Society* (1887, p. 28), nor in
Daehnhardt's *Natursagen*, nor in other sources which I have consulted.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[130:2](bap35.htm#fr_88.md) 12. *give thee sleep*.
*Dormificabo* R., which must be preferred, I think, to *glorificabo* of
AP.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[130:3](bap35.htm#fr_89.md) *the earth* \[*of
Egypt*\]. The word *Aegypti* is certainly intrusive, written
mechanically after *excitabo te*, etc., *de terra*.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[131:1](bap35.htm#fr_90.md) *Lit*.: Here *is*
honey, a great summit.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[131:2](bap35.htm#fr_91.md) 15. The corrupt words
*istic mel apex magnus* I emend into *stigma et apex manus*, cf. 4 Esdr.
4:48-50; 6:9, 6:10. *The fulness of a moment: momenti plenitudo*.
Perhaps this renders ρηοπῆσ πλήρωμα, that which fills the scale of the
balance and causes it to sink.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[131:3](bap35.htm#fr_92.md) *four and a half have
passed and two and a half remain* (cf. 4 Esdr. 14:11). The total, seven,
agrees with that in the Vision of Kenaz (XXVI I 1. 8), "men shall dwell
in the world VII. (*i.e.* 7000) years." The calculation in the present
passage ought to mean that 4500 years are past and 2500 remain: but no
other authority seems to place the death of Moses so late as AM. 4500.
The *Assumption of Moses* puts it in 2500, the Hebrew in 2706, the LXX
in 3859, *Jubilees* in 2450.

There is a certain plausibility in the following view: 4½ stands for 45,
and 2½ for 25: the 45 and 25 consist of weeks of years. Then 45 = 3150,
and 25 = 1750: total 4900, or 7 X 700, a good mystical number. Only it
disagrees with the 7000 of XXVIII. 8. With that passage in view, I think
we must take it that 4½ = 4500, and 2½ 2500, the unit being 100 years.

The *Assumption of Moses* (10:11) says that from the death of Moses "to
the advent of Messiah there will be 250 times," which is superficially
like 2½. The "times" here are commonly taken to mean weeks of years,
making 1750. But if we could take each "time" to be ten years, then 250
<span id="page_132">p. 132</span> times would be 2500 years or fifty
jubilees, and we should <span id="page_132">p. 132</span> *only* have to
alter *bis millesimus et quingentesimus* (I:2) to *quater* (*IIII*.)
*millesimus*, etc., to bring it into exact agreement with *Philo*!
Perhaps this method of dealing with authorities may find more favour
with others than it does with me.

I think it quite possible that the unexplained verse in *Apoc. Bar*.
28:2, "and the measure and reckoning of that time are two parts weeks
(or two parts a week), of seven weeks" may contain the same calculation,
the week being 1000 years, and "two parts a week" being corrupt for 2½
weeks. But if so we should have to assume that the writer of *Apoc.
Bar*. had not allowed for the difference in date between Moses and
Baruch--some 850 years. I do not think that such an inadvertence is
quite out of the question.

Another possibility is that our author, in making his calculation, has
in mind not so much the date of Moses, as that at which he is himself
writing.

Taking the texts as they stand, the calculation, and the whole account
of the death of Moses, show that Philo quite disregards the
*Assumption*, though he may very likely have read it. When I came across
the passage as a separate extract in a MS. and published it, in 1893, I
spent much space in trying to prove that it was actually part of the
*Assumption*. The view neither was nor deserved to be accepted.
