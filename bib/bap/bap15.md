### ADDITIONAL NOTE.

A passage in Origen *On Romans* (IV. 12, p. 646) deserves to be quoted
as being very much in the manner of Philo. "We have found," he says, "in
a certain apocryphal book (in quodam secretiore libello) mention of an
angel of grace who takes his name from grace, being called Ananchel,
*i.e*. the grace of God: and the writing in question says that this
angel was sent by God to Esther to give her favour in the sight of the
king." just so in Philo appropriate angels are sent to Kenaz and to
David and intervene to save the victims of Jair. I think it worth
suggesting that the story of Esther found a place in *Philo*, and that
this was the *secretior libellus* to which Origen refers.
