### CHAPTER XXXVIII.

XXXVIII\. (Then did Jair judge Israel 22 years.)

|           |
|-----------|
| Jud. 10:3 |

The same built a sanctuary to Baal, and led the people astray saying:
Every man that sacrificeth not unto Baal shall die. And when all the
people sacrificed, seven men only would not sacrifice whose names are
these: Dephal, Abiesdrel, Getalibal, Selumi, Assur, Jonadali, Memihel.
2. The same answered and said unto Jair: Behold, we remember the
precepts which they that were before us commanded us, and Debbora our
mother, saying: Take heed that ye turn not away your heart to the right
hand or to the left, but attend unto the law of the Lord day and night.
Now therefore why dost thou corrupt the people of the Lord and deceive
them, saying: Baal is God, let us worship him? And now if he be God as
thou sayest, let him speak as a God, and then we will sacrifice unto
him. 3. And Jair <span id="fr_131"></span>[1](#fn_131.md) said: Burn them
with fire, for they have blasphemed Baal. And his servants took them to
burn them with fire. And when they cast them upon the fire there went
forth Nathaniel, the angel which is over fire, and quenched the fire and
burned up the servants of Jair: but the seven men he made to escape, so
that no man of the people saw them, for he had smitten the people with
blindness. 4. And when Jair came to the place (*or* it came to the place
of Jair) he also was burned. But before he burned him, the angel of the
Lord said unto him: Hear the word of the Lord before thou diest. Thus
saith the Lord: I raised thee up out

of the land of Egypt, and appointed thee ruler over my peoples. But thou
hast risen and corrupted my covenant, and hast led them astray, and hast
sought to burn my servants in the flame, because they reproved thee,
which though they be burned with corruptible fire, yet now are they
quickened with living fire and are delivered. But thou shalt die, saith
the Lord, and in the fire wherein thou shalt die, therein shalt thou
have thy dwelling. And thereafter he burned him, and came even unto the
pillar of Baal and overthrew it, and burned up Baal with the people that
stood by, even 1000 men.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_131"></span>[187:1](bap54.htm#fr_131.md) XXXVIII. it is not
clear why Jair is selected for the part of an apostate and idolatrous
judge. The story of the Three Children (Dan. 3), and perhaps also those
of the Maccabaean martyrs, have been in the writer's mind.
