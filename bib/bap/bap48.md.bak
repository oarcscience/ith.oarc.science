### CHAPTER XXXII.

|          |
|----------|
| Jud. 5:1 |

XXXII\. *Then Debbora and Barach the son of Abino* and all the people
together *sang* an hymn unto the Lord *in that day*, saying: Behold,
from on high hath the Lord shewn unto us his glory, even as he did
aforetime when he sent forth his voice to confound the tongues of men.
And he chose out our nation, and took Abraham our father out of the
fire, and chose him before all his brethren, and kept him from the fire
and delivered him from the bricks of the building of the tower, and gave
him a son in the latter days of his old age, and brought him out of the
barren womb, and all the angels were jealous against him, and the
orderers of the hosts envied him. <span id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_123.md)
2. And it came to pass, when they were jealous against him, God said
unto him: Slay for me the fruit of thy belly and offer for my

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

sake that which I gave thee. And Abraham did not gainsay him and set
forth immediately. And as he went forth he said to his son: Lo, now, my
son, I offer thee for a burnt offering and deliver thee into his hands
who gave thee unto me. 3. And the son said to his father: Hear me,
father. If a lamb of the flock is accepted for an offering to the Lord
for an odour of sweetness, and if for the iniquities of men sheep are
appointed to the slaughter, but man is set to inherit the world, how
then sayest thou now unto me: Come and inherit a life secure, and a time
that cannot be measured? What and if I had not been born in the world to
be offered a sacrifice unto him that made me? And it shall be my
blessedness beyond all men, for there shall be no other *such thing*;
and in me shall the generations be instructed, and by me the peoples
shall understand that the Lord hath accounted the soul of a man worthy
to be a sacrifice unto him. 4. And when his father had offered him upon
the altar and had bound his feet to slay him, the Most Mighty hasted and
sent forth his voice from on high saying: Kill not thy son,

|            |
|------------|
| Gen. 22:11 |

neither destroy the fruit of thy body: for now have I showed forth
*myself* that I might appear to them that know me not, and have shut the
mouths of them that always speak evil against thee. And thy memorial
shall be before me for ever, and thy name and the name of this *thy son*
from one generation to another.

5\. And to Isaac he gave two sons, which also were from a womb shut up,
for at that time their mother was in the third year of her marriage. And
it shall not be so with any other woman, neither shall any wife boast
herself so, that cometh near to her husband in the third year. And there
were born to him two sons, even Jacob and Esau. And

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

\[paragraph continues\] God loved Jacob, but Esau he hated because of
his deeds.

6\. And it came to pass in the old age of their father, that Isaac
blessed Jacob and sent him into Mesopotamia, and there he begat 12 sons,
and they went down into Egypt and dwelled there.

7\. And when their enemies dealt evilly with them, the people cried unto
the Lord, and their prayer was heard, and he brought them out thence,
and led them unto the mount Sina, and brought forth unto them the
foundation of understanding which he had prepared from the birth of the
world; and then the foundation was moved, the hosts sped forth the
lightnings upon their courses, and the winds sounded out of their
storehouses, and the earth was stirred from her foundation, and the
mountains and the rocks trembled in their fastenings, and the clouds
lifted up their waves against the flame of the fire that it should not
consume the world. 8. Then did the depth awake from his springs, and all
the waves of the sea came together. Then did Paradise give forth the
breath of her fruits, and the cedars of Libanus were moved from their
roots. And the beasts of the field were terrified in the dwellings of
the forests, and all his works gathered together to behold the Lord when
he ordained a covenant with the children of Israel. And all things that
the Most Mighty said, these hath he observed, having for witness Moses
his beloved.

9\. And when he was dying *God* appointed unto him the firmament, <span
id="fr_124"></span>[1](#fn_124.md) and shewed him these witnesses whom now
we have, saying: Let the heaven whereinto

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

thou hast entered and the earth wherein thou hast walked until now be a
witness between me and thee and my people. For the sun and the moon and
the stars shall be ministers unto us (*or* you).

10\. And when Jesus arose to rule over the people, it came to pass in
the day wherein he fought against the enemies, that the evening drew
near, while yet the battle was strong, and Jesus said to the sun and the
moon: O ye ministers that were appointed between the Most Mighty and his
sons, lo now, the battle goeth on still, and do ye forsake your office?
Stand still therefore to-day and give light unto his sons, and put
darkness upon our enemies. And they did so.

11\. And now in these days Sisara arose to make us his bondmen, and we
cried unto the Lord our God, and he commanded the stars and said: Depart
out of your ranks, and burn mine enemies, that they may know my might.
And the stars came down and overthrew their camp and kept us safe
without any labour.

12\. Therefore will we not cease to sing praises, neither shall our
mouths keep silence from telling of his marvellous works: for he hath
remembered his promises both new and old, and hath shown us his
deliverance,: and therefore doth Jahel boast herself among women,
because she alone hath brought this good way to success, in that with
her own

|             |
|-------------|
| Judith 13:2 |

hands she slew Sisara.

13\. O earth, go thou, go, ye heavens and lightnings, go, ye angels and
hosts, \[go ye\] and tell the fathers in the treasure-houses of their
souls, and say: The Most Mighty hath not forgotten the least of all the
promises which he made with us, saying: Many wonders will I perform for
your sons. And now from this day forth it shall be

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

known that whatsoever God hath said unto men that he will perform, he
will perform it, even though man die. 14. Sing praises, sing praises, O
Debbora (*or*, if man delay to sing praises to God, yet sing thou, O
Debbora), and let the grace of an holy spirit awake in thee, and begin
to praise the works of the Lord: for there shall not again arise such a
day, wherein the stars shall bear tidings and overcome the enemies of
Israel, as it was commanded them. From this time forth if Israel fall
into a strait, let him call upon these his witnesses together with their
ministers, and they shall go upon an embassy to the most High, and he
will remember this day, and will send a deliverance to his covenant. 15.
And thou, Debbora, begin to speak of that thou sawest in the field: how
that the people walked and went forth safely, and the stars fought on
their part (*or*, how that, like peoples walking, so went forth the
stars and fought). Rejoice, O land, over them that dwell in thee, for in
thee is the knowledge of the Lord which buildeth his stronghold in thee.
For it was of right that God took out of thee the rib of him that was
first formed, knowing that out of his rib Israel should be born. And thy
forming shall be for a testimony of what the Lord hath done for his
people.

16\. Tarry, O ye hours of the day, and hasten not onward, that we may
declare that which our understanding can bring forth, for night will
come upon us. And it shall be like the night when God smote the
firstborn of the Egyptians for the sake of his firstborn. 17. And then
shall I cease from my hymn because the time will be hastened (*or*
prepared) for his righteous ones. For I will sing unto him as in the
renewing of the creation, and the people shall remember this
deliverance, and it

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

shall be for a testimony unto them. Let the sea also bear witness, with
the deeps thereof, for not only did God dry it up before the face of our
fathers, but he did also overthrow the camp from its setting and
overcame our enemies.

18\. And when Debbora made an end of her words she went up with the
people together unto Silo, and they offered sacrifices and burnt
offerings and sounded upon the broad trumpets. <span
id="fr_125"></span>[1](#fn_125.md) And when they sounded and had offered
the sacrifices, Debbora said: This shall be for a testimony of the
trumpets between the stars and the Lord of them.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_123"></span>[174:1](bap48.htm#fr_123.md) XXXII. 1, 2. The
angels were jealous of Abraham. In *Jubilees* it is the adversary
Mastema who suggests the sacrifice of Isaac: in *Pirke R. Eliezer* the
ministering angels intercede for Isaac. I have not found the statement
of our text elsewhere.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[176:1](bap48.htm#fr_124.md) 9. *appointed unto
him the firmament*: *Disposuit ei firmamentum*. Perhaps the meaning is
"displayed the firmament arranged in its order."

<span id="fn_125"></span>[179:1](bap48.htm#fr_125.md) 18. *on the broad
trumpets*: *de latis psalphingis*. Can this be meant to render ἐν
σάλπιγξιν ἐλαταῖσ (Ps. 97:7)?
