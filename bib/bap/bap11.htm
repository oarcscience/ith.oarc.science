<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">10. RELATION TO OTHER LITERATURE.</H3>
<P>10. THE RELATION OF PHILO TO OTHER BOOKS now comes up for consideration. The author's knowledge of the Old Testament literature is</P>
<P><A NAME="page_43"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 43</FONT></A></P>
<P>apparent on every page. There are obvious borrowings from all the books to the end of 2 Kings; of Chronicles he seems to be a definite imitator. He knows the story of job, and quotes a Psalm; he draws from Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel. With the Wisdom literature he has not much in common, and traces of the use of the Minor Prophets, of Ezra, Nehemiah, or Tobit, are hard to find, though I will not deny their presence.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> If he lived, as I believe he did, near the end of the first century, we should naturally credit him with a knowledge of the whole Jewish canon.</P>
<P>It is more important to determine his relation to the apocryphal books--the literature to which he was himself a contributor. Four of these, <I>Enoch</I>, <I>Jubilees</I>, the <I>Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch</I>, and the <I>Fourth Book of Esdras</I>, afford interesting material.</P>
<P>(<I>a</I>) Certain affinities with the <I>Book of Enoch</I> are traceable in <I>Philo</I>. It is true that Enoch is not one of his heroes; in fact, he tells us no more of him than is found in Genesis, but I believe that the Book was known to him, though it is only in the first part of it that I find any striking parallels.</P>
<P>In the first place, his view of the stars and other heavenly bodies is like that of <I>Enoch</I>. They are sentient beings, who receive commands from God and move about to execute them. See the story of Sisera, and the hymn of Deborah, and compare in <I>Enoch</I> 6, etc., the punishment of the errant stars.</P>
<P>Again, a passage in Enoch (14<SUP>8</SUP>) seems to be the model of some in Philo. "Behold, clouds called me in my vision, and mists cried to me, and runnings of stars and lightnings hastened me, and in the vision winds gave me wings and lifted me</P>
<P>
<A HREF="bap54.htm#page_188">188</A>.}</P>
<P><A NAME="page_44"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 44</FONT></A></P>
<P>up." Compare <I>Philo</I> XI. 5: "The heavens were folded up, and the clouds drew up water . . . and the thunders and lightnings were multiplied, and the winds and tempests sounded; the stars were gathered together, and the angels ran before " (XIII. 7); "the winds shall sound and the lightnings run on," etc. (XV. 2); "the lightnings of the stars shone, and the thunders followed, sounding with them" (XXXII. 7); "the lightnings hasted to their courses, and the winds gave a sound out of their storehouses," etc. The phrase in <I>Enoch</I> 14 <SUP>8</SUP>, <SUP>10</SUP>, <SUP>11</SUP> is &#0948;&#0953;&#0945;&#0948;&#0961;&#0959;&#0956;&#0945;&#8054; &#7936;&#0963;&#0964;&#0941;&#0961;&#0969;&#0957; &#0954;&#0945;&#8054; &#7936;&#0963;&#0964;&#0961;&#0945;&#0960;&#0945;&#0943;. In 16<SUP>1</SUP> we have &#8001; &#0945;&#7984;&#8060;&#0957; &#8001; &#0956;&#0941;&#0947;&#0945;&#0963;, which may be the source of the <I>immensurabilis mundus</I> (<I>seculum tempus</I>) of Philo IX. 3, XXXII. 3, XXXIV. 2.</P>
<P>In Enoch 17<SUP>3</SUP>, &#0964;&#8057;&#0958;&#0959;&#0957; &#0960;&#0965;&#0961;&#8056;&#0963; &#0954;&#0945;&#8054; &#0946;&#0941;&#0955;&#0951;. Philo XIX. 16, <I>praecedebant eum fulgura et lampades et sagittae omnes unanimes</I>.</P>
<P>Enoch 18<SUP>1</SUP>, &#0917;&#8150;&#8125;&#0948;&#0959;&#0957; &#0964;&#0959;&#8058;&#0963; &#0952;&#0951;&#0963;&#0945;&#0965;&#0961;&#0959;&#8058;&#0963; &#0964;&#8182;&#0957; &#7936;&#0957;&#0941;&#0956;&#0969;&#0957;; cf. Philo XXXII. 7, above. The winds gave a sound out of their storehouses (<I>promptuariis</I>).</P>
<P>In Enoch 18<SUP>6</SUP> <I>seq</I>. we hear something of precious stones which reminds us of those of Kenaz in <I>Philo</I> XXVI. <I>seq</I>.</P>
<P>The words of 21<SUP>2</SUP>: "I saw neither heaven above nor earth founded, but a place imperfect and terrible" recall the vision of Kenaz in <I>Philo</I> XXVIII. 6 <I>seq</I>.</P>
<P>So also the description of the sweet plants of Paradise in <I>Enoch</I> 24 may have suggested the words of Moses in <I>Philo</I> XII. 9.</P>
<P>In Enoch 25<SUP>2</SUP> "to Visit the earth" has more than one parallel in <I>Philo</I>, e. g. XIX. 12, 13, <I>visitare seculum, orbem</I>: and Enoch 25<SUP>7</SUP> (Then I blessed the God of glory . . . who hath prepared such things for righteous men, etc.) is like <I>Philo</I> XXVI. 6: Blessed be God who hath wrought such signs for</P>
<P><A NAME="page_45"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 45</FONT></A></P>
<P>the sons of men, and 14: Lo, how great good things God hath wrought for men.</P>
<P>(<I>b</I>) The <I>Book of Jubilees</I> is perhaps most nearly comparable to <I>Philo</I>, in that it follows the form of a chronicle of Bible history. Its spirit and plan are, to be sure, wholly different; it is regulated by a strict system of chronology, and its chief interest is in the ceremonial law. It is also far earlier in date, belonging to the last years of the second century B.C.</P>
<P>Our author has read <I>Jubilees</I>, and to a certain extent supplements it in the portions which are common to both books. Thus <I>Jubilees</I> supplies us with the names of the wives of the early patriarchs: <I>Philo</I> omits these, but gives the names of their sons and daughters. It is true that he gives other names for the daughters of Adam, and that in the one case in which he supplies the name of a wife he also differs from <I>Jubilees</I>: with him Cain's wife is Themech, in <I>Jubilees</I> it is Aw&acirc;n (daughter of Adam and sister of Cain, which <I>Philo</I> may have wished to disguise). In the same way <I>Philo</I> devotes much space to the names and number of the grandsons of Noah and their families, which are wanting in <I>Jubilees</I>; and whereas <I>Jubilees</I> gives full geographical details of the provinces which fell to Shem, Ham and Japhet, <I>Philo</I> indulges only in a series of bare names of places, now for the most part hopelessly corrupt. There is a small and seemingly intentional contradiction of <I>Jubilees</I> in this part of his history: <I>Jubilees</I> <SUP>118</SUP>, says that Serug taught Nahor to divine, and worshipped idols. <I>Philo</I> agrees that divination began in the days of Terah and Nahor, but adds that Serug and his sons did <I>not</I> join in it, or in idolatry.</P>
<P>Then, whereas the bulk of <I>Jubilees</I> is occupied with the lives of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, <I>Philo</I>&nbsp;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_46"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 46</FONT></A></P>
<P>tells in detail one episode--the rescue of Abram from the fire--which <I>Jubilees</I> omits, and passes over the rest of the period in a single page. Anything else that he has to say about Abraham and the rest is introduced into the speeches of later personages (Joshua, Deborah, etc.) by way of illustration. The two books agree in giving the names of the seventy souls who went down into Egypt.</P>
<P>All this seems to me to show a consciousness of <I>Jubilees</I>, and an intentional avoidance, in the main, of the ground traversed by that book. Very rarely is there any coincidence of thought, but two possible examples can be cited. <I>Philo</I> has surprisingly little to say about Satan or evil spirits, as we have seen: but suddenly (in XLV. 6) he says: <I>Et dixit Dominus ad anticiminum</I>: And the Lord said to the Adversary. This must surely be the equivalent of the "prince Mastema" whom we meet so frequently in <I>Jubilees</I>. There is also a difficult passage (XIII. 8) which may go back to <I>Jubilees</I>. God is speaking to Moses, and says: "And the nights shall yield their dew, as I spake after the flood of the earth, at that time when I commanded him (or Then he commanded him) concerning the year of the life of Noah, and said to him: These are the years which I ordained," etc. The words, which may be corrupt, at least remind me of the stress laid in <I>Jubilees</I> 6, upon the yearly feast that is to be kept by Noah after the Flood.</P>
<P>Upon the whole <I>Philo's</I> knowledge of <I>Jubilees</I> is to be inferred rather from what he does not say than from what he does.</P>
<P>(<I>c</I>) The Syriac APOCALYPSE OF BARUCH has, as I have elsewhere shown (JTS 1915, 403), certain very marked resemblances to <I>Philo</I>. It will be</P>
<P><A NAME="page_47"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 47</FONT></A></P>
<P>right to repeat and expand the list of them here. We will take the passages in the order in which they appear in the Apocalypse, in Dr. R. H. Charles's last translation (<I>Pseudepigrapha of O.T.</I>).</P>

<P>It will be seen that these resemblances (not all of which, of course, are supposed by me to be equally strong) are scattered over the whole text of <I>Baruch</I>. To me they seem to constitute one among a good many weighty arguments against the hypothesis that <I>Baruch</I> is a composite work but this is not the place to discuss that matter.</P>
<P>(<I>d</I>) We will examine 4 ESDRAS in the same fashion, only here it will be better to cite the Latin of both texts. We must keep in mind the difference between coincidences of vocabulary and parallels in matter. The versions of the two books are extraordinarily alike in their Latinity. One is tempted to say that they are by the same hand; but it will be safer to regard them as products of the same school and age.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the later chapters of <I>Esdras</I>, which are taken up with visions, we--perhaps naturally--find fewer parallels than in the earlier.</P>
<P>Other instances of words and phrases common to the two books, which are stylistic rather than anything else, are--</P>
<I><P>Ecce dies uenient, qui inhabitant terram, sensus, delere orbis, sustinere, adinuentio, renuntiare, in nouissimis temporibus, odoramentum, in nihilum deputare, requietio, aeramentum, corruptibilis, plasmare, uiuificare, mortificare, conturbare, exterminare, humiliare, fructus uentris, apponere</I> or <I>adicere</I> (<I>loqui</I>, etc.), <I>oblatio, pessimus</I> in the positive sense, <I>a minimo usque ad maximum, expugnare, scintilla</I>.</FONT></P>
<P>With the <I>Assumption of Moses</I> I find no community of ideas. Moses' intercession for the people and Joshua's lament are rather like those of the people over Joshua and Deborah. But <I>Philo</I> discards the story of the Assumption proper. Nor do I find illustrative matter in the <I>Testaments of the XII. Patriarchs</I>.</P>
<P>My general conclusion is that <I>Philo</I> is a product of the circle from which both <I>Baruch</I> and 4 <I>Esdras</I> emanated: and it seems to me clear that the writer of <I>Baruch</I> at least was acquainted with <I>Philo</I>. Let it be noted once more that a feature common to all three books is a remarkable want of</P>
<P><A NAME="page_59"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 59</FONT></A></P>
<P>interest in the subject of Satan and evil spirits: <I>Esdras</I> never mentions them, <I>Baruch</I> very seldom, <I>Philo</I> rather oftener, but not often, and always vaguely.</P>
<P>(<I>e</I>) What points of contact are there, it will be asked, between <I>Philo</I> and the NEW TESTAMENT?</P>
<P>My answer is that there are not many direct resemblances. There are a few coincidences of language, and one or two illustrations of beliefs. That the author, living at the date to which I assign him, was conscious of the existence of Christianity, I do not doubt: whether he allows his consciousness to find expression in his book, I do doubt. He is not a speculative theologian or a controversialist; he sticks very close to the language of the Old Testament, and steers clear of disputed questions. I see no veiled polemic in his stories of the idolatry under Kenaz, or of Aod the Magician and Micah. The persecution under Jair may very well be an imitation of the Maccab&aelig;an martyrdoms, or of the story of the Three Children. The stress laid on the eternity of the Law may as well be a prophylactic against heathenism as against Christianity. Paganism is, I think, a more formidable adversary in his eyes than heresy.</P>
<P>The tradition of the "rock that followed them" (X. 7, XI. 15: see the notes) and of the identity of Phinehas with Elijah (XLVIII.) are the chief that bear on New Testament thought. With reference to the latter it should be noted that the words of St. Mark (ix. 13), "as it is written of him," are specially interesting, as showing that Elijah upon his return to earth was to suffer death (in which <I>Philo</I> agrees), and that there was written teaching to that effect.</P>
