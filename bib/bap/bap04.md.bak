### 3. AUTHORITIES FOR THE TEXT.

3\. The next business is to describe the AUTHORITIES FOR THE TEXT of
*Philo*.

(*a*) We will take the printed edition of 1527 first (of which the four
others of 1538-50-53-99 are mere reprints). Its symbol shall be **A**.
In his preface, addressed to the monks of Fulda, Sichardus, like many
editors of the Renaissance period, tells us but little of the
manuscripts he used. The substance of what he says is as follows. At one
time he had hoped to be able to remedy the many corruptions of the
manuscripts, of which he had two; but he gradually came to despair of
doing so, and resolved to give the text as he found it. His two
manuscripts were as like each other as two eggs, so that he could not
doubt that one was a copy of the other, though they were preserved in
libraries far apart. He employed the Fulda copy, and had previously
obtained the use of one from Lorsch Abbey, which was very old, and had
expected that these would provide the materials for a satisfactory
edition; moreover, he had got wind of the existence of another copy. But
his manuscripts proved disappointing, and he is well aware that the
present edition is inadequate. In preparing it he has aimed at following
his manuscripts as closely as possible, and in issuing it now has judged
that the evils of delay are greater than those of haste; especially as
he looks forward to putting forth a greatly improved text in the
future. <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md)

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

(*b*) We have seen that the Fulda MS. is traceable in the library
catalogues late in the sixteenth century. Until lately it was thought to
have been lost, along with the bulk of the Fulda MSS.: but it has been
identified, first by Dr. Cohn, and then, independently, by Dr. P.
Lehmann, with a MS. at Cassel (*Theol*. 4° 3) of the eleventh century.
The Lorsch MS. still remains undiscovered.

The identity of the Cassel MS. with that used by Sichardus is not
doubtful. In its cover is an inscription by him stating that he had it
rebound in 1527. It also retains the old label, of the fourteenth
century, with the title *Liber Philonis Antiquitatum*, and the old Fulda
press-mark.

The book which furnishes this information is a special study, published
by, Dr. Lehmann in 1912, of the libraries and manuscripts used by
Sichardus for the purpose of his various editions of ancient authors.
Dr. Lehmann has collected, *à propos* of Sichardus's *Philo*, notices of
all the MSS. of the Latin *Philo* known to exist, and has succeeded in
increasing the number, from three which were known to Dr. Cohn in 1898,
to sixteen, eleven of

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

which contain the text of the Antiquities. They are as follows-

Admont (an abbey in Austria) 359, Of cent. xi., containing *Ant*. and
*Quaest. in Gen*.  
Cassel, theol. 4° 3, of cent. xi. (the Fulda MS.), containing *Ant*. and
*Quaest*.  
Cheltenham) Phillipps 461, of cent. xii, from Trèves, containing
*Ant*.  
Cues (near Trèves), 16 (or H. II), Of 1451, paper, containing *Ant*. and
*Quaest*.  
Munich, lat. 4569, of cent. xii., from Benedictbeuren, containing *Ant*.
and *Quaest*.  
Munich, lat. 17,133, of cent. xii., from Schäftlarn, containing *Ant*.
and *Quaest*.  
Munich, lat. 18,481, of cent. xi., from Tegernsee, containing *Ant*. and
*Quaest*.  
Rome, Vatican, lat. 488, of cent. xv., containing *Ant*. and *Quaest*.  
Vienna, lat. 446, of cent. xiii., containing *Ant*.  
Würzburg, M. ch. f. 210, of cent. xv. (paper), containing *Ant*.  
Würzburg, M. ch. f 276, of cent. xv. (paper), containing *Ant*. and
*Quaest*.

Besides these, there are at Augsburg, Florence, Rome, Trèves, MSS.
containing *Quaest*. only, and at Coblenz one of which no particulars
were forthcoming.

For the purposes of the present volume only four of the above
authorities have been employed, namely, the Fulda-Cassel MS. as
represented by Sichardus's edition (and with it we must allow for some
use of the lost MS. from Lorsch), the Cheltenham, Vatican, and Vienna
MSS. The fact that Dr. Cohn was known to have in contemplation a full
critical edition precluded others from trying to cover the whole ground,
and, even had it been otherwise desirable to do so, the investigation
would have been very difficult for anyone outside Germany. There are,
for instance, no printed catalogues of the Admont, Cassel, or Würzburg
libraries.

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

However, the paucity of authorities here brought to bear is of little
importance. What Dr. Lehmann tells us <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md)
is sufficient to show that none of the MSS. present a completer text
than we already know. All must go back to an ancestor which was already
mutilated when our first transcripts of it were made. Upon this point
more will be said. At present we will take account of what Dr. Lehmann
has to say of Sichardus's MSS., and proceed to the description of the
MSS. actually used, and of some subsidiary authorities.

Of the Fulda MS. we now learn that it is the work of more than one
scribe, of the eleventh century. The *Antiquities* occupy ff. 1-65*a*,
and have a title in a late medieval hand: *Libri Philonis Iudei de
initio mundi*, which, or the like, is "usual in the MSS." The
*Quaestiones*, entitled (in the original hand): *Filonis Questionum in
genisi et solutionum*, follow on ff. 65*a*-89*a*, and in them is a
noteworthy feature. On f. 86, in the middle of the page the MS. omits,
without any sign of a break, a long passage containing the end of the
Quaestiones and the beginning of the *De Essaeis*, and corresponding to
pp. 82, l. 40-84, l. 16 of Sichardus's edition. At this point Sichardus
has a marginal note: "Here the copies differed, but we have followed
that of Lorsch, as being the older." Now this same gap is found in most,
if not in all, of the other MSS., and not all of these are copied
directly from the Fulda MS. We may say, therefore, that all MSS. showing
this gap are independent of the Lorsch MS., but not necessarily
dependent on the Fulda MS.

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

It is clear from what has been said that Sichardus was wrong in
regarding the Fulda MS. as a copy of that of Lorsch, and that the latter
represented an old and valuable tradition: and, further, that he
exaggerates greatly when he says that the two MSS. were as alike as two
eggs. <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) Dr. Lehmann's final remark is
that the disappearance of the Lorsch MS. is very much to be deplored,
for, judged by the Greek fragments and the Armenian version of the
*Quaestiones*, it represented a better tradition than all the extant
Latin MSS.

Of the other MSS. in the list given above, it may be observed that the
Cues MS. (written at Gottweih in 1451) and the two Würzburg MSS. are not
likely to be of very much value: and that, of the three Munich MSS.,
that from Tegernsee (18481) is to all appearance the parent of the other
two. Probably the monk who wrote to Tegernsee to borrow a Philo (see p.
10) was a member of Benedictbeuren or Schäftlarn. The Schäftlarn copy
(17133) was written between 1160 and 1164. <span
id="fr_7"></span>[2](#fn_7.md)

I now proceed to give a detailed account of the three complete MSS.
which I have been able to use, and of certain subsidiary authorities.
The three MSS. are those mentioned by Dr. Cohn in his article, and I
have been led to examine them during recent years by my interest in the
text, and without serious thought of using them for the purposes of an
edition. They are the copies preserved at Cheltenham, Vienna, and Rome.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

P. The Phillipps MS. 461 is a small vellum book (6 5/8 x 4 3/4 in.) of
124 leaves, with 20 lines to a page; a few leaves palimpsest, over not
much older writing. It is of cent. XII., clearly written: on f. 1*a* the
provenance is stated, in this inscription: Codex SX (?) *Sci. Eucharii
primi Trevirorum archiepi. siquis eum abstulerit anathema sit. Amen.* A
hand of cent. XV. adds the word *Mathie*. Then follows the title, of
cent. XV.: *Philo iudeus de successione generacionis veteris
Testamenti*. On f. 1*b* is Jerome's account of Philo (*de virr.
illustr*. c. XI.): the text of the book begins on 3a: *Adam genuit*, and
ends on 119*b* without colophon. It is followed by a few pieces of
medieval Latin verse, of no great interest. The first begins; *Carnis in
ardore flagrans monialis amore*. Another is on Chess: *Qui cupit
egregium scacorum noscere ludum Audiat. ut potui carmine composui*.

V. Vindobonensis lat. 446, a small folio of 53 leaves, with 31 lines to
a page, in a tall, narrow, rather sloping hand, doubtless German, by
more than one scribe: of cent. XII. late or XIII. early. There is an old
press-mark of cent. XVI.: XI°. 68. The text is preceded by *Jeronimus de
Phylone in catalogo uirorum illustrium*. It begins *Incip. Genesis*.
INITIUM MUNDI. *Adam genuit*, and ends on 53*a* without colophon,
occupying the whole volume.

R. Vaticanus lat. 488, of cent. XV., in a very pretty Roman hand, in
double columns of 35 lines. The first 8*c*, leaves contain tracts of
Augustine, Prosper and Jerome. Our book, to which is prefixed the
extract from Jerome, begins on f. 81. It is headed: *Genesis*, and
begins: *Inicium mundi. Adam Genuit*. The colophon is: *Explicit ystoria
philonis ab initio mundi usque ad David regent*. It is followed by the
*Quaestiones et Solutiones in Genesim*, which occupy ff. 129-148 (end).
The arms of Paul V. and of Cardinal Scipione Borghese the librarian are
on the binding: there is no other mark of provenance.

 

P is thus the only one of the three manuscripts whose old home can be
definitely fixed. It belonged to the abbey of St. Eucharius, otherwise
called of St. Matthias (whose body lies there), just outside Trèves.

(*c*) Next come certain manuscripts which contain extracts from the
text.

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

Ph. The Phillipps MS. 391, Of 92 ff., of cent. XII. early, contains
principally tracts of Jerome, notably *Quaestiones Hebraicae*. On ff.
87-8 it has the four extracts which I printed in 1893 (see above). It
belonged to Leander van Ess, and has an old press-mark C I or C 7.

T. No. 117 in the Town Library at Trèves. A paper MS., dated 1459. It
contains five of the same tracts as Ph and two of the extracts from
*Philo*. It retains its old press-mark, B II, and an inscription showing
that it belonged to the abbey of S. Maria ad Martyres at Trèves. The
contents of the book and the text of the extracts make it clear that T
is a copy of Ph or of a sister-book, while the form of the press-mark
shows that Ph and T belonged to the same library. Thus T is only
important as helping to "place" Ph.

F. MS. McClean 31 in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge (fully described
in my catalogue of the McClean MSS.), is a remarkable copy of the
*Aurora*, or versified Bible, of Petrus de Riga. It is of cent. XIII.,
and is copiously annotated. Among the *marginalia* are many extracts (a
complete list will be found at the beginning of the Appendix on various
Readings) from *Philo*, uniformly introduced under that name, and for
the most part abridged. The manuscript may have been written in the
Rhine Provinces, or in Eastern France.

J. The Hebrew *Chronicle of Jerahmeel*, edited in an English translation
by Dr. M. Gaster (*Oriental Translation Fund*, *New series* IV., 1899),
was compiled early in cent. XIV. somewhere in the Rhineland. It contains
large portions of Philo, some *in extenso*, some abridged. A list is
given in the Appendix. Dr. Gaster will have it that the Hebrew is the
original text; but Hebraists do not agree with him, and it is, in fact,
possible to show that the Hebrew writer was translating from Latin, and
from a manuscript which contained misreadings common to those we now
have. See the Appendix of Readings on III. 10, VII. 3.

(*d*) Glancing back over the list, we see that for all but one of the
items a German origin is established. The Vatican MS. is the exception,
and even this presents certain indications of German origin. Near the
beginning of the book (III. 3) is a speech beginning *Deleam*. R reads
*Vel eam*.

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Now it is a habit with German scribes of the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries to write their capital D's with a
sharply-pointed base, making the letter very like the outline of the
conventional harp, and also very like a capital V; nor do I know any
other script in which the likeness between D and V is so striking. My
guess is that the scribe of R, encountering the puzzling letter near the
beginning of his work, made the mistake, which he does not repeat; and I
regard it as an indication that his archetype was a German book of the
same age as V (and, I may say by anticipation, presenting a remarkably
similar text to that of V).

Thus the geographical distribution of the authorities combines with the
evidence of the literature to show that in the Middle Ages *Philo* was
circulated within very narrow limits, and practically confines those
limits to Germany and Northern France.

\(e\) Of these authorities I have transcribed A, collated P (on the
spot),and R (from a photograph) in full; have examined and partially
collated V (on the spot), and have transcribed Ph, T, and F: J is in
print, and I have collated that also.

The complete copies which are known to us are all ultimately derived
from a single imperfect ancestor. All exhibit the same *lacunae*. The
text, as we have it, ends abruptly in the midst of Saul's last dying
speech: "Say to David: Thus saith Saul: Be not mindful of my hatred nor
of my unrighteousness." How much further the story went we shall discuss
later on. That it is imperfect is clear, and all our copies agree in the
imperfection. Two other obvious *lacunae* occur about two-thirds of the
way through the book, in the story of Abimelech. After the death of
Gideon (XXXVII. 1) we read that "he had a son by a concubine who slew
all his brethren,

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

desiring to be ruler over the people. Then came together all the trees
of the field to the fig-tree, and said: Come reign over us." Thus we
pass from the first entry of Abimelech to a point somewhere in the
Parable of Jotham. I think we must assume that at this place a leaf was
missing in the ancestor of all our copies. None of them make any attempt
to fill the gap. At the end of the story of Abimelech is another bad
place (XXXVIII. 1): "After these things Abimelech ruled over the people
for one year and six months, and died (under a certain tower) when a
woman let fall half a millstone upon him. (Then Jair judged Israel
twenty and two years.) He built a sanctuary to Baal," etc. The words in
parentheses represent the supplements of P. The text as read in A would
imply that Abimelech built a sanctuary to Baal; but it was in fact Jair
who did so. Here, then, is another gap, the extent of which is
uncertain. The immediate successor of Abimelech in the Bible is Tola.
Our historian may or may not have noticed him: he does, later on, omit
one of the minor judges, Ibzan. At most, another leaf is wanting at this
point: at least, a few lines have been lost by casual damage.

There are, further, indications that the imperfect archetype was an
uncial MS. with undivided words. In the early pages of the book much
space is occupied by lists of names, which, being invented by the
author, could not be corrected by recourse to the Bible. The many
disagreements as to the divisions of the names (*e.g.* Sifatecia Sifa.
Tecia, Lodo. Otim Lodoothim, filii aram filiarum, etc.) point to a stage
at which the scribe had no guidance in this matter. So do such variants
as memoraret artari for memorare tartari, in chaoma tonata for in
chaomate nata. Again, in XIX 15 certain unintelligible

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

words (istic mel apex magnus) are written in capitals in V, which I
interpret as an attempt on the part of the scribe to represent exactly
the *ductus litterarum* of an ancestor.

A minuscule stage is evidenced by frequent confusions (in proper names)
of *f* and *s*, of *c* and *z*, of *ch* and *di*, and an occasional *r*
for *n* or the converse. This last error, were it more frequent, might
point to an "insular" ancestor somewhere in the pedigree. There is an a
priori likelihood that a rare text current in the Rhenish district would
have attracted the notice of Irish monks and have been preserved by
them. A closer study of the variants may perhaps confirm this
notion. <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md)

External and internal evidence combined lead me to the conclusion that
our text was preserved in a single imperfect copy written in uncials,
and containing the *Antiquities*, the *Quaestiones in Genesim*, and *De
Essaeis*, which had survived at some centre of ancient culture in the
Rhenish district, most likely in or near Trèves.

(*f*) The authorities used in this book fall into three groups: (1)
Lorsch and Fulda, represented by the printed text, which I call A; (2)
The Trèves group P, Ph, T; (3) VRFJ. This is a rough division. Sichardus
gives us no means of distinguishing readings peculiar to either of his
MSS. and, as we have seen, is probably wrong in saying that they were
very closely allied. The Trèves MSS. are in more frequent agreement with
A than VR. V and R, if not parent and child (and probably they are not)
are at least uncle and nephew. Generally speaking I am of opinion that,
though manifestly wrong in a number of small points, A is preferable to
any one of the complete MSS. that I have seen.

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

It will be readily understood that, in an edition like this, a complete
exposition of the evidence for the text is impossible: but by way of
illustration we will take a short passage for which all our authorities
except J are available, and in which the grouping is (if imperfectly)
shown. The Song of David before Saul (LX. 2 *sqq.*) runs thus in
APPhTVRF. A is taken as the basis.

Tenebrae et silentium erant (erat RF) antequam fieret seculum, et
locutum est silentium et apparuerunt tenebrae.

Et factum est tunc (*om*. tunc RF) nomen tuum in compaginatione
extensionis quod appellatum (+ est VRFPhT) superius coelum, inferius
vocatum (invocatum. V) est terra.

Et praeceptum est superiori ut plueret secundum tempus eius (suum F) et
inferiori pracceptum est (praec. est inf. F: *om*. praec. est R) ut
crearet escam omnibus quae facta sunt (homini qui factus est VRF).

Et post haec facta est tribus spiritum uestrorum (nostrorum F).

Et nunc molesta, esse noli tanquam secunda creatura (factura VRF).

Si comminus memoraret artari in quo ambulas A.

Si comminus memorarer artare, etc. PPhT (artare rather obscure in T).

Si quominus memorare tartari (tractari R) in quo ambulabas VRF.

Aut non audire tibi sufficit quoniam per ea quae consonant in conspectu
tuo multis (in multis VRF) psallo?

Aut immemor es quoniam de resultatione in chaoma tonata (in chaomate
nata VRF) est uestra creatura?

Arguet autem tempora noua (te metra noua VRF) unde natus sum, de quo
nascitur (de qua nascetur VRF) post tempus de lateribus meis qui uos
donauit (domauit P, domabit PhTVRF).

VRF here show themselves the best in some important readings. The first
(*homini* for *omnibus*) is the least obvious: but it will be quickly
seen that the point of the invective is that evil spirits are a
secondary creation, and particularly that they are inferior to man. If
not actually created after man, at least they came into being after the
earth, which was to supply food to him. Moreover, a similar variant
occurs early in the book (III. 2), non diiudicabit spiritus meus in
omnibus (AVR: hominibus P) istis, The

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

\[paragraph continues\] LXX of Gen. 6<sup>3</sup>, ἐν τοῖσ ἀνθρώποισ
τούτοισ, shows that P is right.

But VR (F is rarely available) are not uniformly successful. They
sometimes shirk difficulties. In IX. 13 Moses "natus est in testamento
dei et in testamento carnis eius" (*i.e.* was born circumcised). Here VR
read "in testamentum carnis, which makes nonsense: and a few lines
later, where it is said of Pharaoh's daughter: "et dum uidisset in
Zaticon (sc. διαθήκην) hoc est in testamento carnis," the whole clause
is omitted by VIZ.

In III. 10, we have "et reddet infernus debitum suum, et perditio
restituet *paralecem suam*." This is the obviously right reading of AP:
VR read *partem suam*, and J betrays itself not only as a version from
Latin, but as dependent on a Latin MS. allied to VR, by saying "and
Abaddon shall return its portion."

When Pharaoh has determined to destroy the Hebrew children, the people
say (IX. 2): "ὠμοτοκείαν (ometocean cett.) passa sunt viscera mulierum
nostrarum." All the authorities, including F, keep the strange word, but
V writes "Ometocean id est passa sunt," showing that at some stage there
was an intention to insert a Latin equivalent. Still, the word has
survived.

The shirking of difficulties is not confined to VR. The priestly
vestments, *epomis* (XI. 15) and *cidaris* (XIII. 1), become *ebdomas*
and *cithara* in AP, but not in VR. In a list of the plagues of Egypt
(X. 1), one, *pammixia*, is omitted by AP and retained by VR. This word
*pammixia* (panimixia in the MSS.) deserves a passing note, for it does
not seem to have made its way into dictionaries or concordances. It is
intended to mean the plague of all manner of flies, for which the LXX
and Vulgate equivalent is κυνομυια, *coenomyia*. Jerome, writing on
this, says it ought to be κοινομυια, signifying a mixture of all manner
of flies, and adds that Aquila's word for it was παμμικτον. Older
editors read παμμυιαν for παμμικτον, but Field, or some one before him,
corrected it, and our text confirms the correction.

VR do not always go together: R, as being later, has corruptions of its
own. *Psalphinga*, a trumpet, is a favourite word with our author: R at
first writes this as *psalmigraphus*; later, when he has realised that
this is nonsense, he reproduces *psalphinga* as he should.

We have not yet cited examples in which the Trèves MSS. stand apart. I
will give two specimens, one of a few words, the other longer, in which
this is the case.

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

i\. XXII1. 4. Una petra erat unde effodi patrem uestrum. et genuit *uir
scopuli illius* duos uiros A. P has: incisco petre illius, which is
nearly right: VRF have "incisio petre illius," which is quite right.

ii\. In the *Lament of Jephthah's Daughter* (XL. 6 seq.) all our
authorities are available except F. J is very loose and paraphrastic,
and its evidence will be given after the rest.

The first clause has no important variants. After that, taking A as the
basis, we have--  
(*a*) Ego autem non sum saturata thalamo meo, nec repleta sum coronis
nuptiarum mearum.  
(*b*) Non enim uestita sum splendore sedens in genua mea.  
    Non enim uestita sum splendore sedens in uirginitate mea P.  
    Non enim uestita sum splendore sedens in ingenuitate mea PhT.  
    Non enim uestita sum splendore secundum ingenuam meam VR.  
(c) Non sum usa Mosi odoris mei.  
    "    "     preciosi odoramenti mei PPhT.  
    "    "     moysi odoris mei VR (*om*. usa R).  
(Sichardus conjectured Moscho for Mosi: Pitra prints non sunt thymia
odoris.)  
(*d*) Nec froniuit (fronduit V) anima mea oleo unctionis quod (quibus R)
praeparatum est mihi AVR.  
Nec froniuit animam meam oleum unctionis quod praeparatum est mihi
PPhT.  
(e) O mater, in uano (uanum V) peperisti unigenitam, tuam AVR.  
    O mater, in uano peperisti unigenitam tuam et genuisti eam super
terram PPhT (see below, (*g*)).  
(*f*) Quoniam, factus est infernus thalamus meus.  
(*g*) et genuam meam super terram A.  
    et genua mea super terram. VR (*om*. mea R).  
       P PhT have the equivalent above in (*e*).  
(*h*) et confectio omnis olei quod praeparasti mihi effundatur.  
    (*om*. et) confectio omnis olei quam preparauit mihi mater mea eff.

    et confectio omnis olei quam preparasti mihi effundetur VR.

    et albam (alba Ph) quam neuit tinea comedat PPhT.

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

    et albam quam neuit mater mea tinea comedet eam VR.  
(*k*) et corona quam intexuit nutrix mea in tempore marcescat.  
    et corona quam intexuit mea nutrix in tempore marcescat PPhT.  
    et flores corone quam intexuit nutrix mea in tempore marcescant
(marcescet R) VR.  
(*l*) et stratoria quae texuit in genuam meam de Hyacinthino. et purpura
uermis ca corrumpet.  
    et stratoria quae texuit mihi de iacincto et purpura uermis ea
corrumpat PPhT (corrumpet P).  
    et stratoria quae texuit ingenium meum de iacinctino et purpuram
meam uermes corrumpant V.  
    et stratoriam quae texuit ingenium meum de iacinctino et purpuram
meam uermis corrumpat R.  
(*m*) et referentes de me conuirgines meae in gemitu per dies plangant
me.  
    et referentes de me conuirgines meae cum gemitu per dies plangant me
PPhT.  
    et referentes me conuirgines meae in gemitum per dies plangant me
VR.

The passage reads thus in J, p. 178 (*a*): "I have not beheld my bridal
canopy, nor has the crown of my betrothal been completed. (*b*) I have
not been decked with the lovely ornaments of the bride who sits in her
virginity. (*c*) nor have I been perfumed with the myrrh and the sweet
smelling aloe.  
(*d*) I have not been anointed with the oil of anointment that was
prepared for me.  
(*e*) Alas, O my mother, it was in vain that thou didst give me birth.  
Behold thine only one (*f*) is destined for the bridal chamber of the
grave.  
(*g*) Thou hast wearied thyself for me to no purpose.  
(*h*) The oil with which I was anointed will be wasted.  
(*i)* And the white garments with which I was clothed the moths will
eat.  
(*k*) The garlands of my crown with which thou hast exalted me will
wither and dry up.  
(*l*) And my garments of fine needlework in blue and purple the worm
shall destroy.  
(*m*) And now my friends will lament all the days of my mourning."

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

It will be seen that J has some equivalent for every clause (though in
(*g*) he has wandered far from the text).

In (*b*) he read *sedens in uirginitate* or *ingenuitate* with the
Trèves MSS.: in (*k*) "garlands of my crown" seems nearer to *flores
corone* of VR. For the rest he is too paraphrastic to be followed
closely.

It is very odd that three times over in this short passage the words *in
genua mea*, *genuam meam*, *in genuam meam* should occur in one of the
groups, each time disturbing the sense, while another group somehow
avoids the difficulty. It looks suspicious for the group which does so.
But the evidence of the Trèves group is not to be lightly dismissed. It
would justify a theory that where the words first occur they are corrupt
for *ingenuitate*, that on the second occasion an obscurity of a few
letters genu . . . eam, present in the ancestor of the other MSS., was
not in that of the Trèves group: and that in the third case the words
are merely intrusive--perhaps wrongly inserted from a margin. Another
blurring of a few letters would account for the differences between
*moysi* and *preciosi*, and between *odoris* and *odoramenti*. But I do
not regard this as a really satisfactory explanation.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_4"></span>[12:1](bap04.htm#fr_4.md) The important sentences in
the original are : ut sensimus . . . exemplaria, quorum duo habuimus,
tam constanter <span id="page_13">p. 13</span> tamque ex composito
mendos suos tueri, consilium, quod mutandorum quorundam coeperamus,
plane abiecimus, imitati id quod utrumque exemplar haberet, quae tamen
ita erant inter se similia, ut nec ouum diceres ouo magis, ut dubium
mihi non esset, quin ex altero esset alterum descriptum, utcunque magno
loci intervallo dissita. Quippe attuleramus commodum illud Fuldense
uestrum, cum antea ex Laurissensi coenobio impetrassemus pervetustum
quidem illud, et quod nobis felicissimae editionis magnam spem fecerat:
sed progressos paululum non modo foede destituit, sed et fecit ut
praeproperae nos editionis plurimum. poeniteret . . . dedimus operam ut
ab exemplaribus quam minimum discederemus, ut sicubi fortasse extaret
aliud exemplar, id quod tum inaudieramus, eius collatione nostra . . .
absolverentur.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[15:1](bap04.htm#fr_5.md) P. Lehmann: *Johannes
Sichardus und die von ihm benutzten Bibliotheken und Handschriften*
(*Quellen und Untersuchungen zur Lateinische Philologie des
Mittelalters*, IV. 1. 19 12).

<span id="fn_6"></span>[16:1](bap04.htm#fr_6.md) Dr. Lehmann quotes a
number of instances in which Sichardus has deviated from the MS. in
spelling: he is also clear that conjecture was resorted to. This last
statement applies especially, I think, to the *Quaestiones*.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[16:2](bap04.htm#fr_7.md) The printed catalogue
gives the title of the *Antiquities* in 4569 and 18481 as *Historia ab
initio mundi usque ad Dauid regem*. In 18481 it is preceded by Jerome's
notice *of Philo*.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[21:1](bap04.htm#fr_8.md) In XVI. 7 *in syna* seems
to be a mistake for *in gyro*.
