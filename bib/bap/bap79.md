thee and to thy sons? <span id="fr_164"></span>[1](#fn_163) 2. *And Saul
said to him that bare his armour: Take thy sword and slay me before the
Philistines come and abuse me. And he that bare his armour would not lay
hands upon him*. 3. *And he himself bowed upon his sword*, and he could

a man running and called unto him and said: Take my sword and slay me.
*For my life is yet in me*. 4. And he came to slay him. And Saul said
unto him: Before thou kill me, tell me, who art thou? And he said unto
him: I am Edab, the son of Agag king of the Amalechites. And Saul said:
Behold, now the words of Samuel are come upon me even as he said: He
that shall be born of Agag shall be an offence unto thee. 5. But go thou
and say unto David: I have slain thine enemy. And thou shalt say unto
him: Thus saith Saul: Be not mindful of my hatred, neither of mine
unrighteousness. . . .
