### CHAPTER XLVIII.

XLVIII\.  <span id="fr_141"></span>[2](#fn_141.md) At that time also
Phinees laid himself down to die, and the Lord said unto him: Behold
thou hast overpassed the 120 years that were ordained unto all men. And
now arise and go hence and dwell in the mount Danaben and abide there
many years, and I will command mine

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

eagle and he shall feed thee there, and thou shalt

|              |
|--------------|
| 1 Kings 17:4 |

not comedown any more unto men until the time come and thou be proved in
the time. And then

|              |
|--------------|
| 1 Kings 17:1 |

shalt thou shut the heaven, and at thy word it shall be opened. And
after that thou shalt be lifted up into the place whither they that were
before thee were lifted up, and shalt be there until I remember the
world. And then will I bring you and ye shall taste what is death. 2.
And Phinees went up and did all that the Lord commanded him. Now in the
days when he appointed him to be priest, he anointed him in Silo.

3\. And at that time, when he went up, then it

|                 |
|-----------------|
| Jud. 20:6, etc. |

came to pass that the children of Israel when they kept the passover
commanded the children of Benjamin saying: Go up and take wives for
yourselves by force.. because we cannot give you our daughters, for we
sware in the time of our anger: and it cannot be that a tribe perish out
of Israel. And the children of Benjamin went up and seized for
themselves wives and built Gabaon for them selves and began to dwell
there.

4\. And whereas in the meanwhile the children

|            |
|------------|
| Jud. 21:25 |

of Israel were at rest, they had no prince in those days, and every man
did that which was right in his own eyes.

5\. These are the commandments and the judgments and the testimonies and
the manifestations that were in the days of the judges of Israel, before
a king reigned over them.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_141"></span>[210:2](bap62.htm#fr_141.md) XLVIII. Phinehas
identified with Elijah. See the passage quoted from Origen in the
Introd., [p. 11](bap03.htm#page_11.md). In *Pirke R. Eliezer* the belief is
stated twice: c. 29, when Elijah says: "I have been very zealous" (1
Kings 19:10), God says: Thou art always zealous. Thou wast zealous in
Shittim. . . . because it is said: Phinehas . . . turned my wrath away,
etc. Here also art thou zealous. c. 47. *R. Eliezer said*--<span
id="page_211">p. 211</span> He called the name of Phinehas by the name
of Elijah . . . He gave him the life of this world and the life of the
world to come. In the *Quaest. Hebr. in libros Regum* it is said of the
man of God who came to Eli (1 Sam. 2): *Hunc uirum Dei Iudaei Phinees
dicunt: quem et Eliam autumant*.

Ye shall taste what is death: gustabitis quod est mortis.
