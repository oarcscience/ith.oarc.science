### CHAPTER XIV.

XIV\. *At that time God said unto him: Begin to*

|          |

| Num. 1:2 |

*number my people from* 20 *years and upwards* unto 40 years, that I may
show your tribes all that I declared unto their fathers in a strange
land. For by the 50th part *of them* did I raise them up out of the land
of Egypt, but 40 and 9 parts of them died in the land of Egypt. 2. When
thou hast ordered them and numbered them (*or*, While ye abode there.
And when thou hast numbered them, etc.), write the tale of them, till I
fulfil all that I spake unto their fathers, and set them firmly in their
own land: for I will not diminish any word of those I have spoken unto
their fathers, even of those which I said to them: Your seed shall be as
the stars of heaven for multitude. By number shall they enter into the
land, and in a short time shall they become without number. 3. Then
Moses went down and numbered them, and the number of the people was
604,550. *But the*

| Num. 1:46 |

*tribe of Levi numbered he not among them, for so was it commanded him*;
only he numbered them that were upwards of 50 years, of whom the number
was 47,300. Also he numbered them that were below 20 years, and the
number of them was 850,850. And he looked over the tribe of Levi and the
whole number of them was CXX. CCXD. DCXX. CC. DCCC. <span

4\. And Moses declared the number of them to God; and God said to him:
These are the words which I spake to their fathers in the land of Egypt,
and appointed a number, even 210 years, unto all that saw my wonders.
Now the number of them all was 9000 times 10,000, 200 times 95,000 men,
besides women, and I put to death the whole multitude of them <span

because they believed me not, and the 50th part of them I was left and I
sanctified them unto me. Therefore do I command the generation of my
people to give me tithes of their fruits, to be before me for a memorial
of how great oppression I have removed from them. 5. And when Moses came
down and declared these things to the people, they mourned and lamented
and abode in the desert two years.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_71"></span>[117:1](bap30.htm#fr_71.md) XIV. 3. The number at
the end of this verse is hopelessly corrupt.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[118:1](bap30.htm#fr_72.md) *i.e.* 2,180,000.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[118:2](bap30.htm#fr_73.md) 4. The number 2,180,000
seems as if it ought to bear a relation to the 210 years spent in Egypt:
*qu*. 2,100,000?
