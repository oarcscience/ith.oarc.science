### CHAPTER II.

II\. But Cain dwelt in the earth trembling,

|               |
|---------------|
| Cf. Gen. 4:14 |

according as God appointed unto him after he slew Abel his brother; and
the name of his wife was Themech.

2\. *And Cain knew* Themech *his wife and she*

|           |
|-----------|
| Gen. 4:17 |

*conceived and bare Enoch*.

3. <span id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md) Now Cain was 15 years old when he
did these things; and from that time he began to build cities, until he
had founded seven cities. And these are

|           |
|-----------|
| Gen. 4:17 |

the names of the cities: The name of the first city according to the
name of his son Enoch. The name of the second city Mauli, and of the
third Leeth, and the name of the fourth Teze,

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

and the name of the fifth Iesca; the name of the sixth Celeth, and the
name of the seventh Iebbath.

4\. And Cain lived after he begat Enoch 715 years and begat 3 sons and 2
daughters. And these are the names of his sons: Olad, Lizaph, Fosal; and
of his daughters, Citha and Maac. And all the days of Cain were 730
years, and he died.

5. <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md) Then took Enoch a wife of the
daughters of Seth, which bare him Ciram and Cuuth and Madab. But Ciram
begat Matusael, and Matusael begat Lamech.

|           |
|-----------|
| Gen. 4:19 |

6\. *But Lamech took unto himself two wives: the name of the one was Ada
and the name of the other Sella. 7. And Ada bare him* Iobab: *he was the
father of all that dwell in tents and herd flocks*.

|           |
|-----------|
| Gen. 4:21 |

And again she bare him *Iobal, which was the first to teach all playing
of instruments* (*lit*. every psalm of organs). 8. <span
id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20.md) And at that time, when they that dwelt on
the earth had begun to do evil, every one with his neighbour's wife,
defiling them, God was angry. And he began to play upon the *lute*
(*kinnor*) *and the harp* and on every instrument of sweet psalmody
(*lit*. psaltery), and to corrupt the earth.

|           |
|-----------|
| Gen. 4:22 |

9\. *But Sella bare Tubal* and Misa and Theffa, and this is that Tubal
which showed unto men arts in lead and tin and iron and copper and
silver and gold: and then began the inhabiters of the earth to make
graven images and to worship them.

10. <span id="fr_21"></span>[3](#fn_21.md) *Now Lamech said unto his two
wives Ada* 

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

and Sella: Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, give heed to my precept:
for I have corrupted men for myself, and *have taken away* sucklings
from the breasts, that I might show my sons how to work evil, *and the
inhabiters of the earth*. And now *shall vengeance be taken seven times
of Cain, but of Lamech seventy times seven*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_18"></span>[77:1](bap18.htm#fr_18.md) II. 3. The names of
Cain's cities, except the first, do not occur elsewhere.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[78:1](bap18.htm#fr_19.md) 5. *Jerahmeel* says that
Enoch, son of Cain, took Niba, daughter of Shem, to wife. His source is
unknown to me.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[78:2](bap18.htm#fr_20.md) 8. See the Appendix on
Readings.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[78:3](bap18.htm#fr_21.md) 10. *Jubilees* does not
speak of this Lamech. The turn <span id="page_79">p. 79</span> here
given to his "song" suggests that his offence was against morality; this
view is found elsewhere.
