### CHAPTER XI.

|          |
|----------|
| Ex. 19:1 |

XI\. *And in the 3rd month of the journeying of the children of Israel
out of the land of Egypt, they came into the wilderness of Sinai*. And
God remembered his word and said: I will give light unto the world, and
lighten the habitable places, and make my covenant with the children of
men, and glorify my people above all nations, for unto them will I put
forth an eternal exaltation <span id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53.md) which
shall be unto them a light, but unto the ungodly a chastisement. 2. And
he said unto Moses: Behold, I will call thee to-morrow: be thou ready
and tell my people: "For three days let not a man come near his wife,"
and on the 3rd day I will speak unto thee and unto them, and after that
thou shalt come up unto me. And I will put my words in thy mouth and
thou shalt enlighten my people. For I have given into thy hands an
everlasting law whereby I will judge all the world. For this shall be
for a testimony. For if men say: "We have not known thee, <span
id="fr_54"></span>[2](#fn_54.md) and therefore we have not served

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

thee," therefore will I take vengeance upon them, because they have not
known my law.

3\. And Moses did as God commanded him, and

|           |
|-----------|
| Ex. 19:14 |

sanctified the people and said unto them: *Be ye ready on the 3rd day*,
for after 3 days will God make his covenant with you. And the people
were sanctified. 4. *And it came to pass on the 3rd day*

|           |
|-----------|
| Ex. 19:16 |

*that, lo, there were voices of thunderings (lit. them that sounded) and
brightness of lightnings and the voice of instruments sounding aloud.
And there was fear upon all the people that were in the camp. And Moses
put forth the people to meet God*. 5.  <span
id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55.md) And behold the mountains burned with fire
and the earth shook and the hills were removed and the mountains
overthrown: the depths boiled, and all the habitable places were shaken:
and the heavens were folded up and the clouds drew up water. And flames
of fire shone forth and thunderings and lightnings were multiplied and
winds and tempests made a roaring: the stars were gathered together and
the angels ran before, until God established the law of an everlasting
covenant with the children of Israel, and gave unto them an eternal
commandment which should not pass away.

6\. *And at that time the Lord spake unto his people*

|          |
|----------|
| Ex. 20:1 |

*all these words, saying: I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out
of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt not make
to thyself*

|          |
|----------|
| Ex. 20:4 |

*graven gods, neither* shalt thou make any abominable image of the sun
or the moon or any of the ornaments of the heaven, nor the *likeness of
all things that are upon the earth* nor of such as creep in the

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

waters or upon the earth. *I am the Lord thy God, a jealous God,
requiting the sins* of them that sleep upon the living children of the
ungodly, if they walk in the ways of their fathers; *unto the third and
fourth generation, doing* (or *shewing*) *mercy unto* 1000 *generations
to them that love me and keep my commandments*.

|          |
|----------|
| Ex. 20:7 |

7\. *Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain*, that my
ways be not made vain. *For God* abominateth *him that taketh his name
in vain*.

|          |
|----------|
| Ex. 20:8 |

8\.  <span id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56.md) *Keep the sabbath day to
sanctify it. Six days do thy work, but the seventh day is the sabbath of
the Lord. In it thou shall do no work, thou and all* thy

|            |
|------------|
| Ps. 107:32 |

labourers, saving that therein *ye praise the Lord in the congregation
of the elders and glorify* the Mighty One *in the seat of the aged. For
in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all that are in
them*, and all the world, the wilderness that is not inhabited, and all
things that do labour, <span id="fr_57"></span>[2](#fn_57.md) and all the
order of the heaven, *and God rested*

|          |
|----------|
| Gen. 2:3 |

*the seventh day. Therefore God sanctified the seventh day*, because he
rested therein.

|           |
|-----------|
| Ex. 20:12 |

9\. *Thou shalt love thy father and my mother* and fear them: and then
shall thy light rise, and I will command the heaven and it shall pay
thee the rain thereof, and the earth shall hasten her fruit and thy days
shall be many, and thou shalt dwell in thy land, and shalt not be
childless, for thy seed shall not fail, even that of them that dwell
therein.

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

10\. *Thou shalt not commit adultery*, for thine

|          |
|----------|
| Ex. 20:1 |

enemies did not commit adultery with thee, but thou camest out with a
high hand.

11\. *Thou shall not kill*: because thine enemies

|           |
|-----------|
| Ex. 20:13 |

got not the mastery over thee to slay thee, but thou beheldest their
death.

12\. *Thou shalt not bear false witness against*

|           |
|-----------|
| Ex. 20:16 |

*thy neighbour*, speaking falsely, lest thy watchmen <span
id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58.md) speak falsely against thee.

13\. *Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's house, nor*

|           |
|-----------|
| Ex. 20:17 |

*that which he hath*, lest others also covet thy land.

14\. And when the Lord ceased speaking, the

|           |
|-----------|
| Ex. 20:18 |

people feared with a great fear: and they saw the mountain burning with
torches of fire, and they said to Moses: *Speak thou unto us, and let
not God speak unto us, lest peradventure we die*. For, lo, to-day we
know that God speaketh with man face to face, and man shall live. And
now have we perceived of a truth how that the earth bare the voice of
God with trembling. And Moses said unto them: Fear not,
[for](errata.htm#0.md) this cause came this voice unto you, that ye should
not sin (or, for this cause, that he might prove. you, God came unto
you, that ye might receive the fear of him unto you, that ye sin not).
15. *And all the people*

|           |
|-----------|
| Ex. 20:21 |

*stood afar off, but Moses drew near unto the cloud*, knowing that God
was there. And then God spake unto him his justice and judgements, and
kept him by him 40 days and 40 nights. And there did he command him many
things, and showed him the tree of life,  <span
id="fr_59"></span>[2](#fn_59.md) whereof he cut and

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

took and put it into Mara, and the water of Mara was made sweet and
followed them in the desert 40 years, and went up into the hills with
them and came down into the plain. Also he commanded him concerning the
tabernacle and the ark of the Lord, and the sacrifice of burnt offerings
and of incense, and the ordinance of the table and of the candlestick
and concerning the laver and the base thereof, and the shoulder-piece
and the breastplate, and the very precious stones, that the children of
Israel should make them so: and he shewed him the likeness of them to
make them according to the pattern which he saw. And said unto him: Make
for me a sanctuary and the tabernacle of my glory shall be among you.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_53"></span>[106:1](bap27.htm#fr_53.md) XI. 1. *For upon them
will I put forth an eternal exaltation*: *in quem eliciam excelsa
sempiterna*, or *in whom I have ordained high things eternal*. *In quo
disposui excelsa sempiterna*. In either case the Law is meant.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[106:2](bap27.htm#fr_54.md) 2. *If men say*, "*we
have not known thee*," etc. Compare <span id="page_107">p. 107</span>
the injunction to the Apostles in a fragment of the *Preaching of
Peter*: "After twelve years go forth into the world, lest any say, 'we
did not hear.'"

<span id="fn_55"></span>[107:1](bap27.htm#fr_55.md) 5. Similar lists of the
wonders which accompanied the giving of the Law are in XV. 6, XXIII. 10,
XXXII. 7, 8.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[108:1](bap27.htm#fr_56.md) 8. The gloss on the 4th
Commandment, as Dr. Cohn says, shows that the writer has little interest
in the Temple services, and is appropriate to a time when those services
had ceased. It is rather the Synagogue and its ritual that occur to him
as the obvious form of worship. The words are adapted from Ps. cvii. 32.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[108:2](bap27.htm#fr_57.md) *all things that do
labour*: *quaecunque oberantur*.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[109:1](bap27.htm#fr_58.md) 12. thy watchmen:
custodes. I interpret this of angels.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[109:2](bap27.htm#fr_59.md) 15. The statement that
the tree of life sweetened the waters of Marah, and that these were the
waters that followed Israel, are both peculiar to this book. For Marah
the MSS. seen by me read *myrrha*, but the Fulda MS. has *myrra*; it is
Μεῤῥα in the LXX.
