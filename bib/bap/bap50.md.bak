### CHAPTER XXXIV.

XXXIV\. And at that time there came up a certain Aod <span
id="fr_127"></span>[1](#fn_127.md) of the priests of Madian, and he was a
wizard, and he spake unto Israel, saying: Wherefore give ye ear to your
law? Come and I

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

will shew you such a thing as your law is not. And the people said: What
canst thou shew us that our law hath not? And he said to the people:
Have ye ever seen the sun by night? And they said: Nay. And he said:
Whensoever ye will, I will shew it unto you, that ye may know that our
gods have power, and will not deceive them that serve them. And they
said: Shew us. 2. And he departed and wrought with his magic, commanding
the angels that were set over sorceries, because for a long time he did
sacrifice unto them. 3. &lt;&lt;*For this was formerly in the power of
the angels and was*&gt;&gt; performed by the angels before they were
judged, and they would have destroyed the unmeasurable world; and
because they transgressed, it came to pass that the angels had no longer
the power. <span id="fr_128"></span>[1](#fn_128.md) For when they were
judged, then the power was not committed unto the rest: and by these
*signs* (or *powers*) do they work who minister unto men in sorceries,
until the unmeasurable age shall come. 4. And at that time Aod by art
magic shewed unto the people the sun by night. And the people were
astonished and said: Behold, what great things can the gods of the
Madianites do, and we knew it not! 5. And God, willing to try Israel
whether they were yet in iniquity, suffered *the angels*, and their work
had good success, and the people of Israel were deceived and began to
serve the gods of the Madianites. And God said: I will deliver them into
the hands of the Madianites, inasmuch as by them are they

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

deceived. And he delivered them into their hands, and the Madianites
began to bring Israel into bondage.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_127"></span>[180:1](bap50.htm#fr_127.md) XXXIV. Aod reminds us
of the traditional Antichrist, one of whose great feats will be to make
the sun appear at night: *Ascension of Isaiah* (4:5): "and at his word
the sun will shine at night."

<span id="fn_128"></span>[181:1](bap50.htm#fr_128.md) 3. The sentences
about the angels who preside over sorceries are somewhat obscure. They
depend upon the story, told at such length in *Enoch*, of the fallen
angels who made known secret arts to mankind. The powers possessed by
these were not conferred upon those who replaced them.
