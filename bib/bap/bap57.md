### CHAPTER XLI.

|       |
|-------|
| 12:12 |

XLI\. And after him there arose a judge in Israel, Addo the son of Elech
of Praton, and he also judged the children of Israel eight years. In his
days the king of Moab sent messengers unto him saying: Behold now, thou
knowest that Israel hath taken my cities: now therefore restore them in
recompense. And Addo said: Are ye not yet instructed by that which hath
befallen the children of Ammon, unless peradventure the sins of Moab be
filled up? And Addo sent and took of the people 20,000 men and came
against Moab, and fought against them and slew of them 45,000 men. And
the remnant fled before him. And Addo returned in peace and offered
burnt offerings and sacrifices unto his Lord, and died, and was buried
in Ephrata his city.

made him judge over them, and he judged Israel twenty years. In those
days they fought against the Philistines and took of them twelve cities.
And Elon died and was buried in his city.

3\. But the children of Israel forgat the Lord their God and served the
gods of the dwellers in the land. Therefore were they delivered unto the
Philistines and served them forty years.
