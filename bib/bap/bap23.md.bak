### CHAPTER VII.

VII\. And it came to pass after these things, that the people of the
land turned not from their evil thoughts: and they came together again
unto their princes and said: The people shall not be overcome for ever:
and now let us come together and build us a city and a tower which shall
never be removed.

2\. And when they had begun to build, God saw the city and the tower
which the children of men

|           |
|-----------|
| Gen. 11:6 |

were building, *and he said: Behold, this is one people and their speech
is one*, and this which they have begun to build the earth will not
sustain, neither will the heaven suffer it, beholding it: and it shall
be, if they be not now hindered, that they shall dare all things that
they shall take in mind to do.

3\. *Therefore, lo, I will divide their speech*, and scatter them over
all countries, that they may not know every man his brother, neither
every man understand the speech of his neighbour. And I will deliver
them to the rocks, and they shall build themselves tabernacles of
stubble and straw, and shall dig themselves caves and shall live therein
like beasts of the field, and thus shall they continue before my face
for ever, that they may never devise such things. And I will esteem them
as a drop of water, and liken them unto spittle: <span
id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33.md) and unto some of them their end shall come
by water, and other of them shall be dried up with thirst. 4. And before
all of them will I choose my servant Abram, and I will bring him out
from their land, and lead him into the land which mine eye hath looked
upon from the beginning when all the dwellers upon earth sinned before
my face, and I brought *on them* the water of the flood: and *then* I
destroyed not *that land*, but preserved it. Therefore the fountains of
my wrath did not break forth therein, neither did the water of my
destruction come down upon it. For there will I make my servant Abram to
dwell, and I will make my covenant with him, and bless his seed, and
will be called his God for ever.

5\. Howbeit when the people that dwelt in the land had begun to build
the tower, God divided their speech, and changed their likeness. <span

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

they knew not every man his brother, neither did each understand the
speech of his neighbour. So it came to pass that when the builders
commanded their helpers to bring bricks they brought water, and if they
asked for water, the others brought them straw. And so their counsel was
broken and the), ceased building the city: and *God scattered them
thence over the face of all the earth. Therefore was the name of that
place called Confusion, because there God confounded their speech, and
scattered them thence over the face of all the earth*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_33"></span>[95:1](bap23.htm#fr_33.md) VII. 3. *I will liken
them unto spittle* (also XII. 4). The source is Isa. 40:15; but this
clause is not in our present Hebrew text. It occurs, however, in the
LXX; it is also in 4 *Esdras* 6:56, *Apoc. Bar*. 82:5, both of which
books are believed to have been written in Hebrew. We need not,
therefore, count its occurrence in *Philo* as implying dependence on the
LXX. Compare the combinations of phrases from Isaiah in XXVI. 13.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[95:2](bap23.htm#fr_34.md) 5. changed their
likeness. J adds "into that of <span id="page_96">p. 96</span> monkeys,"
probably from the Book of Jashar (see Migne, *Dict. des Apocryphes* II.
s. v. *Yaschar*). The Greek *Apocalypse of Baruch* describes the
builders of the Tower as changed into bestial forms. The story of the
workmen misunderstanding each other is in *Bereshith Rabbah*, *Jashar*,
etc.
