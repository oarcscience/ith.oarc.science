### CHAPTER XXI.

XXI\. And when Jesus was become old and

|         |
|---------|
| Jos. 23 |

well-stricken in years, God said to him: Behold, thou waxest old and
well-stricken in days, and the land is become very great, and there is
none to divide it (*or* take it by lot), and it shall be after thy
departure this people will mingle with the inhabitants of the land and
go astray after other gods, and I shall forsake them as I testified in
my word unto Moses; but do thou testify unto them before thou diest. 2.
And Jesus said: Thou knowest more than all, O Lord, what moveth the
heart of the sea before it rageth, and thou hast tracked out the
constellations and numbered the

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

stars, and ordered the rain. Thou knowest the mind of all generations
before they be born. And now, Lord, give unto thy people an heart of
wisdom and a mind of prudence, and it shall be when thou givest these
ordinances unto thine heritage, they shall not sin before thee and thou
shall not be wroth with them. 3. Are not these the words which I spake
before thee, Lord, when Achar stole of the curse, and the people were
delivered up before thee, and I prayed in thy sight and said: Were it
not better for us, O Lord, if we had died in the Red Sea, wherein thou
drownedst our enemies? or if we had died in the wilderness, like our
fathers, than to be delivered into the hand of the Amorites that we
should be blotted out for ever? 4. Yet if thy word be about us, no evil
shall befall us: for even though our end be removed unto death, thou
livest which art before the world and after the world; and whereas a man
cannot devise <span id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_95.md) how to put one
generation before another, he saith "God hath destroyed his people whom
he chose": and behold, we shall be in Hell: yet thou wilt make thy word
alive. And now let the fulness of thy mercies have patience with thy
people, and choose for thine heritage a man which shall rule over thy
people, he and his generation. 5. Was it not for this that our father
Jacob spake, saying: *A prince shall not*

|            |
|------------|
| Gen. 49:10 |

*depart from Juda, nor a leader from his loins*. And now confirm the
words spoken aforetime, that the nations of the earth and tribes of the
world may learn that thou art everlasting. 6. And he said furthermore: O
Lord, behold the days shall come

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

and the house of Israel shall be like unto a brooding dove which setteth
her young *in the nest* and will not forsake them nor forget her place.
So, also, these shall turn from their deeds and fight against the
salvation that shall be born unto them.

7\. And Jesus went down from Galgala and

|           |
|-----------|
| Jos. 8:30 |

built an altar of very great stones, and brought no iron upon them, as
Moses had commanded, and set up great stones on mount Gebal, and
whitened them and wrote on them the words of the law very plainly: and
gathered all the people together and read in their ears all the words of
the law. 8. And he came down with them and offered upon the altar
peace-offerings, and they sang many praises, and lifted up the ark of
the covenant of the Lord out of the tabernacle with timbrels and dances
and lutes and harps and psalteries and all instruments of sweet sound.
9. And the priests and Levites were going up before the ark and
rejoicing with psalms, and they set the ark before the altar, and lifted
up on it yet again peace-offerings very many, and the whole house of
Israel sang together with a loud voice saying: Behold, our Lord hath
fulfilled that which he spake with our fathers saying: To your, seed
will I give a land wherein to dwell, a land flowing with milk and honey.
And lo, he hath brought us. into the land of our enemies and hath
delivered them broken in heart before us, and he is the God which sent
to our fathers in the secret places of souls, saying: Behold, the Lord
hath done all that he spake unto us. And now know we of a truth that God
hath confirmed all the words of the law which he spake to us in Oreb;
and if our heart keep his ways it will be well with us, and with our
sons after us. 10. And Jesus blessed them and said: The Lord grant

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

your heart to continue therein (*or* in him) all the days, and if ye
depart not from his name, the covenant of the Lord shall endure with
you. And *he grant* that it be not corrupted, but that the
dwelling-place of God be builded among you, as he spake when he sent you
into his inheritance with mirth and gladness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_95"></span>[136:1](bap37.htm#fr_95.md) XXI. 4. *And whereas a
man cannot devise*, etc. There is an antithesis between the short sight
of man and the eternal knowledge of God: but either the text is unsound
or I fail to understand it, for it seems to me inconsequent as it
stands.
