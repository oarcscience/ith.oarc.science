### CHAPTER LV.

LV\. But Samuel knew nothing of all these things, because three days
before the battle God sent him *away*, saying unto him: Go and look upon
the place of Arimatha, there shall be thy dwelling. And when Samuel
heard what had

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

befallen Israel, he came and prayed unto the Lord) saying: Behold, now,
in vain is understanding denied unto me that I might see the destruction
of my people. And now I fear lest my days grow old in evil and my years
be ended in sorrow, for whereas the ark of the Lord is not with me, why
should I yet live? 2. And the Lord said unto him: Be not grieved,
Samuel, that the ark is taken away. I will bring it again, and them that
have taken it will I overthrow, and will avenge my people of their
enemies. And Samuel said: Lo, even if thou avenge them in time,
according to thy longsuffering, yet what shall we do which die now? And
God said to him: Before thou diest thou shalt see the end which I will
bring upon mine enemies, whereby the Philistines shall perish *and shall
be slain* by scorpions and by all manner of noisome creeping
things. <span id="fr_150"></span>[1](#fn_149.md)

3\. And when the Philistines had set the ark of

|              |
|--------------|
| 1 Sam. 5:2-4 |

the Lord that was taken in the temple of Dagon their god, and were come
to enquire of Dagon concerning their going forth, they found him fallen
on his face and his hands and feet laid before the ark. And they went
forth on the first morning, having crucified his priests. And on the
second day they came and found as on the day before, and the destruction
was greatly multiplied among them. 4. Therefore the Philistines gathered
together

|            |
|------------|
| 1 Sam. 5:6 |

in Accaron, and said every man to his neighbour: Behold now, we see that
the destruction

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

is enlarged among us,

|             |
|-------------|
| 1 Sam. 5:11 |

and the fruit of our body perisheth, for the creeping things that are
sent upon us destroy them that are with child and the sucklings and them
also that give suck. And they said: Let us see wherefore the hand of the
Lord is strong against us. Is it for the ark's sake? for every day is
our god found fallen upon his face before the ark, and we have slain our
priests to no purpose once and again. 5. And the wise men of the
Philistines said: Lo, now by this may we know if the Lord have sent
destruction upon us for his ark's sake or if a chance affliction <span
id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_150.md) is come upon us for a season? 6. And
now, whereas all that are with child and give suck die, and they that
give suck are made childless, and they, that

|               |
|---------------|
| 1 Sam. 6:7-12 |

are suckled perish, we also will take kine that give suck and yoke them
to a new cart, and set the ark upon it, and shut up the young of the
kine. And it shall be, if the kine indeed go forth, and turn not back to
their young, we shall know that we have suffered these things for the
ark's sake; but if they refuse to go, yearning after their young, we
shall know that the time of our fall is come upon us. 7. And certain of
the wise men and diviners answered: Assay ye not only this, but let us
set the kine at the head of the three ways that are about Accaron. <span
id="fr_152"></span>[2](#fn_151.md) For the middle way leadeth to Accaron,
and the way on the right hand to

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

Judæa, and the way on the left hand to Samaria. And direct ye the kine
that bear the ark in the middle way. And if they set forth by the
right-hand way straight unto Judæa, we shall know that of a truth the
God of the Jews hath laid us waste; but if they go by those other ways,
we shall know that an evil (*lit*. mighty) time <span
id="fr_153"></span>[1](#fn_152.md) hath befallen us, for now have we denied
our gods. 8. And the Philistines took milch kine and yoked them to a new
cart and set the ark thereon, and set them at the head of the three
ways, and their young they shut up at home. And the kine, albeit they
lowed and yearned for their young, went forward nevertheless by the
right-hand way that leadeth to Judæa. And then they knew that for the
ark's sake they were laid waste. 9. And all the Philistines assembled
and brought the ark again unto Silo with timbrels and pipes and dances.
And because of the noisome creeping things that laid them waste, they
made seats of gold and sanctified the ark. 10. And in that plaguing of
the Philistines, the number was of them that died being with child
75,000, and of the sucking children 65,000, and of them that gave suck
55,000, and of men 25,000. And the land had rest seven years.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_149"></span>[225:1](bap69.htm#fr_150.md) LV. The plagues that
afflicted the Philistines are only obscurely indicated. They appear to
have consisted of noxious reptiles which particularly attacked the
children and the mothers. In 9 it is said that *sedilia aurea* (ἕδρασ
LXX) were offered *pro reptilibus pessimis quae exterminauerunt eos*,
whereas in the Bible these objects represented the *bubones*
characteristic of the plague--the "emerods" of A. V.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[226:1](bap69.htm#fr_151.md) 5. The phrase *et*
(*aut* R) *conueniens* (+ *temporarie* R) *dominatio* is unusual.
*temporarie*, which seems likely to be genuine, would represent
πρόσκαιροσ. I adopt the *aut* of R, and take *conueniens* to be a
mistranslation of some word meaning fortuitous (from συμβαίνω or
συντυγχάνω or the like): in 1 Sam. 6:7 LXX the word used is σύμπτωμα
("it was a chance that happened to us").

<span id="fn_151"></span>[226:2](bap69.htm#fr_152.md) 7. The passage about
the three roads in 7 is confused in the MSS. I have made a smooth
conflate text which probably conveys the original writer's meaning.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[227:1](bap69.htm#fr_153.md) 7. *an evil* (*lit*.
*mighty*) *time*: *ualidum tempus*.
