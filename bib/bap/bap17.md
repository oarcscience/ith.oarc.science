### Footnotes

<span id="fn_17"></span>[75:1](bap17.htm#fr_17) I. 1. Initium mundi
appears to be the best reading. It is perhaps in the nature of a title:
the proper LXX name for Genesis is γένεσισ κόσμου.

1., etc. It will be observed that almost all the names of sons and all
those of daughters are imaginary. They do not agree with other legendary
names, *e.g.* those of *Jubilees*. For the rest, the first three
chapters are to a very large extent simply copied from Genesis iv-xi.

The spelling of the names is very uncertain in many cases. Where "ph"
occurs, it is very often substituted by Sichardus for "f" in the MSS.;
but of course the "f" must represent a φ, seeing that the text has come
to us through Greek. I have therefore allowed "ph" to stand.

The chronology, according to Dr. Colin, was originally that of the
Hebrew text, but has been to some extent modified by reference to the
LXX. The Hebrew numbers (from Adam to the Flood) add up to 1656, those
of the LXX to 2262, those of *Philo* to 2256; but *Philo* says (III. 6)
that the Flood was in the 1652nd year of the world, which only requires
the change of *secundus* to *sextus* to make it agree exactly with the
Hebrew.
