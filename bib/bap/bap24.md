Ana I will give thee of her an eternal seed and make my covenant with

|                 |

years.

|         |
|---------|

10\. And it came to pass after that the king of Egypt had seen a dream,
that they told him of Joseph, and he declared him the dreams. And it was
so after he declared his dreams, that Pharao made him prince over all
the land of Egypt. At that time there was a famine in all the land, as

|                  |
|------------------|
| Gen. 41,42, etc. |

Joseph had foreseen. And his brethren came down into Egypt to buy food,
because in Egypt only was there food. And Joseph knew his brethren, and
was made known to them, and dealt not evilly with them. And he sent and
called his father out of the land of Chanaan, and he came down unto him.
