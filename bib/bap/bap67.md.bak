### CHAPTER LIII.

|                 |
|-----------------|
| I Sam. 3:1, 3:7 |

LIII\. But Samuel was ministering before the Lord and knew not as yet
what were the oracles of the Lord: for he had not yet heard the oracles
of the Lord, for he was 8 years old. 2. But when God remembered Israel,
he would reveal his words unto Samuel, and Samuel did sleep in the
temple of the Lord. And it came to pass when God called unto him, that
he considered first, and said: Be hold now, Samuel is young that he
should be (or though he be) beloved in my sight; nevertheless because he
hath not yet heard the voice of the Lord, neither is he confirmed unto
the voice of the Most Highest, yet is he like unto Moses my servant: but
unto Moses I spake when he was 80 years old, but Samuel is 8 years old.
And Moses saw the fire first and his heart was afraid. And if Samuel
shall see the fire now, how shall he abide it? There fore now shall
there come unto him a voice as of a man, and not as of God. And when he
under standeth, then I will speak unto him as God. 3.

| 1 Sam. 3:4, 3:5 |

And at midnight a voice out of heaven called him: and Samuel awoke and
perceived as it were the voice of Heli, and ran unto him and spake
saying: Wherefore hast thou awaked me, father? For I was afraid, because
thou didst never call me in the night. And Heli said: Woe is me, can it
be that an unclean spirit hath deceived my son Samuel? And he said to
him: Go and sleep, for I called thee not. Nevertheless, tell me if thou
remember, how often he that called thee cried. And he said: Twice. And
Heli said unto him: Say now, of whose voice wast thou aware, my son? And
he

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

said: Of thine, therefore ran I unto thee. 4. And Heli said: In thee do
I behold the sign that men shall have from this day forward for ever,
.that if one call unto another twice in the night or at noonday, they
shall know that it is an evil spirit. But if he call a third time, they
shall know that it is an angel. And Samuel went away and slept.

5\. And he heard the second time a voice from

|            |
|------------|
| 1 Sam. 3:8 |

heaven, and he arose and ran unto Heli and said unto him: Wherefore
called he me, for I heard the voice of Elchana my father? Then did Heli
under stand that God did begin to call him. And Heli said: In those two
voices wherewith God hath called unto thee, he likened himself to thy
father and to thy master, but now the third time *he will speak as* God.

6\. And he said unto him: With thy right ear attend and with thy left
refrain. For Phinees the priest commanded us, saying: The right ear
heareth the Lord by night, and the left ear an angel. Therefore, if thou
hear with thy right ear, say thus: Speak what thou wilt, for I hear
thee,

|            |
|------------|
| 1 Sam. 3:9 |

for thou hast formed me; but if thou hear with the left ear, come and
tell me. And Samuel went away and slept as Heli had commanded him.

7\. And the Lord added and spake yet a third

|             |
|-------------|
| 1 Sam. 3:10 |

time, and the right ear of Samuel was filled *with the voice*. And when
he perceived that the speech of his father had come down unto him,
Samuel turned upon his other side, and said: If I be able, speak, for
thou hast formed me (*or* knowest well concerning me).

8\. And God said unto him: Verily I enlightened the house of Israel in
Egypt and chose unto me at that time Moses my servant for a prophet, and
by him I wrought wonders for my people, and

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

avenged them of mine enemies as I would, and I took my people into the
wilderness, and enlightened them as they beheld. 9. And when one tribe
rose up against another tribe, saying: Wherefore are the priests alone
holy? I would not destroy them, but I said unto them: Give ye every one
his rod, and it shall be that he whose rod flourisheth I have chosen him
for the priesthood. And when they had all given their rods as I
commanded, then did I command the earth of the tabernacle that the rod
of Aaron should flourish, that his line might be manifested for many
days. And now they which did flourish have abhorred my holy things. 10.
Therefore, lo, the days shall come that I will cut off (*lit*. stop) the
flower that came forth at that time, and I will go forth against them
because they do transgress the word which I spake unto my

|             |
|-------------|
| Deut. 22:26 |

servant Moses, saying: *If thou meet with a nest, thou shalt not take
the mother with the young*, therefore it shall befall them that the
mothers shall die with the children, and the fathers perish with the
sons.

|             |
|-------------|
| 1 Sam. 3:15 |

11\. And when Samuel heard these words his heart was melted, and he
said: Hath it thus come against me in my youth that I should prophesy
unto the destruction of him that fostered me? and how then was I granted
at the request of my mother? and who is he that brought me up? how hath
he charged me to bear evil tidings? 12. And Samuel arose in the morning
and would not tell

|             |
|-------------|
| 1 Sam. 3:17 |

it unto Heli. And Heli said unto him: Hear now, my son. Behold, before
thou wast born God promised Israel that he would send thee unto them to
prophesy. And now, when thy mother came hither and prayed, for she knew
not that which had been done, I said unto her: Go forth, for that which
shall be born of thee shall be a son unto

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

me. Thus spake I unto thy mother, and thus hath the Lord directed thy
way. And even if thou chasten thy nursing-father, as the Lord liveth,
hide thou not from me the things that thou hast heard. 13. Then Samuel
was, afraid, and

|             |
|-------------|
| 1 Sam. 3:18 |

told him all the words that he had heard. And he said: *Can the thing
formed answer him tha*t

|                  |
|------------------|
| Isa. 29:16, etc. |

*formed it*? So also can I not answer when he will take away that which
he hath given, even the faithful giver, the holy one which hath
prophesied, for I am subject unto his power.
