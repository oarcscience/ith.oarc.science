### CHAPTER XXIII.

XXIII\. And Jesus the son of Naue ordered

|         |

| Jos. 24 |

the people and divided unto them the land, being a mighty man of valour.
And while yet the adversaries of Israel were in the land, the days of
Jesus drew near that he should die, and he sent and called all Israel
throughout all their land with their wives and their children, and said
unto them: Gather yourselves together before the ark of the covenant of
the Lord in Silo and I will make a covenant with you before I die. 2.
And when all the people were gathered together on the 16th day of the
3rd month before the face of the Lord in Silo with their wives and their
children, Jesus said unto them: Hear, O Israel, behold I make with you
the covenant of this law which the Lord ordained with our fathers in
Oreb, and therefore tarry ye here this night and see

|            |
|------------|
| Num. 22:19 |

what God will say unto me concerning You. 3. And as the people waited
there that night, the Lord appeared unto Jesus in a vision and spake
saying: According to all these words will I speak unto this people. 4.
And Jesus came in the morning and assembled all the people and said unto
them: Thus saith the Lord: One rock was there

|                 |
|-----------------|
| Isa. 51:1, 51:2 |

from whence I digged out your father, and the cutting of that rock
brought forth two men, whose names were Abraham and Nachor, and out of
the chiselling of that place were born two women whose names were Sara
and Melcha. And they dwelled together beyond the river. And Abraham took
Sara *to wife* and Nachor took Melcha. 5. And when the people of the
land were led astray, every man after his own devices, Abraham believed
in me and was not led aside after them. And I saved him out of the fire
and took him and brought him over into all the land of Chanaan. And I
spake unto him in a vision saying: Unto

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

thy seed

|         |
|---------|
| Gen. 15 |

will I give this land. And he said unto me: Behold now thou hast given
me a wife and she is barren. And how shall I have *seed* of that womb
that is shut up? 6. And I said unto him:

|           |
|-----------|
| Gen. 15:9 |

*Take for me a calf of three years old and a she-goat of three years and
a ram of three years, a turtledove and a pigeon*. And he took them as I
commanded

|            |
|------------|
| Gen. 15:12 |

him. And *I sent a sleep upon him* and compassed him about with fear,
and *I set* before

|       |
|-------|
| 15:17 |

him the place of fire wherein the works of them that commit iniquity
against me shall be avenged, and I showed him the torches of fire
whereby the righteous which have believed in me shall be
enlightened. <span id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_96.md) 7. And I said unto him:
These shall be for a witness between me and thee that I will give thee
seed of the womb that is shut up. And I will liken thee unto the dove,
because thou hast received for me the city which thy sons shall (begin
to) build in my sight. But the turtle-dove I will liken unto the
prophets which shall be born of thee. And the ram will I liken unto the
wise men which shall be born of thee and enlighten thy sons. But the
calf I will liken unto the multitude of the peoples which shall be
multiplied through thee. And the she-goat I will liken unto the women
whose wombs I will open and they shall bring forth. These things shall
be for a witness betwixt us that I will not transgress my words.

8\. And I gave him Isaac and formed him in the womb of her that bare
him, and commanded it that it should restore him quickly and render him
unto me in the 7th month. And for this

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

cause every woman that bringeth forth in the 7th month, her child shall
live: because upon him did I call my glory, and showed forth the new
age. 9. And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau, and unto Esau I gave the
land of Seir for an heritage. And Jacob and his sons went down into
Egypt. And the Egyptians brought your fathers low, as ye know, and I
remembered your fathers, and sent Moses my friend and delivered them
from thence and smote their enemies.

10\. And I brought them out with a high hand and led them through the
Red Sea, and laid the cloud under their feet, and brought them out
through the depth, and brought them beneath the mount Sina, and I *bowed
the heavens and came*

|          |
|----------|
| Ps. 18:9 |

*down*, and I congealed the flame of the fire, and stopped up the
springs of the deep, and impeded the course of the stars, and tamed the
sound of the thunder, and quenched the fulness; of the wind, and rebuked
the multitude of the clouds, and stayed their motions, and interrupted
the storm of the hosts, that I should not break my covenant, for all
things were moved at my coming down, and all things were quickened at my
advent, and I suffered not my people to be scattered, but gave unto them
my law, and enlightened them, that if they did these things they may
live and have length of days and not die. 11. And I have brought you
into this land and given you vineyards. Ye dwell in cities which ye
built not. And I have fulfilled the covenant which I spake unto your
fathers.

12\. And now if ye obey your fathers, I will set my heart upon you for
ever, and will overshadow you, and your enemies shall no more fight
against you, and your land shall be renowned throughout all the world
and your seed be elect in the midst

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

of the peoples, which shall say: Behold the faithful people; because
they believed the Lord, therefore hath the Lord delivered them and
planted them. And therefore will I plant you as a desirable vineyard and
will rule you as a beloved flock, and I will charge the rain and the
dew, and they shall satisfy you all the days of your life. 13. And it
shall be at the end that the lot of every one of you shall be in eternal
life, both for you and your seed, and I will receive your souls and lay
them up in peace, until the time of the age is fulfilled, and I restore
you unto your fathers and your fathers unto you, and they shall know at
your hand that it is not in vain that I have chosen you. These are the
words that the Lord hath spoken unto me this night. 14. And all the
people answered and said: The Lord is our God, and him only will we
serve. And all the people made a great feast that day and a
renewal <span id="fr_97"></span>[1](#fn_97.md) thereof for 28 days.
