### CHAPTER XVIII.

XVIII\. At that time Moses slew Seon and

|         |
|---------|
| Num. 21 |

Og, the kings of the Amorites, and divided all their land unto his
people, and they dwelt therein. 2. But Balac was the king of Moab, that
lived

|         |
|---------|
| Num. 22 |

over against them, and he was greatly afraid, and sent to Balaam the son
of Beor the interpreter of dreams, which dwelt in Mesopotamia, and
charged him saying: Behold I know how that in the reign of my father
Sefor, when the Amorites fought against him, thou didst curse them and
they were delivered up before him. And *now come and curse*

|      |
|------|
| 22:6 |

*this people, for they are many, more than we, and will do thee great
honour*. 3. And Balaam said:

|       |
|-------|
| 22:17 |

Lo, this is good in the sight of Balac, but he knoweth not that the
counsel of God is not as man's counsel. And he knoweth not that the
spirit which is given unto us is given for a time, and our ways are not
guided except God will. *Now therefore abide ye*

|            |
|------------|
| 22:8, 22:9 |

*here, and I will see what the Lord will say to me this night*. 4. And
in the night *God said unto him: Who are the men that are come unto
thee*? And Balaam said: Wherefore, Lord, dost thou tempt the race of
man? They therefore cannot sustain it, for thou knewest more than they,
all that was in the world, before thou foundedst it. And now enlighten
thy servant if it be right that I go with them. 5. And God said to him:
Was it not concerning this people that I spake unto Abraham in a vision
saying: *Thy seed shall be as the stars of*

|            |
|------------|
| Gen. 22:17 |

*heaven*, when I raised him up above the firmament and showed him all
the orderings of the stars, and required of him his son for a burnt
offering? and

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

he brought him to be laid upon the altar, but I restored him to his
father. And because he resisted not, his offering was acceptable in my
sight, and for the blood of him did I choose this people. And then I
said unto the angels that work subtilly: <span
id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_79.md)

|            |
|------------|
| Gen. 18:15 |

Said I not of him: *To Abraham will I reveal all that I do*?

6\. Jacob also, when he wrestled in the dust with the angel that was
over the praises, did not let him go until he blessed him. And now,
behold, thou thinkest to go with these, and curse them whom I have
chosen. But if thou curse them, who is he

|                   |
|-------------------|
| Num. 22:13 *sqq*. |

that shall bless thee? 7. *And Balaam arose in the morning and said: Go
your way, for God will not have me to come with you. And they went and
told Balac* all that was said of Balaam. And *Balac sent yet again other
men to Balaam* saying: Behold, I know that when thou offerest burnt
offerings to God, God will be reconciled with man, and now ask yet again
of thy Lord, and entreat by burnt offerings, as many as he will. For if
peradventure he will be propitiated in my necessity, thou shalt have thy
reward, if so be God accept thy offerings. 8. And Balaam said to them:
Lo, the son of Sephor is foolish, and knoweth not that he

|            |
|------------|
| Num. 22:19 |

dwelleth hard by (*lit*. round about) the dead: <span
id="fr_80"></span>[2](#fn_80.md) *And* 

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

now tarry here this night and I will see what God will say unto me. And
God said to him: Go with them, and thy journey shall be an offence, and
Balac himself shall go unto destruction. And he arose and went with
them. 9. And his she-ass came by the way of the desert and saw the
angel, and he opened the eyes of Balaam and he saw the angel and
worshipped him on the earth. And the angel said to him: Haste and go on,
for what thou sayest shall come to pass with him.

10\. And he came unto the land of Moab and

|             |
|-------------|
| Num. 23, 24 |

built an altar and offered sacrifices: and when he had seen a part of
the people, the spirit of God abode not in him, and he took up his
parable and said: Lo, Balac hath brought me hither unto the mount,
saying: Come, run into the fire of these men. &lt;&lt;Lo&gt;&gt; I
cannot abide that &lt;&lt;fire&gt;&gt; which waters quench, but that
fire which consumeth water who shall endure? And he said to him: It is
easier to take away the foundations and all the topmost part of them,
and to quench the light of the sun and darken the shining of the moon,
than for him who will to root up the planting of the Most Mighty or
spoil his vineyard. And *Balac* himself hath not known it, because his
mind is puffed up, to the intent his destruction may come swiftly. 11.
For behold, I see the heritage which the Most Mighty showed me in the
night, and lo the days come when Moab shall be amazed at that which
befalleth her, for Balac desired to persuade the Most Mighty with gifts
and to purchase decision <span id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_81.md) with money.
Oughtest thou not to have asked what he sent upon Pharao and upon his
land because he would bring them into bondage? Behold an overshadowing
vine, desirable exceedingly, and who shall be

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

jealous against it, for it withereth not? But if any say in his counsel
that the Most Mighty hath laboured in vain or chosen them to no purpose,
lo now I see the salvation of deliverance which is to come unto them. I
am restrained in the speech of my voice and I cannot express that which
I see with mine eyes, for but a little is left to me of the holy spirit
which abideth in me, since I know that in that I was persuaded of Balac
I have lost the days of my life: 12. Lo, again I see the heritage of the
abode of this people, <span id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_82.md) and the light
of it shineth above the brightness of lightning, and the running of it
is swifter than arrows. And the time shall come when Moab shall groan,
and they that serve Cham (Chemosh?) shall be weak, even such as took
this counsel against them. But I shall gnash my teeth because I was
deceived and did transgress that which was said to me in the night. Yet
my prophecy shall remain manifest, and my words shall live, and the wise
and prudent shall remember my words, for when I cursed I perished, and
though I blessed I was not blessed. And when he had so said he held his
peace. And

|            |
|------------|
| Num. 24:11 |

Balac said: Thy God hath defrauded thee of many gifts from me.

13\. Then Balaam said unto him: <span id="fr_83"></span>[2](#fn_83.md) Come
and let

|            |
|------------|
| Num. 31:16 |

us advise what thou shalt do to them. Choose out the most comely women
that are among you and that are in Midian and set them before them
naked, and adorned with gold and jewels, and it shall be when they shall
see them and lie with them, they will sin against their Lord and fall
into your hands,

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

for otherwise thou canst not subdue them. 14. And so saying Balaam
turned away and returned to his place. And thereafter the people were
led astray after the daughters of Moab, for Balac did all that Balaam
had showed him.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_79"></span>[124:1](bap34.htm#fr_79.md) XVIII. 5. *And then I
said unto the angels that work subtilly*. The clause has dropped out of
AP, but must be genuine. *Angelis minute operantibus* is a curious
expression. Minute should be λεπτῶσ. Is the reference to evil angels (as
in XXXIV.), or to angels set over small things, or to the angels who
envied Abraham, as in XXXII. 1, 2?

Probably we ought to follow R in the next words also, and read: "Unto
Abraham will I reveal all that I do, and unto Jacob his son's son whom
he (1) called (my) first born. Who when he wrestled," etc.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[124:2](bap34.htm#fr_80.md) 8. *nescit quoniam
inhabitat in gyro mortuorum*. Are the "mortui" anything more than
Balak's idols?

<span id="fn_81"></span>[125:1](bap34.htm#fr_81.md) 11. *decision*:
*dogma*.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[126:1](bap34.htm#fr_82.md) 12. *the heritage of
the abode of this people: haereditatem dissolutionis*. I take
*dissolutionis* to be a wrong rendering of κατάλυσισ, which means
"abode" in Jer. 49:19 (LXX).

<span id="fn_83"></span>[126:2](bap34.htm#fr_83.md) 13. *Pirke R. Eliezer*
47: Balaam said: "You will not be able to prevail against this people,
unless they have <span id="page_127">p. 127</span> sinned before their
Creator." *peccabunt domino suo . . . aliter expugnare eos non poteris*.
