### CHAPTER XXXVII.

XXXVII\. And he had a son by a concubine whose name was Abimelech; the
same slew all his brethren, desiring to be ruler over the people.

| Jud. 9:5 |

\[*A leaf gone*.\]

2\.  <span id="fr_130"></span>[2](#fn_130.md) Then all the trees of the
field came together

unto the fig-tree and said: Come, reign over us. And the fig-tree said:
Was I indeed born in the kingdom or in the rulership over the trees? or
was I planted to that and that I should reign over you? And therefore
even as I cannot reign over you, neither shall Abimelech obtain
continuance in his rulership. After that the trees came together unto
the vine and said: Come, reign over us. And the

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

vine said: I was planted to give unto men the sweetness of wine, and I
am preserved by rendering unto them my fruit. But like as I cannot reign
over you, so shall the blood of Abimelech be required at your hand. And
after that the trees came unto the apple and said: Come, reign over us.
And he said: It was commanded me to yield unto men a fruit of sweet
savour. Therefore I cannot reign over you, and Abimelech shall die by
stones. 3. Then came the trees unto the bramble and said: Come, reign
over us. And the bramble said: When the thorn was born, truth did shine
forth in the semblance of a thorn. And when our first father was
condemned to death, the earth was condemned to bring forth thorns and
thistles. And when the truth enlightened Moses, it was by a thorn bush
that it enlightened him. Now therefore it shall be that by me the truth
shall be heard of you. Now if ye have spoken in sincerity unto the
bramble that it should in truth reign over you, sit ye under the shadow
of it: but if with dissembling, then let fire go forth and devour and
consume the trees of the field. For the apple-tree was made for the
chastisers, and the fig-tree was made for the people, and the
vine\[yard\] was made for them that were before us.

4\. And now shall *the bramble* be unto you even as Abimelech, which
slew his brethren with wrong, and desireth to rule over you. If
Abimelech be worthy of them (*or* Let Abimelech be a fire unto them)
whom he desireth to rule, let him be as the bramble which was made to
rebuke the foolish among the people. And there went forth fire out of
the bramble and devoured the trees that are in the field.

5\. After that Abimelech ruled over the people for one year and six
months, and he died hard by

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_130"></span>[185:2](bap53.htm#fr_130.md) XXXVII. 2 *seq*. This
adaptation of the parable of Jotham is singularly inept as it stands:
possibly the lost beginning of it may have made it more plausible:
possibly it may contain plays upon Hebrew words which I do not detect.
Two sentences in it are particularly obscure: (1) Nascente spina,
ueritas in specie praelucebat. Can there be here an allusion to Ps. 84
(85):12, ἀλήθεια ἐκ τῆσ γῆσ ἀνέτειλε? (2) *quia malus facta est in
castigatores, et ficus facta est in populum, et uinea jacta est in
praecessores*. Ought we to render facta est by "stands for" or
"represents"?
