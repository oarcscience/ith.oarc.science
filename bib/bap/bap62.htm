In <I>Pirke R. Eliezer</I> the belief is stated twice: c. 29, when Elijah says: "I have been very zealous" (1 Kings 19:10), God says: Thou art always zealous. Thou wast zealous in Shittim. . . . because it is said: Phinehas . . . turned my wrath away, etc. Here also art thou zealous. c. 47. <I>R. Eliezer said</I>--<A NAME="page_211"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 211</FONT></A> He called the name of Phinehas by the name of Elijah . . . He gave him the life of this world and the life of the world to come. In the <I>Quaest. Hebr. in libros Regum</I> it is said of the man of God who came to Eli (1 Sam. 2): <I>Hunc uirum Dei Iudaei Phinees dicunt: quem et Eliam autumant</I>.</P>
