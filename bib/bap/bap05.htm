<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">4. TITLE, AND ATTRIBUTION TO PHILO.</H3>
<P>4. The TITLE of the book is somewhat of a puzzle. Sichardus calls it <I>Philonis Judaei antiquitatum Biblicarum liber</I>, the Fulda catalogue (and the label on the Fulda MS.) <I>Philonis antiquitatum liber</I>; a late title in the same MS. is: <I>libri Philonis iudei de initio mundi</I>; P has a title of cent. XV.: <I>Philo iudeus de successione generationum veteris testamenti</I>; R, in the colophon: "<I>ystoria Philonis ab initio mundi usque ad David regem</I>" (so also two at least of the Munich M SS.); Trithemius has <I>De generationis successu</I>. Sixtus Senensis has two notices of the book: in the first, which is drawn from Sichardus., he calls it <I>Biblicarum antiquitatum liber</I>; in the second, which depends on some MS., his words are: "In Gen. Cap. 5 <I>de successione generis humani</I> liber unus, continens enarrationem genealogiae seu posteritatis Adae. Liber incipit: &#7944;&#0948;&#8048;&#0956; &#7952;&#0947;&#0941;&#0957;&#0957;&#0951;&#0963;&#0949; <I>Adam genuit</I>&nbsp;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_27"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 27</FONT></A></P>
<I><P>tres filios</I>." The two Greek words I take to be no more than a re-translation from Latin. The MS. V has no title at all.</P>
<P>Thus we have authority for three names. The first, <I>Biblicarum antiquitatum</I>, I think, must be in part due to Sichardus; the epithet "Biblicarum" savours to my mind of the Renaissance, and has no certain MS. attestation. "Antiquitatum" (which is as old as cent. XIV.) is probably due to a recollection of Josephus's great work, the <I>Jewish Antiquities</I>. The other name, <I>de successione generationum</I> or the like, has rather better attestation, and: <I>Historia ab initio mundi</I>, etc. (if original in the Munich MSS.) the oldest of all. I can hardly believe, however, that any of them are original; it seems more probable that some Biblical name was prefixed to the book when it was first issued. Rather out of respect to the first editor than for any better reason I have retained the title <I>Biblical Antiquities</I>, under which the text was introduced to the modern world.</P>
<P>The ATTRIBUTION TO PHILO I regard as due to the accident that the text was transmitted in company with genuine Philonic writings.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="bap06.htm#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Certainly, if the <I>Antiquities</I> had come down to us by themselves, no one in his senses could have thought of connecting them with Philo; unless, indeed, knowing of but two Jewish authors, Philo and Josephus, he assumed that, since one had written a history of the Jews, the other must needs have followed suit.</P>
