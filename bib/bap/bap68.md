### CHAPTER LIV.

LIV\. And in those days the Philistines assembled

|              |
|--------------|
| 1 Sam. 4:1-3 |

their camp to fight against Israel, and the children of Israel went out
to fight with them. And when the people of Israel had been put to flight
in the first battle, they said: Let us bring up the ark of the covenant
of the Lord, peradventure it Will fight with us, because in it are the
testimonies of the Lord which he ordained unto our fathers in Oreb. 2.
And as the ark went up with

|                 |
|-----------------|
| 1 Sam. 4:5, 4:6 |

them, when it was come into the camp, the Lord thundered and said: This
time shall be likened unto that which was in the wilderness, when they
took the ark without my commandment, and destruction befel them. So
also, at this time, shall the people fall, and the ark shall be taken,
that I may punish the adversaries of my people because of the ark, and
rebuke my people because they have sinned.

3\. And when the ark was come into the battle,

|             |
|-------------|
| 1 Sam. 4:10 |

the Philistines went forth to meet the children of Israel, and smote
them. And there was there a certain Golia <span

ark, and Ophni and Phinees the sons of Heli

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

and Saul the son of Cis held the ark. And Golia took *it* with his left
hand and slew Ophni and Phinees. 4. But Saul, because he was light on
his feet, fled from before him; and he rent his clothes, Sam.

| 1 Sam. 4:12 |

and put ashes on his head, and came unto Heli the priest. And Heli said
unto him: Tell me

|             |
|-------------|
| 1 Sam. 4:16 |

what hath befallen in the camp? And Saul said unto him: Why askest thou
me these things? for the people is overcome, and God hath forsaken

|             |
|-------------|
| 1 Sam. 4:17 |

Israel. Yea, and the priests also are slain with the sword, and the ark
is delivered unto the

|             |
|-------------|
| 1 Sam. 4:18 |

Philistines. 5. And when Heli heard of the taking of the ark, he said:
Behold, Samuel prophesied of me and my sons that we should die together,
but the ark he named not unto me. And now the testimonies are delivered
up unto the enemy, and what can I more say? Behold, Israel is perished
from the truth, for the judgements are taken away from him. And because
Heli despaired wholly, he fell off from his seat. And they died in one
day, even Heli and Ophni and Phinees his sons.

| 4:19 |

6\. And Heli's son's wife sat and travailed; and when she heard these
things, all her bowels were

|      |
|------|
| 4:20 |

melted. And the midwife said unto her: Be of good cheer, neither let thy
soul faint, for a son is born to thee. And she said to her: Lo now is
one soul born and we four die, that is, my father

|      |
|------|
| 4:21 |

and his two sons and his daughter-in-law. And she called his name, Where
is the glory? saying: The glory of God is perished in Israel because the
ark of the Lord is taken captive. And when she had thus said she gave up
the ghost.
