### 2. HISTORY OF THE BOOK.

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

2\. (*a*) The HISTORY OF THE BOOK, as known to us, can be shortly told.
It was printed by Adam Petri in 1527, at Basle, in a small folio volume,
along with the genuine Philo's *Quaestiones et Solutiones in
Genesim* <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) and a fragment of the *De
Vita contemplativa* (called *De Essaeis*). These were followed by the
*Onomasticon* (*de Nominibus Hebraicis*) ascribed in Philo, in Jerome's
version, and a Latin rendering of the *De Mundo* by Guillaume Budé. The
whole volume is in Latin, and was edited by Joannes Sichardus: for the
first three tracts he used two manuscripts, from Fulda and Lorsch, of
which more hereafter. In 1538 Henricus Petri (son of Adam) reprinted
this collection in a quarto volume, which I have not seen, and in 1550
included it all in a larger collection of patristic writings called
*Micropresbyticon*. In 1552 our book (without the accompanying tracts)
was printed from Sichardus' text in a small volume issued by Gryphius at
Lyons, under the title *Antiquitatum diversi auctores*, and in 1599 in a
similar collection *Historia antiqua*, by Commelin, at Heidelberg,
edited by Juda Bonutius.

During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Philo was read and
occasionally quoted, *e.g.* by Sixtus Senensis in the *Bibliotheca
Sancta*, and by Pineda in his treatise on Solomon: but the greatest
critics and scholars of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries seem
never to have seen it. J. A. Fabricius would certainly have accorded it
a place in his *Codex pseudepigraphus Veteris Testamenti* if he had read
it: and very little escaped his notice. He does speak of it in his
*Bibliotheca Graeca* (ed. Harles, IV. 743, 746), but only from the

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

point of view of the editions. It is not too much to say that the chance
which kept it from him has kept it also from the flock of scholars who
have followed him like sheep for two hundred years. The first
investigator to pay any attention to it seems to have been Cardinal J.
B. Pitra. In the *Spicilegium Solesmense* (1855, II. 345 note, III. 335
note, etc.) there are allusions to it: in the later *Analecta Sacra*
(II. 321; 1884) he printed the Lament of Jephthah's daughter from a
Vatican MS. of it, treating it as a known work, and referring to the
printed edition.

In 1893 I came upon four detached fragments in a manuscript at
Cheltenham, in the Phillipps collection, and printed them as a new
discovery in a volume of *Apocrypha Anecdota* (1st series, Texts and
Studies, II. 3). No one who reviewed the book in England or abroad
recognized that they were taken from a text already in print. At length,
in 1898, the late Dr. L. Cohn, who was engaged for many years upon an
edition of Philo's works, published in the *Jewish Quarterly Review* an
article in which the source of my fragments was pointed out and a very
full account given of the whole book, with copious quotations. This
article of Dr. Cohn's is at present our standard source of information.
Nothing to supersede it has, so far as I know, appeared since. A few
scholars, but on the whole surprisingly few, have used *Philo* in recent
years, notably Mr. H. St. John Thackeray in his book, *The Relation of
St. Paul to Contemporary Jewish Thought*.

(*b*) Can we trace the history of *Philo* further back than the printed
edition of 1527 by means of quotations or allusions to it? The whole
body of evidence is remarkably small. At the very end of the fifteenth
century Joannes Trithemius, Abbot

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

of Sponheim, writes a book, *De Scriptoribus ecclesiasticis*, printed at
Paris in 1512. On f. 18*b* is a notice of *Philo*, derived principally
from Jerome, and a list of his writings. Among these he includes *De
generationum successu*, lib. I. (which is our book), and adds the
opening words: *Adam genuit tres filios*, which shows that he had seen
the text. It is the *only* item so distinguished in all his list. Then,
going back and setting aside certain extracts from the text (of which we
shall speak under the head of authorities), we find, in the twelfth
century, Petrus Comestor of Troyes, in his *Historia Scholastica* (one
of the famous text-books of the Middle Ages), making a single incorrect
quotation from our book (V. 8). He calls his source 'Philo the Jew, or,
as some say, a heathen philosopher, in his book of questions upon
Genesis': the words show that he was quoting a manuscript which
contained that work as well as our text. His quotation is borrowed by
several later mediaeval chroniclers.

In the catalogues of monastic libraries *Philo* is of rare occurrence.
The Fulda catalogue of the sixteenth century <span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) has "Repertorii noni ordo primus, liber
Philonis antiquitatum 36." The number 36 is the older library number,
perhaps as old as the thirteenth century, which was written on the cover
of the volume. This was one of the two manuscripts used by Sichardus: we
shall return to it.

In the twelfth century a monk writes to the Abbot of Tegernsee for the
loan of the "liber Philonis." In 831 the abbey of St. Riquier, near
Abbeville, has in its catalogue "liber Philonis Judaei

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

unum volumen." Both these references may be found in Becker's
*Catalogi*. <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md)

One possible hint, and one only, of the existence of *Philo* in the
Eastern Church is known to me. The *Taktikon* of Nicon, cap. 13, in the
Slavonic version, as quoted by Berendts (*Zacharias-Apokrypken*, p. 5,
note 3), reckons among the canonical books of the Old Testament "the
*Palaea* (the Eastern text-book of Bible history comparable to the
*Historia Scholastica* in the West) and *Philo*."

The *Decretum Gelasianum* of the fifth or sixth century condemns, among
many other apocryphal books, "liber de filiabus Adae Leptogeneseos." The
natural and usual interpretation of the words is that they refer to the
*Book of Jubilees*, which the Greeks called ἡ λεπτὴ γένεσισ, but it is
worth noting that *Philo* mentions the daughters of Adam in the first
few lines, whereas in *Jubilees* they do not occur before the fourth
chapter.

I know of nothing in earlier centuries which looks like an allusion to
*Philo*, unless it be a passage in Origen on John (Tom. VI. 14.) in
which he says <span id="fr_3"></span>[2](#fn_3.md): "I know not what is the
motive of the Jewish tradition that Phinees the son of Eleazar, who
admittedly lived through the days of many of the Judges, is the same as
Elias, and that immortality was promised to him in Numbers

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (XXV. 12)," with more to the same effect. He
refers to no book, but to a tradition which is, in fact, preserved in
several Midrashim. The identification is found in *Philo*, c. XLVIII.
See the note *in loc*.

the catalogues.
