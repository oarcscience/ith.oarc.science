### CHAPTER III.

III\. *And it came to pass when men had begun*

|          |
|----------|
| Gen. 6:1 |

*to multiply on the earth*, that beautiful *daughters were born unto
them*. *And the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were*
exceeding *fair, and took them wives of all that they had chosen*. 2.
 <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) *And God said: My spirit shall not*
judge *among these men for ever, because they are of flesh; but their
years shall be* 120. Upon whom he laid (*or* wherein I have set) the
ends of the world, and in their hands wickednesses were not put out (or
the

|          |
|----------|
| Gen. 6:5 |

law shall not be quenched). 3. *And God saw that in all the dwellers
upon earth works of evil were fulfilled: and inasmuch as their thought
was upon iniquity all their days, God* said: *I will blot out man* and
all things that have budded upon the earth, *for it repenteth me that I
have made him*.

4\. *But Noe found grace* and mercy *before the* 

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

\[paragraph continues\] *Lord, and these are his generations. Noe, which
was a righteous man and* undefiled *in his generation*,

|           |
|-----------|
| Gen. 6:13 |

*pleased the Lord*. Unto whom God *said: The time of all men that dwell
upon the earth is come, for their deeds are very evil. And now make thee
an ark of* cedar wood, *and thus shalt thou make it*. 300 *cubits shall
be the length thereof, and*

|           |
|-----------|
| Gen. 6:18 |

50 *cubits the breadth, and* 30 *cubits the height. And thou shall enter
into the ark, thou and thy wife and thy sons and thy sons' wives with
thee. And I will make my covenant with thee*, to destroy all the

|            |
|------------|
| Gen. 7:2-4 |

dwellers upon earth. *Now of clean beasts and of the fowls of the heaven
that are clean thou shalt take by sevens male and female, that their
seed may be saved alive upon the earth. But of unclean beasts and fowls
thou shalt take to thee by twos male and*

|           |
|-----------|
| Gen. 6:21 |

*female, and shalt take provision for thee and for them also*.

|               |
|---------------|
| Gen. 7:5, 7:7 |

5\. *And Noe did that which God commanded him and entered into the ark,
he and all his sons with*

|           |
|-----------|
| Gen. 7:10 |

*him. And it came to pass after* 7 *days that the*

|           |
|-----------|
| Gen. 7:11 |

*water of the flood began to be upon the earth. And in that day all the
depths were opened* and the great spring *of water and the windows of
heaven, and there was rain upon the earth* 40 *days and* 40 *nights*.

6\. And it was then the 1652<sup>nd</sup> (1656<sup>th</sup>) year from
the time when God had made the heaven and the earth in the day when the
earth was corrupted with the inhabiters thereof by reason of the
iniquity of their works.

7\. And when the flood continued 140 days upon the earth, Noe only and
they that were with him in the ark remained alive: and when God
remembered Noe, he made the water to diminish.

|           |
|-----------|
| Gen. 8:16 |

8\. And it came to pass on the 90<sup>th</sup> day that God

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

dried the earth, and said *unto Noe: Go out of the ark, thou* and all
that are with thee, *and grow and multiply upon the earth. And Noe went
out of the ark, he an d his sons and his sons' wives, and all the beasts
and creeping things and fowls and cattle* brought he forth with him as
God commanded him. *Then built Noe an altar unto the Lord, and took of
all the cattle and of the clean fowls and offered burnt offerings on the
altar*: and it was

|           |
|-----------|
| Gen. 8:21 |

accepted of the Lord for a savour of rest.

9\. *And God said: I will not again curse the earth for man's sake, for
the guise of man's heart* hath left off <span
id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) *from his youth. And therefore I will not
again destroy together all living as I have done*. But it shall be, when
the dwellers upon earth have sinned, I will judge them by famine or by
the sword or by fire or by pestilence (*lit*. death), and there shall be
earthquakes, and they shall be scattered

|           |
|-----------|
| Gen. 8:22 |

into places not inhabited (*or*, the places of *their* habitation shall
be scattered). But I will not again spoil the earth with the water of a
flood, and *in all the days of the earth seed time and harvest, cold and
heat, summer and autumn, day and night shall not cease*, until I
remember them that dwell on the earth, *even* until the times are
fulfilled. 10.  <span id="fr_24"></span>[2](#fn_24.md) But when the years
of the world shall be fulfilled, then shall the light cease and the
darkness be quenched: and I will quicken the dead and raise up from the
earth them that sleep: and Hell shall pay his debt and destruction give
back that

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

which was committed unto him, that I may render unto every man according
to his works and according to the fruit of their imaginations, *even*
until I judge between the soul and the flesh. And the world shall rest,
and death shall be quenched, and Hell shall shut his mouth. And the
earth shall not be without birth, neither barren for them that dwell
therein: and none shall be polluted that hath been justified in me <span
id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md). And there shall be another earth and
another heaven, even an everlasting habitation.

|          |
|----------|
| Gen. 9:8 |

11\. *And the Lord spake* further *unto Noe and to his sons saying:
Behold I will make my covenant with you and with your seed after you,
and will not*

|          |
|----------|
| Gen. 9:2 |

*again spoil the earth with the water of a flood. And all that liveth
and moveth therein shall be to you for meal. Nevertheless the flesh with
the blood of the soul shall ye not eat. For he that sheddeth man's
blood, his blood shall be shed; for in the image of God was man made.
And ye, grow ye and multiply and fill the earth* as the multitude of
fishes that

|           |
|-----------|
| Gen. 9:12 |

multiply in the waters. And God said: This is the covenant that I have
made betwixt me and you; *and it shall be when I cover the heaven with
clouds, that my bow shall appear in the cloud, and it shall be for a
memorial of the covenant betwixt me and you, and all the dwellers upon
earth*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_22"></span>[79:1](bap19.htm#fr_22.md) III. 2. *fin*. See the
variants, which are difficult to explain. If the reading *et in manibus
eorum scelera non extinguebantur* is right, the clause would be better
placed after *opera malignitatum* in the next verse. "And God saw that
in all the inhabiters of the earth works of wickedness were fulfilled,
and in their hands," etc. I have preferred the other reading, the whole
sentence will then refer to the new race who are to arise after the
Flood, and especially to Moses (see IX. 8 *fin*.): the last preceding
words ("their years shall be 120") do certainly apply to them and to
him. The antediluvians are to perish utterly. See on XVI. 3.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[81:1](bap19.htm#fr_23.md) 9. *the guise of man's
heart hath left off* (*figura cordis hominis desiit*: Cohn suggests
*desipit*) "ὁ Ἑβραῖοσ" (ap. Euseb. Emis. in Catena: see Field's
*Hexapla* in loc.) has τὸ πλάσμα τῆσ καρδίασ ἀνθρώπου.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[81:2](bap19.htm#fr_24.md) 10. This is the first
really characteristic passage.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[82:1](bap19.htm#fr_25.md) *that hath been
justified in me*. The word occurs in XLIX. 45 "Is Armathem *iustificata*
more than all the cities of Israel?" and in LI. 2.
