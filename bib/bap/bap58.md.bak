### CHAPTER XLII.

XLII\. Now there was a man of the tribe of

|           |
|-----------|
| Jud. 13:9 |

Dan, whose name was Manue, the son of Edoc, the son of Odo, the son of
Eriden, the son of Phadesur, the son of Dema, the son of Susi, the son
of Dan. And he had a wife whose name was Eluma, the daughter of Remac.
And she was barren and bare him no child. And when Manue her husband
said to her day by day: Lo, the Lord hath shut up thy womb, that thou
shouldest not bear; set me free, therefore, that I may take an other
wife lest I die without issue. And she said: The Lord hath not shut up
me from bearing, but thee, that I should bear no fruit. And he said to
her: Let the law make plain our trial. <span
id="fr_134"></span>[1](#fn_134.md) 2. And as they contended day by day and
both of them were sore grieved because they lacked fruit, upon a certain
night the woman went up into the upper chamber and prayed saying: Do
thou, O Lord God of all flesh, reveal unto me whether unto my husband or
unto me it is not given to beget children, or to whom it is forbidden or
to whom allowed to bear fruit, that to whom it is forbidden, the same
may mourn for his sins, because he continueth without fruit. Or if both
of us be deprived, reveal this also unto us, that we may bear our sin
and keep silence before thee. 3. And

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

the Lord hearkened to her voice and sent her his angel in the morning,
and said unto her: Thou art the barren one that bringeth not forth, and
thou art the womb which is forbidden, to bear fruit. But now hath the
Lord heard thy voice and looked

|                 |
|-----------------|
| Jud. 13:4, 13:7 |

upon thy tears and opened thy womb. And behold thou shalt conceive and
bear a son and shall call his name Samson, for he shall be holy unto thy
Lord. But take heed that he taste not of any fruit of the vine, neither
eat any unclean thing, for as himself hath said, he shall deliver Israel
from the hand of the Philistines. And when the angel of the Lord had
spoken these words he departed from her. 4. And she came unto her
husband into the house and said unto him: Lo, I lay mine hand upon my
mouth and will keep silence before thee all my days, because it was in
vain that I boasted myself, and believed not thy words. For the angel of
the Lord came unto me to-day, and showed me, saying: Eluma, thou art
barren, but thou shalt conceive and bear a son. 5. And Manue believed
not his wife. And he was ashamed and grieved and went up, he also, into
the upper chamber and prayed saying: Lo, I am not worthy to hear the
signs and wonders which God hath wrought in us, or to see the face of
his messenger. 6. And it came to pass while he thus spake, the angel of
the Lord came yet again unto his wife. Now she was in

|           |
|-----------|
| Jud. 13:2 |

the field and Manue was in his house. And the angel said unto her: Run
and call unto thine husband, for God hath accounted him worthy to hear
my voice. 7. And the woman ran and called to her husband, and he hasted
and came unto the angel in the field in Ammo (?), which said unto him:
Go in unto thy wife and do quickly all these things. But he said to him:
Yet see thou to

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

it, Lord, that thy word be accomplished upon thy servant. And he said:
It shall be so. 8. And

|            |
|------------|
| Jud. 13:15 |

Manue said unto him: If I were able, I would persuade thee to enter into
mine house and eat bread with me, and know that when thou goest away I
would give thee gifts to take with thee that thou mightest offer a
sacrifice unto the Lord thy God. And the angel said unto him: I will not
go in with thee into thine house, neither eat thy bread, neither will I
receive thy gifts. For if thou offerest a sacrifice of that which is not
thine, I can not show favour unto thee. 9. And Manue built an altar upon
the rock, and offered sacrifices and burnt offerings. And it came to
pass when he

|            |
|------------|
| Jud. 13:19 |

had cut up the flesh and laid it upon the holy place, the angel put
forth *his hand* and touched it with the end of his sceptre. And there
came forth fire out of the rock and consumed the burnt offerings and
sacrifices. And the angel went up

|       |
|-------|
| 13:20 |

from him with the flame of the fire. 10. But Manue and his wife when
they saw that, fell upon their faces and said: We shall surely die,
because

|       |
|-------|
| 13:22 |

we have seen the Lord face to face. And it sufficed *me* not that I saw
him, but I did also ask, his name, knowing not that he was the minister
of God. Now the angel that came was called Phadahel.

XLIII\. And it came to pass in the time of

|       |
|-------|
| 13:24 |

those days, that Eluma conceived and bare a son and called his name
Samson. And the Lord was with him. And when he was begun to grow up, and
sought to fight against the Philistines, he took

|      |
|------|
| 15:6 |

him a wife of the Philistines. And the Philistines burned her with fire,
for they were brought very low by Samson.

2\. And after that Samson entered into (*or* was

|      |
|------|
| 16:1 |

enraged against) Azotus. And they shut him in

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

and compassed the city about and said: Behold, now is our adversary
delivered into our hands. Now therefore let us gather ourselves together
and succour the souls one of another. And when Samson was arisen in the
night and saw the city closed in he said: Lo, now, these fleas have shut
me up in their city. And now shall the Lord be with me, and I will go
forth by their gates and fight against them. 3. And he went and set his
left hand under the bar of the gate and shook it and threw down the gate
of the wall. One of the gates he held in his right hand for a shield,
and the other he laid upon his shoulders and bare it away, and because
he had no sword he pursued after the Philistines with it, and killed
therewith 25,000 men. And he lifted up all the purtenances of the gate
and set them up on a mountain.

|         |
|---------|
| Jud. 15 |

4\. Now concerning the lion which he slew, and the jawbone of the ass
wherewith he smote the Philistines, and the bands which he brake off
from his arms as it were of themselves, and the foxes which he caught,
are not these things written in the book of the Judges?

|           |
|-----------|
| Jud. 16:4 |

5\. Then Samson went down unto Gerara, a city of the Philistines, and
saw there an harlot whose name was Dalila, and was led away after her,
and took her to him to wife. And God said: Behold, now Samson is led
astray by his eyes and hath forgotten the mighty works which I have
wrought with him, and is mingled with the daughters of the Philistines,
and hath not considered my servant Joseph which was in a strange land
and became a crown unto his brethren because he would not afflict his
seed. Now therefore shall his concupiscence be a stumbling-block unto
Samson, and his mingling shall be his destruction, and I will deliver
him to his enemies and they

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

shall blind him. Yet in the hour of his death will I remember him, and
will avenge him yet once upon the Philistines.

6\. And after these things his wife was importunate

|           |
|-----------|
| Jud. 16:6 |

unto him, saying unto him: Show me thy strength, and wherein is thy
might. So shall I know that thou lovest me. And when Samson had deceived
her three times, and she continued importunate unto him every day, the
fourth time he showed her his heart. But she made him

|            |
|------------|
| Jud. 16:16 |

drunk, and when he slumbered she called a barber, and he shaved the
seven locks of his head, and his might departed from him, for so had
himself revealed unto her. And she called the Philistines,

|            |
|------------|
| Jud. 16:19 |

and they smote Samson, and blinded him, and put him in prison.

7\. And it came to pass in the day of their

|            |
|------------|
| Jud. 16:23 |

banqueting, that they called for Samson that they might mock him. And he
being-bound between two pillars prayed saying: O Lord God of my

|            |
|------------|
| Jud. 16:26 |

fathers, hear me yet this once, and strengthen me that I may die with
these Philistines: for this sight of the eyes which they have taken from
me was freely given unto me by thee. And Samson added saying: Go forth,
O my soul, and be not grieved. Die, O my body, and weep not for thyself.
8. And

|            |
|------------|
| Jud. 16:29 |

he took hold upon the two pillars of the house and shook them. And the
house fell and all that was in it and slew all them that were round
about it, and the number of them was 40,000 men and women. And the
brethren of Samson came down

|            |
|------------|
| Jud. 16:13 |

and all his father's house, and took him and buried him in the sepulchre
of his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.
