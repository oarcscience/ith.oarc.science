### EXODUS CHAPTER 8

<span id="an_exo:8:1">1</span> <span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Say unto Aaron:
Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the rivers, over the canals,
and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.'
<span id="an_exo:8:2">2</span> And Aaron stretched out his hand over the
waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
<span id="an_exo:8:3">3</span> And the magicians did in like manner with
their secret arts, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt. <span
id="an_exo:8:4">4</span> Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and
said: 'Entreat the LORD, that He take away the frogs from me, and from
my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice unto
the LORD.' <span id="an_exo:8:5">5</span> And Moses said unto Pharaoh:
'Have thou this glory over me; against what time shall I entreat for
thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs be
destroyed from thee and thy houses, and remain in the river only?' <span
id="an_exo:8:6">6</span> And he said: 'Against to-morrow.' And he said:
'Be it according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none
like unto the LORD our God. <span id="an_exo:8:7">7</span> And the frogs
shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and
from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.' <span
id="an_exo:8:8">8</span> And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and
Moses cried unto the LORD concerning the frogs, which He had brought
upon Pharaoh. <span id="an_exo:8:9">9</span> And the LORD did according
to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the
courts, and out of the fields. <span id="an_exo:8:10">10</span> And they
gathered them together in heaps; and the land stank. "But when Pharaoh
saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not
unto them; as the LORD had spoken.

<span id="an_exo:8:12">12</span> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Say unto
Aaron: Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that it may
become gnats throughout all the land of Egypt.' <span
id="an_exo:8:13">13</span> And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his
hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and there were gnats
upon man, and upon beast; all the dust of the earth became gnats
throughout all the land of Egypt. <span id="an_exo:8:14">14</span> And
the magicians did so with their secret arts to bring forth gnats, but
they could not; and there were gnats upon man, and upon beast. <span
id="an_exo:8:15">15</span> Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh: 'This
is the finger of God'; and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he
hearkened not unto them; as. the LORD had spoken.

<span id="an_exo:8:16">16</span> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Rise up
early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to
the water; and say unto him: Thus saith the LORD: Let My people go, that
they may serve Me. <span id="an_exo:8:17">17</span> Else, if thou wilt
not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and
upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses; and the
houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the
ground whereon they are. <span id="an_exo:8:18">18</span> And I will set
apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which My people dwell, that no
swarms of flies shall be there; to the end that thou mayest know that I
am the LORD in the midst of the earth. <span
id="an_exo:8:19">19</span> And I will put a division between My people
and thy people—by to-morrow shall this sign be.' <span
id="an_exo:8:20">20</span> And the LORD did so; and there came grievous
swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants’ <span
id="page_74">p. 74</span> houses; and in all the land of Egypt the land
was ruined by reason of the swarms of flies. <span
id="an_exo:8:21">21</span> And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron,
and said: 'Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.' <span
id="an_exo:8:22">22</span> And Moses said: 'It is not meet so to do; for
we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God;
lo, if we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians be fore their eyes,
will they not stone us? <span id="an_exo:8:23">23</span> We will go
three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our
God, as He shall command us.' <span id="an_exo:8:24">24</span> And
Pharaoh said: 'I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your
God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away; entreat for
me.' <span id="an_exo:8:25">25</span> And Moses said: 'Behold, I go out
from thee, and I will entreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may
depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to-morrow;
only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people
go to sacrifice to the LORD.' <span id="an_exo:8:26">26</span> And Moses
went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD. <span
id="an_exo:8:27">27</span> And the LORD did according to the word of
Moses; and He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his
servants, and from his people; there remained not one. <span
id="an_exo:8:28">28</span> And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time
also, and he did not let the people go.
