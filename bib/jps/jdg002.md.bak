### JUDGES CHAPTER 2

<span id="an_jdg:2:1">1</span> And the angel of the LORD came up from
Gilgal to Bochim. And he said: \`...I made you to go up out of Egypt,
and have brought you unto the land which I swore unto your fathers; and
I said: I will never break My covenant with you; <span
id="an_jdg:2:2">2</span> and ye shall make no covenant with the
inhabitants of this land; ye shall break down their altars; but ye have
not hearkened unto My voice; what is this ye have done? <span
id="an_jdg:2:3">3</span> Wherefore I also said: I will not drive them
out from before you; but they shall be unto you as snares, and their
gods shall be a trap unto you.' <span id="an_jdg:2:4">4</span> And it

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spoke these words unto all the
children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
<span id="an_jdg:2:5">5</span> And they called the name of that place
 <span id="fr_110"></span>[a](#fn_107.md) Bochim; and they sacrificed there
unto the LORD.

<span id="an_jdg:2:6">6</span> Now when Joshua had sent the people away,
the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess
the land. <span id="an_jdg:2:7">7</span> And the people served the LORD
all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived
Joshua, who had seen all the great work of the LORD, that He had wrought
for Israel. <span id="an_jdg:2:8">8</span> And Joshua the son of Nun,
the servant of the LORD, died, being a hundred and ten years old. <span
id="an_jdg:2:9">9</span> And they buried him in the border of his
inheritance in Timnathheres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the
north of the mountain of Gaash. <span id="an_jdg:2:10">10</span> And
also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers; and there
arose another generation after them, that knew not the LORD, nor yet the
work which He had wrought for Israel.

<span id="an_jdg:2:11">11</span> And the children of Israel did that
which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and served the Baalim. <span
id="an_jdg:2:12">12</span> And they forsook the LORD, the God of their
fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other
gods, of the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and
worshipped them; and they provoked the LORD. <span
id="an_jdg:2:13">13</span> And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal
and the Ashtaroth. <span id="an_jdg:2:14">14</span> And the anger of the
LORD was kindled against Israel, and He delivered them into the hands of
spoilers that spoiled them, and He gave them over into the hands of
their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand
before their enemies. <span id="an_jdg:2:15">15</span> Whithersoever
they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the
LORD had spoken, and as the LORD had sworn unto them; and they were sore
distressed. <span id="an_jdg:2:16">16</span> And the LORD raised up
judges, who saved them out of the hand of those that spoiled them. <span
id="an_jdg:2:17">17</span> And yet they hearkened not unto their judges,
for they went astray after other gods, and worshipped them; they turned
aside quickly out of the way wherein their fathers walked, obeying the
commandments of the LORD; they did not so. <span
id="an_jdg:2:18">18</span> And when the LORD raised them up judges, then
the LORD was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their
enemies all the days of the judge; for it repented the LORD because of
their groaning by reason of them that oppressed them and crushed them.
<span id="an_jdg:2:19">19</span> But it came to pass, when the judge was
dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their
fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to worship them;
they left nothing undone of their practices, nor of their stubborn way.
<span id="an_jdg:2:20">20</span> And the anger of the LORD was kindled
against Israel; and He said: \`Because this nation have transgressed My
covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto My
voice; <span id="an_jdg:2:21">21</span> I also will not henceforth drive
out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died;
<span id="an_jdg:2:22">22</span> that by them I may prove Israel,
whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their
fathers did keep it, or not.' <span id="an_jdg:2:23">23</span> So the
LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither
delivered He them into the hand of Joshua.
