### EXODUS CHAPTER 31

<span id="an_exo:31:1">1</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_exo:31:2">2</span> 'See, I have called by name Bezalel the
son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; <span
id="an_exo:31:3">3</span> and I have filled him with the spirit of God,
in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of
workmanship, <span id="an_exo:31:4">4</span> to devise skilful works, to
work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, <span
id="an_exo:31:5">5</span> and in cutting of stones for setting, and in
carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship. <span
id="an_exo:31:6">6</span> And I, behold, I have appointed with him
Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of
all that are wise-hearted <span id="page_104">p. 104</span> I have put
wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee: <span
id="an_exo:31:7">7</span> the tent of meeting, and the ark of the
testimony, and the ark-cover that is thereupon, and all the furniture of
the Tent; <span id="an_exo:31:8">8</span> and the table and its vessels,
and the pure candlestick with all its vessels, and the altar of incense;
<span id="an_exo:31:9">9</span> and the altar of burnt-offering with all
its vessels, and the laver and its base; <span
id="an_exo:31:10">10</span> and the plaited garments, and the holy
garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister
in the priest's office; <span id="an_exo:31:11">11</span> and the
anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place;
according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.'

<span id="an_exo:31:12">12</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_exo:31:13">13</span> 'Speak thou also unto the children of
Israel, saying: Verily ye shall keep My sabbaths, for it is a sign
between Me and you throughout your generations, that ye may know that I
am the LORD who sanctify you. <span id="an_exo:31:14">14</span> Ye shall
keep the sabbath therefore, for it is holy unto you; every one that
profaneth it shall surely be put to death; for whosoever doeth any work
therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. <span
id="an_exo:31:15">15</span> Six days shall work be done; but on the
seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the LORD; whosoever
doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.
<span id="an_exo:31:16">16</span> Wherefore the children of Israel shall
keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations,
for a perpetual covenant. <span id="an_exo:31:17">17</span> It is a sign
between Me and the children of Israel for ever; for in six days the LORD
made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He ceased from work and
rested.'

<span id="an_exo:31:18">18</span> And He gave unto Moses, when He had
made an end of speaking with him upon mount Sinai, the two tables of the
testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.
