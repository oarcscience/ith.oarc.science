### I SAMUEL CHAPTER 29

<span id="an_sa1:29:1">1</span> Now the Philistines gathered together
all their hosts to Aphek; and the Israelites pitched by the fountain
which is in Jezreel. <span id="an_sa1:29:2">2</span> And the lords of
the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and
his men passed on in the rearward with Achish. <span
id="an_sa1:29:3">3</span> Then said the princes of the Philistines:
\`What do these Hebrews here?' And Achish said unto the princes of the
Philistines: \`Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of
Israel, who hath been with me these days or these years, and I have
found no fault in him since he fell away unto me unto this day?' <span
id="an_sa1:29:4">4</span> But the princes of the Philistines were wroth
with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him: \`Make the
man return, that he may go back to his place where thou hast appointed
him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he
become an adversary to us; for wherewith should this fellow reconcile
himself unto his lord? should it not be with the heads

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

of these men? <span id="an_sa1:29:5">5</span> Is not this David, of whom
they sang one to another in dances, saying:

Saul hath slain his thousands,  
And David his ten thousands?'

<span id="an_sa1:29:6">6</span> Then Achish called David, and said unto
him: \`As the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and
thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight; for I have not
found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day;
nevertheless the lords favour thee not. <span
id="an_sa1:29:7">7</span> Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that
thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.' <span
id="an_sa1:29:8">8</span> And David said unto Achish: \`But what have I
done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been
before thee unto this day, that I may not go and fight against the
enemies of my lord the king?' <span id="an_sa1:29:9">9</span> And Achish
answered and said to David: \`I know that thou art good in my sight, as
an angel of God; notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have
said: He shall not go up with us to the battle. <span
id="an_sa1:29:10">10</span> Wherefore now rise up early in the morning
with the servants of thy lord that are come with thee; and as soon as ye
are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.' <span
id="an_sa1:29:11">11</span> So David rose up early, he and his men, to
depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And
the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
