### GENESIS CHAPTER 6

<span id="an_gen:6:1">1</span> And it came to pass, when men began to
multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
<span id="an_gen:6:2">2</span> that the sons of God saw the daughters of
men that they were fair; and they took them wives, whomsoever they
chose. <span id="an_gen:6:3">3</span> And the LORD said: 'My spirit
shall not abide in man for ever, for that he also is flesh; therefore
shall his days be a hundred and twenty years.' <span
id="an_gen:6:4">4</span> The Nephilim were in the earth in those days,
and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of
men, and they bore children to them; the same were the mighty men that
were of old, the men of renown.

<span id="an_gen:6:5">5</span> And the LORD saw that the wickedness of
man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts
of his heart was only evil continually. <span
id="an_gen:6:6">6</span> And it repented the LORD that He had made man
on the earth, and it grieved Him at His heart. <span
id="an_gen:6:7">7</span> And the LORD said: 'I will blot out man whom I
have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and
creeping thing, and fowl of the air; for it repenteth Me that I have
made them.' <span id="an_gen:6:8">8</span> But Noah found grace in the
eyes of the LORD.

<span id="an_gen:6:9">9</span> These are the generations of Noah. Noah
was in his generations a man righteous and whole-hearted; Noah walked
with God. <span id="an_gen:6:10">10</span> And Noah begot three sons,
Shem, Ham, and Japheth. <span id="an_gen:6:11">11</span> And the earth
was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. <span
id="an_gen:6:12">12</span> And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was
corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.

<span id="an_gen:6:13">13</span> And God said unto Noah: 'The end of all
flesh is come before Me; for the earth is filled with violence through
them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. <span
id="an_gen:6:14">14</span> Make thee an ark of gopher wood; with rooms
shalt thou make the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with
pitch. <span id="an_gen:6:15">15</span> And this is how thou shalt make
it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty
cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. <span
id="an_gen:6:16">16</span> A light shalt thou make to the ark, <span
id="page_9">p. 9</span> and to a cubit shalt thou finish it upward; and
the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower,
second, and third stories shalt thou make it. <span
id="an_gen:6:17">17</span> And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters
upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life,
from under heaven; every thing that is in the earth shall perish. <span
id="an_gen:6:18">18</span> But I will establish My covenant with thee;
and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and
thy sons’ wives with thee. <span id="an_gen:6:19">19</span> And of every
living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the
ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. <span
id="an_gen:6:20">20</span> Of the fowl after their kind, and of the
cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its
kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. <span
id="an_gen:6:21">21</span> And take thou unto thee of all food that is
eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for
them.' <span id="an_gen:6:22">22</span> Thus did Noah; according to all
that God commanded him, so did he.
