### EXODUS CHAPTER 24

<span id="an_exo:24:1">1</span> And unto Moses He said: 'Come up unto
the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders
of Israel; and worship ye afar off; <span id="an_exo:24:2">2</span> and
Moses alone shall come near unto the LORD; but they shall not come near;
neither shall the people go up with him.' <span
id="an_exo:24:3">3</span> And Moses came and told the people all the
words of the LORD, and all the ordinances; and all the people answered
with one voice, and said: 'All the words which the Lord hath spoken will
we do.' <span id="an_exo:24:4">4</span> And Moses wrote all the words of
the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under
the mount, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.
<span id="an_exo:24:5">5</span> And he sent the young men of the
children of Israel, who offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed
peace-offerings of oxen unto the LORD. <span
id="an_exo:24:6">6</span> And Moses took half of the blood, and put it
in basins; and half of the blood he dashed against the altar. <span
id="an_exo:24:7">7</span> And he took the book of the covenant, and read
in the hearing of the people; and they said: 'All that the LORD hath
spoken will we do, and obey.' <span id="an_exo:24:8">8</span> And Moses
took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said: 'Behold the
blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you in agreement
with all these words.' <span id="page_94">p. 94</span> <span
id="an_exo:24:9">9</span> Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and
Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; <span
id="an_exo:24:10">10</span> and they saw the God of Israel; and there
was under His feet the like of a paved work of sapphire stone, and the
like of the very heaven for clearness. <span
id="an_exo:24:11">11</span> And upon the nobles of the children of
Israel He laid not His hand; and they beheld God, and did eat and drink.

<span id="an_exo:24:12">12</span> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Come up
to Me into the mount, and be there; and I will give thee the tables of
stone, and the law and the commandment, which I have written, that thou
mayest teach them.' <span id="an_exo:24:13">13</span> And Moses rose up,
and Joshua his minister; and Moses went up into the mount of God. <span
id="an_exo:24:14">14</span> And unto the elders he said: 'Tarry ye here
for us, until we come back unto you; and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with
you; whosoever hath a cause, let him come near unto them.' <span
id="an_exo:24:15">15</span> And Moses went up into the mount, and the
cloud covered the mount. <span id="an_exo:24:16">16</span> And the glory
of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days;
and the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.
<span id="an_exo:24:17">17</span> And the appearance of the glory of the
LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the
children of Israel. <span id="an_exo:24:18">18</span> And Moses entered.
into the midst of the cloud, and went up into the mount; and Moses was
in the mount forty days and forty nights.
