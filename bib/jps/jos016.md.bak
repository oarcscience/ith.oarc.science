### JOSHUA CHAPTER 16

<span id="an_jos:16:1">1</span> And the lot for the children of Joseph
went out from the Jordan at Jericho, at the waters of Jericho on the
east, going up from Jericho through the hill-country to the wilderness,
even to Beth-el. <span id="an_jos:16:2">2</span> And it went out from
Beth-el-luz, and passed along unto the border of the Archites to
Ataroth. <span id="an_jos:16:3">3</span> And it went down westward to
the border of the Japhletites, unto the border of Beth-horon the nether,
even unto Gezer; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. <span
id="an_jos:16:4">4</span> And the children of Joseph, Manasseh and
Ephraim, took their inheritance. <span id="an_jos:16:5">5</span> And the
border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus;
even the border of their inheritance eastward was Atroth-addar, unto
Beth-horon the upper. <span id="an_jos:16:6">6</span> And the border
went out westward, Michmethath being on the north; and the border turned
about eastward unto Taanath-shiloh, and passed along it on the east of
Janoah. <span id="an_jos:16:7">7</span> And it went down from Janoah to
Ataroth, and to Naarah, and reached unto Jericho, and went out at the
Jordan. <span id="an_jos:16:8">8</span> From Tappuah the border went
along westward to the brook of Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at
the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim
according to their families; <span id="an_jos:16:9">9</span> together
with the cities which were separated for the children of Ephraim in the
midst of the inheritance of the

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages. <span
id="an_jos:16:10">10</span> And they drove not out the Canaanites that
dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in the midst of Ephraim, unto
this day, and became servants to do taskwork.
