# The Holy Scriptures

## According to the Masoretic Text

### The Jewish Publication Society translation

#### \[1917\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the Jewish Publication Society translation of the Tanach, the
Hebrew Bible. This etext is a completely new transcription, based on a
first edition of the 1917 text, which is under preparation at the
Internet Sacred Text Archive and by volunteers. Due to the size of this
project, we are posting each book as we go. Successive books will appear
in the near future. Please note that certain things such as the format
of HTML anchors has changed; they now include the full
book:verse:chapter in every instance.

We welcome any reports of typographical errors in this electronic text.
Particular problems to look for are missing verse numbers, and unmatched
single quotes.
