### GENESIS CHAPTER 10

<span id="an_gen:10:1">1</span> Now these are the generations of the
sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and unto them were sons born after
the flood.

<span id="an_gen:10:2">2</span> The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog,
and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. <span
id="an_gen:10:3">3</span> And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath,
and Togarmah. <span id="an_gen:10:4">4</span> And the sons of Javan:
Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. <span
id="an_gen:10:5">5</span> Of these were the isles of the nations divided
in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in
their nations.

<span id="an_gen:10:6">6</span> And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim,
and Put, and Canaan. <span id="an_gen:10:7">7</span> And the sons of
Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; and the
sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan. <span id="an_gen:10:8">8</span> And
Cush begot Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one in the earth. <span
id="an_gen:10:9">9</span> He was a mighty hunter before the LORD;
wherefore it is said: 'Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD.'
<span id="an_gen:10:10">10</span> And the beginning of his kingdom was
Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. <span
id="an_gen:10:11">11</span> Out of that land went forth Asshur, and
builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-ir, and Calah, <span
id="an_gen:10:12">12</span> and Resen between Nineveh and Calah—the same
is the great city. <span id="an_gen:10:13">13</span> And Mizraim begot
Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, <span
id="an_gen:10:14">14</span> and Pathrusim, and Casluhim—whence went
forth the Philistines—and Caphtorim.

<span id="an_gen:10:15">15</span> And Canaan begot Zidon his firstborn,
and Heth; <span id="an_gen:10:16">16</span> and the Jebusite, and the
Amorite, and the Girgashite; <span id="an_gen:10:17">17</span> and the
Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite; <span
id="an_gen:10:18">18</span> and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the
Hamathite; and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread
abroad. <span id="an_gen:10:19">19</span> And the border of the
Canaanite was from Zidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou
goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha. <span
id="an_gen:10:20">20</span> These are the sons of Ham, after their
families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.

<span id="an_gen:10:21">21</span> And unto Shem, the father of all the
children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were
children born. <span id="an_gen:10:22">22</span> The sons of Shem: Elam,
and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram. <span
id="an_gen:10:23">23</span> And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and
Gether, and Mash. <span id="an_gen:10:24">24</span> And Arpachshad begot
Shelah; and Shelah begot Eber. <span id="an_gen:10:25">25</span> And
unto Eber were born two sons; the name of the one was  <span
id="fr_16"></span>[b](#fn_15.md) Peleg; for in his days was the earth
divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. <span
id="an_gen:10:26">26</span> And Joktan begot Almodad, and Sheleph, and
Hazarmaveth, and Jerah; <span id="an_gen:10:27">27</span> and Hadoram,
and Uzal, and Diklah; <span id="an_gen:10:28">28</span> and Obal, and
Abimael, and Sheba; <span id="an_gen:10:29">29</span> and Ophir, and
Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan. <span
id="an_gen:10:30">30</span> And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou
goest toward Sephar, unto the mountain of the east. <span
id="an_gen:10:31">31</span> These are the sons of Shem, after their
families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.
<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

<span id="an_gen:10:32">32</span> These are the families of the sons of
Noah, after their generations, in their nations; and of these were the
nations divided in the earth after the flood.
