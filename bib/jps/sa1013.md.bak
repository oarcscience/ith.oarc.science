### I SAMUEL CHAPTER 13

<span id="an_sa1:13:1">1</span> Saul was  <span
id="fr_121"></span>[a](#fn_118.md)— years old when he began to reign; and
two years he reigned over Israel. <span id="an_sa1:13:2">2</span> And
Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were
with Saul in Michmas and in the mount of Beth-el, and a thousand were
with Jonathan in Gibeathbenjamin; and the rest of the people he sent
every man to his tent. <span id="an_sa1:13:3">3</span> And Jonathan
smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the
Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the horn throughout all the

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

land, saying: \`Let the Hebrews hear.' <span
id="an_sa1:13:4">4</span> And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten
the garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also had made himself
odious with the Philistines. And the people were gathered together after
Saul to Gilgal.

<span id="an_sa1:13:5">5</span> And the Philistines assembled themselves
together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six
thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in
multitude; and they came up, and pitched in Michmas, eastward of
Beth-aven. <span id="an_sa1:13:6">6</span> When the men of Israel saw
that they were in a strait—for the people were distressed—then the
people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and
in holds, and in pits. <span id="an_sa1:13:7">7</span> Now some of the
Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as
for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him
trembling.

<span id="an_sa1:13:8">8</span> And he tarried seven days, according to
the set time that Samuel had appointed; but Samuel came not to Gilgal;
and the people were scattered from him. <span
id="an_sa1:13:9">9</span> And Saul said: \`Bring hither to me the
burnt-offering and the peace-offerings.' And he offered the
burnt-offering. <span id="an_sa1:13:10">10</span> And it came to pass
that, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering,
behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute
him. <span id="an_sa1:13:11">11</span> And Samuel said: \`What hast thou
done?' And Saul said: \`Because I saw that the people were scattered
from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that
the Philistines assembled themselves together against Michmas; <span
id="an_sa1:13:12">12</span> therefore said I: Now will the Philistines
come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favour of the
LORD; I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt-offering.' <span
id="an_sa1:13:13">13</span> And Samuel said to Saul: \`Thou hast done
foolishly; thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which
He commanded thee; for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom
upon Israel for ever. <span id="an_sa1:13:14">14</span> But now thy
kingdom shall not continue; the LORD hath sought him a man after His own
heart, and the LORD hath appointed him to be prince over His people,
because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.'

<span id="an_sa1:13:15">15</span> And Samuel arose, and got him up from
Gilgal unto Gibeath-benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were
present with him, about six hundred men. <span
id="an_sa1:13:16">16</span> And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the
people that were present with them, abode in  <span
id="fr_122"></span>[a](#fn_119.md) Gibeathbenjamin; but the Philistines
encamped in Michmas. <span id="an_sa1:13:17">17</span> And the spoilers
came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company
turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual;
<span id="an_sa1:13:18">18</span> and another company turned the way to
Beth-boron; and another company turned the way of the border that
looketh down upon the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.

<span id="an_sa1:13:19">19</span> Now there was no smith found
throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said: \`Lest the
Hebrews make them swords or spears'; <span
id="an_sa1:13:20">20</span> but all the Israelites went down to the
Philistines, to sharpen every man his plowshare, and his coulter, and
his axe, and his mattock. <span id="an_sa1:13:21">21</span> And the
price of the filing was <span id="fr_123"></span>[b](#fn_120.md) a pim for
the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks with three teeth,
and for the axes; and to set the goads. <span
id="an_sa1:13:22">22</span> So it came to pass in the day of battle,
that there was neither sword nor spear

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan;
but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found. <span
id="an_sa1:13:23">23</span> And the garrison of the Philistines went out
unto the pass of Michmas.
