### GENESIS CHAPTER 35

<span id="an_gen:35:1">1</span> And God said unto Jacob: 'Arise, go up
to Beth-el, and dwell there; and make there an altar unto God, who
appeared unto thee when thou didst flee from the face of Esau thy
brother.' <span id="an_gen:35:2">2</span> Then Jacob said unto his
household, and to all that were with him: 'Put away the strange gods
that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments;
<span id="an_gen:35:3">3</span> and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el;
and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of
my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.' <span
id="an_gen:35:4">4</span> And they gave unto Jacob all the foreign gods
which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and
Jacob hid them under the terebinth which was by Shechem. <span
id="an_gen:35:5">5</span> And they journeyed; and a terror of God was
upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue
after the sons of Jacob. <span id="an_gen:35:6">6</span> So Jacob came
to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan—the same is Beth-el—he and all
the people that were with him. <span id="an_gen:35:7">7</span> And he
built there an altar, and called the place  <span
id="fr_58"></span>[a](#fn_57) El-beth-el, because there God was revealed
unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. <span
id="an_gen:35:8">8</span> And Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was
buried below Beth-el under the oak; and the name of it was called  <span
id="fr_59"></span>[b](#fn_58) Allon-bacuth.

<span id="an_gen:35:9">9</span> And God appeared unto Jacob again, when
he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him. <span
id="an_gen:35:10">10</span> And God said unto him: 'Thy name is Jacob;
thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy
name'; and He called his name Israel. <span
id="an_gen:35:11">11</span> And God said unto him: 'I am God Almighty.
Be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of
thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; <span
id="an_gen:35:12">12</span> and the land which I gave unto Abraham and
Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give
the land.' <span id="an_gen:35:13">13</span> And God went up from him in
the place where He spoke with him. <span id="an_gen:35:14">14</span> And
Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He spoke with him, a pillar of
stone, and he poured out a drink-offering thereon, and poured oil
thereon. <span id="an_gen:35:15">15</span> And Jacob called the name of
the place where God spoke with him, Beth-el. <span
id="an_gen:35:16">16</span> And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there
was still some way to come to Ephrath; and Rachel travailed, and she had
hard labour. <span id="an_gen:35:17">17</span> And it came to pass, when
she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her: 'Fear not; for
this also is a son for thee.' <span id="an_gen:35:18">18</span> And it
came to pass, as her soul was in departing—for she died—that she called
his name  <span id="fr_60"></span>[c](#fn_59) Ben-oni; but his father
called him  <span id="fr_61"></span>[d](#fn_60) Benjamin. <span
id="an_gen:35:19">19</span> And Rachel died, and was buried in the way
to Ephrath—the same is Bethlehem. <span id="an_gen:35:20">20</span> And
Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave; the same is the pillar of Rachel's
grave unto this day. <span id="an_gen:35:21">21</span> And Israel
journeyed, and spread his tent beyond Migdal-eder. <span
id="an_gen:35:22">22</span> And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in
that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine;
and Israel heard of it.

Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: <span id="an_gen:35:23">23</span> the
sons of Leah: Reuben, <span id="page_44">p. 44</span> Jacob's
first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun;
<span id="an_gen:35:24">24</span> the sons of Rachel: Joseph and
Benjamin; <span id="an_gen:35:25">25</span> and the sons of Bilhah,
Rachel's handmaid: Dan and Naphtali; <span
id="an_gen:35:26">26</span> and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad
and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in
Paddan-aram. <span id="an_gen:35:27">27</span> And Jacob came unto Isaac
his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba—the same is Hebron—where Abraham
and Isaac sojourned. <span id="an_gen:35:28">28</span> And the days of
Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years. <span
id="an_gen:35:29">29</span> And Isaac expired, and died, and was
gathered unto his people, old and full of days; and Esau and Jacob his
sons buried him.
