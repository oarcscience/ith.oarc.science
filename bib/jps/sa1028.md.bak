### I SAMUEL CHAPTER 28

<span id="an_sa1:28:1">1</span> And it came to pass in those days, that
the Philistines gathered their hosts together for warfare, to fight with
Israel. And Achish said unto David: \`Know thou assuredly, that thou
shalt go out with me in the host, thou and thy men.' <span
id="an_sa1:28:2">2</span> And David said to Achish: \`Therefore thou
shalt know what thy servant will do.' And Achish said to David:
\`Therefore will I make thee keeper of my head for ever.'

<span id="an_sa1:28:3">3</span> Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had
lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul
had put away those that divined by a ghost or a familiar spirit out of
the land. <span id="an_sa1:28:4">4</span> And the Philistines gathered
themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem; and Saul gathered
all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa. <span
id="an_sa1:28:5">5</span> And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines,
he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. <span
id="an_sa1:28:6">6</span> And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD
answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets. <span
id="an_sa1:28:7">7</span> Then said Saul unto his servants: \`Seek me a
woman that divineth by a ghost, that I may go to her, and inquire of
her.' And his servants said to him: \`Behold, there is a woman that
divineth by a ghost at En-dor.'

<span id="an_sa1:28:8">8</span> And Saul disguised himself, and put on
other raiment, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the
woman by night; and he said: \`Divine unto me, I pray thee, by a ghost,
and bring me up whomsoever I shall name unto thee.' <span
id="an_sa1:28:9">9</span> And the woman said unto him: \`Behold, thou
knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that divine by a
ghost or a familiar spirit out of the land; wherefore then layest thou a
snare for my life, to cause me to die?' <span
id="an_sa1:28:10">10</span> And Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying:
\`As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this
thing.' <span id="an_sa1:28:11">11</span> Then said the woman: \`Whom
shall I bring up unto thee?' And he said: \`Bring me up Samuel.' <span
id="an_sa1:28:12">12</span> And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried
with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying: \`Why hast thou
deceived me? for thou art Saul.' <span id="an_sa1:28:13">13</span> And
the king said unto her: \`Be not afraid; for what seest thou?' And the
woman said unto Saul: \`I see a godlike being coming up out of the
earth.' <span id="an_sa1:28:14">14</span> And he said unto her:

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \`What form is he
of?' And she said: \`An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a
robe.' And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face
to the ground, and prostrated himself.

<span id="an_sa1:28:15">15</span> And Samuel said to Saul: \`Why hast
thou disquieted me, to bring me up?' And Saul answered: \`I am sore
distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed
from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams;
therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I
shall do.' <span id="an_sa1:28:16">16</span> And Samuel said:
\`Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from
thee, and is become thine adversary? <span
id="an_sa1:28:17">17</span> And the LORD hath wrought for Himself, as He
spoke by me; and the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and
given it to thy neighbour, even to David. <span
id="an_sa1:28:18">18</span> Because thou didst not hearken to the voice
of the LORD, and didst not execute His fierce wrath upon Amalek,
therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day. <span
id="an_sa1:28:19">19</span> Moreover the LORD will deliver Israel also
with thee into the hand of the Philistines; and to-morrow shalt thou and
thy sons be with me; the LORD will deliver the host of Israel also into
the hand of the Philistines.'

<span id="an_sa1:28:20">20</span> Then Saul fell straightway his full
length upon the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of
Samuel; and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all
the day, nor all the night. <span id="an_sa1:28:21">21</span> And the
woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore affrighted, and said unto
him: \`Behold, thy handmaid hath hearkened unto thy voice, and I have
put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou
spokest unto me. <span id="an_sa1:28:22">22</span> Now therefore, I pray
thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a
morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength,
when thou goest on thy way.' <span id="an_sa1:28:23">23</span> But he
refused, and said: \`I will not eat.' But his servants, together with
the woman, urged him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose
from the earth, and sat upon the bed. <span
id="an_sa1:28:24">24</span> And the woman had a fatted calf in the
house; and she made haste, and killed it; and she took flour, and
kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof; <span
id="an_sa1:28:25">25</span> and she brought it before Saul, and before
his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that
night.
