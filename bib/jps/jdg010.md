### JUDGES CHAPTER 10

<span id="an_jdg:10:1">1</span> And after Abimelech there arose to save
Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he
dwelt in Shamir in the hill-country of Ephraim. <span
id="an_jdg:10:2">2</span> And he judged Israel twenty and three years,
and died, and was buried in Shamir.

<span id="an_jdg:10:3">3</span> And after him arose Jair, the Gileadite;
and he judged Israel twenty and two years. <span
id="an_jdg:10:4">4</span> And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass
colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called  <span
id="fr_113"></span>[a](#fn_110.md) Havvoth-jair unto this day, which are in
the land of Gilead. <span id="an_jdg:10:5">5</span> And Jair died, and
was buried in Kamon.

<span id="an_jdg:10:6">6</span> And the children of Israel again did
that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and served the Baalim, and
the Ashtaroth, and the gods of Aram, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods
of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the
Philistines; and they forsook the LORD, and served Him not. <span
id="an_jdg:10:7">7</span> And the anger of the LORD was kindled against
Israel, and He gave them over into the hand of the Philistines, and into
the hand of the children of Ammon. <span id="an_jdg:10:8">8</span> And
they oppressed and crushed the children of Israel that year; eighteen
years \[oppressed they\] all the children of Israel that were beyond the
Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead. <span
id="an_jdg:10:9">9</span> And the children of Ammon passed over the
Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against
the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was sore distressed. <span
id="an_jdg:10:10">10</span> And the children of Israel cried unto the
LORD, saying: \`We have sinned against Thee, in that we have forsaken
our God, and have served the Baalim.' <span
id="an_jdg:10:11">11</span> And the LORD said unto the children of
Israel: \`Did not I save you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites,
from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines? <span
id="an_jdg:10:12">12</span> The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and
the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried unto Me, and I saved you out
of their hand. <span id="an_jdg:10:13">13</span> Yet ye have forsaken
Me, and served other gods; wherefore I will save you no more. <span
id="an_jdg:10:14">14</span> Go and cry unto the gods which ye have
chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress.' <span
id="an_jdg:10:15">15</span> And the children of Israel said unto the
LORD: \`We have sinned; do Thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto
Thee; only deliver us, we pray Thee, this day.' <span
id="an_jdg:10:16">16</span> And they put away the strange gods from
among them, and served the LORD; and His soul was grieved for the misery
of Israel.

<span id="an_jdg:10:17">17</span> Then the children of Ammon were
gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel
assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpah. <span
id="an_jdg:10:18">18</span> And the people, the princes of Gilead, said
one to another: \`What man is he that will begin to fight against the
children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.'
