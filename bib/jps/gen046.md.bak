### GENESIS CHAPTER 46

<span id="an_gen:46:1">1</span> And Israel took his journey with all
that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God
of his father Isaac. <span id="an_gen:46:2">2</span> And God spoke unto
Israel in the visions of the night, and said: 'Jacob, Jacob.' And he
said: 'Here am I.' <span id="an_gen:46:3">3</span> And <span
id="page_58">p. 58</span> He said: 'I am God, the God of thy father;
fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great
nation. <span id="an_gen:46:4">4</span> I will go down with thee into
Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again; and Joseph shall put
his hand upon thine eyes.' <span id="an_gen:46:5">5</span> And Jacob
rose up from Beer-sheba; and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their
father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which
Pharaoh had sent to carry him. <span id="an_gen:46:6">6</span> And they
took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of
Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him; <span
id="an_gen:46:7">7</span> his sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his
daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and all his seed brought he with him
into Egypt.

<span id="an_gen:46:8">8</span> And these are the names of the children
of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's
first-born. <span id="an_gen:46:9">9</span> And the sons of Reuben:
Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi. <span
id="an_gen:46:10">10</span> And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin,
and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish
woman. <span id="an_gen:46:11">11</span> And the sons of Levi: Gershon,
Kohath, and Merari. <span id="an_gen:46:12">12</span> And the sons of
Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan
died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
<span id="an_gen:46:13">13</span> And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and
Puvah, and Iob, and Shimron. <span id="an_gen:46:14">14</span> And the
sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel. <span
id="an_gen:46:15">15</span> These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore
unto Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah; all the souls of his
sons .and his daughters were thirty and three. <span
id="an_gen:46:16">16</span> And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi,
Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli. <span
id="an_gen:46:17">17</span> And the sons of Asher: Imnah, and Ishvah,
and Ishvi, and Beriah, and Serah their sister; and the sons of Beriah:
Heber, and Malchiel. <span id="an_gen:46:18">18</span> These are the
sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bore
unto Jacob, even sixteen souls. <span id="an_gen:46:19">19</span> The
sons of Rachel Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin. <span
id="an_gen:46:20">20</span> And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were
born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath the daughter of Poti-phera
priest of On bore unto him. <span id="an_gen:46:21">21</span> And the
sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi,
and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard. <span
id="an_gen:46:22">22</span> These are the sons of Rachel, who were born
to Jacob; all the souls were fourteen. <span
id="an_gen:46:23">23</span> And the sons of Dan: Hushim. <span
id="an_gen:46:24">24</span> And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni,
and Jezer, and Shillem. <span id="an_gen:46:25">25</span> These are the
sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and these she
bore unto Jacob; all the souls were seven. <span
id="an_gen:46:26">26</span> All the souls belonging to Jacob that came
into Egypt, that came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons’ wives, all
the souls were threescore and six. <span id="an_gen:46:27">27</span> And
the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls; all
the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were threescore
and ten.

<span id="an_gen:46:28">28</span> And he sent Judah before him unto
Joseph, to show the way before him unto Goshen; and they came into the
land of Goshen. <span id="an_gen:46:29">29</span> And Joseph made ready
his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and he
presented himself unto him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a
good while. <span id="an_gen:46:30">30</span> And Israel said unto
Joseph: 'Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, that thou art yet
alive.' <span id="an_gen:46:31">31</span> And Joseph said unto his
brethren, and unto his father's house: 'I will go up, and tell Pharaoh,
and will say <span id="page_59">p. 59</span> unto him: My brethren, and
my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;
<span id="an_gen:46:32">32</span> and the men are shepherds, for they
have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and
their herds, and all that they have. <span
id="an_gen:46:33">33</span> And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh
shall call you, and shall say: What is your occupation? <span
id="an_gen:46:34">34</span> that ye shall say: Thy servants have been
keepers of cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and our
fathers; that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is
an abomination unto the Egyptians.'
