### I Kings Chapter 3

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> <span
id="an_kg1:3:1">1</span> And Solomon became allied to Pharaoh king of
Egypt by marriage, and took

<span id="page_406">p. 406</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pharaoh's
daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an
end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall
of Jerusalem round about. <span id="an_kg1:3:2">2</span> Only the people
sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the
name of the LORD until those days. <span id="an_kg1:3:3">3</span> And
Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father;
only he sacrificed and offered in the high places.

<span id="an_kg1:3:4">4</span> And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice
there; for that was the great high place; a thousand burnt-offerings did
Solomon offer upon that altar. <span id="an_kg1:3:5">5</span> In Gibeon
the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said: \`Ask
what I shall give thee.' <span id="an_kg1:3:6">6</span> And Solomon
said: \`Thou hast shown unto Thy servant David my father great kindness,
according as he walked before Thee in truth, and in righteousness, and
in uprightness of heart with Thee; and Thou hast kept for him this great
kindness,' that Thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is
this day. <span id="an_kg1:3:7">7</span> And now, O LORD my God, Thou
hast made Thy servant king instead of David my father; and I am but a
little child; I know not how to go out or come in. <span
id="an_kg1:3:8">8</span> And Thy servant is in the midst of Thy people
which Thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor
counted for multitude. <span id="an_kg1:3:9">9</span> Give Thy servant
therefore an understanding heart to judge Thy people, that I may discern
between good and evil; for who is able to judge this Thy great people?'
<span id="an_kg1:3:10">10</span> And the speech pleased the Lord, that
Solomon had asked this thing. <span id="an_kg1:3:11">11</span> And God
said unto him: \`Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked
for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, norhast
asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself
understanding to discern justice; <span
id="an_kg1:3:12">12</span> behold, I have done according to thy word:
lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there
hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise
like unto thee. <span id="an_kg1:3:13">13</span> And I have also given
thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and honour—so that
there hath not been any among the kings like unto thee—all thy days.
<span id="an_kg1:3:14">14</span> And if thou wilt walk in My ways, to
keep My statutes and My commandments, as thy father David did walk, then
I will lengthen thy days.' <span id="an_kg1:3:15">15</span> And Solomon
awoke, and, behold, it was a dream; and he came to Jerusalem, and stood
before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up
burnt-offerings, and offered peace-offerings, and made a feast to all
his servants.

<span id="an_kg1:3:16">16</span> Then came there two women, that were
harlots, unto the king, and stood before him. <span
id="an_kg1:3:17">17</span> And the one woman said: \`Oh, my lord, I and
this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her
in the house. <span id="an_kg1:3:18">18</span> And it came to pass the
third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also; and
we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we
two in the house. <span id="an_kg1:3:19">19</span> And this woman's
child died in the night; because she overlay it. <span
id="an_kg1:3:20">20</span> And she arose at midnight, and took my son
from beside me, while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and
laid her dead child in my bosom. <span id="an_kg1:3:21">21</span> And
when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead;
but when I had looked well at it in the morning, behold, it was not my
son, whom I did bear.' <span id="an_kg1:3:22">22</span> And the other
woman said: \`Nay; but

<span id="page_407">p. 407</span>

the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said: \`No; but
the dead is thy son, and the living is my son.' Thus they spoke before
the king.

<span id="an_kg1:3:23">23</span> Then said the king: \`The one saith:
This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead; and the other
saith: Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.' <span
id="an_kg1:3:24">24</span> And the king said: \`Fetch me a sword.' And
they brought a sword before the king. <span
id="an_kg1:3:25">25</span> And the king said: \`Divide the living child
in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.' <span
id="an_kg1:3:26">26</span> Then spoke the woman whose the living child
was unto the king, for her heart yearned upon her son, and she said:
\`Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it.' But
the other said: \`It shall be neither mine nor thine; divide it.' <span
id="an_kg1:3:27">27</span> Then the king answered and said: \`Give her
the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.'
<span id="an_kg1:3:28">28</span> And all Israel heard of the judgment
which the king had judged; and they feared the king; for they saw that
the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice.
