### I SAMUEL CHAPTER 31

<span id="an_sa1:31:1">1</span> Now the Philistines fought against
Israel, and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell
down slain in mount [Mount](errata.htm#6.md) Gilboa. <span
id="an_sa1:31:2">2</span> And the Philistines followed hard

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and
Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul. <span
id="an_sa1:31:3">3</span> And the battle went sore against Saul, and the
archers overtook him; and he was in great anguish by reason of the
archers. <span id="an_sa1:31:4">4</span> Then said Saul to his
armour-bearer: \`Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest
these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and make a mock of me.'
But his armour-bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul
took his sword, and fell upon it. <span id="an_sa1:31:5">5</span> And
when his armour-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his
sword, and died with him. <span id="an_sa1:31:6">6</span> So Saul died,
and his three sons, and his armour-bearer, and all his men, that same
day together. <span id="an_sa1:31:7">7</span> And when the men of Israel
that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were beyond the
Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were
dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and
dwelt in them.

<span id="an_sa1:31:8">8</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, when
the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his
three sons fallen in mount [Mount](errata.htm#7.md) Gilboa. <span
id="an_sa1:31:9">9</span> And they cut off his head, and stripped off
his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to
carry the tidings unto the house of their idols, and to the people.
<span id="an_sa1:31:10">10</span> And they put his armour in the house
of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.
<span id="an_sa1:31:11">11</span> And when the inhabitants of
Jabesh-gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done
to Saul, <span id="an_sa1:31:12">12</span> all the valiant men arose,
and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons
from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them
there. <span id="an_sa1:31:13">13</span> And they took their bones, and
buried them under the tamarisk-tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
