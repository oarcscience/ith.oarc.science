### II Kings Chapter 12

<span id="an_kg2:12:1">1</span> Jehoash was seven years old when he
began to reign. <span id="an_kg2:12:2">2</span> In the seventh year of
Jehu began Jehoash to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem;
and his mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba. <span
id="an_kg2:12:3">3</span> And Jehoash did that which was right in the
eyes of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed
him. <span id="an_kg2:12:4">4</span> Howbeit the high places were not
taken away; the people still sacrificed and offered in the high places.

<span id="an_kg2:12:5">5</span> And Jehoash said to the priests: \`All
the money of the hallowed things that is brought into the house of the
LORD, in current money, the money of the persons for whom each man is
rated, all the money that it cometh into any man's heart to bring into

<span id="page_458">p. 458</span>

the house of the LORD, <span id="an_kg2:12:6">6</span> let the priests
take it to them, every man from him that bestoweth it upon him; and they
shall repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be
found.' <span id="an_kg2:12:7">7</span> But it was so, that in the three
and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the
breaches of the house. <span id="an_kg2:12:8">8</span> Then king Jehoash
called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the other priests, and said unto
them: \`Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore take
no longer money from them that bestow it upon you, but deliver it for
the breaches of the house.' <span id="an_kg2:12:9">9</span> And the
priests consented that they should take no longer money from the people,
neither repair the breaches of the house.

<span id="an_kg2:12:10">10</span> And Jehoiada the priest took a chest,
and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the
right side as one cometh into the house of the LORD; and the priests
that kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into
the house of the LORD. <span id="an_kg2:12:11">11</span> And it was so,
when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's
scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags and counted
the money that was found in the house of the LORD. <span
id="an_kg2:12:12">12</span> And they gave the money that was weighed out
into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the
house of the LORD; and they paid it out to the carpenters and the
builders, that wrought upon the house of the LORD, <span
id="an_kg2:12:13">13</span> and to the masons and the hewers of stone,
and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the breaches of the house
of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.
<span id="an_kg2:12:14">14</span> But there were not made for the house
of the LORD cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of
gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house
of the LORD; <span id="an_kg2:12:15">15</span> for they gave that to
them that did the work, and repaired therewith the house of the LORD.
<span id="an_kg2:12:16">16</span> Moreover they reckoned not with the
men, into whose hand they delivered the money to give to them that did
the work; for they dealt faithfully. <span
id="an_kg2:12:17">17</span> The forfeit money, and the sin money, was
not brought into the house of the LORD; it was the priests’.

<span id="an_kg2:12:18">18</span> Then Hazael king of Aram went up, and
fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to
Jerusalem. <span id="an_kg2:12:19">19</span> And Jehoash king of Judah
took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah,
his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things,
and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the
LORD, and of the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Aram; and
he went away from Jerusalem.

<span id="an_kg2:12:20">20</span> Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and
all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
the kings of Judah? <span id="an_kg2:12:21">21</span> And his servants
arose, and made a conspiracy, and smote Joash at Beth-millo, on the way
that goeth down to Silla. <span id="an_kg2:12:22">22</span> For Jozacar
the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants,
smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city
of David; and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
