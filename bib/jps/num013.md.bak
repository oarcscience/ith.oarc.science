### NUMBERS CHAPTER 13

‏שלח‎

<span id="an_num:13:1">1</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_num:13:2">2</span> \`Send thou men, that they may spy out
the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel; of every
tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a prince among
them.' <span id="an_num:13:3">3</span> And Moses sent them from the
wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of the LORD; all of
them men who were heads of the children of Israel. <span
id="an_num:13:4">4</span> And these were their names: of the tribe of
Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur. <span id="an_num:13:5">5</span> Of
the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. <span
id="an_num:13:6">6</span> Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of
Jephunneh. <span id="an_num:13:7">7</span> Of the tribe of Issachar,
Igal the son of Joseph. <span id="an_num:13:8">8</span> Of the tribe of
Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun. <span id="an_num:13:9">9</span> Of the
tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu. <span
id="an_num:13:10">10</span> Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of
Sodi. <span id="an_num:13:11">11</span> Of the tribe of Joseph, namely,
of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi. <span
id="an_num:13:12">12</span> Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of
Gemalli. <span id="an_num:13:13">13</span> Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur
the son of Michael. <span id="an_num:13:14">14</span> Of the tribe of
Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi. <span id="an_num:13:15">15</span> Of
the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. <span
id="an_num:13:16">16</span> These are the names of the men that Moses
sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.
<span id="an_num:13:17">17</span> And Moses sent them to spy out the
land of Canaan, and said unto them: \`Get you up here into the South,
and go up into the mountains; <span id="an_num:13:18">18</span> and see
the land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they
are strong or weak, whether they are few or many; <span
id="an_num:13:19">19</span> and what the land is that they dwell in,
whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in,
whether in camps, or in strongholds; <span
id="an_num:13:20">20</span> and what the land is, whether it is fat or
lean, whether there is wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage,
and bring of the fruit of the land.'—Now the time was the time of the
first-ripe grapes.— <span id="an_num:13:21">21</span> So they went up,
and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, at the
entrance to Hamath. <span id="an_num:13:22">22</span> And they went up
into the South, and came unto Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai,
the children of Anak, were there.—Now Hebron was built seven years
before Zoan in Egypt.— <span id="an_num:13:23">23</span> And they came
unto the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one
cluster of grapes, and they bore it upon a pole between two; they took
also of the pomegranates, and of the figs.— <span
id="an_num:13:24">24</span> That place was called the valley of  <span
id="fr_97"></span>[a](#fn_94.md) Eshcol, because of the cluster which the
children of Israel cut down from thence.— <span
id="an_num:13:25">25</span> And they returned from spying out the land
at the end of forty days. <span id="an_num:13:26">26</span> And they
went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the
children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought
back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the
fruit of the land. <span id="an_num:13:27">27</span> And they told him,
and said: \`We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it
floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it. <span
id="an_num:13:28">28</span> Howbeit the people that dwell in the land
are fierce, and the cities are fortified, and very great; and moreover
we saw the children of Anak there. <span
id="an_num:13:29">29</span> Amalek dwelleth in the land of the South;
and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the
mountains; and the Canaanite dwelleth by the sea, and along by the side
of the Jordan.' <span id="an_num:13:30">30</span> And Caleb stilled the
people toward Moses, and said: \`We should go up at once, and possess
it; for we are well able to

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

overcome it.' <span id="an_num:13:31">31</span> But the men that went up
with him said: \`We are not able to go up against the people; for they
are stronger than we.' <span id="an_num:13:32">32</span> And they spread
an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of
Israel, saying: \`The land, through which we have passed to spy it out,
is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people
that we saw in it are men of great stature. <span
id="an_num:13:33">33</span> And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of
Anak, who come of the Nephilim; and we were in our own sight as
grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.'
