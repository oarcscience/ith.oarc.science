### EXODUS CHAPTER 2

<span id="an_exo:2:1">1</span> And there went a man of the house of
Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi. <span
id="an_exo:2:2">2</span> And the woman conceived, and bore a son; and
when she saw him that he was a goodly child, <span id="page_66">p.
66</span> she hid him three months. <span id="an_exo:2:3">3</span> And
when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of
bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the
child therein, and laid it in the flags by the river's brink. <span
id="an_exo:2:4">4</span> And his sister stood afar off, to know what
would be done to him. <span id="an_exo:2:6">6</span> And the daughter of
Pharaoh came down to bathe in the river; and her maidens walked along by
the river-side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her
handmaid to fetch it. <span id="an_exo:2:6">6</span> And she opened it,
and saw it, even the child; and behold a boy that wept. And she had
compassion on him, and said: 'This is one of the Hebrews' children.'
<span id="an_exo:2:7">7</span> Then said his sister to Pharaoh's
daughter: 'Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that
she may nurse the child for thee?' <span id="an_exo:2:8">8</span> And
Pharaoh's daughter said to her: 'Go.' And the maiden went and called the
child's mother. <span id="an_exo:2:9">9</span> And Pharaoh's daughter
said unto her: 'Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will
give thee thy wages.' And the woman took the child, and nursed it. <span
id="an_exo:2:10">10</span> And the child grew, and she brought him unto
Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name
 <span id="fr_73"></span>[a](#fn_72.md) Moses, and said: 'Because I  <span
id="fr_74"></span>[b](#fn_73.md) drew him out of the water.'

<span id="an_exo:2:11">11</span> And it came to pass in those days, when
Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on
their burdens; and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his
brethren. <span id="an_exo:2:12">12</span> And he looked this way and
that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian,
and hid him in the sand. <span id="an_exo:2:13">13</span> And he went
out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving
together; and he said to him that did the wrong: 'Wherefore smitest thou
thy fellow?' <span id="an_exo:2:14">14</span> And he said: 'Who made
thee a ruler and a judge over us? thinkest thou to kill me, as thou
didst kill the Egyptian?' And Moses feared, and said: 'Surely the thing
is known.' <span id="an_exo:2:15">15</span> Now when Pharaoh heard this
thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh,
and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well. <span
id="an_exo:2:16">16</span> Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters;
and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their
father's flock. <span id="an_exo:2:17">17</span> And the shepherds came
and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered
their flock. <span id="an_exo:2:18">18</span> And when they came to
Reuel their father, he said: 'How is it that ye are come so soon
to-day?' <span id="an_exo:2:19">19</span> And they said: 'An Egyptian
delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew
water for us, and watered the flock.' <span
id="an_exo:2:20">20</span> And he said unto his daughters: 'And where is
he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat
bread.' <span id="an_exo:2:21">21</span> And Moses was content to dwell
with the man; and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. <span
id="an_exo:2:22">22</span> And she bore a son, and he called' his name
Gershom; for he said: 'I have been  <span id="fr_75"></span>[c](#fn_74.md)
a stranger in a strange land.'

<span id="an_exo:2:23">23</span> And it came to pass in the course of
those many days that the king of Egypt died; and the children of Israel
sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up
unto God by reason of the bondage. <span id="an_exo:2:24">24</span> And
God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham,
with Isaac, and with Jacob. <span id="an_exo:2:25">25</span> And God saw
the children of Israel, and God took cognizance of them.
