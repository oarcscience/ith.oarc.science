### NUMBERS CHAPTER 30

<span id="an_num:30:1">1</span> And Moses told the children of Israel
according to all that the LORD commanded Moses.

‏מטו.ט‎

<span id="an_num:30:2">2</span> And Moses spoke unto the heads of the
tribes of the children of Israel, saying:

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded. <span
id="an_num:30:3">3</span> When a man voweth a vow unto the LORD, or
sweareth an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his
word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.
<span id="an_num:30:4">4</span> Also when a woman voweth a vow unto the
LORD, and bindeth herself by a bond, being in her father's house, in her
youth, <span id="an_num:30:5">5</span> and her father heareth her vow,
or her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father holdeth
his peace at her, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond
wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. <span
id="an_num:30:6">6</span> But if her father disallow her in the day that
he heareth, none of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound
her soul, shall stand; and the LORD will forgive her, because her father
disallowed her. <span id="an_num:30:7">7</span> And if she be married to
a husband, while her vows are upon her, or the clear utterance of her
lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul; <span
id="an_num:30:8">8</span> and her husband hear it, whatsoever day it be
that he heareth it, and hold his peace at her; then her vows shall
stand, and her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.
<span id="an_num:30:9">9</span> But if her husband disallow her in the
day that he heareth it, then he shall make void her vow which is upon
her, and the clear utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her
soul; and the LORD will forgive her. <span
id="an_num:30:10">10</span> But the vow of a widow, or of her that is
divorced, even every thing wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall
stand against her. <span id="an_num:30:11">11</span> And if a woman
vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath,
<span id="an_num:30:12">12</span> and her husband heard it, and held his
peace at her, and disallowed her not, then all her vows shall stand, and
every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. <span
id="an_num:30:13">13</span> But if her husband make them null and void
in the day that he heareth them, then whatsoever proceeded out of her
lips, whether it were her vows, or the bond of her soul, shall not
stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD will forgive her.
<span id="an_num:30:14">14</span> Every vow, and every binding oath to
afflict the soul, her husband may let it stand, or her husband may make
it void. <span id="an_num:30:15">15</span> But if her husband altogether
hold his peace at her from day to day, then he causeth all her vows to
stand, or all her bonds, which are upon her; he hath let them stand,
because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them. <span
id="an_num:30:16">16</span> But if he shall make them null and void
after that he hath heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity. <span
id="an_num:30:17">17</span> These are the statutes, which the LORD
commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his
daughter, being in her youth, in her father's house.
