### GENESIS CHAPTER 21

<span id="an_gen:21:1">1</span> And the LORD remembered Sarah as He had
said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as He had spoken. <span
id="an_gen:21:2">2</span> And Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in
his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. <span
id="an_gen:21:3">3</span> And Abraham called the name of his son that
was born unto him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac. <span
id="an_gen:21:4">4</span> And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he
was eight days old, as God had commanded him. <span
id="an_gen:21:5">5</span> And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his
son Isaac was' born unto him. <span id="an_gen:21:6">6</span> And Sarah
said: 'God hath made laughter for me; every one that heareth will laugh
on account of me.' <span id="an_gen:21:7">7</span> And she said: 'Who
would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should give children suck? for
I have borne him a son in his old age.'

<span id="an_gen:21:8">8</span> And the child grew, and was weaned. And
Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. <span
id="an_gen:21:9">9</span> And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian,
whom she had borne unto Abraham, making sport. <span
id="an_gen:21:10">10</span> Wherefore she said unto Abraham: 'Cast out
this bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman shall not be
heir with my son, even with Isaac.' <span
id="an_gen:21:11">11</span> And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's
sight on account of his son. <span id="an_gen:21:12">12</span> And God
said unto Abraham: 'Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the
lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah saith unto thee,
hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall seed be called to thee. <span
id="an_gen:21:13">13</span> And also of the son of the bondwoman will I
make a nation, because he is thy seed.' <span
id="an_gen:21:14">14</span> And Abraham rose up early in the morning,
and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it
on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away; and she departed, and
strayed in the wilderness of Beer-sheba. <span
id="an_gen:21:15">15</span> And the water in the bottle was spent, and
she cast the child under one of the shrubs. <span
id="an_gen:21:16">16</span> And she went, and sat her down over against
him a good way off, as it were a bowshot; for she said: 'Let me not look
upon the death of the child.' And she sat over against him, and lifted
up her voice, and wept. <span id="an_gen:21:17">17</span> And God heard
the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of
heaven, and said unto her: 'What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God
hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. <span
id="an_gen:21:18">18</span> Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him fast by
thy hand; for I will make him a great nation.' <span
id="an_gen:21:19">19</span> And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well
of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the
lad drink. <span id="an_gen:21:20">20</span> And God was with the lad,
and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. <span
id="an_gen:21:21">21</span> And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran; and
his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.

<span id="an_gen:21:22">22</span> And it came to pass at that time, that
Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spoke unto Abraham, saying:
'God is with thee in all that thou doest. <span
id="an_gen:21:23">23</span> Now therefore swear unto me here by God that
thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's
son; but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou
shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.' <span
id="an_gen:21:24">24</span> And Abraham said: 'I will swear.' <span
id="an_gen:21:25">25</span> And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of
the well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
<span id="an_gen:21:26">26</span> And Abimelech said: 'I know not <span
id="page_24">p. 24</span> who hath done this thing; neither didst thou
tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to-day.' <span
id="an_gen:21:27">27</span> And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave
them unto Abimelech; and they two made a covenant. <span
id="an_gen:21:28">28</span> And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock
by themselves. <span id="an_gen:21:29">29</span> And Abimelech said unto
Abraham: 'What mean these seven ewe-lambs which thou hast set by
themselves?' <span id="an_gen:21:30">30</span> And he said: 'Verily,
these seven ewe-lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a
witness unto me, that I have digged this well.' <span
id="an_gen:21:31">31</span> Wherefore that place was called Beer-sheba;
because there they swore both of them. <span
id="an_gen:21:32">32</span> So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba; and
Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned
into the land of the Philistines. <span id="an_gen:21:33">33</span> And
Abraham planted a tamarisk-tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the
name of the LORD, the Everlasting God. <span
id="an_gen:21:34">34</span> And Abraham sojourned in the land of the
Philistines many days.
