### GENESIS CHAPTER 34

<span id="an_gen:34:1">1</span> And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she
had borne unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. <span
id="an_gen:34:2">2</span> And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the
prince of the land, saw her; and he took her, and lay with her, and
humbled her. <span id="an_gen:34:3">3</span> And his soul did cleave
unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spoke
comfortingly unto the damsel. <span id="an_gen:34:4">4</span> And
Shechem spoke unto his father <span id="page_42">p. 42</span> Hamor,
saying: 'Get me this damsel to wife.' <span
id="an_gen:34:5">5</span> Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his
daughter; and his sons were with his cattle in the field; and Jacob held
his peace until they came. <span id="an_gen:34:6">6</span> And Hamor the
father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to speak with him. <span
id="an_gen:34:7">7</span> And the sons of Jacob came in from the field
when they heard it; and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth,
because he had wrought a vile deed in Israel in lying with Jacob's
daughter; which thing ought not to be done. <span
id="an_gen:34:8">8</span> And Hamor spoke with them, saying: 'The soul
of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter. I pray you give her unto
him to wife. <span id="an_gen:34:9">9</span> And make ye marriages with
us; give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you. <span
id="an_gen:34:10">10</span> And ye shall dwell with us; and the land
shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions
therein.' <span id="an_gen:34:11">11</span> And Shechem said unto her
father and unto her brethren: 'Let me find favour in your eyes, and what
ye shall say unto me I will give. <span id="an_gen:34:12">12</span> Ask
me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall
say unto me; but give me the damsel to wife.' <span
id="an_gen:34:13">13</span> And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and
Hamor his father with guile, and spoke, because he had defiled Dinah
their sister, <span id="an_gen:34:14">14</span> and said unto them: 'We
cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised;
for that were a reproach unto us. <span id="an_gen:34:15">15</span> Only
on this condition will we consent unto you: if ye will be as we are,
that every male of you be circumcised; <span
id="an_gen:34:16">16</span> then will we give our daughters unto you,
and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and
we will become one people. <span id="an_gen:34:17">17</span> But if ye
will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our
daughter, and we will be gone.' <span id="an_gen:34:18">18</span> And
their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son. <span
id="an_gen:34:19">19</span> And the young man deferred not to do the
thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter. And he was honoured
above all the house of his father. <span id="an_gen:34:20">20</span> And
Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and spoke
with the men of their city, saying: <span
id="an_gen:34:21">21</span> 'These men are peaceable with us; therefore
let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for, behold, the land is
large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and
let us give them our daughters. <span id="an_gen:34:22">22</span> Only
on this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us, to
become one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are
circumcised. <span id="an_gen:34:23">23</span> Shall not their cattle
and their substance and all their beasts be ours? only let us consent
unto them, and they will dwell with us.' <span
id="an_gen:34:24">24</span> And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son
hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was
circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city. <span
id="an_gen:34:25">25</span> And it came to pass on the third day, when
they were in pain, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi,
Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city
unawares, and slew all the males. <span id="an_gen:34:26">26</span> And
they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took
Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went forth. <span
id="an_gen:34:27">27</span> The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and
spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister. <span
id="an_gen:34:28">28</span> They took their flocks and their herds and
their asses, and that which was in the city and that which was in the
field; <span id="an_gen:34:29">29</span> and all their wealth, and all
their little ones and their wives, took they captive <span
id="page_43">p. 43</span> and spoiled, even all that was in the house.
<span id="an_gen:34:30">30</span> And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi: 'Ye
have troubled me, to make me odious unto the inhabitants of the land,
even unto the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and, I being few in number,
they will gather themselves together against me and smite me; and I
shall be destroyed, I and my house.' <span
id="an_gen:34:31">31</span> And they said: 'Should one deal with our
sister as with a harlot?'
