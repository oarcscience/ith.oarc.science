### DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER 12

<span id="an_deu:12:1">1</span> These are the statutes and the
ordinances, which ye shall observe to do in the land which the LORD, the
God of thy fathers, hath given thee to possess it, all the days that ye
live upon the earth. <span id="an_deu:12:2">2</span> Ye shall surely
destroy all the places, wherein the nations that ye are to dispossess
served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and
under every leafy tree. <span id="an_deu:12:3">3</span> And ye shall
break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn
their Asherim with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of
their gods; and ye shall destroy their name out of that place. <span
id="an_deu:12:4">4</span> Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.
<span id="an_deu:12:5">5</span> But unto the place which the LORD your
God shall choose out of all your tribes to put His name there, even unto
His habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come; <span
id="an_deu:12:6">6</span> and thither ye shall bring your
burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the offering
of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill-offerings, and the
firstlings of your herd and of your flock; <span
id="an_deu:12:7">7</span> and there ye shall eat before the LORD your
God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your
households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee. <span
id="an_deu:12:8">8</span> Ye shall not do after all that we do here this
day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes; <span
id="an_deu:12:9">9</span> for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to
the inheritance, which the LORD your God giveth thee. <span
id="an_deu:12:10">10</span> But when ye go over the Jordan, and dwell in
the land which the LORD your God causeth you to inherit, and He giveth
you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;
<span id="an_deu:12:11">11</span> then it shall come to pass that the
place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause His name to dwell
there, thither shall ye bring all that I command you: your
burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the offering of
your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD. <span
id="an_deu:12:12">12</span> And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your
God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and
your maid-servants, and the Levite that is within your gates, forasmuch
as he hath no portion nor inheritance with you. <span
id="an_deu:12:13">13</span> Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy
burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest; <span
id="an_deu:12:14">14</span> but in the place which the LORD shall choose
in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, and
there thou shalt do all that I command thee.

<span id="an_deu:12:15">15</span> Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and
eat flesh within all thy gates, after all the desire of thy soul,
according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which He hath given thee;
the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the gazelle, and as of
the hart.

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> <span
id="an_deu:12:16">16</span> Only ye shall not eat the blood; thou shalt
pour it out upon the earth as water. <span
id="an_deu:12:17">17</span> Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the
tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thine oil, or the firstlings of
thy herd or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy
freewill-offerings, nor the offering of thy hand; <span
id="an_deu:12:18">18</span> but thou shalt eat them before the LORD thy
God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son,
and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maid-servant, and the
Levite that is within thy gates; and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD
thy God in all that thou puttest thy hand unto. <span
id="an_deu:12:19">19</span> Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not
the Levite as long as thou livest upon thy land.

<span id="an_deu:12:20">20</span> When the LORD thy God shall enlarge
thy border, as He hath promised thee, and thou shalt say: \`I will eat
flesh', because thy soul desireth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh,
after all the desire of thy soul. <span id="an_deu:12:21">21</span> If
the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to put His name there be
too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock,
which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt
eat within thy gates, after all the desire of thy soul. <span
id="an_deu:12:22">22</span> Howbeit as the gazelle and as the hart is
eaten, so thou shalt eat thereof; the unclean and the clean may eat
thereof alike. <span id="an_deu:12:23">23</span> Only be stedfast in not
eating the blood; for the blood is the life; and thou shalt not eat the
life with the flesh. <span id="an_deu:12:24">24</span> Thou shalt not
eat it; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water. <span
id="an_deu:12:25">25</span> Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well
with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that
which is right in the eyes of the LORD. <span
id="an_deu:12:26">26</span> Only thy holy things which thou hast, and
thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall
choose; <span id="an_deu:12:27">27</span> and thou shalt offer thy
burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy
God; and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out against the
altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh. <span
id="an_deu:12:28">28</span> Observe and hear all these words which I
command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after
thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the eyes
of the LORD thy God.

<span id="an_deu:12:29">29</span> When the LORD thy God shall cut off
the nations from before thee, whither thou goest in to dispossess them,
and thou dispossessest them, and dwellest in their land; <span
id="an_deu:12:30">30</span> take heed to thyself that thou be not
ensnared to follow them, after that they are destroyed from before thee;
and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying: \`How used these
nations to serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.' <span
id="an_deu:12:31">31</span> Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God;
for every abomination to the LORD, which He hateth, have they done unto
their gods; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the
fire to their gods.
