### EXODUS CHAPTER 5

<span id="an_exo:5:1">1</span> And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and
said unto Pharaoh: Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Let My people
go, that they may hold a feast unto Me in the wilderness.' <span
id="an_exo:5:2">2</span> And Pharaoh said: 'Who is the LORD, that I
should hearken unto His voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, and
moreover I will not let Israel go.' <span id="an_exo:5:3">3</span> And
they said: 'The God of the Hebrews hath met with us. Let us go, we pray
thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice unto the
LORD our God; lest He fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.'
<span id="an_exo:5:4">4</span> And the king of Egypt said unto them:
'Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, cause the people to break loose from
their work? get you unto your burdens.' <span
id="an_exo:5:5">5</span> And Pharaoh said: 'Behold, the people of the
land are now many, and will ye make them rest from their burdens?' <span
id="an_exo:5:6">6</span> And the same day Pharaoh commanded the
taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying: <span
id="an_exo:5:7">7</span> 'Ye shall no more give the people straw to make
brick, as heretofore. Let them go and gather straw for themselves. <span
id="an_exo:5:8">8</span> And the tale of the bricks, which they did make
heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof;
for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying: Let us go and sacrifice
to our God. <span id="an_exo:5:9">9</span> Let heavier work be laid upon
the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard lying
words.' <span id="an_exo:5:10">10</span> And the taskmasters of the
people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people,
saying: 'Thus saith Pharaoh: I will not give you straw. <span
id="an_exo:5:11">11</span> Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can
find it; for nought <span id="page_70">p. 70</span> of your work shall
be diminished.' <span id="an_exo:5:12">12</span> So the people were
scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for
straw. <span id="an_exo:5:13">13</span> And the taskmasters were urgent,
saying: 'Fulfil your work, your daily task, as when there was straw.'
<span id="an_exo:5:14">14</span> And the officers of the children of
Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten,
saying: 'Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your appointed task in making
brick both yesterday and to-day as heretofore?' <span
id="an_exo:5:15">15</span> Then the officers of the children of Israel
came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying: 'Wherefore dealest thou thus with
thy servants? <span id="an_exo:5:16">16</span> There is no straw given
unto thy servants, and they say to us: Make brick; and, behold, thy
servants are beaten, but the fault is in thine own people.' <span
id="an_exo:5:17">17</span> But he said: 'Ye are idle, ye are idle;
therefore ye say: Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD. <span
id="an_exo:5:18">18</span> Go therefore now, and work; for there shall
no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks. <span
id="an_exo:5:19">19</span> And the officers of the children of Israel
did see that they were set on mischief, when they said: 'Ye shall not
diminish aught from your bricks, your daily task.' <span
id="an_exo:5:20">20</span> And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in
the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh; <span
id="an_exo:5:21">21</span> and they said unto them: 'The LORD look upon
you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the
eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in
their hand to slay us.' <span id="an_exo:5:22">22</span> And Moses
returned unto the LORD, and said: 'Lord, wherefore hast Thou dealt ill
with this people? why is it that Thou hast sent me? <span
id="an_exo:5:23">23</span> For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Thy
name, he hath dealt ill with this people; neither hast Thou delivered
Thy people at all.'
