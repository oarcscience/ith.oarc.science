<p><A NAME="an_sa2:5:1">1</A>&nbsp; Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spoke, saying: `Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. <A NAME="an_sa2:5:2">2</A>&nbsp; In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was thou that didst lead out and bring in Israel; and the LORD said to thee: Thou shalt feed My people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.' <A NAME="an_sa2:5:3">3</A>&nbsp; So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_sa2:5:4">4</A>&nbsp; David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. <A NAME="an_sa2:5:5">5</A>&nbsp; In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_sa2:5:6">6</A>&nbsp; And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke unto David, saying: `Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither'; thinking: `David cannot come in hither.' <A NAME="an_sa2:5:7">7</A>&nbsp; Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David. <A NAME="an_sa2:5:8">8</A>&nbsp; And David said on that day: `Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites, and getteth up to the gutter, and [taketh away] the lame and the blind, that are hated of David's soul&#8212;.' Wherefore they say: `There are the blind and the lame; he cannot come into the house.' <A NAME="an_sa2:5:9">9</A>&nbsp; And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward. <A NAME="an_sa2:5:10">10</A>&nbsp; And David waxed greater and greater; for the LORD, the God of hosts, was with him.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_sa2:5:11">11</A>&nbsp; And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house. <A NAME="an_sa2:5:12">12</A>&nbsp; And David perceived that the Lord had established him king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for His people Israel's sake.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_sa2:5:13">13</A>&nbsp; And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David. <A NAME="an_sa2:5:14">14</A>&nbsp; And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon; <A NAME="an_sa2:5:15">15</A>&nbsp; and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia; <A NAME="an_sa2:5:16">16</A>&nbsp; and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_sa2:5:17">17</A>&nbsp; And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold. <A NAME="an_sa2:5:18">18</A>&nbsp; Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. <A NAME="an_sa2:5:19">19</A>&nbsp; And David inquired of the LORD, saying: `Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt Thou deliver them into my hand?' And the LORD said unto David: `Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thy hand.' <A NAME="an_sa2:5:20">20</A>&nbsp; And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said: `The LORD hath broken mine enemies before me, like the breach of waters.' Therefore the name of that place was called &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>
Baal-perazim. <A NAME="an_sa2:5:21">21</A>&nbsp; And they left their images there, and David and his men took them away.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_sa2:5:22">22</A>&nbsp; And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. <A NAME="an_sa2:5:23">23</A>&nbsp; And when David inquired of the LORD, He said: `Thou shalt not go up; make a circuit behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees. <A NAME="an_sa2:5:24">24</A>&nbsp; And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then is the LORD gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.' <A NAME="an_sa2:5:25">25</A>&nbsp; And David did so, as the LORD commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gezer.</p>
