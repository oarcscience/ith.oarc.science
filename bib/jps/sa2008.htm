<p><A NAME="an_sa2:8:1">1</A>&nbsp; And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them; and David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_sa2:8:2">2</A>&nbsp; And he smote Moab, and measured them with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. And the Moabites became servants to David, and brought presents.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_sa2:8:3">3</A>&nbsp; David smote also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to establish his dominion at the river Euphrates. <A NAME="an_sa2:8:4">4</A>&nbsp; And David took from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots. <A NAME="an_sa2:8:5">5</A>&nbsp; And when the Arameans of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Arameans two and twenty thousand men. <A NAME="an_sa2:8:6">6</A>&nbsp; Then David put garrisons in Aram of Damascus; and the Arameans became servants to David, and brought presents. And the LORD gave victory to David whithersoever he went. <A NAME="an_sa2:8:7">7</A>&nbsp; And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. <A NAME="an_sa2:8:8">8</A>&nbsp; And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_sa2:8:9">9</A>&nbsp; And when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer, <A NAME="an_sa2:8:10">10</A>&nbsp; then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him&#8212;because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him; for Hadadezer had wars with Toi&#8212;and he brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass. <A NAME="an_sa2:8:11">11</A>&nbsp; These also did king David dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued: <A NAME="an_sa2:8:12">12</A>&nbsp; of Aram, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. <A NAME="an_sa2:8:13">13</A>&nbsp; And David got him a name when he returned from smiting the Arameans in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men. <A NAME="an_sa2:8:14">14</A>&nbsp; And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the LORD gave victory to David whithersoever he went. </p>  
<p><A NAME="an_sa2:8:15">15</A>&nbsp; And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness unto all his people. <A NAME="an_sa2:8:16">16</A>&nbsp; And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; <A NAME="an_sa2:8:17">17</A>&nbsp; and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was scribe; <A NAME="an_sa2:8:18">18</A>&nbsp; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief ministers.</p>
