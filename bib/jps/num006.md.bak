### NUMBERS CHAPTER 6

<span id="an_num:6:1">1</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_num:6:2">2</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, and
say unto them:

When either man or woman shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a
Nazirite, to consecrate himself unto the LORD, <span
id="an_num:6:3">3</span> he shall abstain from wine and strong drink: he
shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither
shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried.
<span id="an_num:6:4">4</span> All the days of his Naziriteship shall he
eat nothing that is made of the grape-vine, from the pressed grapes even
to the grape-stone. <span id="an_num:6:5">5</span> All the days of his
vow of Naziriteship there shall no razor come upon his head; until the
days be fulfilled, in which he consecrateth himself unto the LORD, he
shall be holy, he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.
<span id="an_num:6:6">6</span> All the days that he consecrateth himself
unto the LORD he shall not come near to a dead body. <span
id="an_num:6:7">7</span> He shall not make himself unclean for his
father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister when they
die; because his consecration unto God is upon his head. <span
id="an_num:6:8">8</span> All the days of his Naziriteship he is holy
unto the LORD. <span id="an_num:6:9">9</span> And if any man die very
suddenly beside him, and he defile his consecrated head, then he shall
shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he
shave it. <span id="an_num:6:10">10</span> And on the eighth day he
shall bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the
door of the tent of meeting. <span id="an_num:6:11">11</span> And the
priest shall prepare one for a sin-offering, and the <span
id="page_167">p. 167</span> other for a burnt-offering, and make
atonement for him, for that he sinned by reason of the dead; and he
shall hallow his head that same day. <span
id="an_num:6:12">12</span> And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the
days of his Naziriteship, and shall bring a he-lamb of the first year
for a guilt-offering; but the former days shall be void, because his
consecration was defiled.

<span id="an_num:6:13">13</span> And this is the law of the Nazirite,
when the days of his consecration are fulfilled: he shall  <span
id="fr_94"></span>[a](#fn_91.md) bring it unto the door of the tent of
meeting; <span id="an_num:6:14">14</span> and he shall present his
offering unto the LORD, one he-lamb of the first year without blemish
for a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb of the first year without blemish
for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for peace-offerings,
<span id="an_num:6:15">15</span> and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes
of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil,
and their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings. <span
id="an_num:6:16">16</span> And the priest shall bring them before the
LORD, and shall offer his sin-offering, and his burnt-offering. <span
id="an_num:6:17">17</span> And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of
peace-offerings unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread; the
priest shall offer also the meal-offering thereof, and the
drink-offering thereof. <span id="an_num:6:18">18</span> And the
Nazirite shall shave his consecrated head at the door of the tent of
meeting, and shall take the hair of his consecrated head, and put it on
the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace-offerings. <span
id="an_num:6:19">19</span> And the priest shall take the shoulder of the
ram when it is sodden, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and
one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazirite,
after he hath shaven his consecrated head. <span
id="an_num:6:20">20</span> And the priest shall wave them for a
wave-offering before the LORD; this is holy for the priest, together
with the breast of waving and the thigh of heaving; and after that

the Nazirite may drink wine. <span id="an_num:6:21">21</span> This is
the law of the Nazirite who voweth, and of his offering unto the LORD
for his Naziriteship, beside that for which his means suffice; according
to his vow which he voweth, so he must do after the law of his
Naziriteship.

<span id="an_num:6:22">22</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_num:6:23">23</span> 'Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons,
saying: On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel; ye shall say
unto them:

<span id="an_num:6:24">24</span> The LORD bless thee, and keep thee;  
<span id="an_num:6:25">25</span> The LORD make His face to shine upon
thee, and be gracious unto thee;  
<span id="an_num:6:26">26</span> The LORD lift up His countenance upon
thee, and give thee peace.  
<span id="an_num:6:27">27</span> So shall they put My name upon the
children of Israel, and I will bless them.'
