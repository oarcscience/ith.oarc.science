### II SAMUEL CHAPTER 22

<span id="an_sa2:22:1">1</span>  And David spoke unto the LORD the words
of this song in the day that the LORD delivered him out of the hand of
all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul; <span
id="an_sa2:22:2">2</span>  and he said:

The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;  
<span id="an_sa2:22:3">3</span>  The God who is my rock, in Him I take
refuge;  
My shield, and my horn of salvation, my high tower, and my refuge;  
My saviour, Thou savest me from violence.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:4">4</span>  Praised, I cry, is the LORD,  
And I am saved from mine enemies.

<span id="an_sa2:22:5">5</span>  For the waves of Death compassed me,  
The floods of  <span id="fr_135"></span>[a](#fn_132) Belial assailed
me.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:6">6</span>  The cords of  <span
id="fr_136"></span>[a](#fn_132) Sheol surrounded me;  
The snares of Death confronted me.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:7">7</span>  In my distress I called upon the
LORD,  
Yea, I called unto my God;  
And out of His temple He heard my voice,  
And my cry did enter into His ears.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:8">8</span>  Then the earth did shake and quake,  
The foundations of heaven did tremble;  
They were shaken, because He was wroth.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:9">9</span>  Smoke arose up in His nostrils,  
And fire out of His mouth did devour;  
Coals flamed forth from Him.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:10">10</span>  He bowed the heavens also, and came
down;  
And thick darkness was under His feet.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:11">11</span>  And He rode upon a cherub, and did
fly;  
Yea, He was seen upon the wings of the wind.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:12">12</span>  And He made darkness pavilions round
about Him,  
Gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:13">13</span>  At the brightness before Him  
Coals of fire flamed forth.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:14">14</span>  The LORD thundered from heaven,  
And the Most High gave forth His voice.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:15">15</span>  And He sent out arrows, and scattered
them;  
Lightning, and discomfited them.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:16">16</span>  And the channels of the sea
appeared,  
The foundations of the world were laid bare,  
By the rebuke of the LORD,  
At the blast of the breath of His nostrils.

<span id="an_sa2:22:17">17</span>  He sent from on high, He took me;  
He drew me out of many waters;  
<span id="an_sa2:22:18">18</span>  He delivered me from mine enemy most
strong,  
&gt;From them that hated me, for they were too mighty for me.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:19">19</span>  They confronted me in the day of my
calamity;  
But the LORD was a stay unto me. <span id="page_396">p. 396</span>  
<span id="an_sa2:22:20">20</span>  He brought me forth also into a large
place;  
He delivered me, because He delighted in me.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:21">21</span>  The LORD rewarded me according to my
righteousness;  
According to the cleanness of my hands hath He recompensed me.

<span id="an_sa2:22:22">22</span>  For I have kept the ways of the
LORD,  
And have not wickedly departed from my God.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:23">23</span>  For all His ordinances were before
me;  
And as for His statutes, I did not depart from them.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:24">24</span>  And I was single-hearted toward
Him,  
And I kept myself from mine iniquity.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:25">25</span>  Therefore hath the LORD recompensed
me according to my righteousness,  
According to my cleanness in His eyes.

<span id="an_sa2:22:26">26</span>  With the merciful Thou dost show
Thyself merciful,  
With the upright man Thou dost show Thyself upright;  
<span id="an_sa2:22:27">27</span>  With the pure Thou dost show Thyself
pure;  
And with the crooked Thou dost show Thyself subtle.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:28">28</span>  And the afflicted people Thou dost
save;  
But Thine eyes are upon the haughty,  
that Thou mayest humble them.

<span id="an_sa2:22:29">29</span>  For Thou art my lamp, O LORD;  
And the LORD doth lighten my darkness.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:30">30</span>  For by Thee I run upon a troop;  
By my God do I scale a wall.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:31">31</span>  As for God, His way is perfect;  
The word of the LORD is tried;  
He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in Him.

<span id="an_sa2:22:32">32</span>  For who is God, save the LORD?  
And who is a Rock, save our God?  
<span id="an_sa2:22:33">33</span>  The God who is my strong fortress,  
And who letteth my way go forth straight;  
<span id="an_sa2:22:34">34</span>  Who maketh my feet like hinds',  
And setteth me upon my high places;  
<span id="an_sa2:22:35">35</span>  Who traineth my hands for war,  
So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:36">36</span>  Thou hast also given me Thy shield of
salvation;  
And Thy condescension hath made me great.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:37">37</span>  Thou hast enlarged my steps under
me,  
And my feet have not slipped.

<span id="an_sa2:22:38">38</span>  I have pursued mine enemies, and
destroyed them;  
Neither did I turn back till they were consumed.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:39">39</span>  And I have consumed them, and smitten
them through, that they cannot arise;  
Yea, they are fallen under my feet.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:40">40</span>  For Thou hast girded me with strength
unto the battle;  
Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:41">41</span>  Thou hast also made mine enemies turn
their backs unto me;  
Yea, them that hate me, that I might cut them off.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:42">42</span>  They looked, but there was none to
save;  
Even unto the LORD, but He answered them not.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:43">43</span>  Then did I beat them small as the
dust of the earth,  
I did stamp them as the mire of the streets, and did tread them down.  
<span id="page_397">p. 397</span>  
<span id="an_sa2:22:44">44</span>  Thou also hast delivered me from the
contentions of my people;  
Thou hast kept me to be the head of the nations;  
A people whom I have not known serve me.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:45">45</span>  The sons of the stranger dwindle away
before me;  
As soon as they hear of me, they obey me.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:46">46</span>  The sons of the stranger fade away,  
And come halting out of their close places.

<span id="an_sa2:22:47">47</span>  The LORD liveth, and blessed be my
Rock;  
And exalted be the God, my Rock of salvation;  
<span id="an_sa2:22:48">48</span>  Even the God that executeth vengeance
for me,  
And bringeth down peoples under me,  
<span id="an_sa2:22:49">49</span>  And that bringeth me forth from mine
enemies;  
Yea, Thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me;  
Thou deliverest me from the violent man.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:50">50</span>  Therefore I will give thanks unto
Thee, O LORD, among the nations,  
And will sing praises unto Thy name.  
<span id="an_sa2:22:51">51</span>  A tower of salvation is He to His
king;  
And showeth mercy to His anointed,  
To David and to his seed, for evermore.
