### I SAMUEL CHAPTER 20

<span id="an_sa1:20:1">1</span> And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and
came and said before Jonathan: \`What have I done? what is mine
iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my
life?' <span id="an_sa1:20:2">2</span> And he said unto him: \`Far from
it; thou shalt not die; behold, my father doeth nothing either great or
small, but that he discloseth it unto me; and why should my father hide
this thing from me? it is not so.' <span id="an_sa1:20:3">3</span> And
David swore moreover, and said: \`Thy father knoweth well that I have
found favour in thine eyes; and he saith: Let not Jonathan know this,
lest he be grieved; but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul
liveth, there is but a step between me and death.' <span
id="an_sa1:20:4">4</span> Then said Jonathan unto David: \`What doth thy
soul desire, that I should do it for thee?' <span
id="an_sa1:20:5">5</span> And David said unto Jonathan: \`Behold,
to-morrow is the new moon, when I should sit with the king to eat; so
let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at
even. <span id="an_sa1:20:6">6</span> If thy father miss me at all, then
say: David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beth-lehem
his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family. <span
id="an_sa1:20:7">7</span> If he say thus: It is well; thy servant shall
have peace; but if he be wroth, then know that evil is determined by
him. <span id="an_sa1:20:8">8</span> Therefore deal kindly with thy
servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD
with thee; but if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why
shouldest thou bring me

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

to thy father?' <span id="an_sa1:20:9">9</span> And Jonathan said: \`Far
be it from thee; for if I should at all know that evil were determined
by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?' <span
id="an_sa1:20:10">10</span> Then said David to Jonathan: \`Who shall
tell me if perchance thy father answer thee roughly?' <span
id="an_sa1:20:11">11</span> And Jonathan said unto David: \`Come and let
us go out into the field.' And they went out both of them into the
field.

<span id="an_sa1:20:12">12</span> And Jonathan said unto David: \`The
LORD, the God of Israel—when I have sounded my father about this time
to-morrow, or the third day, behold, if there be good toward David,
shall I not then send unto thee, and disclose it unto thee? <span
id="an_sa1:20:13">13</span> The LORD do so to Jonathan, and more also,
should it please my father to do thee evil, if I disclose it not unto
thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace; and the LORD be
with thee, as He hath been with my father. <span
id="an_sa1:20:14">14</span> And thou shalt not only while yet I live
show me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not; <span
id="an_sa1:20:15">15</span> but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness
from my house for ever; no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies
of David every one from the face of the earth.' <span
id="an_sa1:20:16">16</span> So Jonathan made a covenant with the house
of David: \`The LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.'
<span id="an_sa1:20:17">17</span> And Jonathan caused David to swear
again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his
own soul.

<span id="an_sa1:20:18">18</span> And Jonathan said unto him:
\`To-morrow is the new moon; and thou wilt be missed, because thy seat
will be empty. <span id="an_sa1:20:19">19</span> And in the third day
thou shalt hide thyself well, and come to the place where thou didst
hide thyself in the day of work, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.
<span id="an_sa1:20:20">20</span> And I will shoot three arrows to the
side-ward, as though I shot at a mark. <span
id="an_sa1:20:21">21</span> And, behold, I will send the lad: Go, find
the arrows. If I say unto the lad: Behold, the arrows are on this side
of thee; take them, and come; for there is peace to thee and no hurt, as
the LORD liveth. <span id="an_sa1:20:22">22</span> But if I say thus
unto the boy: Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way; for the
LORD hath sent thee away. <span id="an_sa1:20:23">23</span> And as
touching the matter which I and thou have spoken of, behold, the LORD is
between me and thee for ever.'

<span id="an_sa1:20:24">24</span> So David hid himself in the field; and
when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to the meal to eat.
<span id="an_sa1:20:25">25</span> And the king sat upon his seat, as at
other times, even upon the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and
Abner sat by Saul's side; but David's place was empty. <span
id="an_sa1:20:26">26</span> Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that
day; for he thought: \`Something hath befallen him, he is unclean;
surely he is not clean.' <span id="an_sa1:20:27">27</span> And it came
to pass on the morrow after the new moon, which was the second day, that
David's place was empty; and Saul said unto Jonathan his son:
\`Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to the meal, neither yesterday,
nor today?' <span id="an_sa1:20:28">28</span> And Jonathan answered
Saul: \`David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem; <span
id="an_sa1:20:29">29</span> and he said: Let me go, I pray thee; for our
family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he bath commanded
me; and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I
pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he is not come unto the king's
table.'

<span id="an_sa1:20:30">30</span> Then Saul's anger was kindled against
Jonathan, and he said unto him: \`Thou son of perverse rebellion, do not
I know that thou hast chosen

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

the son of Jesse to thine own shame, and unto the shame of thy mother's
nakedness? <span id="an_sa1:20:31">31</span> For as long as the son of
Jesse liveth upon the earth, thou shalt not be established, nor thy
kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he deserveth to
die.' <span id="an_sa1:20:32">32</span> And Jonathan answered Saul his
father, and said unto him: \`Wherefore should he be put to death? what
hath he done?' <span id="an_sa1:20:33">33</span> And Saul cast his spear
at him to smite him; whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his
father to put David to death. <span id="an_sa1:20:34">34</span> So
Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the
second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, and because his
father had put him to shame.

<span id="an_sa1:20:35">35</span> And it came to pass in the morning,
that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David,
and a little lad with him. <span id="an_sa1:20:36">36</span> And he said
unto his lad: \`Run, find now the arrows which I shoot.' And as the lad
ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. <span id="an_sa1:20:37">37</span> And
when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot,
Jonathan cried after the lad, and said: \`Is not the arrow beyond thee?'
<span id="an_sa1:20:38">38</span> And Jonathan cried after the lad:
\`Make speed, hasten, stay not.' And Jonathan's lad gathered up the
arrows, and came to his master. <span id="an_sa1:20:39">39</span> But
the lad knew not any thing; only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
<span id="an_sa1:20:40">40</span> And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his
lad, and said unto him: \`Go, carry them to the city.' <span
id="an_sa1:20:41">41</span> And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose
out of a place toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and
bowed down three times; and they kissed one another, and wept one with
another, until David exceeded. <span id="an_sa1:20:42">42</span> And
Jonathan said to David: Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of
us in the name of the LORD, saying: The LORD shall be between me and
thee, and between my seed and thy seed, for ever.'
