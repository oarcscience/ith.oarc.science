### I SAMUEL CHAPTER 6

<span id="an_sa1:6:1">1</span> And the ark of the LORD was in the
country of the Philistines seven months. <span
id="an_sa1:6:2">2</span> And the Philistines called for the priests and
the diviners, saying: \`What shall we do with the ark of the LORD?
declare unto us wherewith we shall send it to its place.' <span
id="an_sa1:6:3">3</span> And they said: \`If ye send away the ark of the
God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return Him a
guilt-offering; then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you
why His hand is not removed from you.' <span
id="an_sa1:6:4">4</span> Then said they: \`What shall be the
guilt-offering which we shall return to Him?' And they said: \`Five
golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the
lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your
lords. <span id="an_sa1:6:5">5</span> Wherefore ye shall make images of
your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall
give glory unto the God of Israel; peradventure He will lighten His hand
from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land. <span
id="an_sa1:6:6">6</span> Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the
Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when He had wrought among
them, did they not let the people go, and they departed? <span
id="an_sa1:6:7">7</span> Now therefore take and prepare you a new cart,
and two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine
to the cart, and bring their calves home from them. <span
id="an_sa1:6:8">8</span> And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon
the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return Him for a
guilt-offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that
it may go. <span id="an_sa1:6:9">9</span> And see, if it goeth up by the
way of its own border to Beth-shemesh, then He hath done us this great
evil; but if not, then we shall know that it is not His hand that smote
us; it was a chance that happened to us.'

<span id="an_sa1:6:10">10</span> And the men did so; and took two milch
kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home. <span
id="an_sa1:6:11">11</span> And they put the ark of the LORD upon the
cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their
emerods. <span id="an_sa1:6:12">12</span> And the kine took the straight
way by the way to Beth-shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as
they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and
the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of
Beth-shemesh. <span id="an_sa1:6:13">13</span> And they of Beth-shemesh
were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their
eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it. <span
id="an_sa1:6:14">14</span> And the cart came into the field of Joshua
the Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone; and
they cleaved the wood of the cart, and offered up the kine for a
burnt-offering unto the LORD. <span id="an_sa1:6:15">15</span> And the
Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it,
wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone; and
the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt-offerings and sacrificed
sacrifices the same day unto the LORD. <span
id="an_sa1:6:16">16</span> And when the five lords of the Philistines
had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.

<span id="an_sa1:6:17">17</span> And these are the golden emerods which
the Philistines returned for a guilt-offering unto the LORD: for Ashdod
one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one; <span
id="an_sa1:6:18">18</span> and the golden mice, according to the number
of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both
of fortified cities and of

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

country villages, even unto Abel by the great stone, whereon they set
down the ark of the LORD, which stone remaineth unto this day in the
field of Joshua the Beth-shemite. <span id="an_sa1:6:19">19</span> And
He smote of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had gazed upon the ark
of the LORD, even He smote of the people seventy men, and fifty thousand
men; and the people  <span id="fr_119"></span>[a](#fn_116.md) mourned,
because the LORD had smitten the people with a great slaughter. <span
id="an_sa1:6:20">20</span> And the men of Beth-shemesh said: \`Who is
able to stand before the LORD, this holy God? and to whom shall it go up
from us?' <span id="an_sa1:6:21">21</span> And they sent messengers to
the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying: \`The Philistines have
brought back the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.'
