### EXODUS CHAPTER 17

<span id="an_exo:17:1">1</span> And all the congregation of the children
of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, by their stages,
according to the commandment of the LORD, and encamped in Rephidim; and
there was no water for the people to drink. <span
id="an_exo:17:2">2</span> Wherefore the people strove with Moses, and
said: 'Give us water that we may drink.' And Moses said unto them: 'Why
strive ye with me? wherefore do ye try the LORD?' <span
id="an_exo:17:3">3</span> And the people thirsted there for water; and
the people murmured against Moses, and said: 'Wherefore hast thou
brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle
with thirst?' <span id="an_exo:17:4">4</span> And Moses cried unto the
LORD, saying: 'What shall I do unto this people? they are almost ready
to stone me.' <span id="an_exo:17:5">5</span> And the LORD said unto
Moses: 'Pass on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of
Israel; and <span id="page_86">p. 86</span> thy rod, wherewith thou
smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go. <span
id="an_exo:17:6">6</span> Behold, I will stand before thee there upon
the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come
water out of it, that the people may drink.' And Moses did so in the
sight of the elders of Israel. <span id="an_exo:17:7">7</span> And the
name of the place was called  <span id="fr_81"></span>[a](#fn_80)
Massah, and  <span id="fr_82"></span>[b](#fn_81) Meribah, because of the
striving of the children of Israel, and because they tried the LORD,
saying: 'Is the LORD among us, or not?'

<span id="an_exo:17:8">8</span> Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel
in Rephidim. <span id="an_exo:17:9">9</span> And Moses said unto Joshua:
'Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek; tomorrow I will stand
on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.' <span
id="an_exo:17:10">10</span> So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and
fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the
hill. <span id="an_exo:17:11">11</span> And it came to pass, when Moses
held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand,
Amalek prevailed. <span id="an_exo:17:12">12</span> But Moses’ hands
were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat
thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side,
and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the
going down of the sun. <span id="an_exo:17:13">13</span> And Joshua
discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.

<span id="an_exo:17:14">14</span> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Write
this for a memorial in the book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua:
for I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under
heaven.' <span id="an_exo:17:15">15</span> And Moses built an altar, and
called the name of it  <span id="fr_83"></span>[c](#fn_82) Adonai-nissi.
<span id="an_exo:17:16">16</span> And he said: 'The hand upon the throne
of the LORD: the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to
generation.'
