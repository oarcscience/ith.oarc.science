### LEVITICUS CHAPTER 8

<span id="an_lev:8:1">1</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_lev:8:2">2</span> 'Take Aaron and his sons with him, and
the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bullock of the
sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread;
<span id="an_lev:8:3">3</span> and assemble thou all the congregation at
the door of the tent of meeting.' <span id="an_lev:8:4">4</span> And
Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the congregation was assembled
at the door of the tent of meeting. <span id="an_lev:8:5">5</span> And
Moses said unto the congregation: 'This is the thing which the LORD hath
commanded to be done.' <span id="an_lev:8:6">6</span> And Moses brought
Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water. <span
id="an_lev:8:7">7</span> And he put upon him the tunic, and girded him
with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon
him, and he girded him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and
bound it unto him therewith. <span id="an_lev:8:8">8</span> And he
placed the breast-plate upon him; and in the breast-plate he put the
Urim and the Thummim. <span id="an_lev:8:9">9</span> And he set the
mitre n upon his head; and upon the mitre, in front, did he set the
golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses. <span
id="an_lev:8:10">10</span> And Moses tools the anointing oil, and
anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.
<span id="an_lev:8:11">11</span> And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar
seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the laver
and its base, to sanctify them. <span id="an_lev:8:12">12</span> And he
poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to
sanctify him. <span id="an_lev:8:13">13</span> And Moses brought Aaron's
sons, and clothed them with tunics, and girded them with girdles, and
bound head-tires upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses. <span
id="an_lev:8:14">14</span> And the bullock of the sin-offering was
brought; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the
bullock of the sin-offering. <span id="an_lev:8:15">15</span> And when
it was slain, Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the
altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured
out the remaining blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to
make atonement for it. <span id="an_lev:8:16">16</span> And he took all
the fat that was upon the inwards, and the lobe of the liver, and the
two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses made it smoke upon the altar.
<span id="an_lev:8:17">17</span> But the bullock, and its skin, and its
flesh, and its dung, were burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD
commanded Moses. <span id="an_lev:8:18">18</span> And the ram of the
burnt-offering was presented; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands
upon the head of the ram. <span id="an_lev:8:19">19</span> And when it
was killed, Moses dashed the blood against the altar round about. <span
id="an_lev:8:20">20</span> And when thee r m was cut into its pieces,
Moses made the head, and the pieces, and the suet smoke. <span
id="an_lev:8:21">21</span> And when the inwards <span id="page_127">p.
127</span> and the legs were washed with water, Moses made the whole ram
smoke upon the altar; it was a burnt-offering for a sweet savour; it was
an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<span id="an_lev:8:22">22</span> And the other ram was presented, the
ram of consecration, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the
head of the ram. <span id="an_lev:8:23">23</span> And when it was slain,
Moses took of the blood thereof, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's
right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe
of his right foot. <span id="an_lev:8:24">24</span> And Aaron's sons
were brought, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right
ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of
their right foot; and Moses dashed the blood against the altar round
about. <span id="an_lev:8:25">25</span> And he took the fat, and the fat
tail, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the lobe of the
liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right thigh. <span
id="an_lev:8:26">26</span> And out of the basket of unleavened bread,
that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of
oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and upon the
right thigh. <span id="an_lev:8:27">27</span> And he put the whole upon
the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and waved them for a
wave-offering before the LORD. <span id="an_lev:8:28">28</span> And
Moses took them from off their hands, and made them smoke on the altar
upon the burnt-offering; they were a consecration-offering for a sweet
savour; it was an offering made by fire unto the LORD. <span
id="an_lev:8:29">29</span> And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a
wave-offering before the LORD; it was Moses’ portion of the ram of
consecration; as the LORD commanded Moses. <span
id="an_lev:8:30">30</span> And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of
the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and
upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons’ garments with
him, and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons’
garments with him. <span id="an_lev:8:31">31</span> And Moses said unto
Aaron and to his sons: 'Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of
meeting; and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of
consecration, as I commanded, saying: Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
<span id="an_lev:8:32">32</span> And that which remaineth of the flesh
and of the bread shall ye burn with fire. <span
id="an_lev:8:33">33</span> And ye shall not go out from the door of the
tent of meeting seven days, until the days of your consecration be
fulfilled; for He shall consecrate you seven days. <span
id="an_lev:8:34">34</span> As hath been done this day, so the LORD hath
commanded to do, to make atonement for you. <span
id="an_lev:8:35">35</span> And at the door of the tent of meeting shall
ye abide day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that
ye die not; for so I am commanded.' <span id="an_lev:8:36">36</span> And
Aaron and his sons did all the things which the LORD commanded by the
hand of Moses.
