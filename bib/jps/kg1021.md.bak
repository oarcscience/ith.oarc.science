### I Kings Chapter 21

<span id="an_kg1:21:1">1</span> And it came to pass after these things,
that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by
the palace of Ahab, king of Samaria. <span id="an_kg1:21:2">2</span> And
Ahab spoke unto Naboth, saying: \`Give me thy vineyard, that I may have
it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house; and I will
give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee,
I will give thee the worth of it in money.' <span
id="an_kg1:21:3">3</span> And Naboth said to Ahab: \`The LORD forbid it
me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.' <span
id="an_kg1:21:4">4</span> And Ahab came into his house sullen and
displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to
him; for he had said: \`I will not give thee the inheritance of my
fathers.' And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face,
and would eat no bread.

<span id="an_kg1:21:5">5</span> But Jezebel his wife came to him, and
said unto him: \`Why is thy spirit so sullen, that thou eatest no
bread?' <span id="an_kg1:21:6">6</span> And he said unto her: \`Because
I spoke unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him: Give me thy
vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another
vineyard for it; and he answered: I will not give thee my vineyard.'
<span id="an_kg1:21:7">7</span> And Jezebel his wife said unto him:
'Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and
let thy heart be merry; I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the
Jezreelite.' <span id="an_kg1:21:8">8</span> So she wrote letters in

<span id="page_437">p. 437</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ahab's name, and
sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to
the nobles that were in his city, and that dwelt with Naboth. <span
id="an_kg1:21:9">9</span> And she wrote in the letters, saying:
\`Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people; <span
id="an_kg1:21:10">10</span> and set two men, base fellows, before him,
and let them bear witness against him, saying: Thou didst curse God and
the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he die.'

<span id="an_kg1:21:11">11</span> And the men of his city, even the
elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent
unto them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent
unto them. <span id="an_kg1:21:12">12</span> They proclaimed a fast, and
set Naboth at the head of the people. <span
id="an_kg1:21:13">13</span> And the two men, the base fellows, came in
and sat before him; and the base fellows bore witness against him, even
against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying: 'Naboth did curse
God and the king.' Then they carried him forth out of the city, and
stoned him with stones, that he died. <span
id="an_kg1:21:14">14</span> Then they sent to Jezebel, saying: 'Naboth
is stoned, and is dead.' <span id="an_kg1:21:15">15</span> And it came
to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that
Jezebel said to Ahab: \`Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth
the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money; for Naboth is
not alive, but dead.' <span id="an_kg1:21:16">16</span> And it came to
pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down
to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.

<span id="an_kg1:21:17">17</span> And the word of the LORD came to
Elijah the Tishbite, saying : <span id="an_kg1:21:18">18</span> \`Arise,
go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwelleth in Samaria; behold, he
is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to take possession
of it. <span id="an_kg1:21:19">19</span> And thou shalt speak unto him,
saying: Thus saith the LORD: Hast thou killed, and also taken
possession? and thou shalt speak unto him, saying: Thus saith the LORD:
In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy
blood, even thine.' <span id="an_kg1:21:20">20</span> And Ahab said to
Elijah: \`Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?' And he answered: \`I have
found thee; because thou hast given thyself over to do that which is
evil in the sight of the LORD. <span id="an_kg1:21:21">21</span> Behold,
I will bring evil upon thee, and will utterly sweep thee away, and will
cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that
is left at large in Israel. <span id="an_kg1:21:22">22</span> And I will
make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the
house of Baasa the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou
hast provoked Me, and hast made Israel to sin. <span
id="an_kg1:21:23">23</span> And of Jezebel also spoke the LORD, saying:
The dogs shall eat Jezebel in the moat of Jezreel. <span
id="an_kg1:21:24">24</span> Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs
shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air
eat.' <span id="an_kg1:21:25">25</span> But there was none like unto
Ahab, who did give himself over to do that which was evil in the sight
of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up. <span
id="an_kg1:21:26">26</span> And he did very abominably in following
idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom the LORD cast out
before the children of Israel.

<span id="an_kg1:21:27">27</span> And it came to pass, when Ahab heard
those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh,
and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly. <span
id="an_kg1:21:28">28</span> And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the
Tishbite, saying: <span id="an_kg1:21:29">29</span> 'Seest thou how Ahab
humbleth himself before Me? because he

<span id="page_438">p. 438</span>

humbleth himself before Me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but
in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.'
