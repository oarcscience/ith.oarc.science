### NUMBERS CHAPTER 21

<span id="an_num:21:1">1</span> And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who
dwelt in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim;
and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive. <span
id="an_num:21:2">2</span> And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and
said: \`If Thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I
will utterly destroy their cities.' <span id="an_num:21:3">3</span> And
the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the
Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities; and the
name of the place was called  <span id="fr_99"></span>[a](#fn_96)
Hormah.

<span id="an_num:21:4">4</span> And they journeyed from mount Hor by the
way to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom; and the soul of the
people became impatient because of the way. <span
id="an_num:21:5">5</span> And the people spoke against God, and against
Moses: \`Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the
wilderness? for there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul
loatheth this light bread.' <span id="an_num:21:6">6</span> And the LORD
sent fiery serpents among the people,

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died. <span
id="an_num:21:7">7</span> And the people came to Moses, and said: \`We
have sinned, because we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee;
pray unto the LORD, that He take away the serpents from us.' And Moses
prayed for the people. <span id="an_num:21:8">8</span> And the LORD said
unto Moses: \`Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole; and it
shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he seeth it,
shall live.' <span id="an_num:21:9">9</span> And Moses made a serpent of
brass, and set it upon the pole; and it came to pass, that if a serpent
had bitten any man, when he looked unto the serpent of brass, he lived.
<span id="an_num:21:10">10</span> And the children of Israel journeyed,
and pitched in Oboth. <span id="an_num:21:11">11</span> And they
journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the wilderness which
is in front of Moab, toward the sunrising. <span
id="an_num:21:12">12</span> From thence they journeyed, and pitched in
the valley of Zered. <span id="an_num:21:13">13</span> From thence they
journeyed, and pitched on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the
wilderness, that cometh out of the border of the Amorites.—For Arnon is
the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites; <span
id="an_num:21:14">14</span> wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars
of the LORD:

Vaheb in Suphah,  
And the valleys of Arnon,  
<span id="an_num:21:15">15</span> And the slope of the valleys  
That inclineth toward the seat of Ar,  
And leaneth upon the border of Moab.—

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> <span
id="an_num:21:16">16</span> And from thence to  <span
id="fr_100"></span>[a](#fn_97) Beer; that is the well whereof the LORD
said unto Moses: \`Gather the people together, and I will give them
water.' <span id="an_num:21:17">17</span> Then sang Israel this song:

Spring up, O well—sing ye unto it—  
<span id="an_num:21:18">18</span> The well, which the princes digged,  
Which the nobles of the people delved,  
With the sceptre, and with their staves.

And from the wilderness to Mattanah; <span
id="an_num:21:19">19</span> and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from
Nahaliel to Bamoth; <span id="an_num:21:20">20</span> and from Bamoth to
the valley that is in the field of Moab, by the top of Pisgah, which
looketh down upon the desert.

<span id="an_num:21:21">21</span> And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon
king of the Amorites, saying: <span id="an_num:21:22">22</span> \`Let me
pass through thy land; we will not turn aside into field, or into
vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells; we will go by the
king's highway, until we have passed thy border.' <span
id="an_num:21:23">23</span> And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass
through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went
out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought
against Israel. <span id="an_num:21:24">24</span> And Israel smote him
with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon unto
the Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon; for the border of the
children of Ammon was strong. <span id="an_num:21:25">25</span> And
Israel took all these cities; and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the
Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns thereof. <span
id="an_num:21:26">26</span> For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king
of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and
taken all his land out of his hand, even unto the Arnon. <span
id="an_num:21:27">27</span> Wherefore they that speak in parables say:

Come ye to Heshbon!  
Let the city of Sihon be built and established!  
<span id="an_num:21:28">28</span> For a fire is gone out of Heshhon,  
A flame from the city of Sihon;  
It hath devoured Ar of Moab,  
The lords of the high places of Arnon.  
<span id="an_num:21:29">29</span> Woe to thee, Moab!  
Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh;  
He hath given his sons as fugitives, <span id="page_190">p. 190</span>  
And his daughters into captivity,  
Unto Sihon king of the Amorites.  
<span id="an_num:21:30">30</span> We have shot at them—Heshbon is
perished—even unto Dibon,  
And we have laid waste even unto Nophah,  
Which reacheth unto Medeba.

<span id="an_num:21:31">31</span> Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the
Amorites. <span id="an_num:21:32">32</span> And Moses sent to spy out
Jazer, and they took the towns thereof, and drove out the Amorites that
were there. <span id="an_num:21:33">33</span> And they turned and went
up by the way of Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan went out against
them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. <span
id="an_num:21:34">34</span> And the LORD said unto Moses: \`Fear him
not; for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his
land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the
Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.' <span id="an_num:21:35">35</span> So
they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none
left him remaining; and they possessed his land.
