### GENESIS CHAPTER 26

<span id="an_gen:26:1">1</span> And there was a famine in the land,
beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went
unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. <span
id="an_gen:26:2">2</span> And the LORD appeared unto him, and said: 'Go
not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of. <span
id="an_gen:26:3">3</span> Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee,
and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all
these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore unto Abraham
thy father; <span id="an_gen:26:4">4</span> and I will multiply thy seed
as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these lands; and
by thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves; <span
id="an_gen:26:5">5</span> because that Abraham hearkened to My voice,
and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.' <span
id="an_gen:26:6">6</span> And Isaac dwelt in Gerar. <span
id="an_gen:26:7">7</span> And the men of the place asked him of his
wife; and he said: 'She is my sister'; for he feared to say: 'My wife';
'lest the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah, because she is
fair to look upon.' <span id="an_gen:26:8">8</span> And it came to pass,
when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the
Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was
sporting with Rebekah his wife. <span id="an_gen:26:9">9</span> And
Abimelech called Isaac, and said: 'Behold, of a surety she is thy wife;
and how saidst thou: She is my sister?' And Isaac said unto him:
'Because I said: Lest I die because of her.' <span
id="an_gen:26:10">10</span> And Abimelech said: 'What is this thou hast
done unto us? one of the people might easily have lain with thy wife,
and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.' <span
id="an_gen:26:11">11</span> And Abimelech charged all the people,
saying: 'He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to
death.' <span id="an_gen:26:12">12</span> And Isaac sowed in that land,
and found in the same year a hundredfold; and the LORD blessed him.
<span id="an_gen:26:13">13</span> And the man waxed great, and grew more
and more until he became very great. <span
id="an_gen:26:14">14</span> And he had possessions of flocks, and
possessions of herds, and a great household; and the Philistines envied
him. <span id="an_gen:26:15">15</span> Now all the wells which his
father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the
Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth. <span
id="an_gen:26:16">16</span> And Abimelech said unto Isaac: 'Go from us;
for thou art much mightier than we.' <span
id="an_gen:26:17">17</span> And Isaac departed thence, and encamped in
the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. <span
id="an_gen:26:18">18</span> And Isaac digged again the wells of water,
which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the
Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham; and he called
their names after the names by which his father had called them. <span
id="an_gen:26:19">19</span> And Isaac's servants digged in the valley,
and found there a well of living water. <span
id="an_gen:26:20">20</span> And the herdmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's
herdmen, saying: 'The water is ours.' And he called the name of the well
 <span id="fr_30"></span>[b](#fn_29.md) Esek; because they contended <span
id="page_31">p. 31</span> with him. <span
id="an_gen:26:21">21</span> And they digged another well, and they
strove for that also. And he called the name of it  <span
id="fr_31"></span>[a](#fn_30.md) Sitnah. <span
id="an_gen:26:22">22</span> And he removed from thence, and digged
another well; and for that they strove not. And he called the name of it
 <span id="fr_32"></span>[b](#fn_31.md) Rehoboth; and he said: 'For now the
LORD path made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.' <span
id="an_gen:26:23">23</span> And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
<span id="an_gen:26:24">24</span> And the LORD appeared unto him the
same night, and said: 'I am the God of Abraham thy father. Fear not, for
I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for My
servant Abraham's sake.' <span id="an_gen:26:25">25</span> And he
builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and
pitched his tent there; and there Isaac's servants digged a well. <span
id="an_gen:26:26">26</span> Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and
Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host. <span
id="an_gen:26:27">27</span> And Isaac said unto them: 'Wherefore are ye
come unto me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?' <span
id="an_gen:26:28">28</span> And they said: 'We saw plainly that the LORD
was with thee; and we said: Let there now be an oath betwixt us, even
betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee; <span
id="an_gen:26:29">29</span> that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not
touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have
sent thee away in peace; thou art now the blessed of the LORD.' <span
id="an_gen:26:30">30</span> And he made them a feast, and they did eat
and drink. <span id="an_gen:26:31">31</span> And they rose up betimes in
the morning, and swore one to another; and Isaac sent them away, and
they departed from him in peace. <span id="an_gen:26:32">32</span> And
it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him
concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him: 'We have
found water.' <span id="an_gen:26:33">33</span> And he called it Shibah.
Therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day.

<span id="an_gen:26:34">34</span> And when Esau was forty years old, he
took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the
daughter of Elon the Hittite. <span id="an_gen:26:35">35</span> And they
were a bitterness of spirit unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
