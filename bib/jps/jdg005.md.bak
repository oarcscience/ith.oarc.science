### JUDGES CHAPTER 5

<span id="an_jdg:5:1">1</span> Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of
Abinoam on that day, saying:

<span id="an_jdg:5:2">2</span> When men let grow their hair in Israel,  
When the people offer themselves willingly,  
Bless ye the LORD.  
<span id="an_jdg:5:3">3</span> Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye
princes;  
I, unto the LORD will I sing;  
I will sing praise to the LORD, the God of Israel.

<span id="an_jdg:5:4">4</span> LORD, when Thou didst go forth out of
Seir,  
When Thou didst march out of the field of Edom,  
The earth trembled, the heavens also dropped,  
Yea, the clouds dropped water.  
<span id="an_jdg:5:5">5</span> The mountains quaked at the presence of
the LORD,  
Even yon Sinai at the presence of the LORD, the God of Israel.

<span id="an_jdg:5:6">6</span> In the days of Shamgar the son of
Anath,  
In the days of Jael, the highways ceased,  
And the travellers walked through byways.  
<span id="an_jdg:5:7">7</span> The rulers ceased in Israel, they
ceased,  
Until that thou didst arise, Deborah,  
That thou didst arise a mother in Israel.  
<span id="an_jdg:5:8">8</span> They chose new gods;  
Then was war in the gates;  
Was there a shield or spear seen  
Among forty thousand in Israel? <span id="page_299">p. 299</span>  
<span id="an_jdg:5:9">9</span> My heart is toward the governors of
Israel,  
That offered themselves willingly among the people.  
Bless ye the LORD.  
<span id="an_jdg:5:10">10</span> Ye that ride on white asses,  
Ye that sit on rich cloths,  
And ye that walk by the way, tell of it;  
<span id="an_jdg:5:11">11</span> Louder than the voice of archers, by
the watering-troughs!  
There shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD,  
Even the righteous acts of His rulers in Israel.  
Then the people of the LORD went down to the gates.

<span id="an_jdg:5:12">12</span> Awake, awake, Deborah;  
Awake, awake, utter a song;  
Arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.  
<span id="an_jdg:5:13">13</span> Then made He a remnant to have dominion
over the nobles and the people;  
The LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.  
<span id="an_jdg:5:14">14</span> 0ut of Ephraim came they whose root is
in Amalek;  
After thee, Benjamin, among thy peoples;  
Out of Machir came down governors,  
And out of Zebulun they that handle the marshal's staff.  
<span id="an_jdg:5:15">15</span> And the princes of Issachar were with
Deborah;  
As was Issachar, so was Barak;  
Into the valley they rushed forth at his feet.  
Among the divisions of Reuben  
There were great resolves of heart.  
<span id="an_jdg:5:16">16</span> Why sattest thou among the
sheep-folds,  
To hear the pipings for the flocks?  
At the divisions of Reuben  
There were great searchings of heart.  
<span id="an_jdg:5:17">17</span> Gilead abode beyond the Jordan;  
And Dan, why doth he sojourn by the ships?  
Asher dwelt at the shore of the sea,  
And abideth by its bays.  
<span id="an_jdg:5:18">18</span> Zebulun is a people that jeoparded
their lives unto the death,  
And Naphtali, upon the high places of the field.

<span id="an_jdg:5:19">19</span> The kings came, they fought;  
Then fought the kings of Canaan,  
In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo;  
They took no gain of money.  
<span id="an_jdg:5:20">20</span> They fought from heaven,  
The stars in their courses fought against Sisera.  
<span id="an_jdg:5:21">21</span> The brook Kishon swept them away,  
That ancient brook, the brook Kishon.  
O my soul, tread them down with strength.  
<span id="an_jdg:5:22">22</span> Then did the horsehoofs stamp  
By reason of the prancings, the prancings of their mighty ones.  
<span id="an_jdg:5:23">23</span> \`Curse ye Meroz', said the angel of
the LORD,  
\`Curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof,  
Because they came not to the help of the LORD,  
To the help of the LORD against the mighty.'  
<span id="an_jdg:5:24">24</span> Blessed above women shall Jael be,  
The wife of Heber the Kenite,  
Above women in the tent shall she be blessed.  
<span id="an_jdg:5:25">25</span> Water he asked, milk she gave him;  
In a lordly bowl she brought him curd.  
<span id="an_jdg:5:26">26</span> Her hand she put to the tent-pin,  
And her right hand to the workmen's hammer;  
And with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote through his head,  
Yea, she pierced and struck through his temples. <span id="page_300">p.
300</span>  
<span id="an_jdg:5:27">27</span> At her feet he sunk, he fell, he lay;  
At her feet he sunk, he fell;  
Where he sunk, there he fell down dead.

<span id="an_jdg:5:28">28</span> Through the window she looked forth,
and peered,  
The mother of Sisera, through the lattice:  
\`Why is his chariot so long in coming?  
Why tarry the wheels of his chariots?'  
<span id="an_jdg:5:29">29</span> The wisest of her princesses answer
her,  
Yea, she returneth answer to herself:  
<span id="an_jdg:5:30">30</span> \`Are they not finding, are they not
dividing the spoil?  
A damsel, two damsels to every man;  
To Sisera a spoil of dyed garments,  
A spoil of dyed garments of embroidery,  
Two dyed garments of broidery for the neck of every spoiler?'

<span id="an_jdg:5:31">31</span> So perish all Thine enemies, O LORD;  
But they that love Him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.  
And the land had rest forty years.
