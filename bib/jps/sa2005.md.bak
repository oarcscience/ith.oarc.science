### II SAMUEL CHAPTER 5

<span id="an_sa2:5:1">1</span>  Then came all the tribes of Israel to
David unto Hebron, and spoke, saying: \`Behold, we are thy bone and thy
flesh. <span id="an_sa2:5:2">2</span>  In times past, when Saul was king
over us, it was thou that didst lead out and bring in Israel; and the
LORD said to thee: Thou shalt feed My people Israel, and thou shalt be
prince over Israel.' <span id="an_sa2:5:3">3</span>  So all the elders
of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant
with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over
Israel.

<span id="an_sa2:5:4">4</span>  David was thirty years old when he began
to reign, and he reigned forty years. <span id="an_sa2:5:5">5</span>  In
Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in
Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.

<span id="an_sa2:5:6">6</span>  And the king and his men went to
Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke
unto David, saying: \`Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou
shalt not come in hither'; thinking: \`David cannot come in hither.'
<span id="an_sa2:5:7">7</span>  Nevertheless David took the stronghold
of Zion; the same is the city of David. <span id="an_sa2:5:8">8</span> 
And David said on that day: \`Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites, and
getteth up to the gutter, and \[taketh away\] the lame and the blind,
that are hated of David's soul—.' Wherefore they say: \`There are the
blind and the lame; he cannot come into the house.' <span
id="an_sa2:5:9">9</span>  And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called
it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.
<span id="an_sa2:5:10">10</span>  And David waxed greater and greater;
for the LORD, the God of hosts, was with him.

<span id="an_sa2:5:11">11</span>  And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers
to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built
David a house. <span id="an_sa2:5:12">12</span>  And David perceived
that the Lord had established him king over Israel, and that He had
exalted his kingdom for His people Israel's sake.

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

<span id="an_sa2:5:13">13</span>  And David took him more concubines and
wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were
yet sons and daughters born to David. <span id="an_sa2:5:14">14</span> 
And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem:
Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon; <span
id="an_sa2:5:15">15</span>  and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and
Japhia; <span id="an_sa2:5:16">16</span>  and Elishama, and Eliada, and
Eliphelet.

<span id="an_sa2:5:17">17</span>  And when the Philistines heard that
David was anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek
David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold. <span
id="an_sa2:5:18">18</span>  Now the Philistines had come and spread
themselves in the valley of Rephaim. <span id="an_sa2:5:19">19</span> 
And David inquired of the LORD, saying: \`Shall I go up against the
Philistines? wilt Thou deliver them into my hand?' And the LORD said
unto David: \`Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into
thy hand.' <span id="an_sa2:5:20">20</span>  And David came to
Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said: \`The LORD hath
broken mine enemies before me, like the breach of waters.' Therefore the
name of that place was called  <span id="fr_129"></span>[a](#fn_126.md)
Baal-perazim. <span id="an_sa2:5:21">21</span>  And they left their
images there, and David and his men took them away.

<span id="an_sa2:5:22">22</span>  And the Philistines came up yet again,
and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. <span
id="an_sa2:5:23">23</span>  And when David inquired of the LORD, He
said: \`Thou shalt not go up; make a circuit behind them, and come upon
them over against the mulberry-trees. <span id="an_sa2:5:24">24</span> 
And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of
the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then is the
LORD gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.' <span
id="an_sa2:5:25">25</span>  And David did so, as the LORD commanded him,
and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gezer.
