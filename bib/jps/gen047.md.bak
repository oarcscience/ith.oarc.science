### GENESIS CHAPTER 47

<span id="an_gen:47:1">1</span> Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh,
and said: 'My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds,
and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold,
they are in the land of Goshen.' <span id="an_gen:47:2">2</span> And
from among his brethren he took five men, and presented them unto
Pharaoh. <span id="an_gen:47:3">3</span> And Pharaoh said unto his
brethren: 'What is your occupation?' And they said unto Pharaoh: 'Thy
servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.' <span
id="an_gen:47:4">4</span> And they said unto Pharaoh: 'To sojourn in the
land are we come; for there is no pasture for thy servants' flocks; for
the famine is sore in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, we pray thee,
let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.' <span
id="an_gen:47:5">5</span> And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph, saying: 'Thy
father and thy brethren are come unto thee; <span
id="an_gen:47:6">6</span> the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best
of the land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell; in the land of
Goshen let them dwell. And if thou knowest any able men among them, then
make them rulers over my cattle.' <span id="an_gen:47:7">7</span> And
Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh. And
Jacob blessed Pharaoh.<span id="an_gen:47:8">8</span> And Pharaoh said
unto Jacob: 'How many are the days of the years of thy life?' <span
id="an_gen:47:9">9</span> And Jacob said unto Pharaoh: 'The days of the
years of my sojournings are a hundred and thirty years; few and evil
have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained
unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of
their sojournings.' <span id="an_gen:47:10">10</span> And Jacob blessed
Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh. <span
id="an_gen:47:11">11</span> And Joseph placed his father and his
brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best
of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. <span
id="an_gen:47:12">12</span> And Joseph sustained his father, and his
brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to the
want of their little ones.

<span id="an_gen:47:13">13</span> And there was no bread in all the
land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and the
land of Canaan languished by reason of the famine. <span
id="an_gen:47:14">14</span> And Joseph gathered up all the money that
was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn
which they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
<span id="an_gen:47:15">15</span> And when the money was all spent in
the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came
unto Joseph, and said: 'Give us bread; for why should we die in thy
presence? for our money faileth.' <span id="an_gen:47:16">16</span> And
Joseph said: 'Give your cattle, and I will give you \[bread\] for your
cattle, if money fail.' <span id="an_gen:47:17">17</span> And they
brought their cattle unto Joseph. And Joseph gave them bread in exchange
for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the
asses; and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for
that year. <span id="an_gen:47:18">18</span> And when that year was
ended, they came unto him the second year, <span id="page_60">p.
60</span> and said unto him: 'We will not hide from my lord, how that
our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lord's; there is
nought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands.
<span id="an_gen:47:19">19</span> Wherefore should we die before thine
eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and
our land will be bondmen unto Pharaoh; and give us seed, that we may
live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate.' <span
id="an_gen:47:20">20</span> So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for
Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine
was sore upon them; and the land became Pharaoh's. <span
id="an_gen:47:21">21</span> And as for the people, he removed them city
by city, from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end
thereof. <span id="an_gen:47:22">22</span> Only the land of the priests
bought he not, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and did eat
their portion which Pharaoh gave them; wherefore they sold not their
land. <span id="an_gen:47:23">23</span> Then Joseph said unto the
people: 'Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh.
Lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land. <span
id="an_gen:47:24">24</span> And it shall come to pass at the
ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth unto Pharaoh, and four parts
shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for
them of your households, and for food for your little ones.' <span
id="an_gen:47:25">25</span> And they said: 'Thou hast saved our lives.
Let us find favour in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's
bond-men.' <span id="an_gen:47:26">26</span> And Joseph made it a
statute concerning the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should
have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone became not Pharaoh's.
<span id="an_gen:47:27">27</span> And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt,
in the land of Goshen; and they got them possessions therein, and were
fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.

‏ויחי‎

<span id="an_gen:47:28">28</span> And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt
seventeen years; so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a
hundred forty and seven years. <span id="an_gen:47:29">29</span> And the
time drew near that Israel must die; and he called his son Joseph, and
said unto him: 'If now I have found favour in thy sight, put, I pray
thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury
me not, I pray thee, in Egypt. <span id="an_gen:47:30">30</span> But
when I sleep with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury
me in their burying-place.' And he said: 'I will do as thou hast said.'
<span id="an_gen:47:31">31</span> And he said: 'Swear unto me.' And he
swore unto him. And Israel bowed down upon the bed's head.
