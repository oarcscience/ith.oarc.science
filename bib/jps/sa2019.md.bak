### II SAMUEL CHAPTER 19

<span id="an_sa2:19:1">1</span>  And the king was much moved, and went
up to the chamber over the gate, and wept; and as he went, thus he said:
\`O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would I had died for thee, O
Absalom, my son, my son!'

<span id="an_sa2:19:2">2</span>  And it was told Joab: \`Behold, the
king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.' <span id="an_sa2:19:3">3</span> 
And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people;
for the people heard say that day: \`The king grieveth for his son.'
<span id="an_sa2:19:4">4</span>  And the people got them by stealth that
day into the city, as people that are ashamed steal away when they flee
in battle. <span id="an_sa2:19:5">5</span>  And the king covered his
face, and the king cried with a loud voice: \`O my son Absalom, O
Absalom, my son, my son!' <span id="an_sa2:19:6">6</span>  And Joab came
into the house to the king, and said: \`Thou hast shamed this day the
faces of all thy servants, who this day have saved thy life, and the
lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and
the lives of thy concubines; <span id="an_sa2:19:7">7</span>  in that
thou lovest them that hate thee, and hatest them that love thee. For
thou hast declared this day, that princes and servants are nought unto
thee; for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had
died this day, then it had pleased thee well. <span
id="an_sa2:19:8">8</span>  Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak to
the heart of thy servants; for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not
forth, there will not tarry a man with thee this night; and that will be
worse unto thee than all the evil that hath befallen thee from thy youth
until now.' <span id="an_sa2:19:9">9</span>  Then the king arose, and
sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying: \`Behold,
the king doth sit in the gate'; and all the people came before the king.

Now Israel had fled every man to his tent. <span
id="an_sa2:19:10">10</span>  And all the people were at strife
throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying: \`The king delivered us out
of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the
Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom. <span
id="an_sa2:19:11">11</span>  And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is
dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the
king back?'

<span id="an_sa2:19:12">12</span>  And king David sent to Zadok and to
Abiathar the priests, saying: \`Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying:
Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house?—For the speech
of all Israel was come to the king, to bring him to his house.— <span
id="an_sa2:19:13">13</span>  Ye are my brethren, ye are my bone and my
flesh; wherefore then should ye be the last to bring back the king?
<span id="an_sa2:19:14">14</span>  And say ye to Amasa: Art thou not my
bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not
captain of the host before me continually in

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

the room of Joab.' <span id="an_sa2:19:15">15</span>  And he bowed the
heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that
they sent unto the king: \`Return thou, and all thy servants.'

<span id="an_sa2:19:16">16</span>  So the king returned, and came to the
Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the
king over the Jordan. <span id="an_sa2:19:17">17</span>  And Shimei the
son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, made haste and came down
with the men of Judah to meet king David. <span
id="an_sa2:19:18">18</span>  And there were a thousand men of Benjamin
with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen
sons and his twenty servants with him. And they rushed into the Jordan
before the king. <span id="an_sa2:19:19">19</span>  And the ferry-boat
passed to and fro to bring over the king's household, and to do what he
thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when
he would go over the Jordan. <span id="an_sa2:19:20">20</span>  And he
said unto the king: \`Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither
do thou remember that which thy servant did iniquitously the day that my
lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his
heart. <span id="an_sa2:19:21">21</span>  For thy servant doth know that
I have sinned; therefore, behold, I am come this day the first of all
the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.' <span
id="an_sa2:19:22">22</span>  But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and
said: \`Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the
LORD'S anointed?' <span id="an_sa2:19:23">23</span>  And David said:
\`What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this
day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day
in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?' <span
id="an_sa2:19:24">24</span>  And the king said unto Shimei : \`Thou
shalt not die.' And the king swore unto him.

<span id="an_sa2:19:25">25</span>  And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came
down to meet the king; and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed
his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until
the day he came home in peace. <span id="an_sa2:19:26">26</span>  And it
came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the
king said unto him: \`Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?'
<span id="an_sa2:19:27">27</span>  And he answered: \`My lord, O king,
my servant deceived me; for thy servant said: I will saddle me an ass,
that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because thy servant is
lame. <span id="an_sa2:19:28">28</span>  And he hath slandered thy
servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of
God; do therefore what is good in thine eyes. <span
id="an_sa2:19:29">29</span>  For all my father's house were deserving of
death at the hand of my lord the king; yet didst thou set thy servant
among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I
yet? or why should I cry any more unto the king?' <span
id="an_sa2:19:30">30</span>  And the king said unto him: \`Why speakest
thou any more of thy matters? I say: Thou and Ziba divide the land.'
<span id="an_sa2:19:31">31</span>  And Mephibosheth said unto the king:
\`Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come in peace
unto his own house.'

<span id="an_sa2:19:32">32</span>  And Barzillai the Gileadite came down
from Rogelim; and he passed on to the Jordan with the king, to bring him
on the way over the Jordan. <span id="an_sa2:19:33">33</span>  Now
Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old; and he had
provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a
very great man. <span id="an_sa2:19:34">34</span>  And the king said
unto Barzillai: \`Come thou over with me, and I will sustain thee with
me in Jerusalem.' <span id="an_sa2:19:35">35</span>  And Barzillai said
unto the king: \`How many are the days of the

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

years of my life, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?
<span id="an_sa2:19:36">36</span>  I am this day fourscore years old;
can I discern between good and bad? can thy servant taste what I eat or
what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing
women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord
the king? <span id="an_sa2:19:37">37</span>  Thy servant would but just
go over the Jordan with the king; and why should the king recompense it
me with such a reward? <span id="an_sa2:19:38">38</span>  Let thy
servant, I pray thee, turn back, that I may die in mine own city, by the
grave of my father and my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let
him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good
unto thee.' <span id="an_sa2:19:39">39</span>  And the king answered:
\`Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall
seem good unto thee; and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will
I do for thee.' <span id="an_sa2:19:40">40</span>  And all the people
went over the Jordan, and the king went over; and the king kissed
Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.

<span id="an_sa2:19:41">41</span>  So the king went over to Gilgal, and
 <span id="fr_134"></span>[a](#fn_131.md) Chimham went over with him; and
all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people
of Israel. <span id="an_sa2:19:42">42</span>  And, behold, all the men
of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king: \`Why have our
brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and brought the king, and
his household, over the Jordan, and all David's men with him?' <span
id="an_sa2:19:43">43</span>  And all the men of Judah answered the men
of Israel: \`Because the king is near of kin to us; wherefore then are
ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or
hath any gift been given us?' <span id="an_sa2:19:44">44</span>  And the
men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said: \`We have ten parts
in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye; why then did
ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back
our king?' And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words
of the men of Israel.
