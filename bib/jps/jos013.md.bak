### JOSHUA CHAPTER 13

<span id="an_jos:13:1">1</span> Now Joshua was old and well stricken in
years; and the LORD said unto him: 'Thou art old and well stricken in
years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed. <span
id="an_jos:13:2">2</span> This is the land that yet remaineth: all the
regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites; <span
id="an_jos:13:3">3</span> from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even
unto the border of Ekron northward—which is counted to the Canaanites;
the five lords of the Philistines: the Gazite, and the Ashdodite, the
Ashkelonite, the Gittite; and the Ekronite; also the Avvim <span
id="an_jos:13:4">4</span> on the south; all the land of the Canaanites,
and Mearah that belongeth to the Zidonians, unto Aphek, to the border of
the Amorites; <span id="an_jos:13:5">5</span> and the land of the
Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baal-gad under
mount Hermon unto the entrance of Hamath; <span
id="an_jos:13:6">6</span> all the inhabitants of the hill-country from
Lebanon unto Misrephoth-maim, even all the Zidonians; them will I drive
out from before the children of Israel; only allot thou it unto Israel
for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee. <span
id="an_jos:13:7">7</span> Now therefore divide this land for an
inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.' <span
id="an_jos:13:8">8</span> With him the Reubenites and the Gadites
received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan
eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them; <span
id="an_jos:13:9">9</span> from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley
of Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the
table-land from Medeba unto Dibon; <span id="an_jos:13:10">10</span> and
all

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, unto
the border of the children of Ammon; <span
id="an_jos:13:11">11</span> and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites
and Maacathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah; <span
id="an_jos:13:12">12</span> all the kingdom of Og in Bastian, who
reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei—the same was left of the remnant of
the Rephaim—for these did Moses smite, and drove them out. <span
id="an_jos:13:13">13</span> Nevertheless the children of Israel drove
not out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites; but Geshur and Maacath
dwelt in the midst of Israel unto this day. <span
id="an_jos:13:14">14</span> Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave no
inheritance; the offerings of the LORD, the God of Israel, made by fire
are his inheritance, as He spoke unto him.

<span id="an_jos:13:15">15</span> And Moses gave unto the tribe of the
children of Reuben according to their families. <span
id="an_jos:13:16">16</span> And their border was from Aroer, that is on
the edge of the valley of Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of
the valley, and all the table-land by Medeba; <span
id="an_jos:13:17">17</span> Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the
table-land; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon; <span
id="an_jos:13:18">18</span> and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath; <span
id="an_jos:13:19">19</span> and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zerethshahar
in the mount of the valley; <span id="an_jos:13:20">20</span> and
Beth-peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth; <span
id="an_jos:13:21">21</span> and all the cities of the table-land, and
all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon,
whom Moses smote with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and
Hur, and Reba, the princes of Sihon, that dwelt in the land. <span
id="an_jos:13:22">22</span> Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer,
did the children of Israel slay with the sword among the rest of their
slain. <span id="an_jos:13:23">23</span> And as for the border of the
children of Reuben, the Jordan was their border. This was the
inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, the
cities and the villages thereof.

<span id="an_jos:13:24">24</span> And Moses gave unto the tribe of Gad,
unto the children of Gad, according to their families. <span
id="an_jos:13:25">25</span> And their border was Jazer, and all the
cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer
that is before Rabbah; <span id="an_jos:13:26">26</span> and from
Heshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the
border of Lidbir; <span id="an_jos:13:27">27</span> and in the valley,
Bethhararn, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the
kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, the Jordan being the border thereof,
unto the uttermost part of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan
eastward. <span id="an_jos:13:28">28</span> This is the inheritance of
the children of Gad according to their families, the cities and the
villages thereof.

<span id="an_jos:13:29">29</span> And Moses gave inheritance unto the
half-tribe of Manasseh; and it was for the half-tribe of the children of
Manasseh according to their families. <span
id="an_jos:13:30">30</span> And their border was from Mahanaim, all
Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the villages of
Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities; <span
id="an_jos:13:31">31</span> and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei,
the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of
Machir the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children of Machir
according to their families.

<span id="an_jos:13:32">32</span> These are the inheritances which Moses
distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho,
eastward. <span id="an_jos:13:33">33</span> But unto the tribe of Levi
Moses gave no inheritance; the LORD, the God of Israel, is their
inheritance, as He spoke unto them.
