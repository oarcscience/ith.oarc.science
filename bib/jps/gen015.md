### GENESIS CHAPTER 15

<span id="an_gen:15:1">1</span> After these things the word of the LORD
came unto Abram in a vision, saying: 'Fear not, Abram, I am thy shield,
thy reward shall be exceeding great.' <span
id="an_gen:15:2">2</span> And Abram said: 'O Lord GOD, what wilt Thou
give me, seeing I go hence childless, and he that shall be possessor of
my house is Eliezer of Damascus?' <span id="an_gen:15:3">3</span> And
Abram said: 'Behold, to me Thou hast given no seed, and, lo, one born in
my house is to be mine heir.' <span id="an_gen:15:4">4</span> And,
behold, the word of the LORD came unto him saying: 'This man shall not
be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels
shall be thine heir.' <span id="an_gen:15:5">5</span> And He brought him
forth abroad, and said: 'Look now toward heaven, and count the stars, if
thou be able to count them'; and He said unto him: 'So shall thy seed
be.' <span id="an_gen:15:6">6</span> And he believed in the LORD; and He
counted it to him for righteousness. <span id="an_gen:15:7">7</span> And
He said unto him: 'I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the
Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.' <span
id="an_gen:15:8">8</span> And he said: 'O Lord GOD, whereby shall I know
that I shall inherit it?' <span id="an_gen:15:9">9</span> And He said
unto him: 'Take Me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three
years old, and a ram of three years old, and <span id="page_17">p.
17</span> a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.' <span
id="an_gen:15:10">10</span> And he took him all these, and divided them
in the midst, and laid each half over against the other; but the birds
divided he not. <span id="an_gen:15:11">11</span> And the birds of prey
came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away. <span
id="an_gen:15:12">12</span> And it came to pass, that, when the sun was
going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and, lo, a dread, even a great
darkness, fell upon him. <span id="an_gen:15:13">13</span> And He said
unto Abram: 'Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a
land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict
them four hundred years; <span id="an_gen:15:14">14</span> and also that
nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge; and afterward shall they
come out with great substance. <span id="an_gen:15:15">15</span> But
thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good
old age. <span id="an_gen:15:16">16</span> And in the fourth generation
they shall come back hither; for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet
full.' <span id="an_gen:15:17">17</span> And it came to pass, that, when
the sun went down, and there was thick darkness, behold a smoking
furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces. <span
id="an_gen:15:18">18</span> In that day the LORD made a covenant with
Abram, saying: 'Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of
Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates; <span
id="an_gen:15:19">19</span> the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the
Kadmonite, <span id="an_gen:15:20">20</span> and the Hittite, and the
Perizzite, and the Rephaim, <span id="an_gen:15:21">21</span> and the
Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.'
