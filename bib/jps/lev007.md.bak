### LEVITICUS CHAPTER 7

<span id="an_lev:7:1">1</span> And this is the law of the
guilt-offering; it is most holy. <span id="an_lev:7:2">2</span> In the
place where they kill the burnt-offering shall they kill the
guilt-offering; and the blood thereof shall be dashed against the altar
round about. <span id="an_lev:7:3">3</span> And he shall offer of it all
the fat thereof: the fat tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards,
<span id="an_lev:7:4">4</span> and the two kidneys, and the fat that is
on them, which is by the loins, and the lobe above the liver, which he
shall take away by the kidneys. <span id="an_lev:7:5">5</span> And the
priest shall make them smoke upon the altar for an offering made by fire
unto the LORD; it is a guilt-offering. <span
id="an_lev:7:6">6</span> Every male among the priests may eat thereof;
it shall be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy. <span
id="an_lev:7:7">7</span> As is the sin-offering, so is the
guilt-offering; there is one law for them; the priest that maketh
atonement therewith, he shall have it. <span
id="an_lev:7:8">8</span> And the priest that offereth any man's
burnt-offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the
burnt-offering which he bath offered. <span id="an_lev:7:9">9</span> And
every meal-offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed
in the stewing-pan, and on the griddle, shall be the priest's that
offereth it. <span id="an_lev:7:10">10</span> And every meal-offering,
mingled with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as well
as another.

<span id="an_lev:7:11">11</span> And this is the law of the sacrifice of
peace-offerings, which one may offer unto the LORD. <span
id="an_lev:7:12">12</span> If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he
shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened <span
id="page_125">p. 125</span> cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened
wafers spread with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour
soaked. <span id="an_lev:7:13">13</span> With cakes of leavened bread he
shall present his offering with the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for
thanksgiving. 14And of it he shall present one out of each offering for
a gift unto the LORD; it shall be the priest's that dasheth the blood of
the peace-offerings against the altar. <span
id="an_lev:7:15">15</span> And the flesh of the sacrifice of his
peace-offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his
offering; he shall not leave any of it until the morning. <span
id="an_lev:7:16">16</span> But if the sacrifice of his offering be a
vow, or a freewill-offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he
offereth his sacrifice; and on the morrow that which remaineth of it may
be eaten. <span id="an_lev:7:17">17</span> But that which remaineth of
the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.
<span id="an_lev:7:18">18</span> And if any of the flesh of the
sacrifice of his peace-offerings be at all eaten on the third day, it
shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that
offereth it; it shall be an abhorred thing, and the soul that eateth of
it shall bear his iniquity. <span id="an_lev:7:19">19</span> And the
flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be
burnt with fire. And as for the flesh, every one that is clean may eat
thereof. <span id="an_lev:7:20">20</span> But the soul that eateth of
the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, that pertain unto the
LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from
his people. <span id="an_lev:7:21">21</span> And when any one shall
touch any unclean thing, whether it be the uncleanness of man, or an
unclean beast, or any unclean detestable thing, and eat of the flesh of
the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, that soul
shall be cut off from his people.

<span id="an_lev:7:22">22</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_lev:7:23">23</span> Speak unto the children of Israel,
saying:

Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat. <span
id="an_lev:7:24">24</span> And the fat of that which dieth of itself,
and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used for any other
service; but ye shall in no wise eat of it. <span
id="an_lev:7:25">25</span> For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of
which men present an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul
that eateth it shall be cut off from his people. <span
id="an_lev:7:26">26</span> And ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether
it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings. <span
id="an_lev:7:27">27</span> Whosoever it be that eateth any blood, that
soul shall be cut off from his people.

<span id="an_lev:7:28">28</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_lev:7:29">29</span> Speak unto the children of Israel,
saying:

He that offereth his sacrifice of peace-offerings unto the LORD shall
bring his offering unto the LORD out of his sacrifice of
peace-offerings. <span id="an_lev:7:30">30</span> His own hands shall
bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire: the fat with the breast
shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave-offering before
the LORD. <span id="an_lev:7:31">31</span> And the priest shall make the
fat smoke upon the altar; but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons’.
<span id="an_lev:7:32">32</span> And the right thigh shall ye give unto
the priest for a heave-offering out of your sacrifices of
peace-offerings. <span id="an_lev:7:33">33</span> He among the sons of
Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace-offerings, and the fat,
shall have the right thigh for a portion. <span
id="an_lev:7:34">34</span> For the breast of waving and the thigh of
heaving have I taken of the children of Israel out of their sacrifices
of peace-offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto
his sons as a due for ever from the children of Israel. <span
id="page_126">p. 126</span>

<span id="an_lev:7:35">35</span> This is the consecrated portion of
Aaron, and the consecrated portion of his sons, out of the offerings of
the LORD made by fire, in the day when they were presented to minister
unto the LORD in the priest's office; <span
id="an_lev:7:36">36</span> which the LORD commanded to be given them of
the children of Israel, in the day that they were anointed. It is a due
for ever throughout their generations.

<span id="an_lev:7:37">37</span> This is the law of the burnt-offering,
of the meal-offering, and of the sin-offering, and of the
guilt-offering, and of the consecration-offering, and of the sacrifice
of peace-offerings; <span id="an_lev:7:38">38</span> which the LORD
commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the
children of Israel to present their offerings unto the LORD, in the
wilderness of Sinai.
