### I SAMUEL CHAPTER 19

<span id="an_sa1:19:1">1</span> And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and
to all his servants, that

they should slay David; but Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David.
<span id="an_sa1:19:2">2</span> And Jonathan told David, saying: \`Saul
my father seeketh to slay thee; now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to
thyself in the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself.
<span id="an_sa1:19:3">3</span> And I will go out and stand beside my
father in the field where thou art, and I will speak with my father of
thee; and if I see aught, I will tell thee.'

<span id="an_sa1:19:4">4</span> And Jonathan spoke good of David unto
Saul his father, and said unto him: \`Let not the king sin against his
servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and
because his work hath been very good towards thee; <span
id="an_sa1:19:5">5</span> for he put his life in his hand, and smote the
Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great victory for all Israel; thou
sawest it, and didst rejoice; wherefore then wilt thou sin against
innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?' <span
id="an_sa1:19:6">6</span> And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan;
and Saul swore: \`As the LORD liveth, he shall not be put to death.'
<span id="an_sa1:19:7">7</span> And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan
told him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he
was in his presence, as beforetime.

<span id="an_sa1:19:8">8</span> And there was war again; and David went
out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great
slaughter; and they fled before him. <span id="an_sa1:19:9">9</span> And
an evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with
his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand. <span
id="an_sa1:19:10">10</span> And Saul sought to smite David even to the
wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he
smote the spear into the wall; and David fled, and escaped that night.
<span id="an_sa1:19:11">11</span> And Saul sent messengers unto David's
house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning; and Michal David's
wife told him, saying: \`If thou save not thy life to-night,

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

to-morrow thou shalt be slain.' <span id="an_sa1:19:12">12</span> So
Michal let David down through the window; and he went, and fled, and
escaped. <span id="an_sa1:19:13">13</span> And Michal took the teraphim,
and laid it in the bed, and put a quilt of goats' hair at the head
thereof, and covered it with a cloth. <span
id="an_sa1:19:14">14</span> And when Saul sent messengers to take David,
she said: \`He is sick.' <span id="an_sa1:19:15">15</span> And Saul sent
the messengers to see David, saying: \`Bring him up to me in the bed,
that I may slay him.' <span id="an_sa1:19:16">16</span> And when the
messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the quilt
of goats' hair at the head thereof. <span
id="an_sa1:19:17">17</span> And Saul said unto Michal: \`Why hast thou
deceived me thus, and let mine enemy go, that he is escaped?' And Michal
answered Saul: \`He said unto me: Let me go; why should I kill thee?'

<span id="an_sa1:19:18">18</span> Now David fled, and escaped, and came
to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he
and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth. <span
id="an_sa1:19:19">19</span> And it was told Saul, saying: \`Behold,
David is at Naioth in Ramah.' <span id="an_sa1:19:20">20</span> And Saul
sent messengers to take David; and when they saw the company of the
prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the spirit
of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied. <span
id="an_sa1:19:21">21</span> And when it was told Saul, he sent other
messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the
third time, and they also prophesied. <span
id="an_sa1:19:22">22</span> Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the
great cistern that is in Secu; and he asked and said: \`Where are Samuel
and David?' And one said: \`Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.' <span
id="an_sa1:19:23">23</span> And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah; and
the spirit of God came upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied,
until he came to

Naioth in Ramah. <span id="an_sa1:19:24">24</span> And he also stripped
off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down
naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say: \`Is Saul
also among the prophets?'
