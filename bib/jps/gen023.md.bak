### GENESIS CHAPTER 23

<span id="an_gen:23:1">1</span> And the life of Sarah was a hundred and
seven and twenty years; these were the years of the life of Sarah. <span
id="an_gen:23:2">2</span> And Sarah died in Kiriatharba—the same is
Hebron—in the land of Canaan; and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and
to weep for her. <span id="an_gen:23:3">3</span> And Abraham rose up
from before his dead, and spoke unto the children of Heth, saying: <span
id="an_gen:23:4">4</span> 'I am a stranger and a sojourner with you;
give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my
dead out of my sight.' <span id="an_gen:23:5">5</span> And the children
of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him: <span
id="an_gen:23:6">6</span> 'Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince
among us; in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us
shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy
dead.' <span id="an_gen:23:7">7</span> And Abraham rose up, and bowed
down to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth. <span
id="an_gen:23:8">8</span> And he spoke with them, saying: 'If it be your
mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat
for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, <span id="an_gen:23:9">9</span> that
he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end
of his field; for the full price let him give it to me in the midst of
you for a possession of a burying-place.' <span
id="an_gen:23:10">10</span> Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the
children of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing
of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his
city, saying: <span id="an_gen:23:11">11</span> 'Nay, my lord, hear me:
the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in
the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee; bury thy dead.'
<span id="an_gen:23:12">12</span> And Abraham bowed down before the
people of the land. <span id="an_gen:23:13">13</span> And he spoke unto
Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying: 'But if thou
wilt, I pray thee, hear me: I will give the price of the field; take it
of me, and I will bury my dead there.' <span
id="an_gen:23:14">14</span> And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto
him: <span id="an_gen:23:15">15</span> 'My lord, hearken unto me: a
piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that betwixt
me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.' <span
id="an_gen:23:16">16</span> And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and
Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the hearing
of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money
with the merchant. <span id="an_gen:23:17">17</span> So the field of
Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and
the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field,
that were in all the border thereof <span id="page_26">p. 26</span>
round about, were made sure <span id="an_gen:23:18">18</span> unto
Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before
all that went in at the gate of his city. <span
id="an_gen:23:19">19</span> And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his
wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre—the same is
Hebron—in the land of Canaan. <span id="an_gen:23:20">20</span> And the
field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a
possession of a burying-place by the children of Heth.
