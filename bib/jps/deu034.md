### DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER 34

 

<span id="an_deu:34:1">1</span> And Moses went up from the plains of
Moab unto mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against
Jericho. And the LORD showed him all the land, even Gilead as far as
Dan; <span id="an_deu:34:2">2</span> and all Naphtali, and

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah as far as
the hinder sea; <span id="an_deu:34:3">3</span> and the South, and the
Plain, even the valley of Jericho the city of palm-trees, as far as
Zoar. <span id="an_deu:34:4">4</span> And the LORD said unto him: \`This
is the land which I swore unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob,
saying: I will give it unto thy seed; I have caused thee to see it with
thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.' <span
id="an_deu:34:5">5</span> So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in
the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD. <span
id="an_deu:34:6">6</span> And he was buried in the valley in the land of
Moab over against Beth-peor; and no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto
this day. <span id="an_deu:34:7">7</span> And Moses was a hundred and
twenty years old when he died; his eye was not dim, nor his natural
force abated. <span id="an_deu:34:8">8</span> And the children of Israel
wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; so the days of weeping
in the mourning for Moses were ended. <span
id="an_deu:34:9">9</span> And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the
spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the
children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded
Moses. <span id="an_deu:34:10">10</span> And there hath not arisen a
prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to
face; <span id="an_deu:34:11">11</span> in all the signs and the
wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh,
and to all his servants, and to all his land; <span
id="an_deu:34:12">12</span> and in all the mighty hand, and in all the
great terror, which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.
