### I Kings Chapter 17

<span id="an_kg1:17:1">1</span> And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the
settlers of Gilead, said unto Ahab: \`As the LORD, the God of Israel,
liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these
years, but according to my word.' <span id="an_kg1:17:2">2</span> And
the word of the LORD came unto him, saying: <span
id="an_kg1:17:3">3</span> \`Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and
hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan. <span
id="an_kg1:17:4">4</span> And it

<span id="page_430">p. 430</span>

shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the
ravens to feed thee there.' <span id="an_kg1:17:5">5</span> So he went
and did according unto the word of the LORD; for he went and dwelt by
the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan. <span
id="an_kg1:17:6">6</span> And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in
the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the
brook. <span id="an_kg1:17:7">7</span> And it came to pass after a
while, that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.

<span id="an_kg1:17:8">8</span> And the word of the LORD came unto him,
saying: <span id="an_kg1:17:9">9</span> 'Arise, get thee to Zarephath,
which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there; behold, I have commanded a
widow there to sustain thee.' <span id="an_kg1:17:10">10</span> So he
arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city,
behold, a widow was there gathering sticks; and he called to her, and
said: \`Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may
drink.' <span id="an_kg1:17:11">11</span> And as she was going to fetch
it, he called to her, and said: \`Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of
bread in thy hand.' <span id="an_kg1:17:12">12</span> And she said: \`As
the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, only a handful of meal in
the jar, and a little oil in the cruse; and, behold, I am gathering two
sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat
it, and die.' <span id="an_kg1:17:13">13</span> And Elijah said unto
her: \`Fear not; go and do as thou hast said; but make me thereof a
little cake first, and bring it forth unto me, and afterward make for
thee and for thy son. <span id="an_kg1:17:14">14</span> For thus saith
the LORD, the God of Israel: The jar of meal shall not be spent, neither
shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain
upon the land.' <span id="an_kg1:17:15">15</span> And she went and did
according to the saying of Elijah; and she, and he, and her house, did
eat many days. <span id="an_kg1:17:16">16</span> The jar of meal was not
spent, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the
LORD, which He spoke by Elijah.

<span id="an_kg1:17:17">17</span> And it came to pass after these
things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick;
and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.
<span id="an_kg1:17:18">18</span> And she said unto Elijah: \`What have
I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to bring my
sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?' <span
id="an_kg1:17:19">19</span> And he said unto her: \`Give me thy son.'
And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the upper
chamber, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed. <span
id="an_kg1:17:20">20</span> And he cried unto the LORD, and said: \`O
LORD my God, hast Thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I
sojourn, by slaying her son?' <span id="an_kg1:17:21">21</span> And he
stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD,
and said: \`O LORD my God, I pray Thee, let this child's soul come back
into him.' <span id="an_kg1:17:22">22</span> And the LORD hearkened unto
the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came back into him, and
he revived. <span id="an_kg1:17:23">23</span> And Elijah took the child,
and brought him down out of the upper chamber into the house, and
delivered him unto his mother; and Elijah said: \`See, thy son liveth.'
<span id="an_kg1:17:24">24</span> And the woman said to Elijah: \`Now I
know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy
mouth is truth.'
