### LEVITICUS CHAPTER 20

<span id="an_lev:20:1">1</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_lev:20:2">2</span> Moreover, thou shalt say to the children
of Israel: <span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that
sojourn in Israel, that giveth of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely
be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones.
<span id="an_lev:20:3">3</span> I also will set My face against that
man, and will cut him off from among his people, because he hath given
of his seed unto Molech, to defile My sanctuary, and to profane My holy
name. <span id="an_lev:20:4">4</span> And if the people of the land do
at all hide their eyes from that man, when he giveth of his seed unto
Molech, and put him not to death; <span id="an_lev:20:5">5</span> then I
will set My face against that man, and against his family, and will cut
him off, and all that go astray after him, to go astray after Molech,
from among their people. <span id="an_lev:20:6">6</span> And the soul
that turneth unto the ghosts, and unto the familiar spirits, to go
astray after them, I will even set My face against that soul, and will
cut him off from among his people. <span
id="an_lev:20:7">7</span> Sanctify yourselves therefore, and he ye holy;
for I am the LORD your God. <span id="an_lev:20:8">8</span> And keep ye
My statutes, and do them: I am the LORD who sanctify you. <span
id="an_lev:20:9">9</span> For whatsoever man there be that curseth his
father or his mother shall surely be put to death; he hath cursed his
father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him. <span
id="an_lev:20:10">10</span> And the man that committeth adultery with
another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his
neighbour's wife, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be
put to death. <span id="an_lev:20:11">11</span> And the man that lieth
with his father's wife—he hath uncovered his father's nakedness—both of
them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. <span
id="an_lev:20:12">12</span> And if a man lie with his daughter-in-law,
both of them shall surely be put to death; they have wrought corruption;
their blood shall be upon them. <span id="an_lev:20:13">13</span> And if
a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed
abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be
upon them. <span id="an_lev:20:14">14</span> And if a man take with his
wife also her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire,
both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you. <span
id="an_lev:20:15">15</span> And if a man lie with a beast, he shall
surely be put to death; and ye shall slay the beast. <span
id="an_lev:20:16">16</span> And if a woman approach unto any beast, and
lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall
surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. <span
id="an_lev:20:17">17</span> And if a man shall take his sister, his
father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and
she see his nakedness: it is a shameful thing; and they shall be cut off
in the sight of the children of their people: he hath uncovered his
sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity. <span
id="an_lev:20:18">18</span> And if a man shall lie with a woman having
her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness—he hath made naked her
fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood—both of them
shall be cut off from among their people. <span
id="an_lev:20:19">19</span> And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of
thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister; for he hath made naked
his near kin; they shall bear their iniquity. <span
id="an_lev:20:20">20</span> And if a man shall lie with his uncle's
wife—he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness—they shall bear their sin;
they shall die childless. <span id="an_lev:20:21">21</span> And if a man
shall take his brother's wife, it is impurity: he hath uncovered his
brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.

<span id="an_lev:20:22">22</span> Ye shall therefore keep all My
statutes, and all Mine ordinances, and do them, that the land, whither I
bring you to dwell therein, vomit <span id="page_145">p. 145</span> you
not out. <span id="an_lev:20:23">23</span> And ye shall not walk in the
customs of the nation, which I am casting out before you; for they did
all these things, and therefore I abhorred them. <span
id="an_lev:20:24">24</span> But I have said unto you: 'Ye shall inherit
their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land flowing
with milk and honey.' I am the LORD your God, who have set you apart
from the peoples. <span id="an_lev:20:25">25</span> Ye shall therefore
separate between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the
unclean fowl and the clean; and ye shall not make your souls detestable
by beast, or by fowl, or by any thing wherewith the ground teemeth,
which I have set apart for you to hold unclean. <span
id="an_lev:20:26">26</span> And ye shall be holy unto Me; for I the LORD
am holy, and have set you apart from the peoples, that ye should be
Mine.

<span id="an_lev:20:27">27</span> A man also or a woman that divineth by
a ghost or a familiar spirit, shall surely be put to death; they shall
stone them with stones; their blood shall be upon them.
