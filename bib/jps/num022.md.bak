### NUMBERS CHAPTER 22

<span id="an_num:22:1">1</span> And the children of Israel journeyed,
and pitched in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.

‏בלק‎

<span id="an_num:22:2">2</span> And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that
Israel had done to the Amorites. <span id="an_num:22:3">3</span> And
Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many; and Moab was
overcome with dread because of the children of Israel. <span
id="an_num:22:4">4</span> And Moab said unto the elders of Midian: \`Now
will this multitude lick up all that is round about us, as the ox
licketh up the grass of the field.'—And Balak the son of Zippor was king
of Moab at that time.— <span id="an_num:22:5">5</span> And he sent
messengers unto Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the
River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying:
\`Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt; behold, they cover the
face of the earth, and they abide over against me. <span
id="an_num:22:6">6</span> Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this
people; for they are too mighty for me; peradventure I shall prevail,
that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I
know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is
cursed.' <span id="an_num:22:7">7</span> And the elders of Moab and the
elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand;
and they came unto Balaam, and spoke unto him the words of Balak. <span
id="an_num:22:8">8</span> And he said unto them: \`Lodge here this
night, and I will bring you back word, as the LORD may speak unto me';
and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam. <span
id="an_num:22:9">9</span> And God came unto Balaam, and said: \`What men
are these with thee?' <span id="an_num:22:10">10</span> And Balaam said
unto God: \`Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me
\[,saying\]: <span id="an_num:22:11">11</span> Behold the people that is
come out of Egypt, it covereth the face of the earth; now, come curse me
them; peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall
drive them out.' <span id="an_num:22:12">12</span> And God said unto
Balaam: \`Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people;
for they are blessed.' <span id="an_num:22:13">13</span> And Balaam rose
up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak: \`Get you into
your land; for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.' <span
id="an_num:22:14">14</span> And the princes of Moab rose up, and they
went unto Balak, and said: \`Balaam refuseth to come with us.' <span
id="an_num:22:15">15</span> And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and
more honourable than they. <span id="an_num:22:16">16</span> And they
came to Balaam, and said to him: \`Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor:
Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me; <span
id="an_num:22:17">17</span> for I will promote

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

thee unto very great honour, and whatsoever thou sayest unto me I will
do; come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.' <span
id="an_num:22:18">18</span> And Balaam answered and said unto the
servants of Balak: \`If Balak would give me his house full of silver and
gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do any thing,
small or great. <span id="an_num:22:19">19</span> Now therefore, I pray
you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will
speak unto me more.' <span id="an_num:22:20">20</span> And God came unto
Balaam at night, and said unto him: \`If the men are come to call thee,
rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak unto thee, that
shalt thou do.' <span id="an_num:22:21">21</span> And Balaam rose up in
the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
<span id="an_num:22:22">22</span> And God's anger was kindled because he
went; and the angel of the LORD placed himself in the way for an
adversary against him.— Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two
servants were with him.— <span id="an_num:22:23">23</span> And the ass
saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, with his sword drawn in
his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the
field; and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way. <span
id="an_num:22:24">24</span> Then the angel of the LORD stood in a hollow
way between the vineyards, a fence being on this side, and a fence on
that side. <span id="an_num:22:25">25</span> And the ass saw the angel
of the LORD, and she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's
foot against the wall; and he smote her again. <span
id="an_num:22:26">26</span> And the angel of the LORD went further, and
stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right
hand or to the left. <span id="an_num:22:27">27</span> And the ass saw
the angel of the LORD, and she lay down under Balaam; and Balaam's anger
was kindled, and he smote the ass with his staff. <span
id="an_num:22:28">28</span> And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass,
and she said unto Balaam: \`What have I done unto thee, that thou hast
smitten me these three times?' <span id="an_num:22:29">29</span> And
Balaam said unto the ass: \`Because thou hast mocked me; I would there
were a sword in my hand, for now I had killed thee.' <span
id="an_num:22:30">30</span> And the ass said unto Balaam: \`Am not I
thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden all thy life long unto this day?
was I ever wont to do so unto thee?' And he said: \`Nay.' <span
id="an_num:22:31">31</span> Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and
he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, with his sword drawn
in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face. <span
id="an_num:22:32">32</span> And the angel of the LORD said unto him:
\`Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I am
come forth for an adversary, because thy way is contrary unto me; <span
id="an_num:22:33">33</span> and the ass saw me, and turned aside before
me these three times; unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I
had even slain thee, and saved her alive.' <span
id="an_num:22:34">34</span> And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD:
\`I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against
me; now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back.' <span
id="an_num:22:35">35</span> And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam:
\`Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that
thou shalt speak.' So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. <span
id="an_num:22:36">36</span> And when Balak heard that Balaam was come,
he went out to meet him unto Ir-moab, which is on the border of Arnon,
which is in the utmost part of the border. <span
id="an_num:22:37">37</span> And Balak said unto Balaam: \`Did I not
earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto
me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?' <span
id="an_num:22:38">38</span> And Balaam said unto Balak:

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

\`Lo, I am come unto thee; have I now any power at all to speak any
thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.' <span
id="an_num:22:39">39</span> And Balaam went with Balak, and they came
unto Kiriath-huzoth. <span id="an_num:22:40">40</span> And Balak
sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that
were with him. <span id="an_num:22:41">41</span> And it came to pass in
the morning that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into Bamoth-baal,
and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people.

<span id="an_num:23:1">1</span> And Balaam said unto Balak: \`Build me
here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.'
<span id="an_num:23:2">2</span> And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and
Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram. <span
id="an_num:23:3">3</span> And Balaam said unto Balak: \`Stand by thy
burnt-offering, and I will go; peradventure the LORD will come to meet
me; and whatsoever He showeth me I will tell thee.' And he went to a
bare height. <span id="an_num:23:4">4</span> And. God met Balaam; and he
said unto Him: \`I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up
a bullock and a ram on every altar. <span id="an_num:23:5">5</span> And
the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said: \`Return unto Balak,
and thus thou shalt speak.' <span id="an_num:23:6">6</span> And he
returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt-offering, he, and all
the princes of Moab. <span id="an_num:23:7">7</span> And he took up his
parable, and said:

From Aram Balak bringeth me,  
The king of Moab from the mountains of the East:  
\`Come, curse me Jacob,  
And come, execrate Israel.'  
<span id="an_num:23:8">8</span> How shall I curse, whom God hath not
cursed?  
And how shall I execrate, whom the LORD hath not execrated?  
<span id="an_num:23:9">9</span> For from the top of the rocks I see
him,  
And from the hills I behold him:  
Lo, it is a people that shall dwell alone,  
And shall not be reckoned among the nations.  
<span id="an_num:23:10">10</span> Who hath counted the dust of Jacob,  
Or numbered the stock of Israel?  
Let me die the death of the righteous,  
And let mine end be like his!

<span id="an_num:23:11">11</span> And Balak said unto Balaam: \`What
hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold,
thou hast blessed them altogether.' <span
id="an_num:23:12">12</span> And he answered and said: \`Must I not take
heed to speak that which the LORD putteth in my mouth?' <span
id="an_num:23:13">13</span> And Balak said unto him: \`Come, I pray
thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou
shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all; and
curse me them from thence.' <span id="an_num:23:14">14</span> And he
took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven
altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. <span
id="an_num:23:15">15</span> And he said unto Balak: \`Stand here by thy
burnt-offering, while I go toward a meeting yonder.' <span
id="an_num:23:16">16</span> And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in
his mouth, and said: \`Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.'
<span id="an_num:23:17">17</span> And he came to him, and, lo, he stood
by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said
unto him: \`What hath the LORD spoken?' <span
id="an_num:23:18">18</span> And he took up his parable, and said:

Arise, Balak, and hear;  
Give ear unto me, thou son of Zippor:  
<span id="an_num:23:19">19</span> God is not a man, that He should
lie;  
Neither the son of man, that He should repent: <span id="page_193">p.
193</span>  
When He hath said, will He not do it?  
Or when He hath spoken, will He not make it good?  
<span id="an_num:23:20">20</span> Behold, I am bidden to bless;  
And when He hath blessed, I cannot call it back.  
<span id="an_num:23:21">21</span> None hath beheld iniquity in Jacob,  
Neither hath one seen perverseness in Israel;  
The LORD his God is with him,  
And the shouting for the King is among them.  
<span id="an_num:23:22">22</span> God who brought them forth out of
Egypt  
Is for them like the lofty horns of the wild-ox.  
<span id="an_num:23:23">23</span> For there is no enchantment with
Jacob,  
Neither is there any divination with Israel;  
Now is it said of Jacob and of Israel:  
\`What hath God wrought!'  
<span id="an_num:23:24">24</span> Behold a people that riseth up as a
lioness,  
And as a lion Both he lift himself up;  
He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey,  
And drink the blood of the slain.

<span id="an_num:23:25">25</span> And Balak said unto Balaam: \`Neither
curse them at all, nor bless them at all.' <span
id="an_num:23:26">26</span> But Balaam answered and said unto Balak:
\`Told not I thee, saying: All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?'
<span id="an_num:23:27">27</span> And Balak said unto Balaam: \`Come
now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please
God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.' <span
id="an_num:23:28">28</span> And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor,
that looketh down upon the desert. <span id="an_num:23:29">29</span> And
Balaam said unto Balak: \`Build me here seven altars, and prepare me
here seven bullocks and seven rams.' <span
id="an_num:23:30">30</span> And Balak did as Balaam had said, and
offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.
