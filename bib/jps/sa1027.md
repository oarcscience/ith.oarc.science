### I SAMUEL CHAPTER 27

<span id="an_sa1:27:1">1</span> And David said in his heart: \`I shall
now be swept away one day by the hand of Saul; there is nothing better
for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and
Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of
Israel; so shall I escape out of his hand.' <span
id="an_sa1:27:2">2</span> And David arose, and passed over, he and the
six hundred men that were with him, unto Achish the son of Maoch, king
of Gath. <span id="an_sa1:27:3">3</span> And David dwelt with Achish at
Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his
two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess,
Nabal's wife. <span id="an_sa1:27:4">4</span> And it was told Saul that
David was fled to Gath; and he sought no more again for him.

<span id="an_sa1:27:5">5</span> And David said unto Achish: \`If now I
have found favour in thine eyes, let them give me a place in one of the
cities in the country, that I may dwell there; for why should thy
servant dwell in the royal city with thee?' <span
id="an_sa1:27:6">6</span> Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day;
wherefore Ziklag belongeth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

<span id="an_sa1:27:7">7</span> And the number of the days that David
dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
<span id="an_sa1:27:8">8</span> And David and his men went up, and made
a raid upon the Geshurites, and the Gizrites, and the Amalekites; for
those were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as thou goest
to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt. <span
id="an_sa1:27:9">9</span> And David smote the land, and left neither man
nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses,
and the camels, and the apparel. And he returned, and came to Achish.
<span id="an_sa1:27:10">10</span> And Achish said: \`Whither have ye
made a raid to-day?' And David said: \`Against the South of Judah, and
against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the
Kenites.' <span id="an_sa1:27:11">11</span> And David left neither man
nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying: \`Lest they should tell
on us, saying: So did David, and so hath been his manner all the while
he hath dwelt in the country of the Philistines.' <span
id="an_sa1:27:12">12</span> And Achish believed David, saying: \`He hath
made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my
servant for ever.'
