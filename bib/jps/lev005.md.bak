### LEVITICUS CHAPTER 5

<span id="an_lev:5:1">1</span> And if any one sin, in that he heareth
the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he hath seen or
known, if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity; <span
id="an_lev:5:2">2</span> or if any one touch any unclean thing, whether
it be the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean cattle,
or the carcass of unclean swarming things, and be guilty, it being
hidden from him that he is unclean; <span id="an_lev:5:3">3</span> or if
he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever his uncleanness be wherewith
he is unclean, and it be hid from him; and, when he knoweth of it, be
guilty; <span id="an_lev:5:4">4</span> or if any one swear clearly with
his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall
utter clearly with an oath, and it be hid from him; and, when he knoweth
of it, be guilty in one of these things; <span
id="an_lev:5:5">5</span> and it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one
of these things, that he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned;
<span id="an_lev:5:6">6</span> and he shall bring his forfeit unto the
LORD for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb
or a goat; for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for
him as concerning his sin. <span id="an_lev:5:7">7</span> And if his
means suffice not for a lamb, then he shall bring his forfeit for that
wherein he hath sinned, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the
LORD: one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering. <span
id="an_lev:5:8">8</span> And he shall bring them unto the priest, who
shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and pinch off its
head close by its neck, but shall not divide it asunder. <span
id="an_lev:5:9">9</span> And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the
sin-offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall
be drained out at the base of the altar; it is a sin-offering. <span
id="an_lev:5:10">10</span> And he shall prepare the second for a
burnt-offering, according to the ordinance; and the priest shall make
atonement for him as concerning his sin which he hath sinned, and he
shall be forgiven.

<span id="an_lev:5:11">11</span> But if his means suffice not for two
turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, then he shall bring his offering for
that wherein he hath sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour
for a sin-offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put
any frankincense thereon; for it is a sin-offering. <span
id="an_lev:5:12">12</span> And he shall bring it to the priest, and the
priest shall take his handful of it as the memorial-part thereof, and
make it smoke on the altar, upon the offerings of the LORD made by fire;
it is a sin-offering. <span id="an_lev:5:13">13</span> And the priest
shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in
any of these things, and he shall be forgiven; and the remnant shall be
the priest's, as the meal-offering,

<span id="an_lev:5:14">14</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_lev:5:15">15</span> If any one commit a trespass, and sin
through error, in the holy things of the LORD, then he shall bring his
forfeit unto the LORD, a rain without blemish out of the flock,
according to thy valuation in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the
sanctuary, for a guilt-offering. <span id="an_lev:5:16">16</span> And he
shall make <span id="page_123">p. 123</span> restitution for that which
he hath done amiss in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part
thereto, and give it unto the priest; and the priest shall make
atonement for him with the ram of the guilt-offering, and he shall be
forgiven.

<span id="an_lev:5:17">17</span> And if any one sin, and do any of the
things which the LORD hath commanded not to be done, though he know it
not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity. <span
id="an_lev:5:18">18</span> And he shall bring a ram without blemish out
of the flock, according to thy valuation, for a guilt-offering, unto the
priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning the error
which he committed, though he knew it not, and he shall be forgiven.
<span id="an_lev:5:19">19</span> It is a guilt-offering—he is certainly
guilty before the LORD.

<span id="an_lev:5:20">20</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_lev:5:21">21</span> If any one sin, and commit a trespass
against the LORD, and deal falsely with his neighbour in a matter of
deposit, or of pledge, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbour;
<span id="an_lev:5:22">22</span> or have found that which was lost, and
deal falsely therein, and swear to a lie; in any of all these that a man
doeth, sinning therein; <span id="an_lev:5:23">23</span> then it shall
be, if he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which
he took by robbery, or the thing which he hath gotten by oppression, or
the deposit which was deposited with him, or the lost thing which he
found, <span id="an_lev:5:24">24</span> or any thing about which he hath
sworn falsely, he shall even restore it in full, and shall add the fifth
part more thereto; unto him to whom it appertaineth shall he give it, in
the day of his being guilty. <span id="an_lev:5:25">25</span> And he
shall bring his forfeit unto the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the
flock, according to. thy valuation, for a guilt-offering, unto the
priest. <span id="an_lev:5:26">26</span> And the priest shall make
atonement for him before the LORD, and he shall be forgiven, concerning
whatsoever he doeth so as to be guilty thereby.
