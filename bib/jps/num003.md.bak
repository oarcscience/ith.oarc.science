### NUMBERS CHAPTER 3

<span id="an_num:3:1">1</span> Now these are the generations of Aaron
and Moses in the day that the LORD spoke with Moses in mount Sinai.
<span id="an_num:3:2">2</span> And these are the names of the sons of
Aaron: Nadab the first-born, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. <span
id="an_num:3:3">3</span> These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the
priests that were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the
priest's office. <span id="an_num:3:4">4</span> And Nadab and Abihu died
before the LORD, when they offered strange fire before the LORD, in the
wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children; and Eleazar and Ithamar
ministered in the priest's office in the presence of Aaron their father.

<span id="an_num:3:5">5</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_num:3:6">6</span> 'Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set
them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him. <span
id="an_num:3:7">7</span> And they shall keep his charge, and the charge
of the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, to do the service
of the tabernacle. <span id="an_num:3:8">8</span> And they shall keep
all the furniture of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the children
of Israel, to do the service of <span id="page_161">p. 161</span> the
tabernacle. <span id="an_num:3:9">9</span> And thou shalt give the
Levites unto Aaron and to his sons; they are wholly given unto him from
the children of Israel. <span id="an_num:3:10">10</span> And thou shalt
appoint Aaron and his sons, that they may keep their priesthood; and the
common man that draweth nigh shall be put to death.'

<span id="an_num:3:11">11</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_num:3:12">12</span> 'And I, behold, I have taken the
Levites from among the children of Israel instead of every first-born
that openeth the womb among the children of Israel; and the Levites
shall be Mine; <span id="an_num:3:13">13</span> for all the firstborn
are Mine: on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of
Egypt I hallowed unto Me all the first-born in Israel, both man and
beast, Mine they shall be: I am the LORD.'

<span id="an_num:3:14">14</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses in the
wilderness of Sinai, saying: <span id="an_num:3:15">15</span> 'Number
the children of Levi by their fathers’ houses, by their families; every
male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them.' <span
id="an_num:3:16">16</span> And Moses numbered them according to the word
of the LORD, as he was commanded. <span id="an_num:3:17">17</span> And
these were the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, and Kohath, and
Merari. <span id="an_num:3:18">18</span> And these are the names of the
sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei. <span
id="an_num:3:19">19</span> And the sons of Kohath by their families:
Amram and Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. <span id="an_num:3:20">20</span> And
the sons of Merari by their families: Mahli and Mushi. These are the
families of the Levites according to their fathers’ houses.

<span id="an_num:3:21">21</span> Of Gershon was the family of the
Libnites, and the family of the Shimeites; these are the families of the
Gershonites. "Those that were numbered of them, according to the number
of all the males, from a month old and upward, even those that were
numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred. <span
id="an_num:3:23">23</span> The families of the Gershonites were to pitch
behind the tabernacle westward; <span id="an_num:3:24">24</span> the
prince of the fathers’ house of the Gershonites being Eliasaph the son
of Lael, <span id="an_num:3:25">25</span> and the charge of the sons of
Gershon in the tent of meeting the tabernacle, and the Tent, the
covering thereof, and the screen for the door of the tent of meeting,
<span id="an_num:3:26">26</span> and the hangings of the court, and the
screen for the door of the court—which is by the tabernacle, and by the
altar, round about—and the cords of it, even whatsoever pertaineth to
the service thereof.

<span id="an_num:3:27">27</span> And of Kohath was the family of the
Amramites, and the family of the Izharites, and the family of the
Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites; these are the families of
the Kohathites: <span id="an_num:3:28">28</span> according to the number
of all the males, from a month old and upward, eight thousand and six
hundred, keepers of the charge of the sanctuary. <span
id="an_num:3:29">29</span> The families of the sons of Kohath were to
pitch on the side of the tabernacle southward; <span
id="an_num:3:30">30</span> the prince of the fathers’ house of the
families of the Kohathites being Elizaphan the son of Uzziel, <span
id="an_num:3:31">31</span> and their charge the ark, and the table, and
the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary
wherewith the priests minister, and the screen, and all that pertaineth
to the service thereof; <span id="an_num:3:32">32</span> Eleazar the son
of Aaron the priest being prince of the princes of the Levites, and
having the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary.

<span id="an_num:3:33">33</span> Of Merari was the family of the
Mahlites, and the family of the Mushites; these are the families of
Merari. <span id="an_num:3:34">34</span> And those that were numbered of
them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and
upward, <span id="page_162">p. 162</span> were six thousand and two
hundred; <span id="an_num:3:35">35</span> the prince of the fathers’
house of the families of Merari being Zuriel the son of Abihail; they
were to pitch on the side of the tabernacle northward; <span
id="an_num:3:36">36</span> the appointed charge of the sons of Merari
being the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the
pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the instruments
thereof, and all that pertaineth to the service thereof; <span
id="an_num:3:37">37</span> and the pillars of the court round about, and
their sockets, and their pins, and their cords. <span
id="an_num:3:38">38</span> And those that were to pitch before the
tabernacle eastward, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrising,
were Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary,
even the charge for the children of Israel; and the common man that drew
nigh was to be put to death. <span id="an_num:3:39">39</span> All that
were numbered of the Levites, whom and Aaron numbered at the commandment
of the LORD, by their families, all the males from a month old and
upward, were twenty and two thousand.

<span id="an_num:3:40">40</span> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Number
all the first-born males of the children of Israel from a month old and
upward, and take the number of their names. <span
id="an_num:3:41">41</span> And thou shalt take the Levites for Me, even
the LORD, instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel;
and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the
cattle of the children of Israel.' <span id="an_num:3:42">42</span> And
Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the first-born among the
children of Israel. <span id="an_num:3:43">43</span> And all the
first-born males according to the number of names, from a month old and
upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two
thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen.

<span id="an_num:3:44">44</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_num:3:45">45</span> 'Take the Levites instead of all the
first-born among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites
instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be Mine, even the LORD'S.
<span id="an_num:3:46">46</span> And as for the redemption of the two
hundred and threescore and thirteen of the first-born of the children of
Israel, that are over and above the number of the Levites, <span
id="an_num:3:47">47</span> thou shalt take five shekels apiece by the
poll; after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them—the shekel
is twenty gerahs. <span id="an_num:3:48">48</span> And thou shalt give
the money wherewith they that remain over of them are redeemed unto
Aaron and to his sons.' <span id="an_num:3:49">49</span> And Moses took
the redemption-money from them that were over and above them that were
redeemed by the Levites; <span id="an_num:3:50">50</span> from the
first-born of the children of Israel m took he the money: a thousand
three hundred and threescore and five shekels, after the shekel of the
sanctuary. <span id="an_num:3:51">51</span> And Moses gave the
redemption-money unto Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of
the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.
