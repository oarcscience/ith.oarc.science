### GENESIS CHAPTER 4

<span id="an_gen:4:1">1</span> And the man knew Eve his wife; and she
conceived and bore Cain, and said: 'I have  <span
id="fr_9"></span>[b](#fn_8.md) gotten a man with the help of the LORD.'
<span id="an_gen:4:2">2</span> And again she bore his brother Abel. And
Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. <span
id="an_gen:4:3">3</span> And in process of time it came to pass, that
Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. <span
id="an_gen:4:4">4</span> And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of
his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and
to his offering; <span id="an_gen:4:5">5</span> but unto Cain and to his
offering He had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his
countenance fell. <span id="an_gen:4:6">6</span> And the LORD said unto
Cain: 'Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? <span
id="an_gen:4:7">7</span> If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up?
and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door; and unto thee is
its desire, but thou mayest rule over it.' <span
id="an_gen:4:8">8</span> And Cain spoke unto Abel his brother. And it
came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against
Abel his brother, and slew him.

<span id="an_gen:4:9">9</span> And the LORD said unto Cain: 'Where is
Abel thy brother?' And he said: 'I know not; am I my brother's keeper?'
<span id="an_gen:4:10">10</span> And He said: 'What hast thou done? the
voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto Me from the ground. <span
id="an_gen:4:11">11</span> And now cursed art thou from the ground,
which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy
hand. <span id="an_gen:4:12">12</span> When thou tillest the ground, it
shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a
wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.' <span
id="an_gen:4:13">13</span> And Cain said unto the LORD: 'My punishment
is greater than I can bear. <span id="an_gen:4:14">14</span> Behold,
Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the land; and from Thy
face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the
earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay
me.' <span id="an_gen:4:15">15</span> And the LORD said unto him: <span
id="page_7">p. 7</span> 'Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance
shall be taken on him sevenfold.' And the LORD set a sign for Cain, lest
any finding him should smite him.

<span id="an_gen:4:16">16</span> And Cain went out from the presence of
the LORD, and dwelt in the land of  <span id="fr_10"></span>[a](#fn_9.md)
Nod, on the east of Eden. <span id="an_gen:4:17">17</span> And Cain knew
his wife; and she conceived, and bore Enoch; and he builded a city, and
called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch. <span
id="an_gen:4:18">18</span> And unto Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot
Mehujael; and  <span id="fr_11"></span>[b](#fn_10.md) Mehujael begot
Methushael; and Methushael begot Lamech. <span
id="an_gen:4:19">19</span> And Lamech took unto him two wives; the name
of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. <span
id="an_gen:4:20">20</span> And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of
such as dwell in tents and have cattle. <span
id="an_gen:4:21">21</span> And his brother's name was Jubal; he was the
father of all such as handle the harp and pipe. <span
id="an_gen:4:22">22</span> And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain, the
forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron; and the sister of
Tubal-cain was Naamah. <span id="an_gen:4:23">23</span> And Lamech said
unto his wives:

Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;  
Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech;  
For I have slain a man for wounding me,  
And a young man for bruising me;  
<span id="an_gen:4:24">24</span> If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,  
Truly Lamech seventy and seven-fold.

<span id="an_gen:4:25">25</span> And Adam knew his wife again; and she
bore a son, and called his name  <span id="fr_12"></span>[c](#fn_11.md)
Seth: 'for God  <span id="fr_13"></span>[d](#fn_12.md) hath appointed me
another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.' <span
id="an_gen:4:26">26</span> And to Seth, to him also there was born a
son; and he called his name Enosh; then began men to call upon the name
of the LORD.
