### GENESIS CHAPTER 9

<span id="an_gen:9:1">1</span> And God blessed Noah and his sons, and
said unto them: 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
<span id="an_gen:9:2">2</span> And the fear of you and the dread of you
shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air,
and upon all wherewith the ground teemeth, and upon all the fishes of
the sea: into your hand are they delivered. <span
id="an_gen:9:3">3</span> Every moving thing that liveth shall be for
food for you; as the green herb have I given you all. <span
id="an_gen:9:4">4</span> Only flesh with the life thereof, which is the
blood thereof, shall ye not eat. <span id="an_gen:9:5">5</span> And
surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every
beast will I require it; and at the hand of man, even at the hand of
every man's brother, will I require the life of man. <span
id="an_gen:9:6">6</span> Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his
blood be shed; for in the image of God made He man. <span
id="an_gen:9:7">7</span> And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; swarm in
the earth, and multiply therein.'

<span id="an_gen:9:8">8</span> And God spoke unto Noah, and to his sons
with him, saying: <span id="an_gen:9:9">9</span> 'As for Me, behold, I
establish My covenant with you, and with your seed after you; <span
id="an_gen:9:10">10</span> and with every living creature that is with
you, the fowl, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all
that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth. <span
id="an_gen:9:11">11</span> And I will establish My covenant with you;
neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood;
neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.' <span
id="an_gen:9:12">12</span> And God said: 'This is the token of the
covenant which I make between Me and you and every living creature that
is with you, for perpetual generations: <span
id="an_gen:9:13">13</span> I have set My bow in the cloud, and it shall
be for a token of a covenant between Me and the earth. <span
id="an_gen:9:14">14</span> And it shall come to pass, when I bring
clouds over the earth, and the bow is seen in the cloud, <span
id="an_gen:9:15">15</span> that I will remember My covenant, which is
between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the
waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. <span
id="an_gen:9:16">16</span> And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will
look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God
and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.' <span
id="an_gen:9:17">17</span> And God said unto Noah: 'This is the token of
the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is
upon the earth.'

<span id="an_gen:9:18">18</span> And the sons of Noah, that went forth
from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is the father of
Canaan. <span id="an_gen:9:19">19</span> These three were the sons of
Noah, and of these was the whole earth overspread.

<span id="an_gen:9:20">20</span> And Noah the husbandman began, and
planted a vineyard. <span id="an_gen:9:21">21</span> And he drank of the
wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. <span
id="an_gen:9:22">22</span> And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the
nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. <span
id="an_gen:9:23">23</span> And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid
it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the
nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw
not their father's nakedness. <span id="an_gen:9:24">24</span> And Noah
awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done unto him.
<span id="an_gen:9:25">25</span> And he said: <span id="page_12">p.
12</span>

Cursed be Canaan;  
A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.

<span id="an_gen:9:26">26</span> And he said:

Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem;  
And let Canaan be their servant.  
<span id="an_gen:9:27">27</span> God  <span
id="fr_15"></span>[a](#fn_14.md) enlarge Japheth,  
And he shall dwell in the tents of Shem;  
And let Canaan be their servant.

<span id="an_gen:9:28">28</span> And Noah lived after the flood three
hundred and fifty years. <span id="an_gen:9:29">29</span> And all the
days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.
