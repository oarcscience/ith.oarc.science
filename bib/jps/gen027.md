### GENESIS CHAPTER 27

<span id="an_gen:27:1">1</span> And it came to pass, that when Isaac was
old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his
elder son, and said unto him: 'My son'; and he said unto him: 'Here am
I.' <span id="an_gen:27:2">2</span> And he said: 'Behold now, I am old,
I know not the day of my death. <span id="an_gen:27:3">3</span> Now
therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go
out to the field, and take me venison; <span
id="an_gen:27:4">4</span> and make me savoury food, such as I love, and
bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I
die.' <span id="an_gen:27:5">5</span> And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke
to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to
bring it. <span id="an_gen:27:6">6</span> And Rebekah spoke unto Jacob
her son, saying: 'Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy
brother, saying: <span id="an_gen:27:7">7</span> Bring me venison, and
make me savoury food, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD
before my death. <span id="an_gen:27:8">8</span> Now therefore, my son,
hearken to my voice according to that which I command thee. <span
id="an_gen:27:9">9</span> Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence
two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury food for thy
father, such as he loveth; <span id="an_gen:27:10">10</span> and thou
shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, so that he may bless thee
before his death.' <span id="an_gen:27:11">11</span> And Jacob said to
Rebekah his mother: 'Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a
smooth man. <span id="an_gen:27:12">12</span> My father peradventure
will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a mocker; and I shall bring a
curse <span id="page_32">p. 32</span> upon me, and not a blessing.'
<span id="an_gen:27:13">13</span> And his mother said unto him: 'Upon me
be thy curse, my son; only hearken to my voice, and go fetch me them.'
<span id="an_gen:27:14">14</span> And he went, and fetched, and brought
them to his mother; and his mother made savoury food, such as his father
loved. <span id="an_gen:27:15">15</span> And Rebekah took the choicest
garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and
put them upon Jacob her younger son. <span
id="an_gen:27:16">16</span> And she put the skins of the kids of the
goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck. <span
id="an_gen:27:17">17</span> And she gave the savoury food and the bread,
which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob. <span
id="an_gen:27:18">18</span> And he came unto his father, and said: 'My
father'; and he said: 'Here am I; who art thou, my son?' <span
id="an_gen:27:19">19</span> And Jacob said unto his father: 'I am Esau
thy first-born; I have done according as thou badest me. Arise, I pray
thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.' <span
id="an_gen:27:20">20</span> And Isaac said unto his son: 'How is it that
thou hast found it so quickly, my son?' And he said: 'Because the LORD
thy God sent me good speed.' <span id="an_gen:27:21">21</span> And Isaac
said unto Jacob: 'Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son,
whether thou be my very son Esau or not.' <span
id="an_gen:27:22">22</span> And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father;
and he felt him, and said: 'The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the
hands are the hands of Esau.' <span id="an_gen:27:23">23</span> And he
discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's
hands; so he blessed him. <span id="an_gen:27:24">24</span> And he said:
'Art thou my very son Esau?' And he said: 'I am.' <span
id="an_gen:27:25">25</span> And he said: 'Bring it near to me, and I
will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee.' And he
brought it near to him, and he did eat; and he brought him wine, and he
drank. <span id="an_gen:27:26">26</span> And his father Isaac said unto
him: 'Come near now, and kiss me, my son.' <span
id="an_gen:27:27">27</span> And he came near, and kissed him. And he
smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said:

See, the smell of my son  
Is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed.  
<span id="an_gen:27:28">28</span> So God give thee of the dew of
heaven,  
And of the fat places of the earth,  
And plenty of corn and wine.  
<span id="an_gen:27:29">29</span> Let peoples serve thee,  
And nations bow down to thee.  
Be lord over thy brethren,  
And let thy mother's sons bow down to thee.  
Cursed be every one that curseth thee,  
And blessed be every one that blesseth thee.

<span id="an_gen:27:30">30</span> And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac
had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out
from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in
from his hunting. <span id="an_gen:27:31">31</span> And he also made
savoury food, and brought it unto his father; and he said unto his
father: 'Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy
soul may bless me.' <span id="an_gen:27:32">32</span> And Isaac his
father said unto him: 'Who art thou?' And he said: 'I am thy son, thy
first-born, Esau.' <span id="an_gen:27:33">33</span> And Isaac trembled
very exceedingly, and said: 'Who then is he that hath taken venison, and
brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have
blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.' <span
id="an_gen:27:34">34</span> When Esau heard the words of his father, he
cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said unto his father:
'Bless me, even me also, O my father.' <span
id="an_gen:27:35">35</span> And he said: 'Thy brother came with guile,
and hath taken away thy blessing.' <span id="an_gen:27:36">36</span> And
he said: 'Is not he rightly named <span id="page_33">p. 33</span> Jacob?
for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright;
and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing.' And he said: 'Hast
thou not reserved a blessing for me?' <span
id="an_gen:27:37">37</span> And Isaac answered and said unto Esau:
'Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to
him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him; and what
then shall I do for thee, my son?' <span id="an_gen:27:38">38</span> And
Esau said unto his father: 'Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless
me, even me also, O my father.' And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
<span id="an_gen:27:39">39</span> And Isaac his father answered and said
unto him:

Behold, of the fat places of the earth shall be thy dwelling,  
And of the dew of heaven from above;  
<span id="an_gen:27:40">40</span> And by thy sword shalt thou live, and
thou shalt serve thy brother;  
And it shall come to pass when thou shalt break loose,  
That thou shalt shake his yoke from off thy neck.

<span id="an_gen:27:41">41</span> And Esau hated Jacob because of the
blessing wherewith his father blessed him. And Esau said in his heart:
'Let the days of mourning for my father be at hand; then will I slay my
brother Jacob.' <span id="an_gen:27:42">42</span> And the words of Esau
her elder son were told to Rebekah; and she sent and called Jacob her
younger son, and said unto him: 'Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching
thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee. <span
id="an_gen:27:43">43</span> Now therefore, my son, hearken to my voice;
and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran; <span
id="an_gen:27:44">44</span> and tarry with him a few days, until thy
brother's fury turn away; <span id="an_gen:27:45">45</span> until thy
brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast
done to him; then I will send, and fetch thee from thence; why should I
be bereaved of you both in one day?'

<span id="an_gen:27:46">46</span> And Rebekah said to Isaac: 'I am weary
of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob take a wife of the
daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what
good shall my life do me?'
