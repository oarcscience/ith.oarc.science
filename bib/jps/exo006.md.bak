### EXODUS CHAPTER 6

<span id="an_exo:6:1">1</span> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Now shalt
thou see what I will do to Pharaoh; for by a strong hand shall he let
them go, and by a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.'

‏וארא‎

<span id="an_exo:6:2">2</span> And God spoke unto Moses, and said unto
him: 'I am the LORD; <span id="an_exo:6:3">3</span> and I appeared unto
Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My name
 <span id="fr_77"></span>[a](#fn_76.md) ‏יהוה‎, I made Me not known to
them. <span id="an_exo:6:4">4</span> And I have also established My
covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their
sojournings, wherein they sojourned. <span id="an_exo:6:5">5</span> And
moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the
Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered My covenant. <span
id="an_exo:6:6">6</span> Wherefore say unto the children of Israel: I am
the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the
Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem
you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments; <span
id="an_exo:6:7">7</span> and I will take you to Me for a people, and I
will be to you a God; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, who
brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. <span
id="an_exo:6:8">8</span> And I will bring you in unto the land,
concerning which I lifted up My hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac,
and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage: I am the LORD.'
<span id="an_exo:6:9">9</span> And Moses spoke so unto the children of
Israel; but they hearkened not unto Moses for impatience of spirit, and
for cruel bondage.

<span id="an_exo:6:10">10</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_exo:6:11">11</span> 'Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of
Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.' <span
id="an_exo:6:12">12</span> And Moses spoke before the LORD, saying:
'Behold, the children of Israel have <span id="page_71">p. 71</span> not
hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of
uncircumcised lips?'

<span id="an_exo:6:13">13</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto
Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto
Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land
of Egypt.

<span id="an_exo:6:14">14</span> These are the heads of their fathers’
houses: the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu,
Hezron, and Carmi. These are the families of Reuben. <span
id="an_exo:6:15">15</span> And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin,
and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish
woman. These are the families of Simeon. <span
id="an_exo:6:16">16</span> And these are the names of the sons of Levi
according to their generations: Gershon and Kohath, and Merari. And the
years of the life of Levi were a hundred thirty and seven years. <span
id="an_exo:6:17">17</span> The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei,
according to their families. <span id="an_exo:6:18">18</span> And the
sons of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel. And the years
of the life of Kohath were a hundred thirty and three years. <span
id="an_exo:6:19">19</span> And the sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi.
These are the families of the Levites according to their generations.
<span id="an_exo:6:20">20</span> And Amram took him Jochebed his
father's sister to wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses. And the years
of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty and seven years. <span
id="an_exo:6:21">21</span> And the sons of Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and
Zichri. <span id="an_exo:6:22">22</span> And the sons of Uzziel:
Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri. <span id="an_exo:6:23">23</span> And
Aaron took him Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of
Nahshon, to wife; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
<span id="an_exo:6:24">24</span> And the sons of Korah: Assir, and
Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families, of the Korahites. <span
id="an_exo:6:25">25</span> And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the
daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bore him Phinehas. These are the
heads of the fathers’ houses of the Levites according to their families.
<span id="an_exo:6:26">26</span> These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom
the LORD said: 'Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt
according to their hosts.' <span id="an_exo:6:27">27</span> These are
they that spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of
Israel from Egypt. These are that Moses and Aaron. <span
id="an_exo:6:28">28</span> And it came to pass on the day when the LORD
spoke unto Moses in the land of Egypt, <span
id="an_exo:6:29">29</span> that the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 'I am
the LORD; speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak unto
thee.' <span id="an_exo:6:30">30</span> And Moses said before the LORD:
'Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto
me?'
