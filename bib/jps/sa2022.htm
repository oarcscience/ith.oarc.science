<p><A NAME="an_sa2:22:38">38</A>&nbsp; I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them;<br> Neither did I turn back till they were consumed.<br> <A NAME="an_sa2:22:39">39</A>&nbsp; And I have consumed them, and smitten them through, that they cannot arise;<br> Yea, they are fallen under my feet.<br> <A NAME="an_sa2:22:40">40</A>&nbsp; For Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle;<br> Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.<br> <A NAME="an_sa2:22:41">41</A>&nbsp; Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me;<br> Yea, them that hate me, that I might cut them off.<br> <A NAME="an_sa2:22:42">42</A>&nbsp; They looked, but there was none to save;<br> Even unto the LORD, but He answered them not.<br> <A NAME="an_sa2:22:43">43</A>&nbsp; Then did I beat them small as the dust of the earth,<br> I did stamp them as the mire of the streets, and did tread them down.<br> <a name="page_397"><font size="1" color="green">p. 397</font></A><br> <A NAME="an_sa2:22:44">44</A>&nbsp; Thou also hast delivered me from the contentions of my people;<br> Thou hast kept me to be the head of the nations;<br> A people whom I have not known serve me.<br> <A NAME="an_sa2:22:45">45</A>&nbsp; The sons of the stranger dwindle away before me;<br> As soon as they hear of me, they obey me.<br> <A NAME="an_sa2:22:46">46</A>&nbsp; The sons of the stranger fade away,<br> And come halting out of their close places.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_sa2:22:47">47</A>&nbsp; The LORD liveth, and blessed be my Rock;<br> And exalted be the God, my Rock of salvation;<br> <A NAME="an_sa2:22:48">48</A>&nbsp; Even the God that executeth vengeance for me,<br> And bringeth down peoples under me,<br> <A NAME="an_sa2:22:49">49</A>&nbsp; And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies;<br> Yea, Thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me;<br> Thou deliverest me from the violent man.<br> <A NAME="an_sa2:22:50">50</A>&nbsp; Therefore I will give thanks unto Thee, O LORD, among the nations,<br> And will sing praises unto Thy name.<br> <A NAME="an_sa2:22:51">51</A>&nbsp; A tower of salvation is He to His king;<br> And showeth mercy to His anointed,<br> To David and to his seed, for evermore.</p>
