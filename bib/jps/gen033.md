### GENESIS CHAPTER 33

<span id="an_gen:33:1">1</span> And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and
looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he
divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two
handmaids. <span id="an_gen:33:2">2</span> And he put the handmaids and
their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and
Joseph hindermost. <span id="an_gen:33:3">3</span> And he himself passed
over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he
came near to his brother. <span id="an_gen:33:4">4</span> And Esau ran
to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him; and
they wept. <span id="an_gen:33:5">5</span> And he lifted up his eyes,
and saw the women and the children; and said: 'Who are these with thee?'
And he said: 'The children whom God hath graciously given thy servant.'
<span id="an_gen:33:6">6</span> Then the handmaids came near, they and
their children, and they bowed down. <span id="an_gen:33:7">7</span> And
Leah also and her children came near, and bowed down; and after came
Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed down. <span
id="an_gen:33:8">8</span> And he said: 'What meanest thou by all this
camp which I met?' And he said: 'To find favour in the sight of my
lord.' <span id="an_gen:33:9">9</span> And Esau said: 'I have enough; my
brother, let that which thou hast be thine.' <span
id="an_gen:33:10">10</span> And Jacob said: 'Nay, I pray thee, if now I
have found favour in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand;
forasmuch as I have seen thy face, as one seeth the face of God, and
thou wast pleased with me. <span id="an_gen:33:11">11</span> Take, I
pray thee, my gift that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt
graciously with me, and because I have enough.' And he urged him, and he
took it. <span id="an_gen:33:12">12</span> And he said: 'Let us take our
journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.' <span
id="an_gen:33:13">13</span> And he said unto him: 'My lord knoweth that
the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds giving suck are a
care to me; and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.
<span id="an_gen:33:14">14</span> Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over
before his servant; and I will journey on gently, according to the pace
of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the
children, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.' <span
id="an_gen:33:15">15</span> And Esau said: Let me now leave with thee
some of the folk that are with me.' And he said: 'What needeth it? let
me find favour in the sight of my lord.' <span
id="an_gen:33:16">16</span> So Esau returned that day on his way unto
Seir. <span id="an_gen:33:17">17</span> And Jacob journeyed to Succoth,
and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle. Therefore the
name of the place is called  <span id="fr_56"></span>[b](#fn_55.md)
Succoth.

<span id="an_gen:33:18">18</span> And Jacob came in peace to the city of
Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram;
and encamped before the city. <span id="an_gen:33:19">19</span> And he
bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand
of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of
money. <span id="an_gen:33:20">20</span> And he erected there an altar,
and called it  <span id="fr_57"></span>[c](#fn_56.md) El-elohe-Israel.
