### EXODUS CHAPTER 38

<span id="an_exo:38:1">1</span> And he made the altar of burnt-offering
of acacia-wood: five cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the
breadth thereof, four-square and three cubits the height thereof. <span
id="an_exo:38:2">2</span> And he made the horns thereof upon the four
corners of it; the horns thereof <span id="page_113">p. 113</span> were
of one piece with it; and he overlaid it with brass. <span
id="an_exo:38:3">3</span> And he made all the vessels of the altar, the
pots, and the shovels, and the basins, the flesh-hooks, and the
fire-pans; all the vessels thereof made he of brass. <span
id="an_exo:38:4">4</span> And he made for the altar a grating of network
of brass, under the ledge round it beneath, reaching halfway up. <span
id="an_exo:38:5">5</span> And he cast four rings for the four ends of
the grating of brass, to be holders for the staves. <span
id="an_exo:38:6">6</span> And he made the staves of acacia-wood, and
overlaid them with brass. <span id="an_exo:38:7">7</span> And he put the
staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, wherewith to bear it;
he made it hollow with planks.

<span id="an_exo:38:8">8</span> And he made the laver of brass, and the
base thereof of brass, of the mirrors of the serving women that did
service at the door of the tent of meeting.

<span id="an_exo:38:9">9</span> And he made the court; for the south
side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, a
hundred cubits. <span id="an_exo:38:10">10</span> Their pillars were
twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and
their fillets were of silver. <span id="an_exo:38:11">11</span> And for
the north side a hundred cubits, their pillars twenty, and their sockets
twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.
<span id="an_exo:38:12">12</span> And for the west side were hangings of
fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the
pillars and their fillets of silver. <span
id="an_exo:38:13">13</span> And for the east side eastward fifty cubits.
<span id="an_exo:38:14">14</span> The hangings for the one side \[of the
gate\] were fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets
three. <span id="an_exo:38:15">15</span> And so for the other side; on
this hand and that hand by the gate of the court were hangings of
fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. <span
id="an_exo:38:16">16</span> All the hangings of the court round about
were of fine twined linen. <span id="an_exo:38:17">17</span> And the
sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars and
their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of their capitals of silver;
and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver. <span
id="an_exo:38:18">18</span> And the screen for the gate of the court was
the work of the weaver in colours, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and
fine twined linen; and twenty cubits was the length, and the height in
the breadth was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court.
<span id="an_exo:38:19">19</span> And their pillars were four, and their
sockets four, of brass; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of
their capitals and their fillets of silver. <span
id="an_exo:38:20">20</span> And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of
the court round about, were of brass.

<span id="an_exo:38:21">21</span> These are the accounts of the
tabernacle, even the tabernacle of the testimony, as they were rendered
according to the commandment of Moses, through the service of the
Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.—<span
id="an_exo:38:22">22</span> And Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur,
of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses. <span
id="an_exo:38:23">23</span> And with him was Oholiab, the son of
Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, a craftsman, and a skilful workman, and
a weaver in colours, in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine
linen.—<span id="an_exo:38:24">24</span> All the gold that was used for
the work in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the
offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty
shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary. <span
id="an_exo:38:25">25</span> And the silver of them that were numbered of
the congregation was a hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and
threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: <span
id="an_exo:38:26">26</span> a beka a <span id="page_114">p. 114</span>
head, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for
every one that passed over to them that are numbered, from twenty years
old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five
hundred and fifty men. <span id="an_exo:38:27">27</span> And the hundred
talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary, and the
sockets of the veil: a hundred sockets for the hundred talents, a talent
for a socket. <span id="an_exo:38:28">28</span> And of the thousand
seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars,
and overlaid their capitals, and made fillets for them. <span
id="an_exo:38:29">29</span> And the brass of the offering was seventy
talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels. <span
id="an_exo:38:30">30</span> And therewith he made the sockets to the
door of the tent of meeting, and the brazen altar, and the brazen
grating for it, and all the vessels of the altar, <span
id="an_exo:38:31">31</span> and the sockets of the court round about,
and the sockets of the gate of the court, and all the pins of the
tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.
