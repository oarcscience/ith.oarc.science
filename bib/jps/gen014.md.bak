### GENESIS CHAPTER 14

<span id="an_gen:14:1">1</span> And it came to pass in the days of
Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of
Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, <span id="an_gen:14:2">2</span> that they
made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah,
Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of
Bela—the same is Zoar. <span id="an_gen:14:3">3</span> All these came as
allies unto the vale of Siddim—the same is the Salt Sea. <span
id="an_gen:14:4">4</span> Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in
the thirteenth year they rebelled. <span id="an_gen:14:5">5</span> And
in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with
him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham,
and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, <span id="an_gen:14:6">6</span> and
the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-paran, which is by the
wilderness. <span id="an_gen:14:7">7</span> And they turned back, and
came to En-mishpat—the same is Kadesh—and smote all the country of the
Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon-tamar. <span
id="an_gen:14:8">8</span> And there went out the king of Sodom, and the
king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and
the king of Bela—the same is Zoar; and they set the battle in array
against <span id="page_16">p. 16</span> them in the vale of Siddim;
<span id="an_gen:14:9">9</span> against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and
Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of
Ellasar; four kings against the five. <span
id="an_gen:14:10">10</span> Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime
pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and
they that remained fled to the mountain. <span
id="an_gen:14:11">11</span> And they took all the goods of Sodom and
Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way. <span
id="an_gen:14:12">12</span> And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son,
who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed. <span
id="an_gen:14:13">13</span> And there came one that had escaped, and
told Abram the Hebrew—now he dwelt by the terebinths of Mamre the
Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were
confederate with Abram. <span id="an_gen:14:14">14</span> And when Abram
heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his trained men,
born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as
Dan. <span id="an_gen:14:15">15</span> And he divided himself against
them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them
unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. <span
id="an_gen:14:16">16</span> And he brought back all the goods, and also
brought back his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the
people. <span id="an_gen:14:17">17</span> And the king of Sodom went out
to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the
kings that were with him, at the vale of Shaveh—the same is the King's
Vale. <span id="an_gen:14:18">18</span> And Melchizedek king of Salem
brought forth bread and wine; and he was priest of God the Most High.
<span id="an_gen:14:19">19</span> And he blessed him, and said: 'Blessed
be Abram of God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth; <span
id="an_gen:14:20">20</span> and blessed be God the Most High, who hath
delivered thine enemies into thy hand.' And he gave him a tenth of all.
<span id="an_gen:14:21">21</span> And the king of Sodom said unto Abram:
'Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.' <span
id="an_gen:14:22">22</span> And Abram said to the king of Sodom: 'I have
lifted up my hand unto the LORD, God Most High, Maker of heaven and
earth, <span id="an_gen:14:23">23</span> that I will not take a thread
nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine, lest thou shouldest say: I
have made Abram rich; <span id="an_gen:14:24">24</span> save only that
which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went
with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, let them take their portion.'
