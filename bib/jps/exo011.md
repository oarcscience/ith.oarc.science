### EXODUS CHAPTER 11

<span id="an_exo:11:1">1</span> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Yet one
plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he
will let you go hence; when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust
you out hence altogether. <span id="an_exo:11:2">2</span> Speak now in
the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbour, and
every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.'
<span id="an_exo:11:3">3</span> And the LORD gave the people favour in
the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the
land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of
the people.

<span id="an_exo:11:4">4</span> And Moses said: 'Thus saith the LORD:
About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt; <span
id="an_exo:11:5">5</span> and all the first-born in the land of Egypt
shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne,
even unto the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill;
and all the first-born of cattle. <span id="an_exo:11:6">6</span> And
there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as
there hath been none like it, nor shall be like it any more. <span
id="an_exo:11:7">7</span> But against any of the children of Israel
shall not a dog whet his tongue, against man or beast; that ye may know
how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and
Israel. <span id="an_exo:11:8">8</span> And all these thy servants shall
come down unto me, and bow down unto me, saying: Get thee out, and all
the people that follow thee; and after that I will go out.' And he went
out from Pharaoh in hot anger.

<span id="an_exo:11:9">9</span> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Pharaoh
will not hearken unto you; that My wonders may be multiplied in the land
of Egypt.' <span id="an_exo:11:10">10</span> And Moses and Aaron did all
these wonders before Pharaoh; and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and
he did not let the children of Israel go out of his land.
