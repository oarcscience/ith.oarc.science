### I SAMUEL CHAPTER 25

<span id="an_sa1:25:1">1</span> And Samuel died; and all Israel gathered
themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at
Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.

<span id="an_sa1:25:2">2</span> And there was a man in Maon, whose
possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three
thousand sheep, and a thousand goats; and he was shearing his sheep in
Carmel. <span id="an_sa1:25:3">3</span> Now the name of the man was
Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good
understanding, and of a beautiful form; but the man was churlish and
evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb. <span
id="an_sa1:25:4">4</span> And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal
was shearing his sheep. <span id="an_sa1:25:5">5</span> And David sent
ten young men, and David said unto the young men: \`Get you up to
Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name; <span
id="an_sa1:25:6">6</span> and thus ye shall say: All hail! and peace be
both unto thee, and peace be to thy house, and peace be unto all that
thou hast. <span id="an_sa1:25:7">7</span> And now I have heard that
thou hast shearers; thy shepherds have now been with us, and we did them
no hurt, neither was there aught missing unto them, all the while they
were in Carmel. <span id="an_sa1:25:8">8</span> Ask thy young men, and
they will tell thee; wherefore let the young men find favour in thine
eyes; for we come on a good day; give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to
thy hand, unto thy servants, and to thy son David.'

<span id="an_sa1:25:9">9</span> And when David's young men came, they
spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and
ceased. <span id="an_sa1:25:10">10</span> And Nabal answered David's
servants, and said: \`Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there
are many servants now-a-days that break away every man from his master;
<span id="an_sa1:25:11">11</span> shall I then take my bread, and my
water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto
men of whom I know not whence they are?' <span
id="an_sa1:25:12">12</span> So David's young men turned on their way,
and went back, and came and told him according to all these words. <span
id="an_sa1:25:13">13</span> And David said unto his men: \`Gird ye on
every man his sword.' And they girded on every man his sword; and David
also girded on his sword; and there went up after David about four
hundred men; and two hundred abode by the baggage.

<span id="an_sa1:25:14">14</span> But one of the young men told Abigail,
Nabal's wife, saying: \`Behold, David sent messengers out of the
wilderness to salute our master; and he flew upon them. <span
id="an_sa1:25:15">15</span> But the men were very good unto us, and we
were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we went with
them, when we were in the fields; <span id="an_sa1:25:16">16</span> they
were a wall unto us both by night and by day, all the while we were with
them keeping the sheep. <span id="an_sa1:25:17">17</span> Now therefore
know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our
master, and against all his house; for he is such a base fellow, that
one cannot speak to him.'

<span id="an_sa1:25:18">18</span> Then Abigail made haste, and took two
hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed,
and five measures of parched corn, and a hundred clusters of raisins,
and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses. <span
id="an_sa1:25:19">19</span> And she said unto her young men: \`Go on
before me; behold, I come after you.' But she told not her husband
Nabal. <span id="an_sa1:25:20">20</span> And it was so, as she rode on
her ass, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that, behold,

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> David and his men
came down towards her; and she met them.—<span
id="an_sa1:25:21">21</span> Now David had said: \`Surely in vain have I
kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was
missed of all that pertained unto him; and he hath returned me evil for
good. <span id="an_sa1:25:22">22</span> God do so unto the enemies of
David, and more also, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the
morning light so much as one male.'— <span
id="an_sa1:25:23">23</span> And when Abigail saw David, she made haste,
and alighted from her ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed
down to the ground. <span id="an_sa1:25:24">24</span> And she fell at
his feet, and said: Upon me, my lord, upon me be the iniquity; and let
thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine ears, and hear thou the words
of thy handmaid. <span id="an_sa1:25:25">25</span> Let not my lord, I
pray thee, regard this base fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so
is he:  <span id="fr_126"></span>[a](#fn_123.md) Nabal is his name, and
churlishness is with him; but I thy handmaid saw not the young men of my
lord, whom thou didst send. <span id="an_sa1:25:26">26</span> Now
therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing
the LORD hath withholden thee from blood-guiltiness, and from finding
redress for thyself with thine own hand, now therefore let thine
enemies, and them that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal. <span
id="an_sa1:25:27">27</span> And now this present which thy servant hath
brought unto my lord, let it be given unto the young men that follow my
lord. <span id="an_sa1:25:28">28</span> Forgive, I pray thee, the
trespass of thy handmaid; for the LORD will certainly make my lord a
sure house, because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD; and evil
is not found in thee all thy days. <span id="an_sa1:25:29">29</span> And
though man be risen up to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul, yet the
soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy
God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as from
the hollow of a sling. <span id="an_sa1:25:30">30</span> And it shall
come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all
the good that He hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed
thee prince over Israel; <span id="an_sa1:25:31">31</span> that this
shall be no stumblingblock unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord,
either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my lord hath
found redress for himself. And when the LORD shall have dealt well with
my lord, then remember thy handmaid.'

<span id="an_sa1:25:32">32</span> And David said to  <span
id="fr_127"></span>[b](#fn_124.md) Abigail: \`Blessed be the LORD, the God
of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me; <span
id="an_sa1:25:33">33</span> and blessed be thy discretion, and blessed
be thou, that hast kept me this day from bloodguiltiness, and from
finding redress for myself with mine own hand. <span
id="an_sa1:25:34">34</span> For in very deed, as the LORD, the God of
Israel, liveth, who hath withholden me from hurting thee, except thou
hadst made haste and come to meet me, surely there had not been left
unto Nabal by the morning light so much as one male.' <span
id="an_sa1:25:35">35</span> So David received of her hand that which she
had brought him; and he said unto her: \`Go up in peace to thy house;
see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.'

<span id="an_sa1:25:36">36</span> And Abigail came to Nabal; and,
behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and
Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken; wherefore
she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light. <span
id="an_sa1:25:37">37</span> And it came to pass in the morning, when the
wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his
heart died within him and he became as a stone. <span
id="an_sa1:25:38">38</span> And it came to pass about

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, so that he died.

<span id="an_sa1:25:39">39</span> And when David heard that Nabal was
dead, he said: \`Blessed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my
reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept back His servant from
evil; and the evil-doing of Nabal hath the LORD returned upon his own
head.' And David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to him
to wife. <span id="an_sa1:25:40">40</span> And when the servants of
David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke unto her, saying:
\`David hath sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.' <span
id="an_sa1:25:41">41</span> And she arose, and bowed down with her face
to the earth, and said: \`Behold, thy handmaid is a servant to wash the
feet of the servants of my lord.' <span id="an_sa1:25:42">42</span> And
Abigail hastened, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of
hers that followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and
became his wife.

<span id="an_sa1:25:43">43</span> David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel;
and they became both of them his wives. <span
id="an_sa1:25:44">44</span> Now Saul had given Michal his daughter,
David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.
