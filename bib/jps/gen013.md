### GENESIS CHAPTER 13

<span id="an_gen:13:1">1</span> And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and
his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South. <span
id="an_gen:13:2">2</span> And Abram was very <span id="page_15">p.
15</span> rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. <span
id="an_gen:13:3">3</span> And he went on his journeys from the South
even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at the
beginning, between Beth-el and Ai; <span id="an_gen:13:4">4</span> unto
the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first; and Abram
called there on the name of the LORD. <span
id="an_gen:13:5">5</span> And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks,
and herds, and tents. <span id="an_gen:13:6">6</span> And the land was
not able to bear them, that they might dwell together; for their
substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. <span
id="an_gen:13:7">7</span> And there was a strife between the herdmen of
Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle. And the Canaanite and
the Perizzite dwelt then in the land. <span
id="an_gen:13:8">8</span> And Abram said unto Lot: 'Let there be no
strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy
herdmen; for we are brethren. <span id="an_gen:13:9">9</span> Is not the
whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me; if thou
wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou take
the right hand, then I will go to the left.' <span
id="an_gen:13:10">10</span> And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all
the plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before
the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of the LORD, like
the land of Egypt, as thou goest unto Zoar. <span
id="an_gen:13:11">11</span> So Lot chose him all the plain of the
Jordan; and Lot journeyed east; and they separated themselves the one
from the other. <span id="an_gen:13:12">12</span> Abram dwelt in the
land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the Plain, and moved his
tent as far as Sodom. <span id="an_gen:13:13">13</span> Now the men of
Sodom were wicked and sinners against the LORD exceedingly. <span
id="an_gen:13:14">14</span> And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot
was separated from him: 'Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place
where thou art, northward and southward and eastward and westward; <span
id="an_gen:13:15">15</span> for all the land which thou seest, to thee
will I give it, and to thy seed for ever. <span
id="an_gen:13:16">16</span> And I will make thy seed as the dust of the
earth; so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy
seed also be numbered. <span id="an_gen:13:17">17</span> Arise, walk
through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for unto
thee will I give it.' <span id="an_gen:13:18">18</span> And Abram moved
his tent, and came and dwelt by the terebinths of Mamre, which are in
Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.
