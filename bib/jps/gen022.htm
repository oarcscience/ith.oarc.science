<p><A NAME="an_gen:22:1">1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after these things, that God did prove Abraham, and said unto him: 'Abraham'; and he said: 'Here am I.' <A NAME="an_gen:22:2">2</A>&nbsp;And He said: 'Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.' <A NAME="an_gen:22:3">3</A>&nbsp;And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he cleaved the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. <A NAME="an_gen:22:4">4</A>&nbsp;On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. <A NAME="an_gen:22:5">5</A>&nbsp;And Abraham said unto his young men: 'Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come back to you.' <A NAME="an_gen:22:6">6</A>&nbsp;And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and they went both of them together. <A NAME="an_gen:22:7">7</A>&nbsp;And Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father, and said: 'My father.' And he said: 'Here am I, my son.' And he said: 'Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?' <A NAME="an_gen:22:8">8</A>&nbsp;And Abraham said: 'God will &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>
provide Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son.' So they went both of them together. <A NAME="an_gen:22:9">9</A>&nbsp;And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood. <A NAME="an_gen:22:10">10</A> And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. <A NAME="an_gen:22:11">11</A>&nbsp;And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said: 'Abraham, Abraham.' And he said: 'Here am I.' <A NAME="an_gen:22:12">12</A>&nbsp;And he said: 'Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him; for now I know that thou art a God-fearing man, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from Me.' <A NAME="an_gen:22:13">13</A>&nbsp;And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son. <A NAME="an_gen:22:14">14</A>&nbsp;And Abraham called the name of that place &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A>
Adonai-jireh; as it is said to this day: 'In the mount where the LORD is seen.' <A NAME="an_gen:22:15">15</A>&nbsp;And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven, <A NAME="an_gen:22:16">16</A>&nbsp;and said: 'By Myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, <A NAME="an_gen:22:17">17</A>&nbsp;that in blessing I will bless thee, and <a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="green">p. 25</font></A> in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; <A NAME="an_gen:22:18">18</A>&nbsp;and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast hearkened to My voice.' <A NAME="an_gen:22:19">19</A>&nbsp;So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_gen:22:20">20</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying: 'Behold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto thy brother Nahor: <A NAME="an_gen:22:21">21</A>&nbsp;Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram; <A NAME="an_gen:22:22">22</A>&nbsp;and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.' <A NAME="an_gen:22:23">23</A>&nbsp;And Bethuel begot Rebekah; these eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother. <A NAME="an_gen:22:24">24</A>&nbsp;And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bore Tehah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah.</p>
