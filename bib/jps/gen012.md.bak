### GENESIS CHAPTER 12

<span id="an_gen:12:1">1</span> Now the LORD said unto Abram: 'Get thee
out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house,
unto the land that I will show thee. <span id="an_gen:12:2">2</span> And
I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy
name great; and be thou a blessing. <span id="an_gen:12:3">3</span> And
I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I
curse; and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.'
<span id="an_gen:12:4">4</span> So Abram went, as the LORD had spoken
unto him; and Lot went with him; and Abram was seventy and five years
old when he departed out of Haran. <span id="an_gen:12:5">5</span> And
Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their
substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in
Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the
land of Canaan they came. <span id="an_gen:12:6">6</span> And Abram
passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the terebinth of
Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land. <span
id="an_gen:12:7">7</span> And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said:
'Unto thy seed will I give this land'; and he builded there an altar
unto the LORD, who appeared unto him. <span
id="an_gen:12:8">8</span> And he removed from thence unto the mountain
on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the
west, and Ai on the east; and he builded there an altar unto the LORD,
and called upon the name of the LORD. <span
id="an_gen:12:9">9</span> And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the
South.

<span id="an_gen:12:10">10</span> And there was a famine in the land;
and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore
in the land. <span id="an_gen:12:11">11</span> And it came to pass, when
he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife:
'Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon. <span
id="an_gen:12:12">12</span> And it will come to pass, when the Egyptians
shall see thee, that they will say: This is his wife; and they will kill
me, but thee they will keep alive. <span
id="an_gen:12:13">13</span> Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister; that
it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because
of thee.' <span id="an_gen:12:14">14</span> And it came to pass, that,
when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she
was very fair. <span id="an_gen:12:15">15</span> And the princes of
Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken
into Pharaoh's house. <span id="an_gen:12:16">16</span> And he dealt
well with Abram for her sake; and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses,
and menservants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels. <span
id="an_gen:12:17">17</span> And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house
with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife. <span
id="an_gen:12:18">18</span> And Pharaoh called Abram, and said: 'What is
this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she
was thy wife? <span id="an_gen:12:19">19</span> Why saidst thou: She is
my sister? so that I took her to be my wife; now therefore behold thy
wife, take her, and go thy way.' <span id="an_gen:12:20">20</span> And
Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him; and they brought him on the way,
and his wife, and all that he had.
