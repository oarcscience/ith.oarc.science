### NUMBERS CHAPTER 35

<span id="an_num:35:1">1</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses in the
plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying: <span
id="an_num:35:2">2</span> \`Command the children of Israel, that they
give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to
dwell in; and open land round about the cities shall ye give unto the
Levites. <span id="an_num:35:3">3</span> And the cities shall they have
to dwell in; and their open land shall be for their cattle, and for
their substance, and for all their beasts. <span
id="an_num:35:4">4</span> And the open land about the cities, which ye
shall give unto the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and
outward a thousand cubits round about. <span
id="an_num:35:5">5</span> And ye shall measure without the city for the
east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand
cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north
side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst. This shall be to
them the open land about the cities. <span id="an_num:35:6">6</span> And
the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites, they shall be the six
cities of refuge, which ye shall give for the manslayer to flee thither;
and beside them ye shall give forty and two cities. <span
id="an_num:35:7">7</span> All the cities which ye shall give to the
Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with the
open land about them. <span id="an_num:35:8">8</span> And concerning the
cities which ye shall give of the possession of the children of Israel,
from the many ye shall take many, and from the few ye shall take few;
each tribe according to its inheritance which it inheriteth shall give
of its cities unto the Levites.'

<span id="an_num:35:9">9</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_num:35:10">10</span> \`Speak unto the children of Israel,
and say unto them: When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
<span id="an_num:35:11">11</span> then ye shall appoint you cities to be
cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer that killeth any person
through error may flee thither. <span id="an_num:35:12">12</span> And
the cities shall be unto you for refuge from the avenger, that the
manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation for judgment.
<span id="an_num:35:13">13</span> And as to the cities which ye shall
give, there shall be for you six cities of refuge. <span
id="an_num:35:14">14</span> Ye shall give three cities beyond the
Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan; they shall
be cities of refuge. <span id="an_num:35:15">15</span> For the children
of Israel, and for the stranger and for the settler among them, shall
these six cities be for refuge, that every one that killeth any person
through error may flee thither. <span id="an_num:35:16">16</span> But if
he smote him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a
murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death. <span
id="an_num:35:17">17</span> And if he smote him with a stone in the
hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer; the murderer
shall surely be put to death. <span id="an_num:35:18">18</span> Or if he
smote him with a weapon of wood in the hand, whereby a man may die, and
he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

be put to death. <span id="an_num:35:19">19</span> The avenger of blood
shall himself put the murderer to death; when he meeteth him, he shall
put him to death. <span id="an_num:35:20">20</span> And if he thrust him
of hatred, or hurled at him any thing, lying in wait, so that he died;
<span id="an_num:35:21">21</span> or in enmity smote him with his hand,
that he died; he that smote him shall surely be put to death: he is a
murderer; the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he
meeteth him. <span id="an_num:35:22">22</span> But if he thrust him
suddenly without enmity, or hurled upon him any thing without lying in
wait, <span id="an_num:35:23">23</span> or with any stone, whereby a man
may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, so that he died, and he
was not his enemy, neither sought his harm; <span
id="an_num:35:24">24</span> then the congregation shall judge between
the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances; <span
id="an_num:35:25">25</span> and the congregation shall deliver the
manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation
shall restore him to his city of refuge, whither he was fled; and he
shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed
with the holy oil. <span id="an_num:35:26">26</span> But if the
manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge,
whither he fleeth; <span id="an_num:35:27">27</span> and the avenger of
blood find him without the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger
of blood slay the manslayer; there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him;
<span id="an_num:35:28">28</span> because he must remain in his city of
refuge until the death of the high priest; but after the death of the
high priest the manslayer may return into the land of his possession.
<span id="an_num:35:29">29</span> And these things shall be for a
statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your
dwellings. <span id="an_num:35:30">30</span> Whoso killeth any person,
the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses; but one witness
shall not testify against any person that he die. <span
id="an_num:35:31">31</span> Moreover ye shall take no ransom for the
life of a murderer, that is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put
to death. <span id="an_num:35:32">32</span> And ye shall take no ransom
for him that is fled to his city of refuge, that he should come again to
dwell in the land, until the death of the priest. <span
id="an_num:35:33">33</span> So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye
are; for blood, it polluteth the land; and no expiation can be made for
the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him
that shed it. <span id="an_num:35:34">34</span> And thou shalt not
defile the land which ye inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell; for I
the LORD dwell in the midst of the children of Israel.'
