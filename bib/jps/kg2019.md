### II Kings Chapter 19

<span id="an_kg2:19:1">1</span> And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah
heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth,
and went into the house of the LORD. <span id="an_kg2:19:2">2</span> And
he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and
the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the
prophet the son of Amoz. <span id="an_kg2:19:3">3</span> And they said
unto him: \`Thus saith Hezekiah: This day is a day of trouble, and of
rebuke, and of contumely; for the children are come to the birth, and
there is not strength to bring forth. <span id="an_kg2:19:4">4</span> It
may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the
king of Assyria his master hath sent to taunt the living God, and will
rebuke the words which the LORD thy God hath heard; wherefore make
prayer for the remnant that is left.' <span id="an_kg2:19:5">5</span> So
the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. <span
id="an_kg2:19:6">6</span> And Isaiah said unto them: \`Thus shall ye say
to your master: Thus saith the LORD: Be not afraid of the words that
thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have
blasphemed Me. <span id="an_kg2:19:7">7</span> Behold, I will put a
spirit in him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own
land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.'

<span id="an_kg2:19:8">8</span> So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the
king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was
departed from Lachish. <span id="an_kg2:19:9">9</span> And when he heard
say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia: \`Behold, he is come out to fight
against thee'; he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying: <span
id="an_kg2:19:10">10</span> \`Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of
Judah, saying: Let not thy God in whom thou trustest beguile thee,
saying: Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of
Assyria. <span id="an_kg2:19:11">11</span> Behold, thou hast heard what
the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly;
and shalt thou be delivered? <span id="an_kg2:19:12">12</span> Have the
gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed,
Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in
Telassar? <span id="an_kg2:19:13">13</span> Where is the king of Hamath,
and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena,
and Ivvah?'

<span id="an_kg2:19:14">14</span> And Hezekiah received the letter from
the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the
house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD. <span
id="an_kg2:19:15">15</span> And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and
said: \`O LORD, the God of Israel, that sittest upon the cherubim, Thou
art the God,

<span id="page_469">p. 469</span>

even Thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; Thou hast made heaven
and earth. <span id="an_kg2:19:16">16</span> Incline Thine ear, O LORD,
and hear; open Thine eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear the words of
Sennacherib, wherewith he hath sent him to taunt the living God. <span
id="an_kg2:19:17">17</span> Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have
laid waste the nations and their lands, <span
id="an_kg2:19:18">18</span> and have cast their gods into the fire; for
they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone;
therefore they have destroyed them. <span
id="an_kg2:19:19">19</span> Now therefore, O LORD our God, save Thou us,
I beseech Thee, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may
know that Thou art the LORD God, even Thou only.'

<span id="an_kg2:19:20">20</span> Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to
Hezekiah, saying: \`Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Whereas thou
hast prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard
thee. <span id="an_kg2:19:21">21</span> This is the word that the LORD
hath spoken concerning him:

The virgin daughter of Zion  
Hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn;  
The daughter of Jerusalem  
Hath shaken her head at thee.  
<span id="an_kg2:19:22">22</span> Whom hast thou taunted and
blasphemed?  
And against whom hast thou exalted thy voice?  
Yea, thou hast lifted up thine eyes on high,  
Even against the Holy One of Israel!  
<span id="an_kg2:19:23">23</span> By thy messengers thou hast taunted
the Lord,  
And hast said: With the multitude of my chariots  
Am I come up to the height of the mountains,  
To the innermost parts of Lebanon;  
And I have cut down the tall cedars thereof,  
And the choice cypresses thereof ;  
And I have entered into his farthest lodge,  
The forest of his fruitful field.  
<span id="an_kg2:19:24">24</span> I have digged and drunk  
Strange waters,  
And with the sole of my feet have I dried up  
All the rivers of Egypt.

<span id="an_kg2:19:25">25</span> Hast thou not heard?  
Long ago I made it,  
In ancient times I fashioned it;  
Now have I brought it to pass,  
Yea, it is done; that fortified cities  
Should be laid waste into ruinous heaps.  
<span id="an_kg2:19:26">26</span> Therefore their inhabitants were of
small power,  
They were dismayed and confounded;  
They were as the grass of the field,  
And as the green herb,  
As the grass on the housetops,  
And as corn blasted before it is grown up.

<span id="an_kg2:19:27">27</span> But I know thy sitting down, and thy
going out, and thy coming in,  
And thy raging against Me.  
<span id="an_kg2:19:28">28</span> Because of thy raging against Me,  
And for that thy tumult is come up into Mine ears,  
Therefore will I put My hook in thy nose,  
And My bridle in thy lips,  
And I will turn thee back by the way  
By which thou camest.

<span id="an_kg2:19:29">29</span> And this shall be the sign unto thee:
ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second
year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and
reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof. <span
id="an_kg2:19:30">30</span> And the remnant that is escaped of the house
of

<span id="page_470">p. 470</span>

Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. <span
id="an_kg2:19:31">31</span> For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a
remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape; the zeal of the
LORD of hosts shall perform this. <span
id="an_kg2:19:32">32</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the
king of Assyria: He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow
there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast a mound
against it. <span id="an_kg2:19:33">33</span> By the way that he came,
by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith
the LORD. <span id="an_kg2:19:34">34</span> For I will defend this city
to save it, for Mine own sake, and for My servant David's sake.'

<span id="an_kg2:19:35">35</span> And it came to pass that night, that
the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians
a hundred fourscore and five thousand; and when men arose early in the
morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. <span
id="an_kg2:19:36">36</span> So Sennachcrib king of Assyria departed, and
went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. <span
id="an_kg2:19:37">37</span> And it came to pass, as he was worshipping
in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sarezer his sons
smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And
Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.
