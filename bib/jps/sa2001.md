# SECOND SAMUEL

### II SAMUEL CHAPTER 1

‏שמואל ב‎

<span id="an_sa2:1:1">1</span>  AND it came to pass after the death of
Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and
David had abode two days in Ziklag; <span id="an_sa2:1:2">2</span>  it
came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the
camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head; and so it
was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and prostrated
himself. <span id="an_sa2:1:3">3</span>  And David said unto him: \`From
whence comest thou?' And he said unto him: \`Out of the camp of Israel
am I escaped.' <span id="an_sa2:1:4">4</span>  And David said unto him:
\`How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me.' And he answered: \`The
people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen
and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.' <span
id="an_sa2:1:5">5</span>  And David said unto the young man that told
him: \`How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?' <span
id="an_sa2:1:6">6</span>  And the young man that told him said: \`As I
happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his
spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen pressed hard upon him.
<span id="an_sa2:1:7">7</span>  And when he looked behind him, he saw
me, and called unto me. And I answered: Here am I. <span
id="an_sa2:1:8">8</span>  And he said unto me: Who art thou? And I
answered him: I am an Amalekite. <span id="an_sa2:1:9">9</span>  And he
said unto me: Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me, for the agony
hath taken hold of me; because my life is just yet in me. <span
id="an_sa2:1:10">10</span>  So I stood beside him, and slew him, because
I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen; and I took
the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm,
and have brought them hither unto my lord.'

<span id="an_sa2:1:11">11</span>  Then David took hold on his clothes,
and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him. <span
id="an_sa2:1:12">12</span>  And they wailed, and wept, and fasted until
even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the
LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the
sword. <span id="an_sa2:1:13">13</span>  And David said unto the young
man that told him: \`Whence art thou?' And he answered: \`I am the son
of an Amalekite stranger.' <span id="an_sa2:1:14">14</span>  And David
said unto him: \`How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to
destroy the LORD's anointed?' <span id="an_sa2:1:15">15</span>  And
David called one of the young men, and said: \`Go near, and fall upon
him.' And he smote him that he died. <span id="an_sa2:1:16">16</span> 
And David said unto him: \`Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth
hath testified against thee, saying: I have slain the LORD's anointed.'

<span id="an_sa2:1:17">17</span>  And David lamented with this
lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son, <span
id="an_sa2:1:18">18</span>  and said—To teach the sons of Judah the bow.
Behold, it is written in the book of Jashar:

<span id="an_sa2:1:19">19</span>  Thy beauty, O Israel, upon thy high
places is slain!  
How are the mighty fallen!

<span id="an_sa2:1:20">20</span>  Tell it not in Gath,  
Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; <span id="page_367">p.
367</span>  
Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,  
Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.  
<span id="an_sa2:1:21">21</span>  Ye mountains of Gilboa,  
Let there be no dew nor rain upon you,  
Neither fields of choice fruits;  
For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away,  
The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.  
<span id="an_sa2:1:22">22</span>  From the blood of the slain, from the
fat of the mighty,  
The bow of Jonathan turned not back,  
And the sword of Saul returned not empty.  
<span id="an_sa2:1:23">23</span>  Saul and Jonathan, the lovely and the
pleasant  
In their lives, even in their death they were not divided;  
They were swifter than eagles,  
They were stronger than lions.  
<span id="an_sa2:1:24">24</span>  Ye daughters of Israel, weep over
Saul,  
Who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights,  
Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.  
<span id="an_sa2:1:25">25</span>  How are the mighty fallen in the midst
of the battle!

Jonathan upon thy high places is slain!  
<span id="an_sa2:1:26">26</span>  I am distressed for thee, my brother
Jonathan;  
Very pleasant hast thou been unto me;  
Wonderful was thy love to me,  
Passing the love of women.  
<span id="an_sa2:1:27">27</span>  How are the mighty fallen,  
And the weapons of war perished!
