### II SAMUEL CHAPTER 4

<span id="an_sa2:4:1">1</span>  And when Saul's son heard that Abner was
dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were
affrighted. <span id="an_sa2:4:2">2</span>  And Saul's son had two men
that were captains of bands; the name of the one was Baanah, and the
name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the
children of Benjamin; for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin; <span
id="an_sa2:4:3">3</span>  and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have
been sojourners there until this day.

<span id="an_sa2:4:4">4</span>  Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that
was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of
Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled;
and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became
lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

<span id="an_sa2:4:5">5</span>  And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite,
Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house
of Ish-bosheth, as he took his rest at noon. <span
id="an_sa2:4:6">6</span>  And they came thither into the midst of the
house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him in
the groin; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. <span
id="an_sa2:4:7">7</span>  Now when they came into the house, as he lay
on his bed in his bed-chamber, they smote him, and slew him, and
beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all
night. <span id="an_sa2:4:8">8</span>  And they brought the head of
Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king: \`Behold the
head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, who sought thy life;
and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his
seed.' <span id="an_sa2:4:9">9</span>  And David answered Rechab and
Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto
them: \`As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all
adversity, <span id="an_sa2:4:10">10</span>  when one told me, saying:
Behold, Saul is dead, and he was in his own eyes as though he brought
good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, instead of
giving a reward for his tidings. <span id="an_sa2:4:11">11</span>  How
much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own
house upon his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and
take you away from the earth?' <span id="an_sa2:4:12">12</span>  And
David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their
hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But
they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner
in Hebron.
