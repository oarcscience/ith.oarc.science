### II SAMUEL CHAPTER 16

<span id="an_sa2:16:1">1</span>  And when David was a little past the
top, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of
asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred
clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of
wine. <span id="an_sa2:16:2">2</span>  And the king said unto Ziba:
\`What meanest thou by these?' And Ziba said: \`The asses are for the
king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the
young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness
may drink.' <span id="an_sa2:16:3">3</span>  And the king said: \`And
where is thy master's son?' And Ziba said unto the king: \`Behold, he
abideth at Jerusalem; for he said: To-day will the house of Israel
restore me the kingdom of my father.' <span id="an_sa2:16:4">4</span> 
Then said the king to Ziba: \`Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto
Mephibosheth.'

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And Ziba said: \`I
prostrate myself; let me find favour in thy sight, my lord, O king.'

<span id="an_sa2:16:5">5</span>  And when king David came to Bahurim,
behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul,
whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and kept on cursing
as he came. <span id="an_sa2:16:6">6</span>  And he cast stones at
David, and at all the servants of king David; and all the people and all
the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. <span
id="an_sa2:16:7">7</span>  And thus said Shimei when he cursed:
\`Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow; <span
id="an_sa2:16:8">8</span>  the LORD hath returned upon thee all the
blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the
LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and,
behold, thou art taken in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of
blood.'

<span id="an_sa2:16:9">9</span>  Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah
unto the king: \`Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me
go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.' <span
id="an_sa2:16:10">10</span>  And the king said: \`What have I to do with
you, ye sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because the LORD hath said
unto him: Curse David; who then shall say: Wherefore hast thou done so?'
<span id="an_sa2:16:11">11</span>  And David said to Abishai, and to all
his servants: \`Behold, my son, who came forth of my body, seeketh my
life; how much more this Benjamite now? let him alone, and let him
curse; for the LORD hath bidden him. <span id="an_sa2:16:12">12</span> 
It may be that the LORD will look on mine eye, and that the LORD will
requite me good for his cursing of me this day.' <span
id="an_sa2:16:13">13</span>  So David and his men went by the way; and
Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he
went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. <span
id="an_sa2:16:14">14</span>  And the king, and all the people that were
with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.

<span id="an_sa2:16:15">15</span>  And Absalom, and all the people, the
men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. <span
id="an_sa2:16:16">16</span>  And it came to pass, when Hushai the
Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto
Absalom: \`Long live the king, long live the king.' <span
id="an_sa2:16:17">17</span>  And Absalom said to Hushai: \`Is this thy
kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?' <span
id="an_sa2:16:18">18</span>  And Hushai said unto Absalom: \`Nay; but
whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen,
his will I be, and with him will I abide. <span
id="an_sa2:16:19">19</span>  And again, whom should I serve? should I
not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's
presence, so will I be in thy presence.'

<span id="an_sa2:16:20">20</span>  Then said Absalom to Ahithophel:
\`Give your counsel what we shall do.' <span
id="an_sa2:16:21">21</span>  And Ahithophel said unto Absalom: \`Go in
unto thy father's concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and
all Israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father; then will the
hands of all that are with thee be strong.' <span
id="an_sa2:16:22">22</span>  So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top
of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the
sight of all Israel.—<span id="an_sa2:16:23">23</span>  Now the counsel
of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man
inquired of the word of God; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both
with David and with Absalom.
