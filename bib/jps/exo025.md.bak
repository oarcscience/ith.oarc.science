### EXODUS CHAPTER 25

<span id="an_exo:25:1">1</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_exo:25:2">2</span> 'Speak unto the children of Israel, that
they take for Me an offering; of every man whose heart maketh him
willing ye shall take My offering. <span id="an_exo:25:3">3</span> And
this is the offering which ye shall take of them: gold, and silver, and
brass; <span id="an_exo:25:4">4</span> and blue, and purple, and
scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’ hair; <span
id="an_exo:25:5">5</span> and rams’ skins dyed red, and sealskins, and
acacia-wood; <span id="an_exo:25:6">6</span> oil for the light, spices
for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense; <span
id="an_exo:25:7">7</span> onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the
ephod, and for the breastplate. <span id="an_exo:25:8">8</span> And let
them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them. <span
id="an_exo:25:9">9</span> According to all that I show thee, the pattern
of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the furniture thereof, even so
shall ye make it.

<span id="an_exo:25:10">10</span> And they shall make an ark of
acacia-wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a
cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height
thereof. <span id="an_exo:25:11">11</span> And thou shalt overlay it
with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make
upon it a crown of gold round about. <span
id="an_exo:25:12">12</span> And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for
it, and put them in the four feet thereof; and two rings shall be on the
one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it. <span
id="an_exo:25:13">13</span> And thou shalt make staves of acacia-wood,
and overlay them with gold. <span id="an_exo:25:14">14</span> And thou
shalt put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, wherewith
to bear the ark. <span id="an_exo:25:15">15</span> The staves shall be
in the rings of the ark; they shall not be taken from it. <span
id="an_exo:25:16">16</span> And thou shalt put into the ark the
testimony which I shall give thee. <span id="an_exo:25:17">17</span> And
thou shalt make an ark-cover of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall
be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof. <span
id="an_exo:25:18">18</span> And thou shalt make two cherubim of gold; of
beaten work shalt thou make them, at the two ends of the ark-cover.
<span id="an_exo:25:19">19</span> And make one cherub at the one end,
and one cherub at the other end; of one piece with the ark-cover shall
<span id="page_95">p. 95</span> ye make the cherubim of the two ends
thereof. <span id="an_exo:25:20">20</span> And the cherubim shall spread
out their wings on high, screening the ark-cover with their wings, with
their faces one to another; toward the ark-cover shall the faces of the
cherubim be. <span id="an_exo:25:21">21</span> And thou shalt put the
ark-cover above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the
testimony that I shall give thee. <span id="an_exo:25:22">22</span> And
there I will meet with thee, and I will speak with thee from above the
ark-cover, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the
testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the
children of Israel.

<span id="an_exo:25:23">23</span> And thou shalt make a table of
acacia-wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the
breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. <span
id="an_exo:25:24">24</span> And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold,
and make thereto a crown of gold round about. <span
id="an_exo:25:25">25</span> And thou shalt make unto it a border of a
handbreadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the
border thereof round about. <span id="an_exo:25:26">26</span> And thou
shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four
corners that are on the four feet thereof. <span
id="an_exo:25:27">27</span> Close by the border shall the rings be, for
places for the staves to bear the table. <span
id="an_exo:25:28">28</span> And thou shalt make the staves of
acacia-wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne
with them. <span id="an_exo:25:29">29</span> And thou shalt make the
dishes thereof, and the pans thereof, and the jars thereof, and the
bowls thereof, wherewith to pour out; of pure gold shalt thou make them.
<span id="an_exo:25:30">30</span> And thou shalt set upon the table
showbread before Me alway.

<span id="an_exo:25:31">31</span> And thou shalt make a candlestick of
pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made, even its base,
and its shaft; its cups, its knops, and its flowers, shall be of one
piece with it. <span id="an_exo:25:32">32</span> And there shall be six
branches going out of the sides thereof: three branches of the
candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the
candlestick out of the other side thereof; <span
id="an_exo:25:33">33</span> three cups made like almond-blossoms in one
branch, a knop and a flower; and three cups made like almond-blossoms in
the other branch, a knop and a flower; so for the six branches going out
of the candlestick. <span id="an_exo:25:34">34</span> And in the
candlestick four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knops thereof, and
the flowers thereof. <span id="an_exo:25:35">35</span> And a knop under
two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one
piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for
the six branches going out of the candlestick. <span
id="an_exo:25:36">36</span> Their knops and their branches shall be of
one piece with it; the whole of it one beaten work of pure gold. <span
id="an_exo:25:37">37</span> And thou shalt make the lamps thereof,
seven; and they shall light the lamps thereof, to give light over
against it. <span id="an_exo:25:38">38</span> And the tongs thereof, and
the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold. <span
id="an_exo:25:39">39</span> Of a talent of pure gold shall it be made,
with all these vessels. <span id="an_exo:25:40">40</span> And see that
thou make them after their pattern, which is being shown thee in the
mount.
