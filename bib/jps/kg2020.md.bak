### II Kings Chapter 20

<span id="an_kg2:20:1">1</span> In those days was Hezekiah sick unto
death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto
him: \`Thus saith the LORD: Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die,
and not live.' <span id="an_kg2:20:2">2</span> Then he turned his face
to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying: <span
id="an_kg2:20:3">3</span> \`Remember now, O LORD, I beseech Thee, how I
have walked before Thee in truth and with a whole heart, and have done
that which is good in Thy sight.' And Hezekiah wept sore. <span
id="an_kg2:20:4">4</span> And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone
out of the inner court of the city, that the word of the LORD came to
him, saying: <span id="an_kg2:20:5">5</span> \`Return, and say to
Hezekiah the prince of My people: Thus saith the LORD, the God of David
thy father: I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears; behold, I
will heal thee; on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the
LORD. <span id="an_kg2:20:6">6</span> And I will add unto thy days
fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of
the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for Mine own sake, and
for My servant David's sake.' <span id="an_kg2:20:7">7</span> And Isaiah
said: \`Take a cake of figs.' And they took and laid it on the boil, and
he recovered.

<span id="an_kg2:20:8">8</span> And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah: \`What
shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up
unto the house of the LORD the third day?' <span
id="an_kg2:20:9">9</span> And Isaiah said: \`This shall be the sign unto
thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that He hath spoken:
shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?' <span
id="an_kg2:20:10">10</span> And Hezekiah answered: \`It is a light thing
for the shadow to decline ten degrees; nay, but let the shadow return
backward ten degrees.' <span id="an_kg2:20:11">11</span> And Isaiah the
prophet cried unto the LORD; and he brought the shadow ten degrees
backward, by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz.

<span id="an_kg2:20:12">12</span> At that time Berodach-baladan the son
of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent a letter and a present unto Hezekiah;
for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. <span
id="an_kg2:20:13">13</span> And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and showed
them all his treasure-house, the silver, and the gold, and the spices,
and the precious oil, and the house of his armour, and all that was
found in his treasures; there was nothing in his

<span id="page_471">p. 471</span>

house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not. <span
id="an_kg2:20:14">14</span> Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king
Hezekiah, and said unto him: \`What said these men? and from whence came
they unto thee?' And Hezekiah said: \`They are come from a far country,
even from Babylon.' <span id="an_kg2:20:15">15</span> And he said:
\`What have they seen in thy house?' And Hezekiah answered: \`All that
is in my house have they seen; there is nothing among my treasures that
I have not shown them.'

<span id="an_kg2:20:16">16</span> And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah: \`Hear
the word of the LORD. <span id="an_kg2:20:17">17</span> Behold, the days
come, that all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have
laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing
shall be left, saith the LORD. <span id="an_kg2:20:18">18</span> And of
thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they
take away; and they shall be officers in the palace of the king of
Babylon.' <span id="an_kg2:20:19">19</span> Then said Hezekiah unto
Isaiah: \`Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken.' He said
moreover: \`Is it not so, if peace and truth shall be in my days?'

<span id="an_kg2:20:20">20</span> Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah,
and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and
brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Judah? <span id="an_kg2:20:21">21</span> And
Hezekiah slept with his fathers; and Manasseh his son reigned in his
stead.
