### DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER 31

‏וילך‎

<span id="an_deu:31:1">1</span> And Moses went and spoke these words
unto all Israel. <span id="an_deu:31:2">2</span> And he said unto them:
\`I am a hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and
come in; and the LORD hath said unto me: Thou shalt not go over this
Jordan. <span id="an_deu:31:3">3</span> The LORD thy God, He will go
over before thee; He will destroy these nations from before thee, and
thou shalt dispossess them; and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as
the LORD hath spoken. <span id="an_deu:31:4">4</span> And the LORD will
do unto them as He did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites,
and unto their land; whom He destroyed. <span
id="an_deu:31:5">5</span> And the LORD will deliver them up before you,
and ye shall do unto them according unto all the
[commandments](errata.htm#3.md) which I have commanded you. <span
id="an_deu:31:6">6</span> Be strong and of good courage, fear not, nor
be affrighted at them; for the LORD thy God, He it is that doth go with
thee; He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.'

<span id="an_deu:31:7">7</span> And Moses called unto Joshua, and said
unto him in the sight of all Israel: \`Be strong and of good courage;
for thou shalt go with this people into the land which the LORD hath
sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to
inherit it. <span id="an_deu:31:8">8</span> And the LORD, He it is that
doth

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

go before thee; He will be with thee, He will not fail thee, neither
forsake thee; fear not, neither be dismayed.'

<span id="an_deu:31:9">9</span> And Moses wrote this law, and delivered
it unto the priests the sons of Levi, that bore the ark of the covenant
of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel. <span
id="an_deu:31:10">10</span> And Moses commanded them, saying: \`At the
end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the
feast of tabernacles, <span id="an_deu:31:11">11</span> when all Israel
is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which He shall
choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
<span id="an_deu:31:12">12</span> Assemble the people, the men and the
women and the little ones, and thy stranger that is within thy gates,
that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God,
and observe to do all the words of this law; <span
id="an_deu:31:13">13</span> and that their children, who have not known,
may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the
land whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.'

<span id="an_deu:31:14">14</span> And the LORD said unto Moses:
\`Behold, thy days approach that thou must die; call Joshua, and present
yourselves in the tent of meeting, that I may give him a charge.' And
Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.
<span id="an_deu:31:15">15</span> And the LORD appeared in the Tent in a
pillar of cloud; and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the
Tent. <span id="an_deu:31:16">16</span> And the LORD said unto Moses:
\`Behold, thou art about to sleep with thy fathers; and this people will
rise up, and go astray after the foreign gods of the land, whither they
go to be among them, and will forsake Me, and break My covenant which I
have made with them. <span id="an_deu:31:17">17</span> Then My anger
shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and
I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many
evils and troubles shall come upon them; so that they will say in that
day: Are not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?
<span id="an_deu:31:18">18</span> And I will surely hide My face in that
day for all the evil which they shall have wrought, in that they are
turned unto other gods. <span id="an_deu:31:19">19</span> Now therefore
write ye this song for you, and teach thou it the children of Israel;
put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for Me against
the children of Israel. <span id="an_deu:31:20">20</span> For when I
shall have brought them into the land which I swore unto their fathers,
flowing with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten their fill, and
waxen fat; and turned unto other gods, and served them, and despised Me,
and broken My covenant; <span id="an_deu:31:21">21</span> then it shall
come to pass, when many evils and troubles are come upon them, that this
song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be
forgotten out of the mouths of their seed; for I know their imagination
how they do even now, before I have brought them into the land which I
swore.' <span id="an_deu:31:22">22</span> So Moses wrote this song the
same day, and taught it the children of Israel. <span
id="an_deu:31:23">23</span> And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge,
and said: \`Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt bring the
children of Israel into the land which I swore unto them; and I will be
with thee.'

<span id="an_deu:31:24">24</span> And it came to pass, when Moses had
made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were
finished, <span id="an_deu:31:25">25</span> that Moses commanded the
Levites, that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying: <span
id="an_deu:31:26">26</span> \`Take this book of the law, and put it by
the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

it may be there for a witness against thee. <span
id="an_deu:31:27">27</span> For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff
neck; behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been
rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death? <span
id="an_deu:31:28">28</span> Assemble unto me all the elders of your
tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears,
and call heaven and earth to witness against them. <span
id="an_deu:31:29">29</span> For I know that after my death ye will in
any wise deal corruptly, and turn aside from the way which I have
commanded you; and evil will befall you in the end of days; because ye
will do that which is evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke Him
through the work of your hands.' <span id="an_deu:31:30">30</span> And
Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this
song, until they were finished:
