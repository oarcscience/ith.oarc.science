### LEVITICUS CHAPTER 24

<span id="an_lev:24:1">1</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_lev:24:2">2</span> 'Command the children of Israel, that
they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a
lamp to burn continually. <span id="an_lev:24:3">3</span> Without the
veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, shall Aaron order it from
evening to morning before the LORD continually; it shall be a statute
for ever throughout your generations. <span id="an_lev:24:4">4</span> He
shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD
continually.

<span id="an_lev:24:5">5</span> And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake
twelve cakes thereof: two tenth parts of an ephah shall be in one cake.
<span id="an_lev:24:6">6</span> And thou shalt set them in two rows, six
in a row, upon the pure table before the LORD. <span
id="an_lev:24:7">7</span> And thou shalt put pure frankincense with each
row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial-part, even an offering
made by fire unto the LORD. <span id="an_lev:24:8">8</span> Every
sabbath day he shall set it in order before the LORD continually; it is
from the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant. <span
id="an_lev:24:9">9</span> And it shall be for Aaron and his sons; and
they shall eat it in a holy place; for it is most holy unto him of the
offerings of the LORD made by fire, a perpetual due.'

<span id="an_lev:24:10">10</span> And the son of an Israelitish woman,
whose father was an Egyptian, <span id="page_150">p. 150</span> went out
among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelitish woman and a
man of Israel strove together in the camp. <span
id="an_lev:24:11">11</span> And the son of the Israelitish woman
blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him unto Moses. And
his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of
Dan. <span id="an_lev:24:12">12</span> And they put him in ward, that it
might be declared unto them at the mouth of the LORD.

<span id="an_lev:24:13">13</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_lev:24:14">14</span> Bring forth him that hath cursed
without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his
head, and let all the congregation stone him. <span
id="an_lev:24:15">15</span> And thou shalt speak unto the children of
Israel, saying: Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin. <span
id="an_lev:24:16">16</span> And he that blasphemeth the name of the
LORD, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall
certainly stone him; as well the stranger, as the home-born, when he
blasphemeth the Name, shall be put to death. <span
id="an_lev:24:17">17</span> And he that smiteth any man mortally shall
surely be put to death. <span id="an_lev:24:18">18</span> And he that
smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good: life for life. <span
id="an_lev:24:19">19</span> And if a man maim his neighbour; as he hath
done, so shall it be done to him: <span
id="an_lev:24:20">20</span> breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for
tooth; as he hath maimed a man, so shall it be rendered unto him. <span
id="an_lev:24:21">21</span> And he that killeth a beast shall make it
good; and he that killeth a man shall be put to death. <span
id="an_lev:24:22">22</span> Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for
the stranger, as for the home-born; for I am the LORD your God.' <span
id="an_lev:24:23">23</span> And Moses spoke to the children of Israel,
and they brought forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stoned
him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded
Moses.
