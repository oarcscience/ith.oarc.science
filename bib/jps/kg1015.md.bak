### I Kings Chapter 15

<span id="an_kg1:15:1">1</span> Now in the eighteenth year of king
Jeroboam the son of Nebat began Abijam to reign over Judah. <span
id="an_kg1:15:2">2</span> Three years reigned he in Jerusalem; and his
mother's name.was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. <span
id="an_kg1:15:3">3</span> And he walked in all the sins of his father,
which he had done before him; and his heart was not whole with the LORD
his God, as the heart of David his father. <span
id="an_kg1:15:4">4</span> Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his
God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to
establish Jerusalem; <span id="an_kg1:15:5">5</span> because David did
that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from
any thing that He commanded him all the days of his life, save only in
the matter of Uriah the Hittite. <span id="an_kg1:15:6">6</span> Now
there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.

<span id="an_kg1:15:7">7</span> And the rest of the acts of Abijam, and
all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.

<span id="page_427">p. 427</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> <span
id="an_kg1:15:8">8</span> And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they
buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_kg1:15:9">9</span> And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam
king of Israel began Asa to reign over Judah. 10And forty and one years
reigned he in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Maacah the daughter
of Abishalom. <span id="an_kg1:15:10">10</span> And Asa did that which
was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did David his father. <span
id="an_kg1:15:12">12</span> And he put away the sodomites out of the
land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. <span
id="an_kg1:15:13">13</span> And also Maacah his mother he removed from
being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah;
and Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron. <span
id="an_kg1:15:14">14</span> But the high places were not taken away;
nevertheless the heart of Asa was whole with the LORD all his days.
<span id="an_kg1:15:15">15</span> And he brought into the house of the
LORD the things that his father had hallowed, and the things that
himself had hallowed, silver, and gold, and vessels.

<span id="an_kg1:15:16">16</span> And there was war between Asa and
Baasa king of Israel all their days. <span
id="an_kg1:15:17">17</span> And Baasa king of Israel went up against
Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come
in to Asa king of Judah. <span id="an_kg1:15:18">18</span> Then Asa took
all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house
of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them
into the hand of his servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the
son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Aram, that dwelt at
Damascus, saying: <span id="an_kg1:15:19">19</span> 'There is a league
between me and thee, between my father and thy father; behold, I have
sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; go, break thy league with
Baasa king of Israel, that he may depart from me.' <span
id="an_kg1:15:20">20</span> And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and
sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and smote
Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the
land of Naphtali. <span id="an_kg1:15:21">21</span> And it came to pass,
when Baasa heard thereof, that he left off building Ramah, and dwelt in
Tirzah. <span id="an_kg1:15:22">22</span> Then king Asa made a
proclamation unto all Judah; none was exempted; and they carried away
the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasa had
builded; and king Asa built therewith Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.

<span id="an_kg1:15:23">23</span> Now the rest of all the acts of Asa,
and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built,
are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. <span
id="an_kg1:15:24">24</span> And Asa slept with his fathers, and was
buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoshaphat
his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_kg1:15:25">25</span> And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to
reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he
reigned over Israel two years. <span id="an_kg1:15:26">26</span> And he
did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way
of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin. <span
id="an_kg1:15:27">27</span> And Baasa the son of Ahijah, of the house of
Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasa smote him at Gibbethon, which
belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege
to Gibbethon. <span id="an_kg1:15:28">28</span> Even in the third year
of Asa king of Judah did Baasa slay him, and reigned in his stead. <span
id="an_kg1:15:29">29</span> And it came to pass that, as soon as he was
king; he smote all the house of Jeroboam,

<span id="page_428">p. 428</span>

he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him;
according unto the saying of the LORD, which He spoke by the hand of His
servant Ahijah the Shilonite; <span id="an_kg1:15:30">30</span> for the
sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and wherewith he made Israel to sin;
because of his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD, the God of
Israel.

<span id="an_kg1:15:31">31</span> Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and
all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
the kings of Israel? <span id="an_kg1:15:32">32</span> And there was war
between Asa and Baasa king of Israel all their days.

<span id="an_kg1:15:33">33</span> In the third year of Asa king of Judah
began Baasa the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, and
reigned twenty and four years. <span id="an_kg1:15:34">34</span> And he
did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way
of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
