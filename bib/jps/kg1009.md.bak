### I Kings Chapter 9

<span id="an_kg1:9:1">1</span> And it came to pass, when Solomon had
finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king's house,
and all Solomon's delight which he was pleased to do, <span
id="an_kg1:9:2">2</span> that the LORD appeared to Solomon the second
time, as He had appeared unto him at Gibeon. <span
id="an_kg1:9:3">3</span> And the LORD said unto him: \`I have heard thy
prayer and thy supplication, that thou

<span id="page_417">p. 417</span>

hast made before Me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built,
to put My name there for ever; and Mine eyes and My heart shall be there
perpetually. <span id="an_kg1:9:4">4</span> And as for thee, if thou
wilt walk before Me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart,
and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee,
and wilt keep My statutes and Mine ordinances; <span
id="an_kg1:9:5">5</span> then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom
over Israel for ever; according as I promised to David thy father,
saying: There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel. <span
id="an_kg1:9:6">6</span> But if ye shall turn away from following Me, ye
or your children, and not keep My commandments and My statutes which I
have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship
them; <span id="an_kg1:9:7">7</span> then will I cut off Israel out of
the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed
for My name, will I cast out of My sight; and Israel shall be a proverb
and a byword among all peoples; <span id="an_kg1:9:8">8</span> and this
house which is so high \[shall become desolate\], and every one that
passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and when they shall
say: Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?
<span id="an_kg1:9:9">9</span> they shall be answered: Because they
forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the
land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and
served them; therefore bath the LORD brought all this evil upon them.'

<span id="an_kg1:9:10">10</span> And it came to pass at the end of
twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the
LORD and the king's house—<span id="an_kg1:9:11">11</span> now Hiram the
king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar-trees and cypress-trees,
and with gold, according to all his desire—that then king Solomon gave
Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. <span
id="an_kg1:9:12">12</span> And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the
cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not. <span
id="an_kg1:9:13">13</span> And he said: \`What cities are these which
thou hast given me, my brother?' And they were called the land of Cabul,
unto this day. <span id="an_kg1:9:14">14</span> And Hiram sent to the
king sixscore talents of gold.

<span id="an_kg1:9:15">15</span> And this is the account of the levy
which king Solomon raised; to build the house of the LORD, and his own
house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and
Gezer. <span id="an_kg1:9:16">16</span> Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone
up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites
that dwelt in the city, and given it for a portion unto his daughter,
Solomon's wife. <span id="an_kg1:9:17">17</span> And Solomon built
Gezer, and Beth-boron the nether, <span id="an_kg1:9:18">18</span> and
Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land, <span
id="an_kg1:9:19">19</span> and all the store-cities that Solomon had,
and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and
that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and
in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. <span
id="an_kg1:9:20">20</span> All the people that were left of the
Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites,
who were not of the children of Israel; <span
id="an_kg1:9:21">21</span> even their children that were left after them
in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to
destroy, of them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants, unto this
day. <span id="an_kg1:9:22">22</span> But of the children of Israel did
Solomon make no bondservants; but they were the men of war, and his
servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots
and of his horsemen.

<span id="page_418">p. 418</span>

<span id="an_kg1:9:23">23</span> These were the chief officers that were
over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, who bore rule over the
people that wrought in the work.

<span id="an_kg1:9:24">24</span> But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of
the city of David unto her house which \[Solomon\] had built for her;
then did he build Millo.

<span id="an_kg1:9:25">25</span> And three times in a year did Solomon
offer burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar which he built
unto the LORD, offering thereby, upon the altar that was before the
LORD. So he finished the house.

<span id="an_kg1:9:26">26</span> And king Solomon made a navy of ships
in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in
the land of Edom. <span id="an_kg1:9:27">27</span> And Hiram sent in the
navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the
servants of Solomon. <span id="an_kg1:9:28">28</span> And they came to
Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents,
and brought it to king Solomon.
