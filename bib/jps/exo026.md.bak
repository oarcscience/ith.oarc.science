### EXODUS CHAPTER 26

<span id="an_exo:26:1">1</span> Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle
with ten curtains: of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and
scarlet, with cherubim the work of the skilful workman shalt thou make
them. <span id="an_exo:26:2">2</span> The length of each curtain shall
be eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits;
all the curtains shall have one measure. <span
id="an_exo:26:3">3</span> Five curtains shall be coupled together one to
another; and the other five curtains <span id="page_96">p. 96</span>
shall be coupled one to another. <span id="an_exo:26:4">4</span> And
thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain that is
outmost in the first set; and likewise shalt thou make in the edge of
the curtain that is outmost in the second set. <span
id="an_exo:26:5">5</span> Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one
curtain, and fifty loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that
is in the second set; the loops shall be opposite one to another. <span
id="an_exo:26:6">6</span> And thou shalt make fifty clasps of gold, and
couple the curtains one to another with the clasps, that the tabernacle
may be one whole. <span id="an_exo:26:7">7</span> And thou shalt make
curtains of goats’ hair for a tent over the tabernacle; eleven curtains
shalt thou make them. <span id="an_exo:26:8">8</span> The length of each
curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four
cubits; the eleven curtains shall have one measure. <span
id="an_exo:26:9">9</span> And thou shalt couple five curtains by
themselves, and six curtains by themselves, and shalt double over the
sixth curtain in the forefront of the tent. <span
id="an_exo:26:10">10</span> And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge
of the one curtain that is outmost in the first set, and fifty loops
upon the edge of the curtain which is outmost in the second set. <span
id="an_exo:26:11">11</span> And thou shalt make fifty clasps of brass,
and put the clasps into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it
may be one. <span id="an_exo:26:12">12</span> And as for the overhanging
part that remaineth of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that
remaineth over shall hang over the back of the tabernacle. <span
id="an_exo:26:13">13</span> And the cubit on the one side, and the cubit
on the other side, of that which remaineth over in the length of the
curtains of the tent, shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on
this side and on that side, to cover it. <span
id="an_exo:26:14">14</span> And thou shalt make a covering for the tent
of rams’ skins dyed red, and a covering of sealskins above.

<span id="an_exo:26:15">15</span> And thou shalt make the boards for the
tabernacle of acacia-wood, standing up. <span
id="an_exo:26:16">16</span> Ten cubits shall be the length of a board,
and a cubit. and a half the breadth of each board. <span
id="an_exo:26:17">17</span> Two tenons shall there be in each board,
joined one to another; thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the
tabernacle. <span id="an_exo:26:18">18</span> And thou shalt make the
boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards for the south side southward.
<span id="an_exo:26:19">19</span> And thou shalt make: forty sockets of
silver under the twenty boards: two sockets under one board for its two
tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons; <span
id="an_exo:26:20">20</span> and for the second side of the tabernacle,
on the north side, twenty boards. <span id="an_exo:26:21">21</span> And
their forty sockets of silver: two sockets under one board, and two
sockets under another board. <span id="an_exo:26:22">22</span> And for
the hinder part of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make six boards.
<span id="an_exo:26:23">23</span> And two boards shalt thou make for the
corners of the tabernacle in the hinder part. <span
id="an_exo:26:24">24</span> And they shall be double beneath, and in
like manner they shall be complete unto, the top thereof unto the first
ring; thus shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners.
<span id="an_exo:26:25">25</span> Thus there shall be eight boards, and
their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets: two sockets under one board,
and two sockets under another board., <span
id="an_exo:26:26">26</span> And thou shalt make bars of acacia-wood:
five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, <span
id="an_exo:26:27">27</span> and five bars for the boards of the other
side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the
tabernacle, for the hinder part westward; <span
id="an_exo:26:28">28</span> and the middle bar in the midst of the
boards, which shall pass through from I end to end. <span
id="an_exo:26:29">29</span> And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold,
and make their rings of gold for holders for the bars; <span
id="page_97">p. 97</span> and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold.
<span id="an_exo:26:30">30</span> And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle
according to the fashion thereof which hath been shown thee in the
mount.

<span id="an_exo:26:31">31</span> And thou shalt make a veil of blue,
and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; with cherubim the work
of the skilful workman shall it be made. <span
id="an_exo:26:32">32</span> And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of
acacia overlaid with gold, their hooks being of gold, upon four sockets
of silver. <span id="an_exo:26:33">33</span> And thou shalt hang up the
veil under the clasps, and shalt bring in thither within the veil the
ark of the testimony; and the veil shall divide unto you between the
holy place and the most holy. <span id="an_exo:26:34">34</span> And thou
shalt put the ark-cover upon the ark of the testimony in the most holy
place. <span id="an_exo:26:35">35</span> And thou shalt set the table
without the veil, and the candlestick over against the table on the side
of the tabernacle toward the south; and thou shalt put the table on the
north side. <span id="an_exo:26:36">36</span> And thou shalt make a
screen for the door of the Tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and
fine twined linen, the work of the weaver in colours. <span
id="an_exo:26:37">37</span> And thou shalt make for the screen five
pillars of acacia, and overlay them with gold; their hooks shall be of
gold; and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them.
