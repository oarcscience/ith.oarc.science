### EXODUS CHAPTER 19

<span id="an_exo:19:1">1</span> In the third month after the children of
Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they
into the wilderness of Sinai. <span id="an_exo:19:2">2</span> And when
they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the wilderness of
Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before
the mount. <span id="an_exo:19:3">3</span> And Moses went up unto God,
and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying: 'Thus shalt
thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: <span
id="an_exo:19:4">4</span> Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians,
and how I bore you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto Myself. <span
id="an_exo:19:5">5</span> Now therefore, if ye will hearken unto My
voice indeed, and keep My covenant, then ye shall be Mine own treasure
from among all peoples; for all the earth is Mine; <span
id="an_exo:19:6">6</span> and ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests,
and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the
children of Israel.' <span id="an_exo:19:7">7</span> And Moses came and
called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words
which the LORD commanded him. <span id="an_exo:19:8">8</span> And all
the <span id="page_88">p. 88</span> people answered together, and said:
'All that the LORD hath spoken we will do.' And Moses reported the words
of the people unto the LORD. <span id="an_exo:19:9">9</span> And the
LORD said unto Moses: 'Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the
people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee for
ever.' And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD. <span
id="an_exo:19:10">10</span> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Go unto the
people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their
garments, rand be ready against the third day; for the third day the
LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.
<span id="an_exo:19:12">12</span> And thou shalt set bounds unto the
people round about, saying: Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up
into the mount, or touch the border of it; whosoever toucheth the mount
shall be surely put to death; <span id="an_exo:19:13">13</span> no hand
shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether
it be beast or man, it shall not live; when the ram's horn soundeth
long, they shall come up to the mount.' <span
id="an_exo:19:14">14</span> And Moses went down from the mount unto the
people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their garments. <span
id="an_exo:19:15">15</span> And he said unto the people: 'Be ready
against the third day; come not near a woman.' <span
id="an_exo:19:16">16</span> And it came to pass on the third day, when
it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings and a thick
cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a horn exceeding loud; and all
the people that were in the camp trembled. <span
id="an_exo:19:17">17</span> And Moses brought forth the people out of
the camp to meet God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
<span id="an_exo:19:18">18</span> Now mount Sinai was altogether on
smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof
ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.
<span id="an_exo:19:19">19</span> And when the voice of the horn waxed
louder and louder Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice. <span
id="an_exo:19:20">20</span> And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, to
the top of the mount; and the LORD called Moses to the top of the mount;
and Moses went up. <span id="an_exo:19:21">21</span> And the LORD said
unto Moses: 'Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto
the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish. <span
id="an_exo:19:22">22</span> And let the priests also, that come near to
the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them'.
<span id="an_exo:19:23">23</span> And Moses said unto the LORD: 'The
people cannot come up to mount Sinai; for thou didst charge us, saying:
Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.' <span
id="an_exo:19:24">24</span> And the LORD said unto him: 'Go, get thee
down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee; but let not the
priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest He
break forth upon them.' <span id="an_exo:19:25">25</span> So Moses went
down unto the people, and told them.
