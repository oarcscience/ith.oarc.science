### DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER 23

<span id="an_deu:23:1">1</span> A man shall not take his father's wife,
and shall not uncover his father's skirt.

<span id="an_deu:23:2">2</span> He that is crushed or maimed in his
privy parts shall not enter into the assembly of the LORD.

<span id="an_deu:23:3">3</span> A bastard shall not enter into the
assembly of the LORD; even to the tenth generation shall none of his
enter into the assembly of the LORD.

<span id="an_deu:23:4">4</span> An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter
into the assembly of the LORD; even to the tenth generation shall none
of them enter into the assembly of the LORD for ever; <span
id="an_deu:23:5">5</span> because they met you not with bread and with
water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they
hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Aram-naharaim,

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

to curse thee. <span id="an_deu:23:6">6</span> Nevertheless the LORD thy
God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the LORD thy God turned the curse
into a blessing unto thee, because the LORD thy God loved thee. <span
id="an_deu:23:7">7</span> Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their
prosperity all thy days for ever.

<span id="an_deu:23:8">8</span> Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite, for he
is thy brother; thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian, because thou wast a
stranger in his land. <span id="an_deu:23:9">9</span> The children of
the third generation that are born unto them may enter into the assembly
of the LORD.

<span id="an_deu:23:10">10</span> When thou goest forth in camp against
thine enemies, then thou shalt keep thee from every evil thing. <span
id="an_deu:23:11">11</span> If there be among you any man, that is not
clean by reason of that which chanceth him by night, then shall he go
abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp. <span
id="an_deu:23:12">12</span> But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he
shall bathe himself in water; and when the sun is down, he may come
within the camp. <span id="an_deu:23:13">13</span> Thou shalt have a
place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad. <span
id="an_deu:23:14">14</span> And thou shalt have a paddle among thy
weapons; and it shall be, when thou sittest down abroad, thou shalt dig
therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee.
<span id="an_deu:23:15">15</span> For the LORD thy God walketh in the
midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before
thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy; that He see no unseemly thing in
thee, and turn away from thee.

<span id="an_deu:23:16">16</span> Thou shalt not deliver unto his master
a bondman that is escaped from his master unto thee; <span
id="an_deu:23:17">17</span> he shall dwell with thee, in the midst of
thee, in the place which he shall choose within one of thy gates, where
it liketh him best; thou shalt not wrong him.

<span id="an_deu:23:18">18</span> There shall be no harlot of the
daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of
Israel. <span id="an_deu:23:19">19</span> Thou shalt not bring the hire
of a harlot, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD thy God
for any vow; for even both these are an abomination unto the LORD thy
God.

<span id="an_deu:23:20">20</span> Thou shalt not lend upon interest to
thy brother: interest of money, interest of victuals, interest of any
thing that is lent upon interest. <span id="an_deu:23:21">21</span> Unto
a foreigner thou mayest lend upon interest; but unto thy brother thou
shalt not lend upon interest; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in
all that thou puttest thy hand unto, in the land whither thou goest in
to possess it.

<span id="an_deu:23:22">22</span> When thou shalt vow a vow unto the
LORD thy God, thou shalt not be slack to pay it; for the LORD thy God
will surely require it of thee; and it will be sin in thee. <span
id="an_deu:23:23">23</span> But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall
be no sin in thee. <span id="an_deu:23:24">24</span> That which is gone
out of thy lips thou shalt observe and do; according as thou hast vowed
freely unto the LORD thy God, even that which thou hast promised with
thy mouth.

<span id="an_deu:23:25">25</span> When thou comest into thy neighbour's
vineyard, then thou mayest eat grapes until thou have enough at thine
own pleasure; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel.

<span id="an_deu:23:26">26</span> When thou comest into thy neighbour's
standing corn, then thou mayest pluck ears with thy hand; but thou shalt
not move a sickle unto thy neighbour's standing corn.
