#### FIRST SAMUEL

### I SAMUEL CHAPTER 1

‏שמואל א‎

<span id="an_sa1:1:1">1</span> Now there was a certain man of
Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was
Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son
of Zuph, an Ephraimite. <span id="an_sa1:1:2">2</span> And he had two
wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other
Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. <span
id="an_sa1:1:3">3</span> And this man went up out of his city from year
to year to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh.
And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there priests unto
the LORD. <span id="an_sa1:1:4">4</span> And it came to pass upon a day,
when Elkanah sacrificed, that he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all
her sons and her daughters, portions; <span id="an_sa1:1:5">5</span> but
unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but the LORD
had shut up her womb. <span id="an_sa1:1:6">6</span> And her rival vexed
her sore, to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb. <span
id="an_sa1:1:7">7</span> And as he did so year by year, when she went up
to the house of the LORD, so she vexed her; therefore she wept, and
would not eat. <span id="an_sa1:1:8">8</span> And Elkanah her husband
said unto her: \`Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and
why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?' <span
id="an_sa1:1:9">9</span> So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in
Shiloh, and after they had drunk— now Eli the priest sat upon his seat
by the doorpost of the temple of the LORD; <span
id="an_sa1:1:10">10</span> and she was in bitterness of soul— and prayed
unto the LORD, and wept sore. <span id="an_sa1:1:11">11</span> And she
vowed a vow, and said: \`O LORD of hosts, if Thou wilt indeed look on
the affliction of Thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget Thy
handmaid, but wilt give unto Thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give
him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor
come upon his head.' <span id="an_sa1:1:12">12</span> And it came to
pass, as she prayed long before the LORD, that Eli watched her mouth.
<span id="an_sa1:1:13">13</span> Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart;
only her lips moved, but her voice could not be heard; therefore Eli
thought she had been drunken. <span id="an_sa1:1:14">14</span> And Eli
said unto her: \`How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from
thee.' <span id="an_sa1:1:15">15</span> And Hannah answered and said:
\`No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit; I have drunk neither
wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before the LORD. <span
id="an_sa1:1:16">16</span> Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman:
for out of the abundance of my complaint and my vexation have I spoken
hitherto.' <span id="an_sa1:1:17">17</span> Then Eli answered and said:
\`Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant thy petition that thou hast
asked of Him.' <span id="an_sa1:1:18">18</span> And she said: \`Let thy
servant find favour in thy sight.' So the woman went her way, and did
eat, and her countenance was no more sad. <span
id="an_sa1:1:19">19</span> And they rose up in the morning early, and
worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to
Ramah; and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

her. <span id="an_sa1:1:20">20</span> And it came to pass, when the time
was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she called
his name Samuel: 'because I have asked him of the LORD.'

<span id="an_sa1:1:21">21</span> And the man Elkanah, and all his house,
went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow. <span
id="an_sa1:1:22">22</span> But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her
husband: \`Until the child be weaned, when I will bring him, that he may
appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.' <span
id="an_sa1:1:23">23</span> And Elkanah her husband said unto her: \`Do
what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD
establish His word.' So the woman tarried and gave her son suck, until
she weaned him. <span id="an_sa1:1:24">24</span> And when she had weaned
him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of
meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD
in Shiloh; and the child was young. <span id="an_sa1:1:25">25</span> And
when the bullock was slain, the child was brought to Eli. <span
id="an_sa1:1:26">26</span> And she said: \`Oh, my lord, as thy soul
liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto
the LORD. <span id="an_sa1:1:27">27</span> For this child I prayed; and
the LORD hath granted me my petition which I asked of Him; <span
id="an_sa1:1:28">28</span> therefore I also have lent him to the LORD;
as long as he liveth he is lent to the LORD.' And he worshipped the LORD
there.
