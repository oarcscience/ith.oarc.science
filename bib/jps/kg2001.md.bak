# SECOND KINGS

### II Kings Chapter 1

<span id="an_kg2:1:1">1</span> AND Moab rebelled against Israel after
the death of Ahab. <span id="an_kg2:1:2">2</span> And Ahaziah fell down
through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was
sick; and he sent messengers, and said unto them: \`Go, inquire of
Baal-zebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this sickness.'
<span id="an_kg2:1:3">3</span> But an angel of the LORD said to Elijah
the Tishbite: \`Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of
Samaria, and say unto them: Is it because there is no God in Israel,
that ye go to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? <span
id="an_kg2:1:4">4</span> Now therefore thus saith the LORD: Thou shalt
not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely
die.' And Elijah departed.

<span id="an_kg2:1:5">5</span> And the messengers returned unto him, and
he said unto them: \`Why is it that ye are returned?' <span
id="an_kg2:1:6">6</span> And they said unto him: \`There came up a man
to meet us, and said unto us: Go, return unto the king that sent you,
and say unto him: Thus saith the LORD: Is it because there is no God in
Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?
therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone
up, but shalt surely die.' <span id="an_kg2:1:7">7</span> And he said
unto them: \`What manner of man was he that came up to meet you, and
told you these words?' <span id="an_kg2:1:8">8</span> And they answered
him: \`He was a hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his
loins.' And he said: \`It is Elijah the Tishbite.'

<span id="an_kg2:1:9">9</span> Then the king sent unto him a captain of
fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him; and, behold, he sat on the
top of the hill. And he spoke unto him: \`O man of God, the king hath
said: Come down.' <span id="an_kg2:1:10">10</span> And Elijah answered
and said to the captain of fifty: \`If I be a man of God, let fire come
down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty.' And there came down
fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty. <span
id="an_kg2:1:11">11</span> And again he sent unto him another captain of
fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him: \`O man of God,
thus hath the king said: Come down quickly.' <span
id="an_kg2:1:12">12</span> And Elijah answered and said unto them: \`If
I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and
thy fifty.' And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him
and his fifty. <span id="an_kg2:1:13">13</span> And again he sent the
captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty
went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him,
and said unto him: O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life
of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight. <span
id="an_kg2:1:14">14</span> Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and
consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties; but now
let my life be precious in thy sight.' <span
id="an_kg2:1:15">15</span> And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah:
\`Go down with him; be not afraid of him.' And he arose, and went down
with him unto the king.

<span id="page_442">p. 442</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> <span
id="an_kg2:1:16">16</span> And he said unto him: \`Thus saith the LORD:
Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baalzebub the god
of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His
word? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art
gone up, but shalt surely die.'

<span id="an_kg2:1:17">17</span> So he died according to the word of the
LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram began to reign in his stead in
the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because
he had no son. <span id="an_kg2:1:18">18</span> Now the rest of the acts
of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel?
