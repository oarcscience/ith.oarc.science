### EXODUS CHAPTER 3

<span id="an_exo:3:1">1</span> Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro
his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock <span
id="page_67">p. 67</span> to the farthest end of the wilderness, and
came to the mountain of God, unto Horeb. <span
id="an_exo:3:2">2</span> And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in
a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and, behold,
the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. <span
id="an_exo:3:3">3</span> And Moses said: 'I will turn aside now, and see
this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.' <span
id="an_exo:3:4">4</span> And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to
see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said: 'Moses,
Moses.' And he said: 'Here am I.' <span id="an_exo:3:5">5</span> And He
said: 'Draw not nigh hither; put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for
the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.' <span
id="an_exo:3:6">6</span> Moreover He said: 'I am the God of thy father,
the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' And Moses
hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. <span
id="an_exo:3:7">7</span> And the LORD said: 'I have surely seen the
affliction of My people that are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by
reason of their taskmasters; for I know their pains; <span
id="an_exo:3:8">8</span> and I am come down to deliver them out of the
hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good
land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the
place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the
Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. <span
id="an_exo:3:9">9</span> And now, behold, the cry of the children of
Israel is come unto Me; moreover I have seen the oppression wherewith
the Egyptians oppress them. <span id="an_exo:3:10">10</span> Come now
therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring
forth My people the children of Israel out of Egypt.' <span
id="an_exo:3:11">11</span> And Moses said unto God: 'Who am I, that I
should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of
Israel out of Egypt?' <span id="an_exo:3:12">12</span> And He said:
'Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be the token unto thee,
that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of
Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.' <span
id="an_exo:3:13">13</span> And Moses said unto God: Behold, when I come
unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them: The God of your
fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me: What is His
name? what shall I say unto them?' <span id="an_exo:3:14">14</span> And
God said unto Moses: 'I AM THAT I AM'; and He said: 'Thus shalt thou say
unto the children of Israel: I AM hath sent me unto you.' <span
id="an_exo:3:15">15</span> And God said moreover unto Moses: 'Thus shalt
thou say unto the children of Israel: The LORD, the God of your fathers,
the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me
unto you; this is My name for ever, and this is My memorial unto all
generations. <span id="an_exo:3:16">16</span> Go, and gather the elders
of Israel together, and say unto them: The LORD, the God of your
fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, hath appeared unto
me, saying: I have surely remembered you, and seen that which is done to
you in Egypt. <span id="an_exo:3:17">17</span> And I have said: I will
bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the
Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the
Hivite, and the Jebusite, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. <span
id="an_exo:3:18">18</span> And they shall hearken to thy voice. And thou
shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and
ye shall say unto him: The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, hath met with
us. And now let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the
wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God. <span
id="an_exo:3:19">19</span> And I know that the king of Egypt will not
give you leave to go, except <span id="page_68">p. 68</span> by a mighty
hand. <span id="an_exo:3:20">20</span> And I will put forth My hand, and
smite Egypt with all My wonders which I will do in the midst thereof.
And after that he will let you go. <span id="an_exo:3:21">21</span> And
I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. And it
shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty; <span
id="an_exo:3:22">22</span> but every woman shall ask of her neighbour,
and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of
gold, and raiment; and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your
daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.'
