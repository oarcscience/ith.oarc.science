### GENESIS CHAPTER 17

<span id="an_gen:17:1">1</span> And when Abram was ninety years old and
nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him: 'I am God Almighty;
walk before Me, and be thou whole-hearted. <span
id="an_gen:17:2">2</span> And I will make My covenant between Me and
thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.' <span
id="an_gen:17:3">3</span> And Abram fell on his face; and God talked
with him, saying: <span id="an_gen:17:4">4</span> 'As for Me, behold, My
covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be  <span
id="fr_21"></span>[a](#fn_20) the father of a multitude of nations.
<span id="an_gen:17:5">5</span> Neither shall thy name any more be
called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for the father of a
multitude of nations have I made thee. <span
id="an_gen:17:6">6</span> And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I
will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. <span
id="an_gen:17:7">7</span> And I will establish My covenant between Me
and thee and thy seed after thee throughout their generations for an
everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee.
<span id="an_gen:17:8">8</span> And I will give unto thee, and to thy
seed after thee, the land of thy sojournings, all the land of Canaan,
for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.' <span
id="an_gen:17:9">9</span> And God said unto Abraham: 'And as for thee,
thou shalt keep My covenant, thou, and thy seed after thee throughout
their generations. <span id="an_gen:17:10">10</span> This is My
covenant, which ye shall keep, between Me and you and thy seed after
thee: every male among you shall be circumcised. <span
id="an_gen:17:11">11</span> And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of
your foreskin; and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt Me and you.
<span id="an_gen:17:12">12</span> And he that is eight days old shall be
circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he that
is born in the house, or bought with money of any foreigner, that is not
of thy seed. <span id="an_gen:17:13">13</span> He that is born in thy
house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised;
and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
<span id="an_gen:17:14">14</span> And the uncircumcised male who is not
circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off
from his people; he hath broken My covenant.'

<span id="an_gen:17:15">15</span> And God said unto Abraham: 'As for
Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but  <span
id="fr_22"></span>[b](#fn_21) Sarah shall her name be. <span
id="an_gen:17:16">16</span> And I will bless her, and moreover I will
give thee a son of her; yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother
of nations; kings of peoples shall be of her.' <span
id="an_gen:17:17">17</span> Then Abraham fell upon his face, and
laughed, and said in his heart: 'Shall a child be born unto him that is
a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?'
<span id="an_gen:17:18">18</span> And Abraham said unto God: 'Oh that
Ishmael might live before Thee!' <span id="an_gen:17:19">19</span> And
God said: 'Nay, but Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son; and thou shalt
call his name  <span id="fr_23"></span>[c](#fn_22) Isaac; and I will
establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed
after him. <span id="an_gen:17:20">20</span> And as for Ishmael, I have
heard thee; behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and
will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will
make him a great nation. <span id="an_gen:17:21">21</span> But My
covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto thee at
this set time in the next year.' <span id="an_gen:17:22">22</span> And
He left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham. <span
id="an_gen:17:23">23</span> And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all
that were born in his house, and <span id="page_19">p. 19</span> all
that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's
house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day,
as God had said unto him. <span id="an_gen:17:24">24</span> And Abraham
was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of
his foreskin. <span id="an_gen:17:25">25</span> And Ishmael his son was
thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his
foreskin. <span id="an_gen:17:26">26</span> In the selfsame day was
Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son. <span
id="an_gen:17:27">27</span> And all the men of his house, those born in
the house, and those bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised
with him.
