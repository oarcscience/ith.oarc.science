### I Kings Chapter 4

<span id="an_kg1:4:1">1</span> And king Solomon was king over all
Israel. <span id="an_kg1:4:2">2</span> And these were the princes whom
he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest; <span
id="an_kg1:4:3">3</span> Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha,
scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder; <span
id="an_kg1:4:4">4</span> and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the
host; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests; <span
id="an_kg1:4:5">5</span> and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the
officers; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister and the king's
friend; <span id="an_kg1:4:6">6</span> and Ahishar was over the
household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the levy.

<span id="an_kg1:4:7">7</span> And Solomon had twelve officers over all
Israel, who provided victuals for the king and his household: each man
had to make provision for a month in the year. <span
id="an_kg1:4:8">8</span> And these are their names: The son of Hur, in
the hill-country of Ephraim; <span id="an_kg1:4:9">9</span> the son of
Deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-bethhanan;
<span id="an_kg1:4:10">10</span> the son of Hesed, in Arubboth; to him
pertained Socoh, and all the land of Hepher; <span
id="an_kg1:4:11">11</span> the son of Abinadab, in all the region of
Dor; he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife; .12Baana the son of
Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside
Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abel-meholah, as far as
beyond Jokmeam; .13the son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him pertained
the villages of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; even to
him pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great
cities with walls and brazen bars; .14Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in
Mahanaim; <span id="an_kg1:4:15">15</span> Ahimaaz, in Naphtali; he also
took Basemath the daughter of Solomon to wife; <span
id="an_kg1:4:16">16</span> Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and
Bealoth; <span id="an_kg1:4:17">17</span> Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah,
in Issachar; <span id="an_kg1:4:18">18</span> Shimei the son of Ela, in
Benjamin; <span id="an_kg1:4:19">19</span> Geber the son of Uri, in the
land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king
of Bashan; and one officer that was \[over all the officers\] in the
land. <span id="an_kg1:4:20">20</span> Judah and Israel were many, as
the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and
making merry.
