### II SAMUEL CHAPTER 14

<span id="an_sa2:14:1">1</span>  Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived
that the king's heart was toward Absalom. <span
id="an_sa2:14:2">2</span>  And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched thence a
wise woman, and said unto her: \`I pray thee, feign thyself to be a
mourner, and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and anoint not
thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the
dead; <span id="an_sa2:14:3">3</span>  and go in to the king, and speak
on this manner unto him.' So Joab put the words in her mouth.

<span id="an_sa2:14:4">4</span>  And when the woman of Tekoa spoke to
the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and prostrated herself,
and said: \`Help, O king.' <span id="an_sa2:14:5">5</span>  And the king
said unto her: \`What aileth thee?' And she answered: \`Of a truth I am
a widow, my husband being dead. <span id="an_sa2:14:6">6</span>  And thy
handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and
there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and killed
him. <span id="an_sa2:14:7">7</span>  And, behold, the whole family is
risen against thy handmaid, and they said: Deliver him that smote his
brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew,
and so destroy the heir also. Thus will they quench my coal which is
left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the
face of the earth.'

<span id="an_sa2:14:8">8</span>  And the king said unto the woman: \`Go
to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.' <span
id="an_sa2:14:9">9</span>  And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king:
\`My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house; and
the king and his throne be guiltless.' <span
id="an_sa2:14:10">10</span>  And the king said: \`Whosoever saith aught
unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.' <span
id="an_sa2:14:11">11</span>  Then said she: \`I pray thee, let the king
remember the LORD thy God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any
more, lest they destroy my son.' And he said: \`As the LORD liveth,
there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.'

<span id="an_sa2:14:12">12</span>  Then the woman said: \`Let thy
handmaid, I pray thee, speak a word unto my lord the king.' And he said:
\`Say on.' <span id="an_sa2:14:13">13</span>  And the woman said:
\`Wherefore then hast thou devised such a thing against the people of
God? for in speaking this word the king is as one that is guilty, in
that the king doth not fetch home again his banished one. <span
id="an_sa2:14:14">14</span>  For we must needs die, and are as water
spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God
respect any person; but let him devise means, that he that is banished
be not an outcast from him. <span id="an_sa2:14:15">15</span>  Now
therefore seeing that I am come to speak this word unto my lord the
king, it is because the people have made me afraid; and thy handmaid
said: I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will
perform the request of his servant. <span id="an_sa2:14:16">16</span> 
For the king

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man that would
destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God. <span
id="an_sa2:14:17">17</span>  Then thy handmaid said: Let, I pray thee,
the word of my lord the king be for my comfort; for as an angel of God,
so is my lord the king to discern good and bad; and the LORD thy God be
with thee.'

<span id="an_sa2:14:18">18</span>  Then the king answered and said unto
the woman: \`Hide not from me, I pray thee, aught that I shall ask
thee.' And the woman said: \`Let my lord the king now speak.' <span
id="an_sa2:14:19">19</span>  And the king said: \`Is the hand of Joab
with thee in all this?' And the woman answered and said: \`As thy soul
liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left
from aught that my lord the king hath spoken; for thy servant Joab, he
bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid; <span
id="an_sa2:14:20">20</span>  to change the face of the matter hath thy
servant Joab done this thing; and my lord is wise, according to the
wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.'

<span id="an_sa2:14:21">21</span>  And the king said unto Joab: \`Behold
now, I have granted this request; go therefore, bring the young man
Absalom back.' <span id="an_sa2:14:22">22</span>  And Joab fell to the
ground on his face, and prostrated himself, and blessed the king; and
Joab said: \`To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found favour in thy
sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath performed the request of
thy servant.' <span id="an_sa2:14:23">23</span>  So Joab arose and went
to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. <span
id="an_sa2:14:24">24</span>  And the king said: \`Let him turn to his
own house, but let him not see my face.' So Absalom turned to his own
house, and saw not the king's face.

<span id="an_sa2:14:25">25</span>  Now in all Israel there was none to
be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty; from the sole of his foot
even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. <span
id="an_sa2:14:26">26</span>  And when he polled his head—now it was at
every year's end that he polled it; because the hair was heavy on him,
therefore he polled it—he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred
shekels, after the king's weight. <span id="an_sa2:14:27">27</span>  And
unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name
was Tamar; she was a woman of a fair countenance.

<span id="an_sa2:14:28">28</span>  And Absalom dwelt two full years in
Jerusalem; and he saw not the king's face. <span
id="an_sa2:14:29">29</span>  Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to
the king; but he would not come to him; and he sent again a second time,
but he would not come. <span id="an_sa2:14:30">30</span>  Therefore he
said unto his servants: \`See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath
barley there; go and set it on fire.' And Absalom's servants set the
field on fire. <span id="an_sa2:14:31">31</span>  Then Joab arose, and
came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him: \`Wherefore have thy
servants set my field on fire?' <span id="an_sa2:14:32">32</span>  And
Absalom answered Joab: \`Behold, I sent unto thee, saying: Come hither,
that I may send thee to the king, to say: Wherefore am I come from
Geshur? it were better for me to be there still; now therefore let me
see the king's face; and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me.'
<span id="an_sa2:14:33">33</span>  So Joab came to the king, and told
him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed
himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed
Absalom.
