### I SAMUEL CHAPTER 26

<span id="an_sa1:26:1">1</span> And the Ziphites came unto Saul to
Gibeah, saying: \`Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah,
which is before Jeshimon?' <span id="an_sa1:26:2">2</span> Then Saul
arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand
chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
<span id="an_sa1:26:3">3</span> And Saul pitched in the hill of
Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the
wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
<span id="an_sa1:26:4">4</span> David therefore sent out spies, and
understood that Saul was come of a certainty. <span
id="an_sa1:26:5">5</span> And David arose, and came to the place where
Saul had pitched; and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner
the son of Ner, the captain of his host; and Saul lay within the
barricade, and the people pitched round about him.

<span id="an_sa1:26:6">6</span> Then answered David and said to
Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to
Joab, saying: \`Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?' And
Abishai said: \`I will go down with thee.' <span
id="an_sa1:26:7">7</span> So David and Abishai came to the people by
night; and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the barricade, with his
spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay
round about him. <span id="an_sa1:26:8">8</span> Then said Abishai to
David: \`God hath delivered up thine enemy into thy hand this day; now
therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear to the earth at
one stroke, and I will not smite him the second time.' <span
id="an_sa1:26:9">9</span> And David said to Abishai: \`Destroy him not;
for who can put forth his hand against the LORD'S anointed, and be
guiltless?' <span id="an_sa1:26:10">10</span> And David said: \`As the
LORD liveth, nay, but the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to
die; or he shall go down into battle, and be swept away. <span
id="an_sa1:26:11">11</span> The LORD forbid it me, that I should put
forth my hand against the LORD'S anointed; but now take, I pray thee,
the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water, and let us go.'
<span id="an_sa1:26:12">12</span> So David took the spear and the cruse
of water from Saul's head; and they got them away, and no man saw it,
nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep; because a
deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.

<span id="an_sa1:26:13">13</span> Then David went over to the other
side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

between them. <span id="an_sa1:26:14">14</span> And David cried to the
people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying: \`Answerest thou not,
Abner?' Then Abner answered and said: \`Who art thou that criest to the
king?' <span id="an_sa1:26:15">15</span> And David said to Abner: \`Art
not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore
then hast thou not kept watch over thy lord the king? for there came one
of the people in to destroy the king thy lord. <span
id="an_sa1:26:16">16</span> This thing is not good that thou hast done.
As the LORD liveth, ye deserve to die, because ye have not kept watch
over your lord, the LORD'S anointed. And now, see, where the king's
spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his head.'

<span id="an_sa1:26:17">17</span> And Saul knew David's voice, and said:
\`Is this thy voice, my son David?' And David said: \`It is my voice, my
lord, O king.' <span id="an_sa1:26:18">18</span> And he said:
\`Wherefore doth my lord pursue after his servant? for what have I done?
or what evil is in my hand? <span id="an_sa1:26:19">19</span> Now
therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his
servant. If it be the LORD that hath stirred thee up against me, let Him
accept an offering; but if it be the children of men, cursed be they
before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day that I should not
cleave unto the inheritance of the LORD, saying: Go, serve other gods.
<span id="an_sa1:26:20">20</span> Now therefore, let not my blood fall
to the earth away from the presence of the LORD; for the king of Israel
is come out to seek a single flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in
the mountains.'

<span id="an_sa1:26:21">21</span> Then said Saul: \`I have sinned;
return, my son David; for I will no more do thee harm, because my life
was precious in thine eyes this day; behold, I have played the fool and
erred exceedingly.' <span id="an_sa1:26:22">22</span> And David answered
and said: \`Behold the king's spear! let then one of the young men come
over and fetch it. <span id="an_sa1:26:23">23</span> And the LORD will
render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; forasmuch as
the LORD delivered thee into my hand to-day, and I would not put forth
my hand against the LORD'S anointed. <span
id="an_sa1:26:24">24</span> And, behold, as thy life was much set by
this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the
LORD, and let Him deliver me out of all tribulation.' <span
id="an_sa1:26:25">25</span> Then Saul said to David: \`Blessed be thou,
my son David; thou shalt both do mightily, and shalt surely prevail.' So
David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.
