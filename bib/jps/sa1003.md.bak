### I SAMUEL CHAPTER 3

<span id="an_sa1:3:1">1</span> And the child Samuel ministered unto the
LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days;
there was no frequent vision. <span id="an_sa1:3:2">2</span> And it came
to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place—now his eyes
had begun to wax dim, that he could not see—<span
id="an_sa1:3:3">3</span> and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and
Samuel was laid down to sleep in the temple of the LORD, where the ark
of God was, <span id="an_sa1:3:4">4</span> that the LORD called Samuel;
and he said: \`Here am I.' <span id="an_sa1:3:5">5</span> And he ran
unto Eli, and said: \`Here am I; for thou didst call me.' And he said:
\`I called not; lie down again.' And he went and lay down. <span
id="an_sa1:3:6">6</span> And the LORD called yet again Samuel. And
Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said: \`Here am I; for thou didst call
me.' And he answered:\`I called not, my son; lie down again.' <span
id="an_sa1:3:7">7</span> Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither
was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him. <span
id="an_sa1:3:8">8</span> And the LORD called Samuel again the third
time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said: \`Here am I; for thou
didst call me.' And Eli perceived that the LORD was calling the child.
<span id="an_sa1:3:9">9</span> Therefore Eli said unto Samuel: \`Go, lie
down; and it shall be, if thou be called, that thou shalt say: Speak,
LORD; for Thy servant heareth.' So Samuel went and lay down in his
place. <span id="an_sa1:3:10">10</span> And the LORD came, and stood,
and called as at other times: \`Samuel, Samuel.' Then Samuel said:
\`Speak; for Thy servant heareth.' <span id="an_sa1:3:11">11</span> And
the LORD said to Samuel: \`Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which
both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. <span
id="an_sa1:3:12">12</span> In that day I will perform against Eli all
that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto
the end. <span id="an_sa1:3:13">13</span> For I have told him that I
will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity, in that he knew that
his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he rebuked them not.
<span id="an_sa1:3:14">14</span> And therefore I have sworn unto the
house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated
with sacrifice nor offering for ever.' <span
id="an_sa1:3:15">15</span> And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened
the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to tell Eli the
vision. <span id="an_sa1:3:16">16</span> Then Eli called Samuel, and
said: \`Samuel, my son.' And he said: \`Here am I.' <span
id="an_sa1:3:17">17</span> And he said: \`What is the thing that He hath
spoken unto thee? I pray thee,

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

hide it not from me; God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any
thing from me of all the things that He spoke unto thee.' <span
id="an_sa1:3:18">18</span> And Samuel told him all the words, and hid
nothing from him. And he said: \`It is the LORD; let Him do what seemeth
Him good.'

<span id="an_sa1:3:19">19</span> And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with
him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. <span
id="an_sa1:3:20">20</span> And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba
knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD. <span
id="an_sa1:3:21">21</span> And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh; for
the LORD revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.
