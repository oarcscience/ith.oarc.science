### DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER 15

<span id="an_deu:15:1">1</span> At the end of every seven years thou
shalt make a release. <span id="an_deu:15:2">2</span> And this is the
manner of the release: every creditor shall release that which he

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

hath lent unto his neighbour; he shall not exact it of his neighbour and
his brother; because the LORD's release hath been proclaimed. <span
id="an_deu:15:3">3</span> Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it; but
whatsoever of thine is with thy brother thy hand shall release. <span
id="an_deu:15:4">4</span> Howbeit there shall be no needy among you—for
the LORD will surely bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God
giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it— <span
id="an_deu:15:5">5</span> if only thou diligently hearken unto the voice
of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all this commandment which I
command thee this day. <span id="an_deu:15:6">6</span> For the LORD thy
God will bless thee, as He promised thee; and thou shalt lend unto many
nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt rule over many
nations, but they shall not rule over thee.

<span id="an_deu:15:7">7</span> If there be among you a needy man, one
of thy brethren, within any of thy gates, in thy land which the LORD thy
God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor shut thy hand from
thy needy brother; <span id="an_deu:15:8">8</span> but thou shalt surely
open thy hand unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his
need in that which he wanteth. <span id="an_deu:15:9">9</span> Beware
that there be not a base thought in thy heart, saying: \`The seventh
year, the year of release, is at hand'; and thine eye be evil against
thy needy brother, and thou give him nought; and he cry unto the LORD
against thee, and it be sin in thee. <span
id="an_deu:15:10">10</span> Thou shalt surely give him, and thy heart
shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him; because that for this
thing the LORD thy God will bless thee in all thy work, and in all that
thou puttest thy hand unto. <span id="an_deu:15:11">11</span> For the
poor shall never cease out of the land; therefore I command thee,
saying: \`Thou shalt surely open thy hand unto thy poor and needy
brother, in thy land.'

<span id="an_deu:15:12">12</span> If thy brother, a Hebrew man, or a
Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, he shall serve thee six years; and in
the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee. <span
id="an_deu:15:13">13</span> And when thou lettest him go free from thee,
thou shalt not let him go empty; <span id="an_deu:15:14">14</span> thou
shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy
threshing-floor, and out of thy winepress; of that wherewith the LORD
thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him. <span
id="an_deu:15:15">15</span> And thou shalt remember that thou wast a
bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee;
therefore I command thee this thing to-day. <span
id="an_deu:15:16">16</span> And it shall be, if he say unto thee: \`I
will not go out from thee'; because he loveth thee and thy house,
because he fareth well with thee; <span id="an_deu:15:17">17</span> then
thou shalt take an awl, and thrust it through his ear and into the door,
and he shall be thy bondman for ever. And also unto thy bondwoman thou
shalt do likewise. <span id="an_deu:15:18">18</span> It shall not seem
hard unto thee, when thou lettest him go free from thee; for to the
double of the hire of a hireling hath he served thee six years; and the
LORD thy God will bless thee in all that thou doest.

<span id="an_deu:15:19">19</span> All the firstling males that are born
of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God;
thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thine ox, nor shear the
firstling of thy flock. <span id="an_deu:15:20">20</span> Thou shalt eat
it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD
shall choose, thou and thy household. <span
id="an_deu:15:21">21</span> And if there be any blemish therein,
lameness, or blindness, any ill blemish whatsoever, thou shalt not
sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God. <span
id="an_deu:15:22">22</span> Thou shalt eat it within thy gates; the
unclean and the clean may eat it alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart.
<span id="an_deu:15:23">23</span> Only thou shalt not

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it out upon the ground as water.
