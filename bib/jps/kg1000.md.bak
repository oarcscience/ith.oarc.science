# FIRST KINGS

### I Kings Chapter 1

<span id="an_kg1:1:1">1</span>  Now king David was old and stricken in
years; and they covered him with clothes, but he could get no heat.
<span id="an_kg1:1:2">2</span> Wherefore his servants said unto him:
\`Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin; and let her
stand before the king, and be a companion unto him; and let her lie in
thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.' <span
id="an_kg1:1:3">3</span> So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all
the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her
to the king. <span id="an_kg1:1:4">4</span> And the damsel was very
fair; and she became a companion unto the king, and ministered to him;
but the king knew her not.

<span id="an_kg1:1:5">5</span> Now Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted
himself, saying: \`I will be king'; and he prepared him chariots and
horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. <span
id="an_kg1:1:6">6</span> And his father had not grieved him all his life
in saying: 'Why hast thou done so?' and he was also a very goodly man;
and he was born after Absalom. <span id="an_kg1:1:7">7</span> And he
conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest;
and they following Adonijah helped him. <span
id="an_kg1:1:8">8</span> But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty
men that belonged to David, were not with Adonijah. <span
id="an_kg1:1:9">9</span> And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fatlings
by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel; and he called all
his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's
servants; <span id="an_kg1:1:10">10</span> but Nathan the prophet, and
Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.

<span id="an_kg1:1:11">11</span> Then Nathan spoke unto Bathsheba the
mother of Solomon, saying: 'Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of
Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not? <span
id="an_kg1:1:12">12</span> Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give
thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy
son Solomon. <span id="an_kg1:1:13">13</span> Go and get thee in unto
king David, and say unto him: Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear
unto thy handmaid, saying: Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after
me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign? <span
id="an_kg1:1:14">14</span> Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the
king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.'

<span id="an_kg1:1:15">15</span> And Bath-sheba went in unto the king
into the chamber.—Now the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite
ministered unto the king.—<span id="an_kg1:1:16">16</span> And
Bath-sheba bowed, and prostrated herself unto the king. And the king
said: \`What wouldest thou?' <span id="an_kg1:1:17">17</span> And she
said unto him: \`My lord, thou didst swear by the LORD thy God unto thy
handmaid: Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall
sit upon my throne. <span id="an_kg1:1:18">18</span> And now, behold,
Adonijah reigneth; and thou, my lord the king, knowest it not. <span
id="an_kg1:1:19">19</span> And he hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep
in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king,

<span id="page_402">p. 402</span>

and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host; but Solomon
thy servant hath he not called. <span id="an_kg1:1:20">20</span> And
thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou
shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king
after him. <span id="an_kg1:1:21">21</span> Otherwise it will come to
pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my
son Solomon shall be counted offenders.'

<span id="an_kg1:1:22">22</span> And, lo, while she yet talked with the
king, Nathan the prophet came in. <span id="an_kg1:1:23">23</span> And
they told the king, saying: Behold Nathan the prophet.' And when he was
come in before the king, he bowed down before the king with his face to
the ground. <span id="an_kg1:1:24">24</span> And Nathan said: \`My lord,
O king, hast thou said: Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit
upon my throne? <span id="an_kg1:1:25">25</span> For he is gone down
this day, and hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and
bath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and
Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and
say: Long live king Adonijah. <span id="an_kg1:1:26">26</span> But me,
even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called. <span
id="an_kg1:1:27">27</span> Is this thing done by my lord the king, and
thou hast not declared unto thy servant who should sit on the throne of
my lord the king after him?'

<span id="an_kg1:1:28">28</span> Then king David answered and said:
'Call me Bath-sheba.' And she came into the king's presence, and stood
before the king. <span id="an_kg1:1:29">29</span> And the king swore and
said: 'As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all
adversity, <span id="an_kg1:1:30">30</span> verily as I swore unto thee
by the LORD, the God of Israel, saying: Assuredly Solomon thy son shall
reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in mystead; verily so
will I do this day.' <span id="an_kg1:1:31">31</span> Then Bath-sheba
bowed with her face to the earth, and prostrated herself to the king,
and said: \`Let my lord king David live for ever.'

<span id="an_kg1:1:32">32</span> And king David said: \`Call me Zadok
the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.'
And they came before the king. <span id="an_kg1:1:33">33</span> And the
king said unto them: \`Take with you the servants of your lord, and
cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to
Gihon. <span id="an_kg1:1:34">34</span> And let Zadok the priest and
Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow ye with
the horn, and say: Long live king Solomon. <span
id="an_kg1:1:35">35</span> Then ye shall come up after him, and he shall
come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead; and I
have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.' <span
id="an_kg1:1:36">36</span> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the
king, and said: \`Amen; so say the LORD, the God of my lord the king.
<span id="an_kg1:1:37">37</span> As the LORD hath been with my lord the
king, even so be He with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the
throne of my lord king David.'

<span id="an_kg1:1:38">38</span> So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the
prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the
Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's
mule, and brought him to Gihon. <span id="an_kg1:1:39">39</span> And
Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed
Solomon. And they blew the ram's horn; and all the people said: \`Long
live king Solomon.' <span id="an_kg1:1:40">40</span> And all the people
came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with
great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.

<span id="an_kg1:1:41">41</span> And Adonijah and all the guests

<span id="page_403">p. 403</span>

that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when
Joab heard the sound of the horn, he said: \`Wherefore is this noise of
the city being in an uproar?' <span id="an_kg1:1:42">42</span> While he
yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and
Adonijah said: \`Come in; for thou art a worthy man, and bringest good
tidings.' <span id="an_kg1:1:43">43</span> And Jonathan answered and
said to Adonijah: \`Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.
<span id="an_kg1:1:44">44</span> And the king hath sent with him Zadok
the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and
the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride
upon the king's mule. <span id="an_kg1:1:45">45</span> And Zadok the
priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon; and they
are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar.
This is the noise that ye have heard. <span
id="an_kg1:1:46">46</span> And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the
kingdom. <span id="an_kg1:1:47">47</span> And moreover the king's
servants came to bless our lord king David, saying: God make the name of
Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy
throne; and the king bowed down upon the bed. <span
id="an_kg1:1:48">48</span> And also thus said the king: Blessed be the
LORD, the God of Israel, who hath given one to sit on my throne this
day, mine eyes even seeing it.'

<span id="an_kg1:1:49">49</span> And all the guests of Adonijah were
afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way. <span
id="an_kg1:1:50">50</span> And Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and
he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. <span
id="an_kg1:1:51">51</span> And it was told Solomon, saying: \`Behold,
Adonijah feareth king Solomon; for, lo, he hath laid hold on the horns
of the altar, saying: Let king Solomon swear unto me first of all that
he willnot slay his servant with the sword.' <span
id="an_kg1:1:52">52</span> And Solomon said: \`If he shall show himself
a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth; but if
wickedness be found in him, he shall die.' <span
id="an_kg1:1:53">53</span> So king Solomon sent, and they brought him
down from the altar. And he came and prostrated himself before king
Solomon; and Solomon said unto him: Go to thy house.'
