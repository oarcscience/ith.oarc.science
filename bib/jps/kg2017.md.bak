### II Kings Chapter 17

<span id="an_kg2:17:1">1</span> In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of
Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel, and
reigned nine years. <span id="an_kg2:17:2">2</span> And he did that
which was evil in the sight of the LORD, yet not as the kings of Israel
that were before him. <span id="an_kg2:17:3">3</span> Against him came
up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and
brought him presents. <span id="an_kg2:17:4">4</span> And the king of
Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So
king of Egypt, and offered no present to the king of Assyria, as he had
done year by year; therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound
him in prison. <span id="an_kg2:17:5">5</span> Then the king of Assyria
came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it
three years. <span id="an_kg2:17:6">6</span> In the ninth year of
Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away unto
Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and in Habor, on the river of Gozan,
and in the cities of the Medes.

<span id="an_kg2:17:7">7</span> And it was so, because the children of
Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who brought them up out of
the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had
feared other gods, <span id="an_kg2:17:8">8</span> and walked in the
statutes of the nations, whom the LORD cast out from before the children
of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they practised; <span
id="an_kg2:17:9">9</span> and the children of Israel did impute things
that were not right unto the LORD their God, and they built them high
places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the
fortified city; <span id="an_kg2:17:10">10</span> and they set them up
pillars and Asherim upon every high hill, and under every leafy tree;
<span id="an_kg2:17:11">11</span> and there they offered in all the high
places, as did the nations whom the LORD carried away before them; and
wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD; <span
id="an_kg2:17:12">12</span> and they served idols, whereof the LORD had
said unto them: 'Ye shall not do this thing'; <span
id="an_kg2:17:13">13</span> yet the LORD forewarned Israel, and Judah,
by the hand of every prophet, and of every seer, saying: \`Turn ye from
your evil ways and keep My commandments and My statutes, according to
all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by
the hand of My servants the prophets'; <span
id="an_kg2:17:14">14</span> notwithstanding they would not hear, but
hardened their neck, like to the neck of their fathers, who believed not
in the LORD their God; <span id="an_kg2:17:15">15</span> and they
rejected His statutes, and His covenant that He made with their fathers,
and His testimonies

<span id="page_465">p. 465</span>

wherewith He testified against them; and they went after things of
nought, and became nought, and after the nations that were round about
them, concerning whom the LORD had charged them that they should not do
like them; <span id="an_kg2:17:16">16</span> and they forsook all the
commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even
two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshipped all the host of heaven,
and served Baal; <span id="an_kg2:17:17">17</span> and they caused their
sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination
and enchantments, and gave themselves over to do that which was evil in
the sight of the LORD, to provoke Him; <span
id="an_kg2:17:18">18</span> that the LORD was very angry with Israel,
and removed them out of His sight; there was none left but the tribe of
Judah only. <span id="an_kg2:17:19">19</span> Also Judah kept not the
commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel
which they practised. <span id="an_kg2:17:20">20</span> And the LORD
rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them
into the hand of spoilers, until He had cast them out of His sight.
<span id="an_kg2:17:21">21</span> For He rent Israel from the house of
David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king; and Jeroboam drew
Israel away from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.
<span id="an_kg2:17:22">22</span> And the children of Israel walked in
all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;
<span id="an_kg2:17:23">23</span> until the LORD removed Israel out of
His sight, as He spoke by the hand of all His servants the prophets. So
Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria, unto this day.

<span id="an_kg2:17:24">24</span> And the king of Assyria brought men
from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and
Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the
children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities
thereof. <span id="an_kg2:17:25">25</span> And so it was, at the
beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD;
therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which killed some of them.
<span id="an_kg2:17:26">26</span> Wherefore they spoke to the king of
Assyria, saying: \`The nations which thou hast carried away, and placed
in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land;
therefore He hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them,
because they know not the manner of the God of the land.'

<span id="an_kg2:17:27">27</span> Then the king of Assyria commanded,
saying: \`Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence;
and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of
the God of the land.' <span id="an_kg2:17:28">28</span> So one of the
priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in
Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear the LORD. <span
id="an_kg2:17:29">29</span> Howbeit every nation made gods of their own,
and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had
made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt. <span
id="an_kg2:17:30">30</span> And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth,
and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,
<span id="an_kg2:17:31">31</span> and the Avvites made Nibhaz and
Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to
Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim. <span
id="an_kg2:17:32">32</span> So they feared the LORD, and made unto them
from among themselves priests of the high places, who sacrificed for
them in the houses of the high places. <span
id="an_kg2:17:33">33</span> They feared the LORD, and served their own
gods, after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been
carried away.

<span id="an_kg2:17:34">34</span> Unto this day they do after the

<span id="page_466">p. 466</span>

former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their
statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law or after the
commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom He
named Israel; <span id="an_kg2:17:35">35</span> with whom the LORD had
made a covenant, and charged them, saying: \`Ye shall not fear other
gods, nor bow down to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them; <span
id="an_kg2:17:36">36</span> but the LORD, who brought you up out of the
land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, Him shall
ye fear, and Him shall ye worship, and to Him shall ye sacrifice; <span
id="an_kg2:17:37">37</span> and the statutes and the ordinances, and the
law and the commandment, which He wrote for you, ye shall observe to do
for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods; <span
id="an_kg2:17:38">38</span> and the covenant that I have made with you
ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods; <span
id="an_kg2:17:39">39</span> but the LORD your God shall ye fear; and He
will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.' <span
id="an_kg2:17:40">40</span> Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did
after their former manner. <span id="an_kg2:17:41">41</span> So these
nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images; their children
likewise, and their children's children, as did their fathers, so do
they unto this day.
