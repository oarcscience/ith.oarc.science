<span id="an_num:2:1">1</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto
Aaron, saying: <span id="an_num:2:2">2</span> 'The children of Israel
shall pitch by their fathers’ houses; every man with his own standard,
according to the ensigns; a good way off shall they pitch round about
the tent of meeting. <span id="an_num:2:3">3</span> Now those that pitch
on the east side toward the sunrising shall be they of the standard of
the camp of Judah, according to their hosts; the prince of the children
of Judah being Nahshon the son of Amminadab, <span
id="an_num:2:4">4</span> and his host, and those that were numbered of
them, threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred; <span

tribe of Issachar; the prince of the children of Issachar being Nethanel
the son of Zuar, <span id="an_num:2:6">6</span> and his host, even those

the children of Zebulun being Eliab the son of Helon, <span
id="an_num:2:8">8</span> and his host, and those that were numbered
thereof, fifty and seven thousand and four hundred; <span

being a hundred thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and

the tribe of Simeon; the prince of the children of Simeon being

his host, and those that were numbered of them, fifty and nine thousand
and three hundred; <span id="an_num:2:14">14</span> and the tribe of
Gad; the prince of the children of Gad being Eliasaph the son of Reuel,
<span id="an_num:2:15">15</span> and his host, even those that were
numbered of them, forty and five thousand and six hundred and fifty;
<span id="an_num:2:16">16</span> all that were numbered of the camp of
Reuben being a hundred thousand and fifty and one thousand and four
hundred and fifty, according to their hosts; and they shall set forth
second.

<span id="an_num:2:17">17</span> Then the tent of meeting, with the camp
of the Levites, shall set forward in the midst of the camps; <span
id="page_160">p. 160</span> as they encamp, so shall they set forward,
every man in his place, by their standards.

<span id="an_num:2:18">18</span> On the west side shall be the standard
of the camp of Ephraim according to their hosts; the prince of the
children of Ephraim being Elishama the son of Ammihud, <span
id="an_num:2:19">19</span> and his host, and those that were numbered of
them, forty thousand and five hundred; <span
id="an_num:2:20">20</span> and next unto him shall be the tribe of
Manasseh; the prince of the children of Manasseh being Gamaliel the son
of Pedahzur, <span id="an_num:2:21">21</span> and his host, and those
that were numbered of them, thirty and two thousand and two hundred;
<span id="an_num:2:22">22</span> and the tribe of Benjamin; the prince
of the children of Benjamin being Abidan the son of Gideoni, <span
id="an_num:2:23">23</span> and his host, and those that were numbered of
them, thirty and five thou- sand and four hundred; <span
id="an_num:2:24">24</span> all that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim
being a hundred thousand and eight thousand and a hundred, according to
their hosts; and they shall set forth third.

<span id="an_num:2:25">25</span> On the north side shall be the standard
of the camp of Dan according to their hosts; the prince of the children
of Dan being Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai, <span
id="an_num:2:26">26</span> and his host, and those that were numbered of

of the children of Naphtali being Ahira the son of Enan, <span

them, fifty and three thousand and four hundred; <span
id="an_num:2:31">31</span> all that were numbered of the camp of Dan
being a hundred thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred;
they shall set forth hindmost by their standards.'

<span id="an_num:2:32">32</span> These are they that were numbered of
the children of Israel by their fathers’ houses; all that were numbered
of the camps according to their hosts were six hundred thousand and
three thousand and five hundred and fifty. <span
id="an_num:2:33">33</span> But the Levites were not numbered among the
children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses. <span
id="an_num:2:34">34</span> Thus did the children of Israel: according to
all that the LORD commanded Moses, so they pitched by their standards,
and so they set forward, each one according to its families, and
according to its fathers’ houses.
