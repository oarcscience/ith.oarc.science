### NUMBERS CHAPTER 12

<span id="an_num:12:1">1</span> And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses
because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a
Cushite woman. <span id="an_num:12:2">2</span> And they said: 'Hath the
LORD indeed spoken only with Moses? hath He not spoken also with us?'
And the LORD heard it.— <span id="an_num:12:3">3</span> Now the man
Moses was very meek, above all the men that were upon the face of the
earth.— <span id="an_num:12:4">4</span> And the LORD spoke suddenly unto
Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam: \`Come out ye three unto the
tent of meeting.' And they three came out. <span
id="an_num:12:5">5</span> And the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud,
and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they
both came forth. <span id="an_num:12:6">6</span> And He said: \`Hear now
My words: if there be a prophet among you, I the LORD do make Myself
known unto him in a vision, do speak with him in a dream. <span
id="an_num:12:7">7</span> My servant Moses is not so; he is trusted in
all My house; <span id="an_num:12:8">8</span> with him do I speak mouth
to mouth, even manifestly, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude
of the LORD doth he behold; wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak
against My servant, against Moses?' <span id="an_num:12:9">9</span> And
the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and He departed. <span
id="an_num:12:10">10</span> And when the cloud was removed from over the
Tent, behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow; and Aaron looked
upon Miriam; and, behold, she was leprous. <span
id="an_num:12:11">11</span> And Aaron said unto Moses: \`Oh my lord, lay
not, I pray thee, sin upon us, for that we have done foolishly, and for
that we have sinned. <span id="an_num:12:12">12</span> Let her not, I
pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh
out of his mother's womb.' <span id="an_num:12:13">13</span> And Moses
cried unto the LORD, saying: \`Heal her now, O God, I beseech Thee.'

<span id="an_num:12:14">14</span> And the LORD said unto Moses: \`If her
father had but spit in her face, should she not hide in shame seven
days? let her be shut up without the camp seven days, and after that she
shall be brought in again.' <span id="an_num:12:15">15</span> And Miriam
was shut up without the camp seven days; and the people journeyed not
till Miriam was brought in again. <span id="an_num:12:16">16</span> And
afterward the people journeyed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the
wilderness of Paran.
