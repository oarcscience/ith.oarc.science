### NUMBERS CHAPTER 25

<span id="an_num:25:1">1</span> And Israel abode in Shittim, and the
people began to cormmit harlotry with the daughters of Moab. <span
id="an_num:25:2">2</span> And they called the people unto the sacrifices
of their gods; and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.
<span id="an_num:25:3">3</span> And Israel joined himself unto the Baal
of Peor; and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel. <span
id="an_num:25:4">4</span> And the LORD said unto Moses: \`Take all the
chiefs of

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

the people, and hang them up unto the LORD in face of the sun, that the
fierce anger of the LORD may turn away from Israel.' <span
id="an_num:25:5">5</span> And Moses said unto the judges of Israel:
\`Slay ye every one his men that have joined themselves unto the Baal of
Peor.' <span id="an_num:25:6">6</span> And, behold, one of the children
of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the
sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children
of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting.
<span id="an_num:25:7">7</span> And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar,
the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the
congregation, and took a spear in his hand. <span
id="an_num:25:8">8</span> And he went after the man of Israel into the
chamber, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the
woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of
Israel. <span id="an_num:25:9">9</span> And those that died by the
plague were twenty and four thousand.

 

‏פינחס‎

<span id="an_num:25:10">10</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_num:25:11">11</span> \`Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the
son of Aaron the priest, hath turned My wrath away from the children of
Israel, in that he was very jealous for My sake among them, so that I
consumed not the children of Israel in My jealousy. <span
id="an_num:25:12">12</span> Wherefore say: Behold, I give unto him My
covenant of peace; <span id="an_num:25:13">13</span> and it shall be
unto him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting
priesthood; because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for
the children of Israel.' <span id="an_num:25:14">14</span> Now the name
of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianitish
woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers' house among
the Simeonites. <span id="an_num:25:15">15</span> And the name of the
Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was
head of the people of a fathers' house in Midian.

<span id="an_num:25:16">16</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_num:25:17">17</span> \`Harass the Midianites, and smite
them; <span id="an_num:25:18">18</span> for they harass you, by their
wiles wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the
matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who
was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.'

<span id="an_num:25:19">19</span> And it came to pass after the plague,
