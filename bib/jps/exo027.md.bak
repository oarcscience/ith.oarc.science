### EXODUS CHAPTER 27

<span id="an_exo:27:1">1</span> And thou shalt make the altar of
acacia-wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be
four-square; and the height thereof shall be three cubits. <span
id="an_exo:27:2">2</span> And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the
four corners thereof; the horns thereof shall be of one piece with it;
and thou shalt overlay it with brass. <span
id="an_exo:27:3">3</span> And thou shalt make its pots to take away its
ashes, and its shovels, and its basins, and its flesh-hooks, and its
fire-pans; all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass. <span
id="an_exo:27:4">4</span> And thou shalt make for it a grating of
network of brass; and upon the net shalt thou make four brazen rings in
the four corners thereof. <span id="an_exo:27:5">5</span> And thou shalt
put it under the ledge round the altar beneath, that the net may reach
halfway up the altar. <span id="an_exo:27:6">6</span> And thou shalt
make staves for the altar, staves of acacia-wood, and overlay them with
brass. <span id="an_exo:27:7">7</span> And the staves thereof shall be
put into the rings, and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the
altar, in bearing it. <span id="an_exo:27:8">8</span> Hollow with planks
shalt thou make it; as it hath been shown thee in the mount, so shall
they make it.

<span id="an_exo:27:9">9</span> And thou shalt make the court of the
tabernacle: for the south side southward there shall be hangings for the
court of fine twined linen a hundred cubits long for one side. <span
id="an_exo:27:10">10</span> And the pillars thereof shall be twenty, and
their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their
fillets shall be of silver. <span id="an_exo:27:11">11</span> And
likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings a hundred
cubits long, and the pillars thereof twenty, and their sockets twenty,
of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver. <span
id="an_exo:27:12">12</span> And for the breadth of the court on the west
side shall be hangings of fifty cubits: their pillars ten, and their
sockets ten. <span id="an_exo:27:13">13</span> And the breadth of the
court on the east side eastward shall be fifty cubits. <span
id="an_exo:27:14">14</span> The hangings for the one side \[of the
gate\] shall be fifteen cubits: their pillars three, and their sockets
three. <span id="an_exo:27:15">15</span> And for the other side shall be
hangings of fifteen cubits: their pillars three, and their sockets
three. <span id="an_exo:27:16">16</span> And for the gate of the court
shall be a screen of twenty cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet,
and fine twined linen, the work of the weaver in colours: their pillars
four, and their sockets four. <span id="an_exo:27:17">17</span> All the
pillars of the <span id="page_98">p. 98</span> court round about shall
be filleted with silver; their hooks of silver, and their sockets of
brass. <span id="an_exo:27:18">18</span> The length of the court shall
be a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty every where, and the height
five cubits, of fine twined linen, and their sockets of brass. <span
id="an_exo:27:19">19</span> All the instruments of the tabernacle in all
the service thereof, and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the
court, shall be of brass.

‏תצוה‎

<span id="an_exo:27:20">20</span> And thou shalt command the children of
Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light,
to cause a lamp to burn continually. <span
id="an_exo:27:21">21</span> In the tent of meeting, without the veil
which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall set it in order,
to burn from evening to morning before the LORD; it shall be a statute
for ever throughout their generations on the behalf of the children of
Israel.
