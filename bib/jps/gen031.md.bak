### GENESIS CHAPTER 31

<span id="an_gen:31:1">1</span> And he heard the words of Laban's sons,
saying: 'Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that
which was our father's hath he gotten all this wealth.' <span
id="an_gen:31:2">2</span> And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban,
and, behold, it was not toward him as beforetime. <span
id="an_gen:31:3">3</span> And the LORD said unto Jacob: 'Return unto the
land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.' <span
id="an_gen:31:4">4</span> And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to
the field unto his flock, <span id="an_gen:31:5">5</span> and said unto
them: 'I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as
beforetime; but the God of my father hath been with me. <span
id="an_gen:31:6">6</span> And ye know that with all my power I have
served your father. <span id="an_gen:31:7">7</span> And your father hath
mocked me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to
hurt me. <span id="an_gen:31:8">8</span> If he said thus: The speckled
shall be thy wages; then all the flock bore speckled; and if he said
thus: The streaked shall be thy wages; then bore all the flock streaked.
<span id="an_gen:31:9">9</span> Thus God hath taken away the cattle of
your father, and given them to me. <span id="an_gen:31:10">10</span> And
it came to pass at the time that the flock conceived, that I lifted up
mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped
upon the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled. <span
id="an_gen:31:11">11</span> And the angel of God said unto me in the
dream: Jacob; and I said: Here am I. <span
id="an_gen:31:12">12</span> And he said: Lift up now thine eyes, and
see, all the he-goats which leap upon the flock are streaked, speckled,
and grizzled; for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee. <span
id="page_38">p. 38</span> <span id="an_gen:31:13">13</span> I am the God
of Beth-el, where thou didst anoint a pillar, where thou didst vow a vow
unto Me. Now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the
land of thy nativity.' <span id="an_gen:31:14">14</span> And Rachel and
Leah answered and said unto him: 'Is there yet any portion or
inheritance for us in our father's house? <span
id="an_gen:31:15">15</span> Are we not accounted by him strangers? for
he hath sold us, and hath also quite devoured our price. <span
id="an_gen:31:16">16</span> For all the riches which God hath taken away
from our father, that is ours and our children's. Now then, whatsoever
God hath said unto thee, do.' <span id="an_gen:31:17">17</span> Then
Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels; <span
id="an_gen:31:18">18</span> and he carried away all his cattle, and all
his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he
had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father unto the land of
Canaan. <span id="an_gen:31:19">19</span> Now Laban was gone to shear
his sheep. And Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's. <span
id="an_gen:31:20">20</span> And Jacob outwitted Laban the Aramean, in
that he told him not that he fled. <span id="an_gen:31:21">21</span> So
he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over  <span
id="fr_48"></span>[a](#fn_47.md) the River, and set his face toward the
mountain of Gilead.

<span id="an_gen:31:22">22</span> And it was told Laban on the third day
that Jacob was fled. <span id="an_gen:31:23">23</span> And he took his
brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days’ journey; and he
overtook him in the mountain of Gilead. <span
id="an_gen:31:24">24</span> And God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream
of the night, and said unto him: 'Take heed to thyself that thou speak
not to Jacob either good or bad.' <span id="an_gen:31:25">25</span> And
Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the
mountain; and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mountain of Gilead.
<span id="an_gen:31:26">26</span> And Laban said to Jacob: 'What hast
thou done, that thou hast outwitted me, and carried away my daughters as
though captives of the sword? <span
id="an_gen:31:27">27</span> Wherefore didst thou flee secretly, and
outwit me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with
mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp; <span
id="an_gen:31:28">28</span> and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and
my daughters? now hast thou done foolishly. <span
id="an_gen:31:29">29</span> It is in the power of my hand to do you
hurt; but the God of your father spoke unto me yesternight, saying: Take
heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. <span
id="an_gen:31:30">30</span> And now that thou art surely gone, because
thou sore longest after thy father's house, wherefore hast thou stolen
my gods?' <span id="an_gen:31:31">31</span> And Jacob answered and said
to Laban: 'Because I was afraid; for I said: Lest thou shouldest take
thy daughters from me by force. "With whomsoever thou findest thy gods,
he shall not live; before our brethren discern thou what is thine with
me, and take it to thee.'—For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen
them.—<span id="an_gen:31:33">33</span> And Laban went into Jacob's
tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants;
but he found them not. And he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into
Rachel's tent. <span id="an_gen:31:34">34</span> Now Rachel had taken
the teraphim, and put them in the saddle of the camel, and sat upon
them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not. <span
id="an_gen:31:35">35</span> And she said to her father: 'Let not my lord
be angry that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women is
upon me.' And he searched, but found not the teraphim. <span
id="an_gen:31:36">36</span> And Jacob was wroth, and strove with Laban.
And Jacob answered and said to Laban: 'What is my trespass? what is my
sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after me? <span
id="an_gen:31:37">37</span> Whereas thou <span id="page_39">p. 39</span>
hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household
stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may
judge betwixt us two. <span id="an_gen:31:38">38</span> These twenty
years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast
their young, and the rams of thy flocks have I not eaten. <span
id="an_gen:31:39">39</span> That which was torn of beasts I brought not
unto thee; I bore the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it,
whether stolen by day or stolen by night. <span
id="an_gen:31:40">40</span> Thus I was: in the day the drought consumed
me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes. <span
id="an_gen:31:41">41</span> These twenty years have I been in thy house:
I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for
thy flock; and thou hast changed my wages ten times. <span
id="an_gen:31:42">42</span> Except the God of my father, the God of
Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been on my side, surely now hadst
thou sent me away empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of
my hands, and gave judgment yesternight.' <span
id="an_gen:31:43">43</span> And Laban answered and said unto Jacob: 'The
daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the
flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine; and what can I do
this day for these my daughters, or for their children whom they have
borne? <span id="an_gen:31:44">44</span> And now come, let us make a
covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.'
<span id="an_gen:31:45">45</span> And Jacob took a stone, and set it up
for a pillar. <span id="an_gen:31:46">46</span> And Jacob said unto his
brethren: 'Gather stones'; and they took stones, and made a heap. And
they did eat there by the heap. <span id="an_gen:31:47">47</span> And
Laban called it  <span id="fr_49"></span>[a](#fn_48.md) Jegar-sahadutha:
but Jacob called it  <span id="fr_50"></span>[b](#fn_49.md) Galeed <span
id="an_gen:31:48">48</span> And Laban said: 'This heap is witness
between me and thee this day.' Therefore was the name of it called
Galeed: <span id="an_gen:31:49">49</span> and  <span
id="fr_51"></span>[c](#fn_50.md) Mizpah, for he said: 'The LORD watch
between me and thee, when we are absent one from another. <span
id="an_gen:31:50">50</span> If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if
thou shalt take wives beside my daughters, no man being with us; see,
God is witness betwixt me and thee.' <span
id="an_gen:31:51">51</span> And Laban said to Jacob: 'Behold this heap,
and behold the pillar, which I have set up betwixt me and thee. <span
id="an_gen:31:52">52</span> This heap be witness, and the pillar be
witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou
shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm. <span
id="an_gen:31:53">53</span> The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor,
the God of their father, judge betwixt us.' And Jacob swore by the Fear
of his father Isaac. <span id="an_gen:31:54">54</span> And Jacob offered
a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread; and
they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain.
