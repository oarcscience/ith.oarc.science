### JOSHUA CHAPTER 20

<span id="an_jos:20:1">1</span> And the LORD spoke unto Joshua, saying:
<span id="an_jos:20:2">2</span> 'Speak to the children of Israel,
saying: Assign you the cities of refuge, whereof I spoke unto you by the
hand of Moses; <span id="an_jos:20:3">3</span> that the manslayer that
killeth any person through error and unawares may flee thither; and they
shall be unto you for a refuge from the avenger of blood. <span
id="an_jos:20:4">4</span> And he shall flee unto one of those cities,
and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his
cause in the ears of the elders of that city; and they shall take him
into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among
them. <span id="an_jos:20:5">5</span> And if the avenger of blood pursue
after him, then they shall not deliver up the man-slayer into his hand;
because he smote his neighbour unawares, and hated him not beforetime.
<span id="an_jos:20:6">6</span> And he shall dwell in that city, until
he stand before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the
high priest that shall be in those days; then may the man-slayer return,
and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from
whence he fled.'

<span id="an_jos:20:7">7</span> And they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in
the hill-country of Naphtali, and Shechem in the hill-country of
Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba—the same is Hebron—in the hill-country of
Judah. <span id="an_jos:20:8">8</span> And beyond the Jordan at Jericho
eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the table-land out of
the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and
Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh. <span
id="an_jos:20:9">9</span> These were the appointed cities for all the
children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them,
that whosoever killeth any person through error might flee thither, and
not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the
congregation.
