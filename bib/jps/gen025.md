### GENESIS CHAPTER 25

<span id="an_gen:25:1">1</span> And Abraham took another wife, and her
name was Keturah. <span id="an_gen:25:2">2</span> And she bore him
Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and <span id="page_29">p.
29</span> Ishbak, and Shuah. <span id="an_gen:25:3">3</span> And Jokshan
begot Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and
Letushim, and Leummim. <span id="an_gen:25:4">4</span> And the sons of
Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these
were the children of Keturah. <span id="an_gen:25:5">5</span> And
Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. <span
id="an_gen:25:6">6</span> But unto the sons of the concubines, that
Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Isaac his
son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. <span
id="an_gen:25:7">7</span> And these are the days of the years of
Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred threescore and fifteen years.
<span id="an_gen:25:8">8</span> And Abraham expired, and died in a good
old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
<span id="an_gen:25:9">9</span> And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried
him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar
the Hittite, which is before Mamre; <span
id="an_gen:25:10">10</span> the field which Abraham purchased of the
children of Heth; there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. <span
id="an_gen:25:11">11</span> And it came to pass after the death of
Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelt by
Beer-lahai-roi.

<span id="an_gen:25:12">12</span> Now these are the generations of
Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore
unto Abraham. <span id="an_gen:25:13">13</span> And these are the names
of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations:
the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
<span id="an_gen:25:14">14</span> and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa;
<span id="an_gen:25:15">15</span> Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and
Kedem; <span id="an_gen:25:16">16</span> these are the sons of Ishmael,
and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments;
twelve princes according to their nations. <span
id="an_gen:25:17">17</span> And these are the years of the life of
Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and seven years; and he expired and died;
and was gathered unto his people. <span id="an_gen:25:18">18</span> And
they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest
toward Asshur: over against all his brethren he did settle.

<span id="an_gen:25:19">19</span> And these are the generations of
Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begot Isaac. <span
id="an_gen:25:20">20</span> And Isaac was forty years old when he took
Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean, of Paddan-aram, the sister
of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife. <span
id="an_gen:25:21">21</span> And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife,
because she was barren; and the LORD let Himself be entreated of him,
and Rebekah his wife conceived. <span id="an_gen:25:22">22</span> And
the children struggled together within her; and she said: 'If it be so,
wherefore do I live?' And she went to inquire of the LORD. <span
id="an_gen:25:23">23</span> And the LORD said unto her:

Two nations are in thy womb,  
And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels;  
And the one people shall be stronger than the other people;  
And the elder shall serve the younger.

<span id="an_gen:25:24">24</span> And when her days to be delivered were
fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. <span
id="an_gen:25:25">25</span> And the first came forth ruddy, all over
like a hairy mantle; and they called his name Esau. <span
id="an_gen:25:26">26</span> And after that came forth his brother, and
his hand had hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called  <span
id="fr_28"></span>[a](#fn_27) Jacob. And Isaac was threescore years old
when she bore them. <span id="an_gen:25:27">27</span> And the boys grew;
and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a quiet
man, dwelling in tents. <span id="an_gen:25:28">28</span> Now Isaac
loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison; and Rebekah loved Jacob.
<span id="an_gen:25:29">29</span> And Jacob <span id="page_30">p.
30</span> sod pottage; and Esau came in from the field, and he was
faint. <span id="an_gen:25:30">30</span> And Esau said to Jacob: 'Let me
swallow, I pray thee, some of this red, red pottage; for I am faint.'
Therefore was his name called  <span id="fr_29"></span>[a](#fn_28) Edom.
<span id="an_gen:25:31">31</span> And Jacob said: 'Sell me first thy
birthright.' <span id="an_gen:25:32">32</span> And Esau said: 'Behold, I
am at the point to die; and what profit shall the birthright do to me?'
<span id="an_gen:25:33">33</span> And Jacob said: 'Swear to me first';
and he swore unto him; and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. <span
id="an_gen:25:34">34</span> And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of
lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way. So
Esau despised his birthright.
