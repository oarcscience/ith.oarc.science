### GENESIS CHAPTER 36

<span id="an_gen:36:1">1</span> Now these are the generations of
Esau—the same is Edom. <span id="an_gen:36:2">2</span> Esau took his
wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite,
and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,
<span id="an_gen:36:3">3</span> and Basemath Ishmael's daughter, sister
of Nebaioth. <span id="an_gen:36:4">4</span> And Adah bore to Esau
Eliphaz; and Basemath bore Reuel; <span id="an_gen:36:5">5</span> and
Oholibamah bore Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau,
that were born unto him in the land of Canaan. <span
id="an_gen:36:6">6</span> And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his
daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his cattle, and all his
beasts, and all his possessions, which he had gathered in the land of
Canaan; and went into a land away from his brother Jacob. <span
id="an_gen:36:7">7</span> For their substance was too great for them to
dwell together; and the land of their sojournings could not bear them
because of their cattle. <span id="an_gen:36:8">8</span> And Esau dwelt
in the mountain-land of Seir—Esau is Edom. <span
id="an_gen:36:9">9</span> And these are the generations of Esau the
father of  <span id="fr_62"></span>[a](#fn_61.md) the Edomites in the
mountain-land of Seir. <span id="an_gen:36:10">10</span> These are the
names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel
the son of Basemath the wife of Esau. <span
id="an_gen:36:11">11</span> And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar,
Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. <span id="an_gen:36:12">12</span> And Timna
was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek.
These are the sons of Adah Esau's wife. <span
id="an_gen:36:13">13</span> And these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, and
Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Basemath Esau's wife.
<span id="an_gen:36:14">14</span> And these were the sons of Oholibamah
the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife; and she bore
to Esau Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah. <span
id="an_gen:36:15">15</span> These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau:
the sons of Eliphaz the first-born of Esau: the chief of Teman, the
chief of Omar, the chief of Zepho, the chief of Kenaz, <span
id="an_gen:36:16">16</span> the chief of Korah, the chief of Gatam, the
chief of Amalek. These are the chiefs that came of Eliphaz in the land
of Edom. These are the sons of Adah. <span
id="an_gen:36:17">17</span> And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son:
the chief of Nahath, the chief of Zerah, the chief of Shammah, the chief
of Mizzah. These are the chiefs that came of Reuel in the land of Edom.
These are the sons of Basemath Esau's wife. <span
id="an_gen:36:18">18</span> And these are the sons of Oholibamah Esau's
wife: the chief of Jeush, the chief of Jalam, the chief of Korah. These
are the chiefs that came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's
wife. <span id="an_gen:36:19">19</span> These are the sons of Esau, and
these are their chiefs; the same is Edom.

<span id="an_gen:36:20">20</span> These are the sons of Seir the Horite,
the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah, <span
id="an_gen:36:21">21</span> and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan. These are
the chiefs that came of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of
Edom. <span id="an_gen:36:22">22</span> And the children of Lotan were
Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was <span id="page_45">p. 45</span>
Timna. <span id="an_gen:36:23">23</span> And these are the children of
Shobal: Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam. <span
id="an_gen:36:24">24</span> And these are the children of Zibeon: Aiah
and Anah—this is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, as he
fed the asses of Zibeon his father. <span
id="an_gen:36:25">25</span> And these are the children of Anah: Dishon
and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah. <span
id="an_gen:36:26">26</span> And these are the children of  <span
id="fr_63"></span>[a](#fn_62.md) Dishon: Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and
Cheran. <span id="an_gen:36:27">27</span> These are the children of
Ezer: Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan. <span
id="an_gen:36:28">28</span> These are the children of Dishan: Uz and
Aran. <span id="an_gen:36:29">29</span> These are the chiefs that came
of the Horites: the chief of Lotan, the chief of Shobal, the chief of
Zibeon, the chief of Anah, <span id="an_gen:36:30">30</span> the chief
of Dishon, the chief of Ezer, the chief of Dishan. These are the chiefs
that came of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir.

<span id="an_gen:36:31">31</span> And these are the kings that reigned
in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of
Israel. <span id="an_gen:36:32">32</span> And Bela the son of Beor
reigned in Edom; and the name of his city was Dinhabah. <span
id="an_gen:36:33">33</span> And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of
Bozrah reigned in his stead. <span id="an_gen:36:34">34</span> And Jobab
died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead.
<span id="an_gen:36:35">35</span> And Husham died, and Hadad the son of
Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead; and
the name of his city was Avith. <span id="an_gen:36:36">36</span> And
Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead. <span
id="an_gen:36:37">37</span> And Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth by
the River reigned in his stead. <span id="an_gen:36:38">38</span> And
Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead. <span
id="an_gen:36:39">39</span> And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and
Hadar reigned in his stead; and the name of his city was Pau; and his
wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of
Me-zahab. <span id="an_gen:36:40">40</span> And these are the names of
the chiefs that came of Esau, according to their families, after their
places, by their names: the chief of Timna, the chief of Alvah, the
chief of Jetheth; <span id="an_gen:36:41">41</span> the chief of
Oholibamah, the chief of Elah, the chief of Pinon; <span
id="an_gen:36:42">42</span> the chief of Kenaz, the chief of Teman, the
chief of Mibzar; <span id="an_gen:36:43">43</span> the chief of Magdiel,
the chief of Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom, according to their
habitations in the land of their possession. This is Esau the father of
the Edomites.
