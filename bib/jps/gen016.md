### GENESIS CHAPTER 16

<span id="an_gen:16:1">1</span> Now Sarai Abram's wife bore him no
children; and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
<span id="an_gen:16:2">2</span> And Sarai said unto Abram: 'Behold now,
the LORD hath restrained me from bearing; go in, I pray thee, unto my
handmaid; it may be that I shall be builded up through her.' And Abram
hearkened to the voice of Sarai. <span id="an_gen:16:3">3</span> And
Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram
had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her
husband to be his wife. <span id="an_gen:16:4">4</span> And he went in
unto Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived,
her mistress was despised in her eyes. <span
id="an_gen:16:5">5</span> And Sarai said unto Abram: 'My wrong be upon
thee: I gave my handmaid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had
conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and
thee.' <span id="an_gen:16:6">6</span> But Abram said unto Sarai:
'Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her that which is good in thine
eyes.' And Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her face.
<span id="an_gen:16:7">7</span> And the angel of the LORD found her by a
fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.
<span id="an_gen:16:8">8</span> And he said: 'Hagar, Sarai's handmaid,
whence camest thou? and whither goest thou?' And she said: 'I flee from
the face of my mistress Sarai.' <span id="an_gen:16:9">9</span> And the
angel of the LORD said unto her: 'Return to thy mistress, and submit
thyself under her hands.' <span id="an_gen:16:10">10</span> And the
angel of the LORD said unto her: 'I will greatly multiply thy seed, that
it shall not be numbered for multitude.' <span
id="an_gen:16:11">11</span> And the angel of the LORD said unto her:
'Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son; and thou shalt call
his name  <span id="fr_18"></span>[a](#fn_17.md) Ishmael, because the LORD
hath heard thy affliction. <span id="an_gen:16:12">12</span> And he
shall be a wild ass of a man: his hand shall be against every man, and
every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the face of all his
brethren.' <span id="an_gen:16:13">13</span> And she called the name of
the LORD that spoke unto her, Thou art  <span
id="fr_19"></span>[b](#fn_18.md) a God of seeing; for she said: 'Have I
even here seen Him that seeth me?' <span
id="an_gen:16:14">14</span> Wherefore the well was called  <span
id="fr_20"></span>[c](#fn_19.md) Beer-lahai-roi; <span id="page_18">p.
18</span> behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered. <span
id="an_gen:16:15">15</span> And Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called
the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. <span
id="an_gen:16:16">16</span> And Abram was fourscore and six years old,
when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
