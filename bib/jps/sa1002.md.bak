### I SAMUEL CHAPTER 2

<span id="an_sa1:2:1">1</span> And Hannah prayed, and said:  
My heart exulteth in the LORD,  
My horn is exalted in the LORD;  
My mouth is enlarged over mine enemies;  
Because I rejoice in Thy salvation.  
<span id="an_sa1:2:2">2</span> There is none holy as the LORD;  
For there is none beside Thee;  
Neither is there any rock like our God.  
<span id="an_sa1:2:3">3</span> Multiply not exceeding proud talk;  
Let not arrogancy come out of your mouth;  
For the LORD is a God of knowledge,  
And by Him actions are weighed.  
<span id="an_sa1:2:4">4</span> The bows of the mighty men are broken,  
And they that stumbled are girded with strength.  
<span id="an_sa1:2:5">5</span> They that were full have hired out
themselves for bread;  
And they that were hungry have ceased;  
While the barren hath borne seven,  
She that had many children hath languished.

<span id="an_sa1:2:6">6</span> The LORD killeth, and maketh alive;  
He bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.  
<span id="an_sa1:2:7">7</span> The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich;  
He bringeth low, He also lifteth up.  
<span id="an_sa1:2:8">8</span> He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,  
He lifteth up the needy from the dung-hill,  
To make them sit with princes,  
And inherit the throne of glory;  
For the pillars of the earth are the LORD'S,  
And He hath set the world upon them.

<span id="an_sa1:2:9">9</span> He will keep the feet of His holy ones,  
But the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness;  
For not by strength shall man prevail.  
<span id="an_sa1:2:10">10</span> They that strive with the LORD shall be
broken to pieces;  
Against them will He thunder in heaven; <span id="page_327">p.
327</span>  
The LORD will judge the ends of the earth;  
And He will give strength unto His king,  
And exalt the horn of His anointed.

<span id="an_sa1:2:11">11</span> And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house.
And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.

<span id="an_sa1:2:12">12</span> Now the sons of Eli were base men; they
knew not the LORD. <span id="an_sa1:3:13">13</span> And the custom of
the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice,
the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a
flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand; <span
id="an_sa1:2:14">14</span> and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or
caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took
therewith. So they did unto all the Israelites that came thither in
Shiloh. <span id="an_sa1:2:15">15</span> Yea, before the fat was made to
smoke, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed:
\`Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh
of thee, but raw.' <span id="an_sa1:2:16">16</span> And if the man said
unto him: \`Let the fat be made to smoke first of all, and then take as
much as thy soul desireth'; then he would say: \`Nay, but thou shalt
give it me now; and if not, I will take it by force.' <span
id="an_sa1:2:17">17</span> And the sin of the young men was very great
before the LORD; for the men dealt contemptuously with the offering of
the LORD.

<span id="an_sa1:2:18">18</span> But Samuel ministered before the LORD,
being a child, girded with a linen ephod. <span
id="an_sa1:2:19">19</span> Moreover his mother made him a little robe,
and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her
husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. <span
id="an_sa1:2:20">20</span> And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and
say: \`The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which was lent
to the LORD.' And they would go unto their own home. <span
id="an_sa1:2:21">21</span> So the LORD remembered Hannah, and she
conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel
grew before the LORD.

<span id="an_sa1:2:22">22</span> Now Eli was very old; and he heard all
that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women
that did service at the door of the tent of meeting. <span
id="an_sa1:2:23">23</span> And he said unto them: \`Why do ye such
things? for I hear evil reports concerning you from all this people.
<span id="an_sa1:2:24">24</span> Nay, my sons; for it is no good report
which I hear the LORD's people do spread abroad. <span
id="an_sa1:2:25">25</span> If one man sin against another; God shall
judge him; but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for
him?' But they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the
LORD would slay them. <span id="an_sa1:2:26">26</span> And the child
Samuel grew on, and increased in favour both with the LORD, and also
with men.

<span id="an_sa1:2:27">27</span> And there came a man of God unto Eli,
and said unto him: \`Thus saith the LORD: Did I reveal Myself unto the
house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh's
house? <span id="an_sa1:2:28">28</span> And did I choose him out of all
the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to go up unto Mine altar, to burn
incense, to wear an ephod before Me? and did I give unto the house of
thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?
<span id="an_sa1:2:29">29</span> Wherefore kick ye at My sacrifice and
at Mine offering, which I have commanded in My habitation; and honourest
thy sons above Me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the
offerings of Israel My people? <span
id="an_sa1:2:30">30</span> Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, saith:
I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk
before Me for ever; but now the LORD saith: Be it far from Me;

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

for them that honour Me I will honour, and they that despise Me shall be
lightly esteemed. <span id="an_sa1:2:31">31</span> Behold, the days
come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house,
that there shall not be an old man in thy house. <span
id="an_sa1:2:32">32</span> And thou shalt behold a rival in My
habitation, in all the good which shall be done to Israel; and there
shall not be an old man in thy house for ever. <span
id="an_sa1:2:33">33</span> Yet will I not cut off every man of thine
from Mine altar, to make thine eyes to fail, and thy heart to languish;
and all the increase of thy house shall die young men. <span
id="an_sa1:2:34">34</span> And this shall be the sign unto thee, that
which shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day
they shall die both of them. <span id="an_sa1:2:35">35</span> And I will
raise Me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is
in My heart and in My mind; and I will build him a sure house; and he
shall walk before Mine anointed for ever. <span
id="an_sa1:2:36">36</span> And it shall come to pass, that every one
that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of
silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say: [\`](errata.htm#5.md) Put me, I
pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a morsel of
bread.'
