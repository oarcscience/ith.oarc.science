### NUMBERS CHAPTER 24

<span id="an_num:24:1">1</span> And when Balaam saw that it pleased the
LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at the other times, to meet with
enchantments but he set his face toward the wilderness. <span
id="an_num:24:2">2</span> And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw
Israel dwelling tribe by tribe; and the spirit of God came upon him.
<span id="an_num:24:3">3</span> And he took up his parable, and said:

The saying of Balaam the son of Beor,  
And the saying of the man whose eye is opened;  
<span id="an_num:24:4">4</span> The saying of him who heareth the words
of God,  
Who seeth the vision of the Almighty,  
Fallen down, yet with opened eyes:  
<span id="an_num:24:5">5</span> How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob,  
Thy dwellings, O Israel!  
<span id="an_num:24:6">6</span> As valleys stretched out,  
As gardens by the river-side;  
As aloes planted of the LORD,  
As cedars beside the waters;  
<span id="an_num:24:7">7</span> Water shall flow from his branches,  
And his seed shall be in many waters;  
And his king shall be higher than Agag,  
And his kingdom shall be exalted.  
<span id="an_num:24:8">8</span> God who brought him forth out of Egypt  
Is for him like the lofty horns of the wild-ox;  
He shall eat up the nations that are his adversaries,  
And shall break their bones in pieces,  
And pierce them through with his arrows.  
<span id="an_num:24:9">9</span> He couched, he lay down as a lion,  
And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?  
Blessed be every one that blesseth thee,  
And cursed be every one that curseth thee.

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> <span
id="an_num:24:10">10</span> And Balak's anger was kindled against
Balaam, and he smote his hands together; and Balak said unto Balaam: \`I
called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether
blessed them these three times. <span
id="an_num:24:11">11</span> Therefore now flee thou to thy place; I
thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept
thee back from honour.' <span id="an_num:24:12">12</span> And Balaam
said unto Balak: \`Spoke I not also to thy messengers that thou didst
send unto me, saying: <span id="an_num:24:13">13</span> If Balak would
give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word
of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; what the LORD
speaketh, that will I speak? <span id="an_num:24:14">14</span> And now,
behold, I go unto my people; come, and I will announce to thee what this
people shall do to thy people in the end of days.' <span
id="an_num:24:15">15</span> And he took up his parable, and said:

The saying of Balaam the son of Beor,  
And the saying of the man whose eye is opened;  
<span id="an_num:24:16">16</span> The saying of him who heareth the
words of God,  
And knoweth the knowledge of the Most High,  
Who seeth the vision of the Almighty,  
Fallen down, yet with opened eyes:  
<span id="an_num:24:17">17</span> I see him, but not now;  
I behold him, but not nigh;  
There shall step forth a star out of Jacob,  
And a sceptre shall rise out of Israel,  
And shall smite through the corners of Moab,  
And break down all the sons of Seth.  
<span id="an_num:24:18">18</span> And Edom shall be a possession,  
Seir also, even his enemies, shall be a possession;  
While Israel doeth valiantly.  
<span id="an_num:24:19">19</span> And out of Jacob shall one have
dominion,  
And shall destroy the remnant from the city.

<span id="an_num:24:20">20</span> And he looked on Amalek, and took up
his parable, and said:  
Amalek was the first of the nations;  
But his end shall come to destruction.

<span id="an_num:24:21">21</span> And he looked on the Kenite, and took
up his parable, and said:  
Though firm be thy dwelling-place,  
And though thy nest be set in the rock;  
<span id="an_num:24:22">22</span> Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted;  
How long? Asshur shall carry thee away captive.

<span id="an_num:24:23">23</span> And he took up his parable, and
said:  
Alas, who shall live after God hath appointed him?  
<span id="an_num:24:24">24</span> But ships shall come from the coast of
Kittim,  
And they shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber,  
And he also shall come to destruction.

<span id="an_num:24:25">25</span> And Balaam rose up, and went and
returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.
