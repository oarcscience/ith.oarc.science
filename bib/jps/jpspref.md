### PREFACE

THE sacred task of translating the Word of God, as revealed to Israel
through lawgiver, prophet, psalmist, and sage, began at an early date.
According to an ancient rabbinic interpretation, Joshua had the Torah
engraved upon the stones of the altar (Joshua viii. 32) not in the
original Hebrew alone, but in all the languages of mankind, which were
held to be seventy, in order that all men might become acquainted with
the words of the Scriptures. This statement, with its universalistic
tendency, is, of course, a reflex of later times, when the Hebrew
Scriptures had become a subject of curiosity and perhaps also of anxiety
to the pagan or semi-pagan world.

While this tradition contains an element of truth, it is certain that
the primary object of translating the Bible was to minister to a need
nearer home. Upon the establishment of the Second Commonwealth under
Ezra and Nehemiah, it became imperative to make the Torah of God
'distinct and giving sense' through the means of interpretation
(Nehemiah viii. 8 and xiii. 24), that the Word of God might be
understood by all the people. The Rabbis perceived in this activity of
the first generation of the Sopherim the origin of the Aramaic
translation known as the Targum, first made orally and afterwards
committed to writing, which was necessitated by the fact that Israel had
forgotten the sacred language, and spoke the idiom current in a large
part of western Asia. All this, however, is veiled in obscurity, as is
the whole inner history of the Jews during the Persian rule.

The historic necessity for translation was repeated with all the great
changes in Israel's career. It is enough to point to the Septuagint, or
the Greek translation of the Scriptures, the product of Israel's contact
with the Hellenistic civilization dominating the world at that time; to
the Arabic translation by the Gaon Saadya, when the great majority of
the Jewish people came under the sceptre of Mohammedan rulers; and to
the German translation by Mendelssohn and his school, at the dawn of a
new epoch, which brought the Jews in Europe, most of whom spoke a German
dialect, into closer contact with their neighbours.

<span id="page_iv">p. iv</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> These translations
are all historical products intimately connected with Israel's
wanderings among the nations and with the great events of mankind in
general.

Ancient and continuous as this task of translation was, it would be a
mistake to think that there were no misgivings about it. At least it is
certain that opinions were divided as to the desirability of such
undertakings. While Philo and his Alexandrian coreligionists looked upon
the translation of the Seventy as a work of inspired men, the
Palestinian Rabbis subsequently considered the day on which the
Septuagint was completed as one of the most unfortunate in Israel's
history, seeing that the Torah could never be adequately translated. And
there are indications enough that the consequences of such translations
were not all of a desirable nature. However, in view of the eagerness
with which they were undertaken almost in every land and in every great
epoch of the world's history, it is evident that the people at large
approved of such translations, thinking them to be a heave-offering to
the Lord of each newly acquired vernacular adopted in the course of the
ever-changing conditions of history, and in particular a tribute to the
beauty of Japheth dwelling in the spiritual tents of Israel.

The greatest change in the life of Israel during the last two
generations was his renewed acquaintance with English-speaking
civilization. Out of a handful of immigrants from Central Europe and the
East who saw the shores of the New World, or even of England and her
colonies, we have grown under Providence both in numbers and in
importance, so that we constitute now the greatest section of Israel
living in a single country outside of Russia. We are only following in
the footsteps of our great predecessors when, with the growth of our
numbers, we have applied ourselves to the sacred task of preparing a new
translation of the Bible into the English language, which, unless all
signs fail, is to become the current speech of the majority of the
children of Israel.

The need of such a translation was felt long ago. Mention may here be
made of the work of Isaac Leeser in America, which was both preceded and
followed by two translations produced in England: the one by Dr. A.
Benisch, the other by Dr. Michael Friedländer.

<span id="page_v">p. v</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The most popular,
however, among these translations was that of Leeser, which was not only
the accepted version in all the synagogues of the United States, but was
also reproduced in England. Its great merit consisted in the fact that
it incorporated all the improvements proposed by the Mendelssohn School
and their successors, whose combined efforts were included and further
developed in the so-called Zunz Bible, which enjoyed a certain authority
among German Jews for several generations. With the advance of time and
the progress made in almost all departments of Bible study, it was found
that Leeser's translation would bear improvement and recasting.

Steps leading to the preparation of a new translation into the English
language were taken by the Jewish Publication Society of America in
1892. It was intended to secure, if possible, through the co-operation
of scholars in the United States and in Great Britain, a new translation
of each book, and to place it in the hands of an Editorial Committee,
who by correspondence with the translators should harmonize the results
of the work of the individual contributors. This method was followed
until 1901 under the general direction of Doctor Marcus Jastrow,
Editor-in-Chief, with Doctor Kaufman Kohler and Doctor Frederick de Sola
Mendes as the other members of the Editorial Committee. <span
id="fr_0"></span>[a](#fn_0)

<span id="page_vi">p. vi</span>

It became apparent in 1901 that by this procedure the publication of a
translation of the entire Hebrew Bible would be indefinitely delayed,
and accordingly the Book of Psalms, translated by Doctor Kohler and
revised by his colleagues, was given to the press and issued in 1903.
The death of Doctor Jastrow in that year required the formation of a new
committee under the chairmanship of Doctor Solomon Schechter. This
committee, however, soon found that the method adopted was too complex,
and that it was impossible to accomplish by correspondence the extensive
work required.

In 1908 the Jewish Publication Society of America and the Central
Conference of American Rabbis reached an agreement to co-operate in
bringing out the new translation upon a revised plan of having the
entire work done by a Board of Editors instead of endeavoring to
harmonize the translations of individual contributors. As a result of
this understanding the present Board, composed of Doctor Solomon
Schechter, Doctor Cyrus Adler, and Doctor Joseph Jacobs, representing
the Jewish Publication Society of America, and Doctor Kaufman Kohler,
Doctor David Philipson, and Doctor Samuel Schulman, representing the
Central Conference of American Rabbis, was constituted, and by mutual
agreement Professor Max L. Margolis was chosen as the seventh member, he
to be the Editor-in-Chief of the work and Secretary to the Editorial
Board, of which Doctor Cyrus Adler was elected Chairman. Incidentally
the selection thus made resulted in an equal representation of the
Jewish Theological Seminary of America at New York, of the Hebrew Union
College at Cincinnati, and of the Dropsie College for Hebrew and Cognate
Learning at Philadelphia. For one year Professor Israel Friedlaender
acted as a member of the Board in the stead of Doctor Schechter.

The method employed by the Board was as follows:

In preparing the manuscript for consideration by the Board of Editors,
Professor Margolis took into account the existing English versions, the
standard commentaries, ancient and modern, the translations already made
for the Jewish Publication Society of America, the divergent renderings
from the Revised Version prepared for the Jews of

<span id="page_vii">p. vii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> England, the
marginal notes of the Revised Version, and the changes of the American
Committee of Revisers. Due weight was given to the ancient versions as
establishing a tradition of interpretation, notably the Septuagint and
the versions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, the Targums, the
Peshitta, the Vulgate, and the Arabic version of Saadya. Talmudic and
midrashic allusions and all available Jewish commentators, both the
great mediæval authorities, like Rashi, Kimhi, and Ibn Ezra, and the
moderns S. D. Luzzatto, Malbim, and Ehrlich, as well as all the
important non-Jewish commentators, were consulted. On this basis, a
manuscript was prepared by the Editor-in-Chief and a copy sent to every
member of the Board of Editors. Sixteen meetings, covering a period of
seven years and occupying one hundred and sixty working days, were held,
at which the proposals in this manuscript and many additional
suggestions by the members of the Board were considered. Each point was
thoroughly discussed, and the view of the majority was incorporated into
the manuscript. When the Board was evenly divided, the Chairman cast the
deciding vote. From time to time sub-committees were at work upon points
left open, and their reports, submitted to the Board, were discussed and
voted upon. The proof of the entire work was sent to each member of the
Board for revision, and the new proposals which were made by one or
another were in turn submitted to a vote by correspondence and to a
final vote at the last meeting of the Board, held in October-November,
1915.

The present translation is the first for which a group of men
representative of Jewish learning among English-speaking Jews assume
joint responsibility, all previous efforts in the English language
having been the work of individual translators. It has a character of
its own. It aims to combine the spirit of Jewish tradition with the
results of biblical scholarship, ancient, mediæval, and modern. It gives
to the Jewish world a translation of the Scriptures done by men imbued
with the Jewish consciousness, while the non-Jewish world, it is hoped,
will welcome a translation that presents many passages from the Jewish
traditional point of view.

The repeated efforts by Jews in the field of biblical translation

<span id="page_viii">p. viii</span>

show their sentiment toward translations prepared by other
denominations. The dominant feature of this sentiment, apart from the
thought that the christological interpretations in non-Jewish
translations are out of place in a Jewish Bible, is and was that the Jew
cannot afford to have his Bible translation prepared for him by others.
He cannot have it as a gift, even as he cannot borrow his soul from
others. If a new country and a new language metamorphose him into a new
man, the duty of this new man is to prepare a new garb and a new method
of expression for what is most sacred and most dear to him.

We are, it is hardly needful to say, deeply grateful for the works of
our non-Jewish predecessors, such as the Authorised Version with its
admirable diction, which can never be surpassed, as well as for the
Revised Version with its ample learning—but they are not ours. The
Editors have not only used these famous English versions, but they have
gone back to the earlier translations of Wycliffe, Tyndale, Coverdale,
the Bishops' Bible, and the Douai Version, which is the authorised
English translation of the Vulgate used by the Roman Catholics; in a
word, upon doubtful points in style, all English versions have been
drawn upon. The renditions of parts of the Hebrew Scriptures by Lowth
and others in the eighteenth century and by Cheyne and Driver in our own
days were likewise consulted.

As to the text and order of the biblical books, the present translation
follows Jewish tradition, the Sacred Scriptures having come down in a
definite compass and in a definite text. They are separated into three
divisions: Law (Torah, Pentateuch), Prophets (Nebi’im), Writings
(Ketubim). Each of these possesses a different degree of holiness or
authority. In the Prophets and the Writings the order of the books
varies in manuscripts or among Jewish authorities; but there is absolute
agreement as to the compass of these two divisions, and no book is
transposed from the one into the other. Thus Ruth, Lamentations, and
Daniel are all placed in the division of Writings—not among the
Prophets, as in non-Jewish versions.

With every step by which each of the three parts was sealed, nothing to
be added or to be taken away, the text was likewise fixed and
thenceforth made the object of zealous watchfulness. Even with regard

<span id="page_ix">p. ix</span>

to the latest book of our Scriptures, we read its text substantially in
the form in which the great Rabbi Akiba read it, he who said that the
system by which the sacred text was guarded constituted a fence about
the Scriptures. In that system, at first oral and later committed to
writing, the letters were actually counted and lists made, to the end
that no alterations should creep in at the hands of careless scribes.
The first to collect the notes known as Masorah was Jacob ben Haim Ibn
Adonijah, the editor of the second Rabbinic Bible. In our own day many
scholars have been prominent in this field of labour, chief among whom
are Wolf Heidenheim, S. Frensdorff, S. Baer, and C. D. Ginsburg. We have
followed Baer's <span id="fr_1"></span>[a](#fn_1) text and for the parts
not edited by him that of Ginsburg. Not only does the text known as the
masoretic represent the text current in the Synagogue with regard to
consonants, but also with regard to its signs standing for vowels and
accents, both of which embody the interpretation accepted by the
Synagogue. While in the scrolls which are read in the Synagogue the bare
consonants are alone permitted, readers must prepare themselves from
copies allowed for private use, in ancient times written and now
printed, which contain the additional signs for vowels and accents. A
translation must naturally follow the guide of the latter. Moreover, the
public reader is bound in certain cases to substitute mentally other
consonants in the place of those found in the scrolls, in accordance
with the marginal annotations in the copies intended for private use.
These variants are taken traditionally for corrections, and the public
reader who persists in ignoring them forfeits his position. It is true
that in the case of such variations the Jewish commentators of the
Middle Ages sought to elicit a meaning also from the textual reading,
and seem here and there tacitly to give it preference, but all this
partakes of the nature of private judgment, and does not affect the
uniform practice of the public readings in the Synagogue. While as a
rule the margin (Kere) was followed, we have occasionally adopted the
consonants of

<span id="page_x">p. x</span>

the text (Ketib), as for instance in Psalm cxxxix. 16, and II Chronicles
xxiv. 27; xxxiv. 9.

A translation destined for the people can follow only one text, and that
must be the traditional. Nevertheless a translator is not a transcriber
of the text. His principal function is to make the Hebrew intelligible.
Faithful though he must be to the Hebrew idiom, he will nevertheless be
forced by the genius of the English language to use circumlocution, to
add a word or two, to alter the sequence of words, and the like. In
general, our rule has been that, where the word or words added are
implied in the Hebrew construction, no device is used to mark the
addition; where, on the other hand, the addition is not at once to be
inferred from the original wording and yet seems necessary for the
understanding, it has been enclosed in brackets. Naturally opinion will
differ as to what may be deemed an addition warranted by the Hebrew
construction and what may not, but as intelligibility was the principal
aim, the Editors have felt justified in making their additions,
sparingly it is true, but nevertheless as often as the occasion
required.

We have thought it proper to limit the margin to the shortest compass,
confining it to such elucidation of and references to the literal
meaning as are absolutely necessary for making the translation
intelligible. The Rabbis enumerate eighteen instances in which the
scribes consciously altered the text. We have called attention to a
change of this nature in Judges xviii. 30.

Personal pronouns referring to the Deity have been capitalized. As an
aid to clearness direct discourse has been indicated by quotation marks.
In the prophetical writings, where the speech of the prophet
imperceptibly glides into the words of the Deity, and in the legal
portions of the Pentateuch, it has been thought best to use quotation
marks sparingly. Although the spelling of proper names in the English
Bible in many instances deviates somewhat from an accurate
representation of the Hebrew, it has nevertheless been deemed wise,
owing to the familiarity of Hebrew names in their usual English form,
generally to retain the current spelling.

In all externals this translation is especially adapted for use in
synagogue

<span id="page_xi">p. xi</span>

and school. The Keriat ha-Torah, or the reading of the section from the
Five Books of Moses, is the central feature of the Synagogue service.
The Pentateuch is divided into fifty-four sections; beginning with the
Sabbath following the Feast of Tabernacles, the readings on the Sabbaths
of the year are taken in their order from the Five Books of Moses. The
reading consists either of the whole section or of a selected portion.
There was a variant custom according to which the reading of the Torah
extended over a period of three years instead of one year. However, the
one year cycle gradually superseded the three year cycle, and has become
the universal custom in the Synagogue.

The Pentateuchal readings are supplemented by readings from the Prophets
known as Haftarot. Readings from the third portion of the Bible, though
customary at one time, have now largely fallen into disuse. The five
small books known as the Five Megillot are given a place in the
Synagogue service in their entirety. On the feast of Purim the book of
Esther is read; the book of Lamentations is read on Tish‘ah be-Ab (Ninth
of Ab), the fast-day observed in commemoration of the destruction of
Jerusalem; Song of Songs, Ruth, and Ecclesiastes are read respectively
on the Feast of Passover, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of
Tabernacles.

The sections of the Pentateuch as traditionally read on the Sabbath are
indicated, and a table gives all Scriptural readings, both on the
Sabbath and on feast days and fast days.

By the favor of a gracious Providence the present company of Editors was
permitted to finish the work which is now given to the public. The final
meeting in November, nineteen hundred and fifteen, was closed with a
prayer of thanks to God that the great task was completed and that the
group which during seven years had toiled together was intact. Since
that day two of our number have been called to the

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

academy on high, Solomon Schechter and Joseph Jacobs, be their memory
for a blessing. We grieve that it was not granted these cherished
colleagues to live to see the final fruition of their labours; their
wholehearted and devoted service is herewith recorded in grateful
appreciation. In all humility their co-workers submit this version to
the Jewish people in the confident hope that it will aid them in the
knowledge of the Word of God.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[ix:a](jpspref.htm#fr_1) It should be noted that
in the otherwise excellent edition of Baer the word ‏חק‎ has been
omitted by mistake in Proverbs v. 20. In Ezekiel ix. 9 the Board
deviated from the Baer edition and accepted the reading ‏דמים‎, instead
of ‏חמס‎. In Psalm lxii. 4 the vocalization of Ben Naphtali was followed
instead of that of Ben Asher usually adopted by Baer.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[xiii:a](jpspref.htm#fr_2) Parentheses indicate
Sephardic ritual.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[xv:a](jpspref.htm#fr_4) On Sabbath, 14.22-16.17
