### II SAMUEL CHAPTER 23

<span id="an_sa2:23:1">1</span>  Now these are the last words of
David:  
The saying of David the son of Jesse,  
And the saying of the man raised on high,  
The anointed of the God of Jacob,  
And the sweet singer of Israel:  
<span id="an_sa2:23:2">2</span>  The spirit of the LORD spoke by me,  
And His word was upon my tongue.

<span id="an_sa2:23:3">3</span>  The God of Israel said,  
The Rock of Israel spoke to me:  
\`Ruler over men shall be  
The righteous, even he that ruleth in the fear of God,  
<span id="an_sa2:23:4">4</span>  And as the light of the morning, when
the sun riseth,  
A morning without clouds;  
When through clear shining after rain,  
The tender grass springeth out of the earth.'  
<span id="an_sa2:23:5">5</span>  For is not my house established with
God?  
For an everlasting covenant He hath made with me,  
Ordered in all things, and sure;  
For all my salvation, and all my desire,  
Will He not make it to grow?  
<span id="an_sa2:23:6">6</span>  But the ungodly, they are as thorns
thrust away, all of them,  
For they cannot be taken with the hand;  
<span id="an_sa2:23:7">7</span>  But the man that toucheth them  
Must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear;  
And they shall be utterly burned with fire in their place.

<span id="an_sa2:23:8">8</span>  These are the names of the mighty men
whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains;
the same was Adino the Eznite; \[he lifted up his spear\] against eight
hundred, whom he slew at one time.

<span id="an_sa2:23:9">9</span>  And after him was Eleazar the son of
Dodo the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when
they jeoparded their lives against the Philistines that were

<span id="page_398">p. 398</span>

there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away;
<span id="an_sa2:23:10">10</span>  he stood firm, and smote the
Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand did cleave unto the
sword; and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people
returned after him only to strip the slain.

<span id="an_sa2:23:11">11</span>  And after him was Shammah the son of
Age the Ararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a
troop, where was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled
from the Philistines. <span id="an_sa2:23:12">12</span>  But he stood in
the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and
the LORD wrought a great victory.

<span id="an_sa2:23:13">13</span>  And three of the thirty chief went
down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam;
and the troop of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
<span id="an_sa2:23:14">14</span>  And David was then in the stronghold,
and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem. <span
id="an_sa2:23:15">15</span>  And David longed, and said: \`Oh that one
would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the
gate!' <span id="an_sa2:23:16">16</span>  And the three mighty men broke
through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of
Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David;
but he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD. <span
id="an_sa2:23:17">17</span>  And he said: \`Be it far from me, O LORD,
that I should do this; shall I drink the blood of the men that went in
jeopardy of their lives?' therefore he would not drink it. These things
did the three mighty men.

<span id="an_sa2:23:18">18</span>  And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the
son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. And he lifted up his spear
against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three.
<span id="an_sa2:23:19">19</span>  He was most honourable of the three;
therefore he was made their captain; howbeit he attained not unto the
first three.

<span id="an_sa2:23:20">20</span>  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the
son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he smote the
two altar-hearths of Moab; he went down also and slew a lion in the
midst of a pit in time of snow; <span id="an_sa2:23:21">21</span>  and
he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man; and the Egyptian had a spear in his
hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of
the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. <span
id="an_sa2:23:22">22</span>  These things did Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men. <span
id="an_sa2:23:23">23</span>  He was more honourable than the I thirty,
but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his
guard.

<span id="an_sa2:23:24">24</span>  Asahel the brother of Joab was one of
the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem; <span
id="an_sa2:23:25">25</span>  Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite;
<span id="an_sa2:23:26">26</span>  Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of
Ikkesh the Tekoite; <span id="an_sa2:23:27">27</span>  Abiezer the
Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite; <span id="an_sa2:23:28">28</span> 
Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite; <span
id="an_sa2:23:29">29</span>  Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite,
Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin; <span
id="an_sa2:23:30">30</span>  Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of
Nahale-gaash; <span id="an_sa2:23:31">31</span>  Abi-albon the
Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite; <span id="an_sa2:23:32">32</span> 
Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan; <span
id="an_sa2:23:33">33</span>  Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of
Sharar the Ararite; <span id="an_sa2:23:34">34</span>  Eliphelet the son
of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the
Gilonite; <span id="an_sa2:23:35">35</span>  Hezrai the Carmelite,
Paarai the Arbite; <span id="an_sa2:23:36">36</span>  Igal the son of
Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite;

<span id="page_399">p. 399</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> <span
id="an_sa2:23:37">37</span>  Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite,
armour-bearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah; <span
id="an_sa2:23:38">38</span>  Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite; <span
id="an_sa2:23:39">39</span>  Uriah the Hittite. Thirty and seven in all.
