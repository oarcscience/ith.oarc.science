### GENESIS CHAPTER 22

<span id="an_gen:22:1">1</span> And it came to pass after these things,
that God did prove Abraham, and said unto him: 'Abraham'; and he said:
'Here am I.' <span id="an_gen:22:2">2</span> And He said: 'Take now thy
son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the
land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the
mountains which I will tell thee of.' <span
id="an_gen:22:3">3</span> And Abraham rose early in the morning, and
saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his
son; and he cleaved the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and
went unto the place of which God had told him. <span
id="an_gen:22:4">4</span> On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes,
and saw the place afar off. <span id="an_gen:22:5">5</span> And Abraham
said unto his young men: 'Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad
will go yonder; and we will worship, and come back to you.' <span
id="an_gen:22:6">6</span> And Abraham took the wood of the
burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took in his hand
the fire and the knife; and they went both of them together. <span
id="an_gen:22:7">7</span> And Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father, and
said: 'My father.' And he said: 'Here am I, my son.' And he said:
'Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a
burnt-offering?' <span id="an_gen:22:8">8</span> And Abraham said: 'God
will  <span id="fr_25"></span>[a](#fn_24) provide Himself the lamb for a
burnt-offering, my son.' So they went both of them together. <span
id="an_gen:22:9">9</span> And they came to the place which God had told
him of; and Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order,
and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood. <span
id="an_gen:22:10">10</span> And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and
took the knife to slay his son. <span id="an_gen:22:11">11</span> And
the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said: 'Abraham,
Abraham.' And he said: 'Here am I.' <span
id="an_gen:22:12">12</span> And he said: 'Lay not thy hand upon the lad,
neither do thou any thing unto him; for now I know that thou art a
God-fearing man, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son,
from Me.' <span id="an_gen:22:13">13</span> And Abraham lifted up his
eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by
his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a
burnt-offering in the stead of his son. <span
id="an_gen:22:14">14</span> And Abraham called the name of that place
 <span id="fr_26"></span>[b](#fn_25) Adonai-jireh; as it is said to this
day: 'In the mount where the LORD is seen.' <span
id="an_gen:22:15">15</span> And the angel of the LORD called unto
Abraham a second time out of heaven, <span
id="an_gen:22:16">16</span> and said: 'By Myself have I sworn, saith the
LORD, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,
thine only son, <span id="an_gen:22:17">17</span> that in blessing I
will bless thee, and <span id="page_25">p. 25</span> in multiplying I
will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which
is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his
enemies; <span id="an_gen:22:18">18</span> and in thy seed shall all the
nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast hearkened to My
voice.' <span id="an_gen:22:19">19</span> So Abraham returned unto his
young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham
dwelt at Beersheba.

<span id="an_gen:22:20">20</span> And it came to pass after these
things, that it was told Abraham, saying: 'Behold, Milcah, she also hath
borne children unto thy brother Nahor: <span
id="an_gen:22:21">21</span> Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and
Kemuel the father of Aram; <span id="an_gen:22:22">22</span> and Chesed,
and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.' <span
id="an_gen:22:23">23</span> And Bethuel begot Rebekah; these eight did
Milcah bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother. <span
id="an_gen:22:24">24</span> And his concubine, whose name was Reumah,
she also bore Tehah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah.
