<p><A NAME="an_num:22:1">1</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel journeyed, and pitched in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.</p>  
<p align="center">&#8207;&#1489;&#1500;&#1511;&#8206;</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_num:22:2">2</A>&nbsp;And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. <A NAME="an_num:22:3">3</A>&nbsp;And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many; and Moab was overcome with dread because of the children of Israel. <A NAME="an_num:22:4">4</A>&nbsp;And Moab said unto the elders of Midian: `Now will this multitude lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field.'&#8212;And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.&#8212; <A NAME="an_num:22:5">5</A>&nbsp;And he sent messengers unto Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying: `Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt; behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me. <A NAME="an_num:22:6">6</A>&nbsp;Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me; peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.' <A NAME="an_num:22:7">7</A>&nbsp;And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spoke unto him the words of Balak. <A NAME="an_num:22:8">8</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them: `Lodge here this night, and I will bring you back word, as the LORD may speak unto me'; and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam. <A NAME="an_num:22:9">9</A>&nbsp;And God came unto Balaam, and said: `What men are these with thee?' <A NAME="an_num:22:10">10</A>&nbsp;And Balaam said unto God: `Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me [,saying]: <A NAME="an_num:22:11">11</A>&nbsp;Behold the people that is come out of Egypt, it covereth the face of the earth; now, come curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.' <A NAME="an_num:22:12">12</A>&nbsp;And God said unto Balaam: `Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people; for they are blessed.' <A NAME="an_num:22:13">13</A>&nbsp;And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak: `Get you into your land; for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.' <A NAME="an_num:22:14">14</A>&nbsp;And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said: `Balaam refuseth to come with us.' <A NAME="an_num:22:15">15</A>&nbsp;And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they. <A NAME="an_num:22:16">16</A>&nbsp;And they came to Balaam, and said to him: `Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor: Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me; <A NAME="an_num:22:17">17</A>&nbsp;for I will promote</p>  
<p><a name="page_191"><font size="1" color="green">p. 191</font></A></p>  
<p>thee unto very great honour, and whatsoever thou sayest unto me I will do; come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.' <A NAME="an_num:22:18">18</A>&nbsp;And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak: `If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do any thing, small or great. <A NAME="an_num:22:19">19</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will speak unto me more.' <A NAME="an_num:22:20">20</A>&nbsp;And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him: `If the men are come to call thee, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak unto thee, that shalt thou do.' <A NAME="an_num:22:21">21</A>&nbsp;And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab. <A NAME="an_num:22:22">22</A>&nbsp;And God's anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of the LORD placed himself in the way for an adversary against him.&#8212; Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.&#8212; <A NAME="an_num:22:23">23</A>&nbsp;And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field; and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way. <A NAME="an_num:22:24">24</A>&nbsp;Then the angel of the LORD stood in a hollow way between the vineyards, a fence being on this side, and a fence on that side. <A NAME="an_num:22:25">25</A>&nbsp;And the ass saw the angel of the LORD, and she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall; and he smote her again. <A NAME="an_num:22:26">26</A>&nbsp;And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. <A NAME="an_num:22:27">27</A>&nbsp;And the ass saw the angel of the LORD, and she lay down under Balaam; and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with his staff. <A NAME="an_num:22:28">28</A>&nbsp;And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam: `What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?' <A NAME="an_num:22:29">29</A>&nbsp;And Balaam said unto the ass: `Because thou hast mocked me; I would there were a sword in my hand, for now I had killed thee.' <A NAME="an_num:22:30">30</A>&nbsp;And the ass said unto Balaam: `Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden all thy life long unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee?' And he said: `Nay.' <A NAME="an_num:22:31">31</A>&nbsp;Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face. <A NAME="an_num:22:32">32</A>&nbsp;And the angel of the LORD said unto him: `Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I am come forth for an adversary, because thy way is contrary unto me; <A NAME="an_num:22:33">33</A>&nbsp;and the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times; unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even slain thee, and saved her alive.' <A NAME="an_num:22:34">34</A>&nbsp;And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD: `I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me; now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back.' <A NAME="an_num:22:35">35</A>&nbsp;And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam: `Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak.' So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. <A NAME="an_num:22:36">36</A>&nbsp;And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto Ir-moab, which is on the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border. <A NAME="an_num:22:37">37</A>&nbsp;And Balak said unto Balaam: `Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?' <A NAME="an_num:22:38">38</A>&nbsp;And Balaam said unto Balak:</p>  
<p><a name="page_192"><font size="1" color="green">p. 192</font></A></p>  
<p>`Lo, I am come unto thee; have I now any power at all to speak any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.' <A NAME="an_num:22:39">39</A>&nbsp;And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kiriath-huzoth. <A NAME="an_num:22:40">40</A>&nbsp;And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him. <A NAME="an_num:22:41">41</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the morning that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into Bamoth-baal, and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_num:23:1">1</A>&nbsp;And Balaam said unto Balak: `Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.' <A NAME="an_num:23:2">2</A>&nbsp;And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram. <A NAME="an_num:23:3">3</A>&nbsp;And Balaam said unto Balak: `Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go; peradventure the LORD will come to meet me; and whatsoever He showeth me I will tell thee.' And he went to a bare height. <A NAME="an_num:23:4">4</A>&nbsp;And. God met Balaam; and he said unto Him: `I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. <A NAME="an_num:23:5">5</A>&nbsp;And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said: `Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.' <A NAME="an_num:23:6">6</A>&nbsp;And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab. <A NAME="an_num:23:7">7</A>&nbsp;And he took up his parable, and said:</p>  
<p>From Aram Balak bringeth me,<br> The king of Moab from the mountains of the East:<br> `Come, curse me Jacob,<br> And come, execrate Israel.'<br> <A NAME="an_num:23:8">8</A>&nbsp;How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed?<br> And how shall I execrate, whom the LORD hath not execrated?<br> <A NAME="an_num:23:9">9</A>&nbsp;For from the top of the rocks I see him,<br> And from the hills I behold him:<br> Lo, it is a people that shall dwell alone,<br> And shall not be reckoned among the nations.<br> <A NAME="an_num:23:10">10</A>&nbsp;Who hath counted the dust of Jacob,<br> Or numbered the stock of Israel?<br> Let me die the death of the righteous,<br> And let mine end be like his!</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_num:23:11">11</A>&nbsp;And Balak said unto Balaam: `What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.' <A NAME="an_num:23:12">12</A>&nbsp;And he answered and said: `Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD putteth in my mouth?' <A NAME="an_num:23:13">13</A>&nbsp;And Balak said unto him: `Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all; and curse me them from thence.' <A NAME="an_num:23:14">14</A>&nbsp;And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. <A NAME="an_num:23:15">15</A>&nbsp;And he said unto Balak: `Stand here by thy burnt-offering, while I go toward a meeting yonder.' <A NAME="an_num:23:16">16</A>&nbsp;And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said: `Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.' <A NAME="an_num:23:17">17</A>&nbsp;And he came to him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him: `What hath the LORD spoken?' <A NAME="an_num:23:18">18</A>&nbsp;And he took up his parable, and said:</p>  
<p>Arise, Balak, and hear;<br> Give ear unto me, thou son of Zippor:<br> <A NAME="an_num:23:19">19</A>&nbsp;God is not a man, that He should lie;<br> Neither the son of man, that He should repent: <a name="page_193"><font size="1" color="green">p. 193</font></A><br> When He hath said, will He not do it?<br> Or when He hath spoken, will He not make it good?<br> <A NAME="an_num:23:20">20</A>&nbsp;Behold, I am bidden to bless;<br> And when He hath blessed, I cannot call it back.<br> <A NAME="an_num:23:21">21</A>&nbsp;None hath beheld iniquity in Jacob,<br> Neither hath one seen perverseness in Israel;<br> The LORD his God is with him,<br> And the shouting for the King is among them.<br> <A NAME="an_num:23:22">22</A>&nbsp;God who brought them forth out of Egypt<br> Is for them like the lofty horns of the wild-ox.<br> <A NAME="an_num:23:23">23</A>&nbsp;For there is no enchantment with Jacob,<br> Neither is there any divination with Israel;<br> Now is it said of Jacob and of Israel:<br> `What hath God wrought!'<br> <A NAME="an_num:23:24">24</A>&nbsp;Behold a people that riseth up as a lioness,<br> And as a lion Both he lift himself up;<br> He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey,<br> And drink the blood of the slain. </p>  
<p><A NAME="an_num:23:25">25</A>&nbsp;And Balak said unto Balaam: `Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.' <A NAME="an_num:23:26">26</A>&nbsp;But Balaam answered and said unto Balak: `Told not I thee, saying: All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?' <A NAME="an_num:23:27">27</A>&nbsp;And Balak said unto Balaam: `Come now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.' <A NAME="an_num:23:28">28</A>&nbsp;And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the desert. <A NAME="an_num:23:29">29</A>&nbsp;And Balaam said unto Balak: `Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.' <A NAME="an_num:23:30">30</A>&nbsp;And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.</p>
