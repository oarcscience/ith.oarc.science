### JUDGES CHAPTER 12

<span id="an_jdg:12:1">1</span> And the men of Ephraim were gathered
together, and passed to Zaphon; and they said unto Jephthah: \`Wherefore
didst thou pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst
not call us to go

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

with thee? we will burn thy house upon thee with fire.' <span
id="an_jdg:12:2">2</span> And Jephthah said unto them: \`I and my people
were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you,
ye saved me not out of their hand. <span id="an_jdg:12:3">3</span> And
when I saw that ye saved me not, I put my life in my hand, and passed
over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my
hand; wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against
me?' <span id="an_jdg:12:4">4</span> Then Jephthah gathered together all
the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead smote
Ephraim, because they said: \`Ye are fugitives of Ephraim, ye
Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, and in the midst of Manasseh.'
<span id="an_jdg:12:5">5</span> And the Gileadites took the fords of the
Jordan against the Ephraimites; and it was so, that when any of the
fugitives of Ephraim said: \`Let me go over', the men of Gilead said
unto him: \`Art thou an Ephraimite?' If he said: \`Nay'; <span
id="an_jdg:12:6">6</span> then said they unto him: \`Say now
Shibboleth'; and he said \`Sibboleth'; for he could not frame to
pronounce it right; then they laid hold on him, and slew him at the
fords of the Jordan; and there fell at that time of Ephraim forty and
two thousand.

<span id="an_jdg:12:7">7</span> And Jephthah judged Israel six years.
Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of
Gilead.

<span id="an_jdg:12:8">8</span> And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged
Israel. <span id="an_jdg:12:9">9</span> And he had thirty sons, and
thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from
abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years. <span
id="an_jdg:12:10">10</span> And Ibzan died, and was buried at
Beth-lehem.

<span id="an_jdg:12:11">11</span> And after him Elon the Zebulunite
judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years. <span
id="an_jdg:12:12">12</span> And Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried
in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.

<span id="an_jdg:12:13">13</span> And after him Abdon the son of Hillel
the Pirathonite judged Israel. <span id="an_jdg:12:14">14</span> And he
had forty sons and thirty sons' sons, that rode on threescore and ten
ass colts; and he judged Israel eight years. <span
id="an_jdg:12:15">15</span> And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite
died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the
hill-country of the Amalekites.
