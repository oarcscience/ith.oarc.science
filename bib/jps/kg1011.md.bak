### I Kings Chapter 11

<span id="an_kg1:11:1">1</span> Now king Solomon loved many foreign
women, besides the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites,
Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites; <span
id="an_kg1:11:2">2</span> of the nations concerning which the LORD said
unto the children of Israel: \`Ye shall not go among them, neither shall
they come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart after
their gods'; Solomon did cleave unto these in love. <span
id="an_kg1:11:3">3</span> And he had seven hundred wives, princesses,
and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart. <span
id="an_kg1:11:4">4</span> For it came to pass, when Solomon. was old,
that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was
not whole with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.
<span id="an_kg1:11:5">5</span> For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the
goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the detestation of the
Ammonites. <span id="an_kg1:11:6">6</span> And Solomon did that which
was evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as
did David his father. <span id="an_kg1:11:7">7</span> Then did Solomon
build a high place for Chemosh the detestation of Moab, in the mount
that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the detestation of the children
of Ammon. <span id="an_kg1:11:8">8</span> And so did he for all his
foreign wives, who offered and sacrificed unto their gods.

<span id="page_420">p. 420</span>

<span id="an_kg1:11:9">9</span> And the LORD was angry with Solomon,
because his heart was turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who
had appeared unto him twice, <span id="an_kg1:11:10">10</span> and had
commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other
gods; but he kept not that which the LORD commanded. <span
id="an_kg1:11:11">11</span> Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon:
\`Forasmuch as this hath been in thy mind, and thou hast not kept My
covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely
rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant. <span
id="an_kg1:11:12">12</span> Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do
it, for David thy father's sake; but I will rend it out of the hand of
thy son. <span id="an_kg1:11:13">13</span> Howbeit I will not rend away
all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to thy sou, for David My
servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.'

<span id="an_kg1:11:14">14</span> And the LORD raised up an adversary
unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was of the king's seed in Edom.
<span id="an_kg1:11:16">16</span> For it came to pass, when David was in
Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain,
and had smitten every male in Edom—<span id="an_kg1:11:16">16</span> for
Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off
every male in Edom—<span id="an_kg1:11:17">17</span> that  <span
id="fr_143"></span>[a](#fn_139.md) Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of
his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a
little child. <span id="an_kg1:11:18">18</span> And they arose out of
Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and
they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house,
and appointed him victuals and gave him land. <span
id="an_kg1:11:19">19</span> And Hadad found great favour in the sight of
Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the
sister of Tahpenes the queen. <span id="an_kg1:11:20">20</span> And the
sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in
Pharaoh's house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh's house among the sons of
Pharaoh. <span id="an_kg1:11:21">21</span> And when Hadad heard in Egypt
that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host
was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh: 'Let me depart, that I may go to mine
own country.' <span id="an_kg1:11:22">22</span> Then Pharaoh said unto
him: \`But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to
go to thine own country?' And he answered: \`Nothing; howbeit let me
depart in any wise.'

<span id="an_kg1:11:23">23</span> And God raised up another adversary
unto him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer
king of Zobah. <span id="an_kg1:11:24">24</span> And he gathered men
unto him, and became captain over a troop, when David slew them \[of
Zobah\]; and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in
Damascus. <span id="an_kg1:11:25">25</span> And he was an adversary to
Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did; and
he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Aram.

<span id="an_kg1:11:26">26</span> And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an
Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was
Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king. <span
id="an_kg1:11:27">27</span> And this was the cause that he lifted up his
hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of
the city of David his father. <span id="an_kg1:11:28">28</span> And the
man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour; and Solomon saw the young man
that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labour of
the house of Joseph. <span id="an_kg1:11:29">29</span> And it came to
pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet
Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now Ahijah

<span id="page_421">p. 421</span>

had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the
field. <span id="an_kg1:11:30">30</span> And Ahijah laid hold of the new
garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces. <span
id="an_kg1:11:31">31</span> And he said to Jeroboam: \`Take thee ten
pieces; for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Behold, I will rend
the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to
thee—<span id="an_kg1:11:32">32</span> but he shall have one tribe, for
My servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have
chosen out of all the tribes of Israel—<span
id="an_kg1:11:33">33</span> because that they have forsaken Me, and have
worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of
Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have not
walked in My ways, to do that which is right in Mine eyes, and to keep
My statutes and Mine ordinances, as did David his father. <span
id="an_kg1:11:34">34</span> Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom
out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life,
for David My servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept My
commandments and My statutes; <span id="an_kg1:11:35">35</span> but I
will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee,
even ten tribes. <span id="an_kg1:11:36">36</span> And unto his son will
I give one tribe, that David My servant may have a lamp alway before Me
in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen Me to put My name there.
<span id="an_kg1:11:37">37</span> And I will take thee, and thou shalt
reign over all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.
<span id="an_kg1:11:38">38</span> And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken
unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in My ways, and do that
which is right in Mine eyes, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as
David My servant did, that I will be with thee, and will build thee a
sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee. <span
id="an_kg1:11:39">39</span> And I will for this afflict the seed of
David, but not for ever.'

<span id="an_kg1:11:40">40</span> Solomon sought therefore to kill
Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of
Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.

<span id="an_kg1:11:41">41</span> Now the rest of the acts of Solomon,
and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of
the acts of Solomon? <span id="an_kg1:11:42">42</span> And the time that
Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. <span
id="an_kg1:11:43">43</span> And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was
buried in the city of David his father; and Rehoboam his son reigned in
his stead.
