### DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER 22

<span id="an_deu:22:1">1</span> Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or
his sheep driven away, and hide thyself from them; thou shalt surely
bring them back unto thy brother. <span id="an_deu:22:2">2</span> And if
thy brother be not nigh unto thee, and thou know him not, then thou
shalt bring it home to thy house, and it shall be with thee until thy
brother require it, and thou shalt restore it to him. <span
id="an_deu:22:3">3</span> And so shalt thou do with his ass; and so
shalt thou do, with his garment; and so shalt thou do with every lost
thing of thy brother's, which he hath lost, and thou hast found; thou
mayest not hide thyself.

<span id="an_deu:22:4">4</span> Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or
his ox fallen down by the way, and hide thyself from them; thou shalt
surely help him to lift them up again.

<span id="an_deu:22:5">5</span> A woman shall not wear that which
pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment; for
whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto the LORD thy God.

<span id="an_deu:22:6">6</span> If a bird's nest chance to be before
thee in the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs,
and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not
take the dam with the young; <span id="an_deu:22:7">7</span> thou shalt
in any wise let the dam go, but the young thou mayest take unto thyself;
that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days.

<span id="an_deu:22:8">8</span> When thou buildest a new house, then
thou shalt make a parapet for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon
thy house, if any man fall from thence..

<span id="an_deu:22:9">9</span> Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with two
kinds of seed; lest the fulness of the seed which thou hast sown be
forfeited together with the increase of the vineyard.

<span id="an_deu:22:10">10</span> Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an
ass together. <span id="an_deu:22:11">11</span> Thou shalt not wear a
mingled stuff, wool and linen together.

<span id="an_deu:22:12">12</span> Thou shalt make thee twisted cords
upon the four corners of thy covering, wherewith thou coverest thyself.

<span id="an_deu:22:13">13</span> If any man take a wife, and go in unto
her, and hate her, <span id="an_deu:22:14">14</span> and lay wanton
charges against her, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say:

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \`I took this
woman, and when I came nigh to her, I found not in her the tokens of
virginity'; <span id="an_deu:22:15">15</span> then shall the father of
the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the
damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate. <span
id="an_deu:22:16">16</span> And the damsel's father shall say unto the
elders: \`I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;
<span id="an_deu:22:17">17</span> and, lo, he hath laid wanton charges,
saying: I found not in thy daughter the tokens of virginity; and yet
these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity.' And they shall spread
the garment before the elders of the city. <span
id="an_deu:22:18">18</span> And the elders of that city shall take the
man and chastise him. <span id="an_deu:22:19">19</span> And they shall
fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of
the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of
Israel; and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.

<span id="an_deu:22:20">20</span> But if this thing be true, that the
tokens of virginity were not found in the damsel; <span
id="an_deu:22:21">21</span> then they shall bring out the damsel to the
door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with
stones that she die; because she hath wrought a wanton deed in Israel,
to play the harlot in her father's house; so shalt thou put away the
evil from the midst of thee.

<span id="an_deu:22:22">22</span> If a man be found lying with a woman
married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, the man that lay
with the woman, and the woman; so shalt thou put away the evil from
Israel.

<span id="an_deu:22:23">23</span> If there be a damsel that is a virgin
betrothed unto a man, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;
<span id="an_deu:22:24">24</span> then ye shall bring them both out unto
the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they
die: the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man,
because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife; so thou shalt put away the
evil from the midst of thee.

<span id="an_deu:22:25">25</span> But if the man find the damsel that is
betrothed in the field, and the man take hold of her, and lie with her;
then the man only that lay with her shall die. <span
id="an_deu:22:26">26</span> But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing;
there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death; for as when a man riseth
against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter. <span
id="an_deu:22:27">27</span> For he found her in the field; the betrothed
damsel cried, and there was none to save her.

<span id="an_deu:22:28">28</span> If a man find a damsel that is a
virgin, that is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her,
and they be found; <span id="an_deu:22:29">29</span> then the man that
lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty shekels of
silver, and she shall be his wife, because he hath humbled her; he may
not put her away all his days.
