### JOSHUA CHAPTER 2

<span id="an_jos:2:1">1</span> And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of
Shittim two spies secretly, saying: 'Go view the land, and Jericho.' And
they went, and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and
lay there. <span id="an_jos:2:2">2</span> And it was told the king of
Jericho, saying: 'Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the
children of Israel to search out the land.' <span
id="an_jos:2:3">3</span> And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab,
saying: 'Bring forth the men that are come to thee, that are entered
into thy house; for they are come to search out all the land.' <span
id="an_jos:2:4">4</span> And the woman took the two men, and hid them;
and she said: 'Yea, the men came unto me, but I knew not whence they
were; <span id="an_jos:2:5">5</span> and it came to pass about the time
of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out;
whither the men went I know not; pursue after them quickly; for ye shall
overtake them. <span id="an_jos:2:6">6</span> But she had brought them
up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had
spread out upon the roof. <span id="an_jos:2:7">7</span> And the men
pursued after them the way to the Jordan unto the fords; and as soon as
they that pursued after them were gone out, the gate was shut. <span
id="an_jos:2:8">8</span> And before they were laid down, she came up
unto them upon the roof; <span id="an_jos:2:9">9</span> and she said
unto the men: 'I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that
your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land
melt away before you. <span id="an_jos:2:10">10</span> For we have heard
how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when ye came
out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that
were beyond the Jordan, unto Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.
<span id="an_jos:2:11">11</span> And as soon as we had heard it, our
hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man,
because of you; for the LORD your God, He is God in heaven above, and on
earth beneath. <span id="an_jos:2:12">12</span> Now therefore, I pray
you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have dealt kindly with you, that
ye also will deal kindly with my father's house—and give me a true token
<span id="an_jos:2:13">13</span> and save alive my father, and my
mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and
deliver our lives from death.' <span id="an_jos:2:14">14</span> And the
men said unto her: 'Our life for yours, if ye tell not this our
business; and it shall be, when the LORD giveth us the land, that we
will deal kindly and truly with thee.' <span
id="an_jos:2:15">15</span> Then she let them down by a cord through the
window; for her house was upon the side of the wall, and she dwelt upon
the wall. <span id="an_jos:2:16">16</span> And she said unto them: 'Get
you to the mountain, lest the pursuers light upon you; and hide
yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned; and
afterward may ye go your way.' <span id="an_jos:2:17">17</span> And the
men said unto her: 'We will be guiltless of this thine oath which thou
hast made us to swear. <span id="an_jos:2:18">18</span> Behold, when we
come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the
window which thou didst let us down by; and thou shalt gather unto thee
into the house thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy
father's household. <span id="an_jos:2:19">19</span> And it shall be,
that whosoever

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall
be upon his head, and we will be guiltless; and whosoever shall be with
thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon
him. <span id="an_jos:2:20">20</span> But if thou utter this our
business, then we will be guiltless of thine oath which thou hast made
us to swear.' <span id="an_jos:2:21">21</span> And she said: 'According
unto your words, so be it.' And she sent them away, and they departed;
and she bound the scarlet line in the window. <span
id="an_jos:2:22">22</span> And they went, and came unto the mountain,
and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned; and the
pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not. <span
id="an_jos:2:23">23</span> Then the two men returned, and descended from
the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and
they told him all that had befallen them. <span
id="an_jos:2:24">24</span> And they said unto Joshua: 'Truly the LORD
hath delivered into our hands all the land; and moreover all the
inhabitants of the land do melt away before us.'
