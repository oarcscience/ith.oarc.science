### II SAMUEL CHAPTER 17

<span id="an_sa2:17:1">1</span>  Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom:
\`Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue
after David this night; <span id="an_sa2:17:2">2</span>  and I will come
upon him while

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid; and all the
people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only;
<span id="an_sa2:17:3">3</span>  and I will bring back all the people
unto thee; when all shall have returned, \[save\] the man whom thou
seekest, all the people will be in peace.' <span
id="an_sa2:17:4">4</span>  And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all
the elders of Israel.

<span id="an_sa2:17:5">5</span>  Then said Absalom: \`Call now Hushai
the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.' <span
id="an_sa2:17:6">6</span>  And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom
spoke unto him, saying: \`Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner;
shall we do after his saying? if not, speak thou.' <span
id="an_sa2:17:7">7</span>  And Hushai said unto Absalom: \`The counsel
that Ahithophel hath given this time is not good.' <span
id="an_sa2:17:8">8</span>  Hushai said moreover: \`Thou knowest thy
father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are embittered in
their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and thy father
is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people. <span
id="an_sa2:17:9">9</span>  Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some
place; and it will come to pass, when they fall upon them at the first,
and whosoever heareth it shall say: There is a slaughter among the
people that follow Absalom; <span id="an_sa2:17:10">10</span>  then even
he that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly
melt; for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they
that are with him are valiant men. <span id="an_sa2:17:11">11</span> 
But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together unto thee, from Dan
even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and
that thou go to battle in thine own person. <span
id="an_sa2:17:12">12</span>  So shall we come upon him in some place
where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth
on the ground; and of him and of all the men that are with him we will
not leave so much as one. <span id="an_sa2:17:13">13</span>  Moreover,
if he withdraw himself into a city, then shall all Israel bring up ropes
to that city, and we will draw it into the valley until there be not one
small stone found there.' <span id="an_sa2:17:14">14</span>  And Absalom
and all the men of Israel said: \`The counsel of Hushai the Archite is
better than the counsel of Ahithophel.'—For the LORD had ordained to
defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might
bring evil upon Absalom.

<span id="an_sa2:17:15">15</span>  Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to
Abiathar the priests: \`Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and
the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled. <span
id="an_sa2:17:16">16</span>  Now therefore send quickly, and tell David,
saying: Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but in any
wise pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that
are with him.' <span id="an_sa2:17:17">17</span>  Now Jonathan and
Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; and a maid-servant used to go and tell them;
and they went and told king David; for they might not be seen to come
into the city. <span id="an_sa2:17:18">18</span>  But a lad saw them,
and told Absalom; and they went both of them away quickly, and came to
the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they
went down thither. <span id="an_sa2:17:19">19</span>  And the woman took
and spread the covering over the well's mouth, and strewed groats
thereon; and nothing was known. <span id="an_sa2:17:20">20</span>  And
Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house; and they said:
\`Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?' And the woman said unto them: \`They
are gone over the brook of water.' And when they had sought and could

<span id="page_388">p. 388</span>

not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_sa2:17:21">21</span>  And it came to pass, after they were
departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king
David; and they said unto David: \`Arise ye, and pass quickly over the
water; for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.' <span
id="an_sa2:17:22">22</span>  Then David arose, and all the people that
were with him, and they passed over the Jordan; by the morning light
there lacked not one of them that was not gone over the Jordan.

<span id="an_sa2:17:23">23</span>  And when Ahithophel saw that his
counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and got him
home, unto his city, and set his house in order, and strangled himself;
and he died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.

<span id="an_sa2:17:24">24</span>  When David was come to Mahanaim,
Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
<span id="an_sa2:17:25">25</span>  And Absalom had set Amasa over the
host instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was
Ithra the Jesraelite, that went in to Abigal the daughter of Nahash,
sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother. <span id="an_sa2:17:26">26</span>  And
Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.

<span id="an_sa2:17:27">27</span>  And it came to pass, when David was
come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children
of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the
Gileadite of Rogelim, <span id="an_sa2:17:28">28</span>  brought beds,
and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and
parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and parched pulse, <span
id="an_sa2:17:29">29</span>  and honey, and curd, and sheep, and cheese
of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat; for
they said: \`The people [are](errata.htm#8.md) hungry, and faint, and
thirsty, in the wilderness.'
