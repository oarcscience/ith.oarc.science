### GENESIS CHAPTER 11

<span id="an_gen:11:1">1</span> And the whole earth was of one language
and of one speech. <span id="an_gen:11:2">2</span> And it came to pass,
as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar;
and they dwelt there. <span id="an_gen:11:3">3</span> And they said one
to another: 'Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly.' And
they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. <span
id="an_gen:11:4">4</span> And they said: 'Come, let us build us a city,
and a tower, with its top in heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we
be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.' <span
id="an_gen:11:5">5</span> And the LORD came down to see the city and the
tower, which the children of men builded. <span
id="an_gen:11:6">6</span> And the LORD said: 'Behold, they are one
people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to
do; and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to
do. <span id="an_gen:11:7">7</span> Come, let us go down, and there
confound their language, that they may not understand one another's
speech.' <span id="an_gen:11:8">8</span> So the LORD scattered them
abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth; and they left off to
build the city. <span id="an_gen:11:9">9</span> Therefore was the name
of it called Babel; because the LORD did there  <span
id="fr_17"></span>[a](#fn_16) confound the language of all the earth;
and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all
the earth.

<span id="an_gen:11:10">10</span> These are the generations of Shem.
Shem was a hundred years old, and begot Arpachshad two years after the
flood. <span id="an_gen:11:11">11</span> And Shem lived after he begot
Arpachshad five hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.

<span id="an_gen:11:12">12</span> And Arpachshad lived five and thirty
years, and begot Shelah. <span id="an_gen:11:13">13</span> And
Arpachshad lived after he begot Shelah four hundred and three years, and
begot sons and daughters.

<span id="an_gen:11:14">14</span> And Shelah lived thirty years, and
begot Eber. <span id="an_gen:11:15">15</span> And Shelah lived after he
begot Eber four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.

<span id="an_gen:11:16">16</span> And Eber lived four and thirty years,
and begot Peleg. <span id="an_gen:11:17">17</span> And Eber lived after
he begot Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and
daughters.

<span id="an_gen:11:18">18</span> And Peleg lived thirty years, and
begot Reu. <span id="an_gen:11:19">19</span> And Peleg lived after he
begot Reu two hundred and nine years, and begot sons and daughters.

<span id="an_gen:11:20">20</span> And Reu lived two and thirty years,
and begot Serug. <span id="an_gen:11:21">21</span> And Reu lived after
he begot Serug two hundred and seven years, and begot sons and
daughters.

<span id="an_gen:11:22">22</span> And Serug lived thirty years, and
begot Nahor. <span id="an_gen:11:23">23</span> And Serug lived after he
begot Nahor two hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.

<span id="an_gen:11:24">24</span> And Nahor lived nine and twenty years,
and begot Terah. <span id="an_gen:11:25">25</span> And Nahor lived after
he begot Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begot sons and
daughters.

<span id="an_gen:11:26">26</span> And Terah lived seventy years, and
begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

<span id="an_gen:11:27">27</span> Now these are the generations of
Terah. Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begot Lot. <span
id="an_gen:11:28">28</span> And Haran died in the presence of his father
Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. <span
id="an_gen:11:29">29</span> And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the
name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah,
the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
<span id="an_gen:11:30">30</span> And Sarai was barren; she had no
child. <span id="an_gen:11:31">31</span> And Terah took Abram his <span
id="page_14">p. 14</span> son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son,
and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth
with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and
they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. <span
id="an_gen:11:32">32</span> And the days of Terah were two hundred and
five years; and Terah died in Haran.
