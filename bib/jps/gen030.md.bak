### GENESIS CHAPTER 30

<span id="an_gen:30:1">1</span> And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob
no children, Rachel envied her sister; and she said unto Jacob: 'Give me
children, or else I die.' <span id="an_gen:30:2">2</span> And Jacob's
anger was kindled against Rachel; and he said: 'Am I in God's stead, who
hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?' <span
id="an_gen:30:3">3</span> And she said: 'Behold my maid <span
id="page_36">p. 36</span> Bilhah, go in unto her; that she may bear upon
my knees, and I also may be builded up through her.' <span
id="an_gen:30:4">4</span> And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife;
and Jacob went in unto her. <span id="an_gen:30:5">5</span> And Bilhah
conceived, and bore Jacob a son. <span id="an_gen:30:6">6</span> And
Rachel said: 'God hath  <span id="fr_40"></span>[a](#fn_39.md) judged me,
and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son.' Therefore called
she his name Dan. <span id="an_gen:30:7">7</span> And Bilhah Rachel's
handmaid conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son. <span
id="an_gen:30:8">8</span> And Rachel said: 'With mighty wrestlings have
I  <span id="fr_41"></span>[b](#fn_40.md) wrestled with my sister, and have
prevailed.' And she called his name Naphtali. <span
id="an_gen:30:9">9</span> When Leah saw that she had left off bearing,
she took Zilpah her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob to wife. <span
id="an_gen:30:10">10</span> And Zilpah Leah's handmaid bore Jacob a son.
<span id="an_gen:30:11">11</span> And Leah said: 'Fortune is come!' And
she called his name  <span id="fr_42"></span>[c](#fn_41.md) Gad. <span
id="an_gen:30:12">12</span> And Zilpah Leah's handmaid bore Jacob a
second son. <span id="an_gen:30:13">13</span> And Leah said: 'Happy am
I! for the daughters will call me happy.' And she called his name  <span
id="fr_43"></span>[d](#fn_42.md) Asher. <span
id="an_gen:30:14">14</span> And Reuben went in the days of wheat
harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his
mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah: 'Give me, I pray thee, of thy
son's mandrakes.' <span id="an_gen:30:15">15</span> And she said unto
her: 'Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband? and
wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also?' And Rachel said:
'Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son's mandrakes.'
<span id="an_gen:30:16">16</span> And Jacob came from the field in the
evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said: 'Thou must come in
unto me; for I have surely hired thee with my son's mandrakes.' And he
lay with her that night. <span id="an_gen:30:17">17</span> And God
hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son.
<span id="an_gen:30:18">18</span> And Leah said: 'God hath given me my
 <span id="fr_44"></span>[e](#fn_43.md) hire, because I gave my handmaid to
my husband.' And she called his name Issachar. <span
id="an_gen:30:19">19</span> And Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth
son to Jacob. <span id="an_gen:30:20">20</span> And Leah said: 'God hath
endowed me with a good dowry; now will my husband  <span
id="fr_45"></span>[f](#fn_44.md) dwell with me, because I have borne him
six sons.' And she called his name Zebulun. <span
id="an_gen:30:21">21</span> And afterwards she bore a daughter, and
called her name Dinah. <span id="an_gen:30:22">22</span> And God
remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb. <span
id="an_gen:30:23">23</span> And she conceived, and bore a son, and said:
'God  <span id="fr_46"></span>[g](#fn_45.md) hath taken away my reproach.'
<span id="an_gen:30:24">24</span> And she called his name Joseph,
saying: 'The LORD  <span id="fr_47"></span>[h](#fn_46.md) add to me another
son.'

<span id="an_gen:30:25">25</span> And it came to pass, when Rachel had
borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban: 'Send me away, that I may go
unto mine own place, and to my country. <span
id="an_gen:30:26">26</span> Give me my wives and my children for whom I
have served thee, and let me go; for thou knowest my service wherewith I
have served thee.' <span id="an_gen:30:27">27</span> And Laban said unto
him: 'If now I have found favour in thine eyes—I have observed the
signs, and the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.' <span
id="an_gen:30:28">28</span> And he said: 'Appoint me thy wages, and I
will give it.' <span id="an_gen:30:29">29</span> And he said unto him:
'Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle have fared with
me. <span id="an_gen:30:30">30</span> For it was little which thou hadst
before I came, and it hath increased abundantly; and the LORD hath
blessed thee whithersoever I turned. And now when shall I provide for
mine own house also?' <span id="an_gen:30:31">31</span> And he said:
'What shall I give thee?' And Jacob said: 'Thou shalt not give me aught;
if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep
it. <span id="an_gen:30:32">32</span> I will pass through all thy flock
to-day, removing <span id="page_37">p. 37</span> from thence every
speckled and spotted one, and every dark one among the sheep, and the
spotted and speckled among the goats; and of such shall be my hire.
<span id="an_gen:30:33">33</span> So shall my righteousness witness
against me hereafter, when thou shalt come to look over my hire that is
before thee: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats,
and dark among the sheep, that if found with me shall be counted
stolen.' <span id="an_gen:30:34">34</span> And Laban said: 'Behold,
would it might be according to thy word.' <span
id="an_gen:30:35">35</span> And he removed that day the he-goats that
were streaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and
spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the dark ones among the
sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons. <span
id="an_gen:30:36">36</span> And he set three days’ journey betwixt
himself and Jacob. And Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks. <span
id="an_gen:30:37">37</span> And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and
of the almond and of the plane-tree; and peeled white streaks in them,
making the white appear which was in the rods. <span
id="an_gen:30:38">38</span> And he set the rods which he had peeled over
against the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the
flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink. <span
id="an_gen:30:39">39</span> And the flocks conceived at the sight of the
rods, and the flocks brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted.
<span id="an_gen:30:40">40</span> And Jacob separated the lambs—he also
set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the dark in the
flock of Laban—and put his own droves apart, and put them not unto
Laban's flock. <span id="an_gen:30:41">41</span> And it came to pass,
whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that Jacob laid the
rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might
conceive among the rods; <span id="an_gen:30:42">42</span> but when the
flock were feeble, he put them not in; so the feebler were Laban's, and
the stronger Jacob's. <span id="an_gen:30:43">43</span> And the man
increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maidservants and
men-servants, and camels and asses.
