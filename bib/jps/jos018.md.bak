### JOSHUA CHAPTER 18

<span id="an_jos:18:1">1</span> And the whole congregation of the
children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set up
the tent of meeting there; and the land was subdued before them. <span
id="an_jos:18:2">2</span> And there remained among the children of
Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance. <span
id="an_jos:18:3">3</span> And Joshua said unto the children of Israel:
'How long are ye slack to go in to possess the land, which the LORD, the
God of your fathers, hath given you? <span
id="an_jos:18:4">4</span> Appoint for you three men for each tribe; and
I will send them, and they shall arise, and walk through the land, and
describe it according to their inheritance; and they shall come unto me.
<span id="an_jos:18:5">5</span> And they shall divide it into seven
portions: Judah shall abide in his border on the south, and the house of
Joseph shall abide in their border on the north. <span
id="an_jos:18:6">6</span> And ye shall describe the land into seven
portions, and bring the description hither to me; and I will cast lots
for you here before the LORD our God. <span
id="an_jos:18:7">7</span> For the Levites have no portion among you, for
the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance; and Gad and Reuben and
the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the
Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.'

<span id="an_jos:18:8">8</span> And the men arose, and went; and Joshua
charged them that went to describe the land, saying: 'Go and walk
through the land, and describe it, and come back to me, and I will cast
lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh.' <span
id="an_jos:18:9">9</span> And the men went and passed through the land,
and described it by cities into seven portions in a book, and they came
to Joshua unto the camp at Shiloh. <span id="an_jos:18:10">10</span> And
Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD; and there Joshua
divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their
divisions.

<span id="an_jos:18:11">11</span> And the lot of the tribe of the
children of Benjamin came up according to their families; and the border
of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of
Joseph. <span id="an_jos:18:12">12</span> And their border on the north
side was from the Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho
on the north, and went up through the hill-country westward; and the
goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth-aven. <span
id="an_jos:18:13">13</span> And the border passed along from thence to
Luz, to the side of Luz—the same is Beth-el—southward; and the border
went down to Atroth-addar, by the mountain that lieth on the south of
Beth-horon the nether. <span id="an_jos:18:14">14</span> And the border
was drawn and turned about on the west side southward, from the mountain
that lieth before Beth-horon southward; and the goings out thereof were
at Kiriath-baal—the same is Kiriath-jearim—a city of the children of
Judah; this was the west side. <span id="an_jos:18:15">15</span> And the
south side was from the uttermost part of Kiriath-jearim, and the border
went out westward, and went out to the fountain of the waters of
Nephtoah. <span id="an_jos:18:16">16</span> And the border went

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

down to the uttermost part of the mountain that lieth before the Valley
of the son of Hinnom, which is in the vale of Rephaim northward; and it
went down to the Valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite
southward, and went down to En-rogel. <span
id="an_jos:18:17">17</span> And it was drawn on the north, and went out
at En-shemesh, and went out to Geliloth, which is over against the
ascent of Adummim; and it went down to the Stone of Bohan the son of
Reuben. <span id="an_jos:18:18">18</span> And it passed along to the
side over against the Arabah northward, and went down unto the Arabah.
<span id="an_jos:18:19">19</span> And the border passed along to the
side of Beth-hoglah northward; and the goings out of the border were at
the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan; this was
the south border. <span id="an_jos:18:20">20</span> And the Jordan was
to be the border of it on the east side. This was the inheritance of the
children of Benjamin, by the borders thereof round about, according to
their families.

<span id="an_jos:18:21">21</span> Now the cities of the tribe of the
children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and
Bethhoglah, and Emek-keziz; <span id="an_jos:18:22">22</span> and
Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Beth-el; <span
id="an_jos:18:23">23</span> and Avvim, and Parah, and Ophrah; <span
id="an_jos:18:24">24</span> and Chephar-ammonah, and Ophni, and Geba;
twelve cities with their villages: <span
id="an_jos:18:25">25</span> Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth; <span
id="an_jos:18:26">26</span> and Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah; <span
id="an_jos:18:27">27</span> and Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah; <span
id="an_jos:18:28">28</span> and Zela, Eleph, and the Jebusite—the same
is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages.
This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their
families.
