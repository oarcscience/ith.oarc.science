And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. <A NAME="an_gen:11:4">4</A>&nbsp;And they said: 'Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, with its top in heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.' <A NAME="an_gen:11:5">5</A>&nbsp;And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. <A NAME="an_gen:11:6">6</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said: 'Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do; and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do. <A NAME="an_gen:11:7">7</A>&nbsp;Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.' <A NAME="an_gen:11:8">8</A>&nbsp;So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth; and they left off to build the city. <A NAME="an_gen:11:9">9</A>&nbsp;Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>
confound the language of all the earth; and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.</p>
