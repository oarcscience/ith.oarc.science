### NUMBERS CHAPTER 9

<span id="an_num:9:1">1</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses in the
wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they
were come out of the land of Egypt, saying: <span
id="an_num:9:2">2</span> \`Let the children of Israel keep the passover
in its appointed season. <span id="an_num:9:3">3</span> In the
fourteenth day of this month, at dusk, ye shall keep it in its appointed
season; according to all the statutes of it, and according to all the
ordinances thereof, shall ye keep it.' <span
id="an_num:9:4">4</span> And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel,
that they should keep the passover. <span id="an_num:9:5">5</span> And
they kept the passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the
month, at dusk, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the
LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel. <span
id="an_num:9:6">6</span> But there were certain men, who were unclean by
the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that
day; and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day. <span
id="an_num:9:7">7</span> And those men said unto him: \`We are unclean
by the dead body of a man; wherefore are we to be kept back, so as not
to bring the offering of the LORD in its appointed season among the
children of Israel?' <span id="an_num:9:8">8</span> And Moses said unto
them: \`Stay ye, that I may hear what the LORD will command concerning
you.'

<span id="an_num:9:9">9</span> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<span id="an_num:9:10">10</span> \`Speak unto the children of Israel,
saying: If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by
reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep
the passover unto the LORD; <span id="an_num:9:11">11</span> in the
second month on the fourteenth day at dusk they shall keep it; they
shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs; <span
id="an_num:9:12">12</span> they shall leave none of it unto the morning,
nor break a bone thereof; according to all the statute of the passover
they shall keep it. <span id="an_num:9:13">13</span> But the man that is
clean, and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover,
that soul shall be cut off from his people; because he brought not the
offering of the LORD in its appointed season, that man shall bear his
sin. <span id="an_num:9:14">14</span> And if a stranger shall sojourn
among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD: according to the
statute of the passover, and according to the ordinance thereof, so
shall he do; ye shall have one statute, both for the stranger, and for
him that is born in the land.'

 

<span id="an_num:9:15">15</span> And on the day that the tabernacle was
reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the
testimony; and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the s
appearance of fire, until morning. <span id="an_num:9:16">16</span> So
it was alway: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.
<span id="an_num:9:17">17</span> And whenever the cloud was taken up
from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel journeyed;
and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel
encamped. <span id="an_num:9:18">18</span> At the commandment of the
LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the
LORD they encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they
remained encamped. <span id="an_num:9:19">19</span> And when the cloud
tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept
the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not. <span
id="an_num:9:20">20</span> And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon
the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

LORD they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of the
LORD they journeyed. <span id="an_num:9:21">21</span> And sometimes the
cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in
the morning, they journeyed; or if it continued by day and by night,
when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed. <span
id="an_num:9:22">22</span> Whether it were two days, or a month, or a
year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding thereon, the
children of Israel remained encamped, and journeyed not; but when it was
taken up, they journeyed. <span id="an_num:9:23">23</span> At the
commandment of the LORD they encamped, and at the commandment of the
LORD they journeyed; they kept the charge of the LORD, at the
commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
