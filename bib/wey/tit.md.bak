### Weymouth New Testament: Titus

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, a bondservant of God and an Apostle
of Jesus Christ for building up the faith of God's own people and
spreading a full knowledge of the truths of religion,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> in hope of the Life of the Ages which God,
who is never false to His word, promised before the commencement of the
Ages.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> And at the appointed time He clearly made
known His Message in the preaching with which I was entrusted by the
command of God our Saviour:

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> To Titus my own true child in our common
faith. May grace and peace be granted to you from God the Father and
Christ Jesus our Saviour.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> I have left you behind in Crete in order
that you may set right the things which still require attention, and
appoint Elders in every town, as I directed you to do;

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> wherever there is a man of blameless life,
true to his one wife, having children who are themselves believers and
are free from every reproach of profligacy or of stubborn self-will.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> For, as God's steward, a minister must be
of blameless life, not over-fond of having his own way, not a man of a
passionate temper nor a hard drinker, not given to blows nor greedy of
gain,

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> but hospitable to strangers, a lover of
goodness, sober-minded, upright, saintly, self-controlled;

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> holding fast to the faithful Message which
he has received, so that he may be well qualified both to encourage
others with sound teaching and to reply successfully to opponents.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> For there are many that spurn
authority--idle, talkative and deceitful persons, who, for the most
part, are adherents of the Circumcision.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> You must stop the mouths of such men, for
they overthrow the faith of whole families, teaching what they ought
not, just for the sake of making money.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> One of their own number--a Prophet who is
a countryman of theirs--has said, "Cretans are always liars, dangerous
animals, idle gluttons."

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> This testimony is true. Therefore sternly
denounce them, that they may be robust in their faith,

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> and not give attention to Jewish legends
and the maxims of men who turn their backs on the truth.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> To the pure everything is pure; but to
the polluted and unbelieving nothing is pure, but on the contrary their
very minds and consciences are polluted.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> They profess to know God; but in their
actions they disown Him, and are detestable and disobedient men, and for
any good work are utterly useless.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> But as for you, you must speak in a manner
that befits wholesome teaching.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> Exhort aged men to be temperate, grave,
sober-minded, robust in their faith, their love and their patience.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> In the same way exhort aged women to let
their conduct be such as becomes consecrated persons. They must not be
slanderers nor enslaved to wine-drinking. They must be teachers of what
is right.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> They should school the young women to be
affectionate to their husbands and to their children, to be
sober-minded, pure in their lives,

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> industrious in their homes, kind,
submissive to their husbands, so that the Christian teaching may not be
exposed to reproach.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> In the same way exhort the younger men to
be discreet,

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> and above all make your own life a pattern
of right conduct, having in your teaching no taint of insincerity, but a
serious tone,

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> and healthy language which no one can
censure, so that our opponents may feel ashamed at having nothing evil
to say against us.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Exhort slaves to be always obedient to
their owners, and to give them satisfaction in everything, not
contradicting and not pilfering,

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> but manifesting perfect fidelity and kind
feeling, in order to bring honour to the teaching of our Saviour, God,
in all things.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> For the grace of God has displayed itself
with healing power to all mankind,

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> training us to renounce ungodliness and
all the pleasures of this world, and to live sober, upright, and pious
lives at the present time,

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> in expectation of the fulfilment of our
blessed hope--the Appearing in glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus
Christ;

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> who gave Himself for us to purchase our
freedom from all iniquity, and purify for Himself a people who should be
specially His own, zealous for doing good works.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> Thus speak, exhort, reprove, with all
impressiveness. Let no one make light of your authority.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Remind people that they must submit to the
rulers who are in authority over them; that they must obey the
magistrates, be prepared for every right action,

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> not speak evil of any one, nor be
contentious, but yield unselfishly to others and constantly manifest a
forgiving spirit towards all men.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> For there was a time when we also were
deficient in understanding, obstinate, deluded, the slaves of various
cravings and pleasures, spending our lives in malice and envy, hateful
ourselves and hating one another.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> But when the goodness of God our Saviour,
and His love to man, dawned upon us, not in consequence of things which
we,

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> as righteous men, had done, but as the
result of His own mercy He saved us by means of the bath of regeneration
and the renewal of our natures by the Holy Spirit,

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> which He poured out on us richly through
Jesus Christ our Saviour;

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> in order that having been declared
righteous through His grace we might become heirs to the Life of the
Ages in fulfilment of our hopes.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> This is a faithful saying, and on these
various points I would have you insist strenuously, in order that those
who have their faith fixed on God may be careful to set an example of
good actions. For these are not only good in themselves, but are also
useful to mankind.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> But hold yourself aloof from foolish
controversies and pedigrees and discussions and wrangling about the Law,
for they are useless and vain.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> After a first and second admonition, have
nothing further to do with any one who will not be taught;

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> for, as you know, a man of that
description has turned aside from the right path and is a sinner
self-condemned.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> After I have sent Artemas or Tychicus to
you, lose no time in joining me at Nicopolis; for I have decided to pass
the winter there.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Help Zenas the lawyer forward on his
journey with special care, and Apollos, so that they may have all they
require.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> And let our people too learn to set a
good example in following honest occupations for the supply of their
necessities, so that they may not live useless lives.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> Every one here sends you greeting. Greet
the believers who hold us dear. May grace be with you all.
