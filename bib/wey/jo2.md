### Weymouth New Testament: 2 John

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The Elder to the elect lady and her
children. Truly I love you all, and not I alone, but also all who know
the truth,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> for the sake of the truth which is
continually in our hearts and will be with us for ever.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Grace, mercy and peace will be with us from
God the Father, and from Jesus Christ the Son of the Father, in truth
and love.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> It is an intense joy to me to have found
some of your children living true Christian lives, in obedience to the
command which we have received from the Father.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And now, dear lady, I pray you--writing to
you, as I do, not a new command, but the one which we have had from the
very beginning--let us love one another.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> The love of which I am speaking consists in
our living in obedience to God's commands. God's command is that you
should live in obedience to what you all heard from the very beginning.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> For many deceivers have gone out into the
world--men who do not acknowledge Jesus as Christ who has come in human
nature. Such a one is \`the deceiver' and \`the anti-Christ.'

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Keep guard over yourselves, so that you may
not lose the results of your good deeds, but may receive back a full
reward.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> No one has God, who instead of remaining
true to the teaching of Christ, presses on in advance: but he who
remains true to that teaching has both the Father and the Son.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> If any one who comes to you does not
bring this teaching, do not receive him under your roof nor bid him
Farewell.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> He who bids him Farewell is a sharer in
his evil deeds.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> I have a great deal to say to you all,
but will not write it with paper and ink. Yet I hope to come to see you
and speak face to face, so that your happiness may be complete.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> The children of your elect sister send
greetings to you.
