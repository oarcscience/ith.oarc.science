### Weymouth New Testament: Philemon

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and
Timothy our brother: To Philemon our dearly-loved fellow labourer--

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> and to our sister Apphia and our comrade
Archippus--as well as to the Church in your house.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> May grace be granted to you all, and peace,
from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I give continual thanks to my God while
making mention of you, my brother, in my prayers,

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> because I hear of your love and of the
faith which you have towards the Lord Jesus and which you manifest
towards all God's people;

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> praying as I do, that their participation
in your faith may result in others fully recognizing all the right
affection that is in us toward Christ.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> For I have found great joy and comfort in
your love, because the hearts of God's people have been, and are,
refreshed through you, my brother.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Therefore, though I might with Christ's
authority speak very freely and order you to do what is fitting,

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> it is for love's sake that--instead of
that--although I am none other than Paul the aged, and am now also a
prisoner for Christ Jesus,

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> I entreat you on behalf of my own child
whose father I have become while in my chains--I mean Onesimus.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Formerly he was useless to you, but
now--true to his name--he is of great use to you and to me.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> I am sending him back to you, though in
so doing I send part of myself.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> It was my wish to keep him at my side for
him to attend to my wants, as your representative, during my
imprisonment for the Good News.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> Only I wished to do nothing without your
consent, so that his kind action of yours might not be done under
pressure, but might be a voluntary one.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> For perhaps it was for this reason he was
parted from you for a time, that you might receive him back wholly and
for ever yours;

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> no longer as a slave, but as something
better than a slave--a brother peculiarly dear to me, and even dearer to
you, both as a servant and as a fellow Christian.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> If therefore you regard me as a comrade,
receive him as if he were I myself.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> And if he was ever dishonest or is in
your debt, debit me with the amount.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> I Paul write this with my own hand--I
will pay you in full. (I say nothing of the fact that you owe me even
your own self.)

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Yes, brother, do me this favour for the
Lord's sake. Refresh my heart in Christ.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> I write to you in the full confidence
that you will meet my wishes, for I know you will do even more than I
say.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> And at the same time provide
accommodation for me; for I hope that through your prayers I shall be
permitted to come to you.

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> Greetings to you, my brother, from
Epaphras my fellow prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus;

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> and from Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and
Luke, my fellow workers.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with the spirit of every one of you.
