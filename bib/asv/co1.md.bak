### American Standard Version: 1 Corinthians

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, called \[to be\] an apostle of Jesus
Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> unto the church of God which is at Corinth,
\[even\] them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called \[to be\]
saints, with all that call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in
every place, their \[Lord\] and ours:

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Grace to you and peace from God our Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I thank my God always concerning you, for
the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> that in everything ye were enriched in him,
in all utterance and all knowledge;

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> even as the testimony of Christ was
confirmed in you:

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting
for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> who shall also confirm you unto the end,
\[that ye be\] unreproveable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> God is faithful, through whom ye were
called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Now I beseech you, brethren, through the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing and
\[that\] there be no divisions among you; but \[that\] ye be perfected
together in the same mind and in the same judgment.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> For it hath been signified unto me
concerning you, my brethren, by them \[that are of the household\] of
Chloe, that there are contentions among you.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Now this I mean, that each one of you
saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos: and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for
you? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> I thank God that I baptized none of you,
save Crispus and Gaius;

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> lest any man should say that ye were
baptized into my name.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> And I baptized also the household of
Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to
preach the gospel: not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ
should be made void.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> For the word of the cross is to them that
perish foolishness; but unto us who are saved it is the power of God.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> For it is written, I will destroy the
wisdom of the wise, And the discernment of the discerning will I bring
to nought.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Where is the wise? where is the scribe?
where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the
wisdom of the world?

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> For seeing that in the wisdom of God the
world through its wisdom knew not God, it was God's good pleasure
through the foolishness of the preaching to save them that believe.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> Seeing that Jews ask for signs, and
Greeks seek after wisdom:

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> but we preach Christ crucified, unto Jews
a stumblingblock, and unto Gentiles foolishness;

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> but unto them that are called, both Jews
and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> Because the foolishness of God is wiser
than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> For behold your calling, brethren, that
not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, \[are
called\]:

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> but God chose the foolish things of the
world, that he might put to shame them that are wise; and God chose the
weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are
strong;

<span id="an_1:28">1:28</span> and the base things of the world, and the
things that are despised, did God choose, \[yea\] and the things that
are not, that he might bring to nought the things that are:

<span id="an_1:29">1:29</span> that no flesh should glory before God.

<span id="an_1:30">1:30</span> But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who
was made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification,
and redemption:

<span id="an_1:31">1:31</span> that, according as it is written, He that
glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> And I, brethren, when I came unto you, came
not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the
testimony of God.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> For I determined not to know anything among
you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And I was with you in weakness, and in
fear, and in much trembling.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> And my speech and my preaching were not in
persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of
power:

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> that your faith should not stand in the
wisdom of men, but in the power of God.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> We speak wisdom, however, among them that
are fullgrown: yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this
world, who are coming to nought:

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery,
\[even\] the \[wisdom\] that hath been hidden, which God foreordained
before the worlds unto our glory:

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> which none of the rulers of this world hath
known: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of
glory:

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> but as it is written, Things which eye saw
not, and ear heard not, And \[which\] entered not into the heart of man,
Whatsoever things God prepared for them that love him.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> But unto us God revealed \[them\] through
the Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of
God.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> For who among men knoweth the things of a
man, save the spirit of the man, which is in him? even so the things of
God none knoweth, save the Spirit of God.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> But we received, not the spirit of the
world, but the spirit which is from God; that we might know the things
that were freely given to us of God.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> Which things also we speak, not in words
which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth; combining
spiritual things with spiritual \[words\].

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> Now the natural man receiveth not the
things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him; and he
cannot know them, because they are spiritually judged.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> But he that is spiritual judgeth all
things, and he himself is judged of no man.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> For who hath known the mind of the Lord,
that he should instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> And I, brethren, could not speak unto you
as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye
were not yet able \[to bear it\]: nay, not even now are ye able;

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> for ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is
among you jealousy and strife, are ye not carnal, and do ye not walk
after the manner of men?

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> For when one saith, I am of Paul; and
another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men?

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> What then is Apollos? and what is Paul?
Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave
the increase.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> So then neither is he that planteth
anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Now he that planteth and he that watereth
are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own
labor.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> For we are God's fellow-workers: ye are
God's husbandry, God's building.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> According to the grace of God which was
given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another
buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> For other foundation can no man lay than
that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> But if any man buildeth on the foundation
gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble;

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> each man's work shall be made manifest:
for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the
fire itself shall prove each man's work of what sort it is.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> If any man's work shall abide which he
built thereon, he shall receive a reward.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> If any man's work shall be burned, he
shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through
fire.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> Know ye not that ye are a temple of God,
and \[that\] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> If any man destroyeth the temple of God,
him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> Let no man deceive himself. If any man
thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool,
that he may become wise.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> For the wisdom of this world is
foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in
their craftiness:

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> and again, The Lord knoweth the
reasonings of the wise that they are vain.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> Wherefore let no one glory in men. For
all things are yours;

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or
the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all
are yours;

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Let a man so account of us, as of ministers
of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> Here, moreover, it is required in stewards,
that a man be found faithful.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> But with me it is a very small thing that I
should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own
self.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> For I know nothing against myself; yet am I
not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Wherefore judge nothing before the time,
until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of
darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall
each man have his praise from God.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> Now these things, brethren, I have in a
figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes; that in us ye
might learn not \[to go\] beyond the things which are written; that no
one of you be puffed up for the one against the other.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> For who maketh thee to differ? and what
hast thou that thou didst not receive? but if thou didst receive it, why
dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> Already are ye filled, already ye are
become rich, ye have come to reign without us: yea and I would that ye
did reign, that we also might reign with you.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> For, I think, God hath set forth us the
apostles last of all, as men doomed to death: for we are made a
spectacle unto the world, both to angels and men.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye
are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye have glory, but
we have dishonor.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> Even unto this present hour we both
hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain
dwelling-place;

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> and we toil, working with our own hands:
being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> being defamed, we entreat: we are made as
the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, even until now.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> I write not these things to shame you,
but to admonish you as my beloved children.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> For though ye have ten thousand tutors in
Christ, yet \[have ye\] not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I begat
you through the gospel.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> I beseech you therefore, be ye imitators
of me.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> For this cause have I sent unto you
Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put
you in remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach
everywhere in every church.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> Now some are puffed up, as though I were
not coming to you.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> But I will come to you shortly, if the
Lord will; and I will know, not the word of them that are puffed up, but
the power.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> For the kingdom of God is not in word,
but in power.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> What will ye? shall I come unto you with
a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> It is actually reported that there is
fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the
Gentiles, that one \[of you\] hath his father's wife.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> And ye are puffed up, and did not rather
mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among
you.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> For I verily, being absent in body but
present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him that
hath so wrought this thing,

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> in the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being
gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> to deliver such a one unto Satan for the
destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the
Lord Jesus.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that
a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a
new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also hath been
sacrificed, \[even\] Christ:

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> wherefore let us keep the feast, not with
old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with
the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no
company with fornicators;

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> not at all \[meaning\] with the
fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or
with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world:

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> but as it is, I wrote unto you not to
keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or
covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an
extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> For what have I to do with judging them
that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within?

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> But them that are without God judgeth.
Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Dare any of you, having a matter against
his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the
saints?

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Or know ye not that the saints shall judge
the world? and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge
the smallest matters?

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how
much more, things that pertain to this life?

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> If then ye have to judge things pertaining
to this life, do ye set them to judge who are of no account in the
church?

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> I say \[this\] to move you to shame. What,
cannot there be \[found\] among you one wise man who shall be able to
decide between his brethren,

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> but brother goeth to law with brother, and
that before unbelievers?

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> Nay, already it is altogether a defect in
you, that ye have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong?
why not rather be defrauded?

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong, and
defraud, and that \[your\] brethren.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall
not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators,
nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves
with men,

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards,
nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> And such were some of you: but ye were
washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the
Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> All things are lawful for me; but not all
things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be
brought under the power of any.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> Meats for the belly, and the belly for
meats: but God shall bring to nought both it and them. But the body is
not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> and God both raised the Lord, and will
raise up as through his power.

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> Know ye not that your bodies are members
of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them
members of a harlot? God forbid.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> Or know ye not that he that is joined to
a harlot is one body? for, The twain, saith he, shall become one flesh.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> But he that is joined unto the Lord is
one spirit.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> Flee fornication. Every sin that a man
doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth
against his own body.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> Or know ye not that your body is a temple
of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have from God? and ye are
not your own;

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> for ye were bought with a price: glorify
God therefore in your body.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote:
It is good for a man not to touch a woman.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> But, because of fornications, let each man
have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> Let the husband render unto the wife her
due: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> The wife hath not power over her own body,
but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power over his
own body, but the wife.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> Defraud ye not one the other, except it be
by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer, and
may be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your
incontinency.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> But this I say by way of concession, not of
commandment.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> Yet I would that all men were even as I
myself. Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this
manner, and another after that.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> But I say to the unmarried and to widows,
It is good for them if they abide even as I.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> But if they have not continency, let them
marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> But unto the married I give charge,
\[yea\] not I, but the Lord, That the wife depart not from her husband

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> (but should she depart, let her remain
unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband); and that the husband
leave not his wife.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If
any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with
him, let him not leave her.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> And the woman that hath an unbelieving
husband, and he is content to dwell with her, let her not leave her
husband.

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified
in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else
were your children unclean; but now are they holy.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> Yet if the unbelieving departeth, let him
depart: the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such
\[cases\]: but God hath called us in peace.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> For how knowest thou, O wife, whether
thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O husband, whether
thou shalt save thy wife?

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> Only, as the Lord hath distributed to
each man, as God hath called each, so let him walk. And so ordain I in
all the churches.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> Was any man called being circumcised? Let
him not become uncircumcised. Hath any been called in uncircumcision?
Let him not be circumcised.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> Circumcision is nothing, and
uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God.

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> Let each man abide in that calling
wherein he was called.

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> Wast thou called being a bondservant?
Care not for it: nay, even if thou canst become free, use \[it\] rather.

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> For he that was called in the Lord being
a bondservant, is the Lord's freedman: likewise he that was called being
free, is Christ's bondservant.

<span id="an_7:23">7:23</span> Ye were bought with a price; become not
bondservants of men.

<span id="an_7:24">7:24</span> Brethren, let each man, wherein he was
called, therein abide with God.

<span id="an_7:25">7:25</span> Now concerning virgins I have no
commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one that hath
obtained mercy of the Lord to be trustworthy.

<span id="an_7:26">7:26</span> I think therefore that this is good by
reason of the distress that is upon us, \[namely,\] that it is good for
a man to be as he is.

<span id="an_7:27">7:27</span> Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to
be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.

<span id="an_7:28">7:28</span> But shouldest thou marry, thou hast not
sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Yet such shall have
tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you.

<span id="an_7:29">7:29</span> But this I say, brethren, the time is
shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though
they had none;

<span id="an_7:30">7:30</span> and those that weep, as though they wept
not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that
buy, as though they possessed not;

<span id="an_7:31">7:31</span> and those that use the world, as not
using it to the full: for the fashion of this world passeth away.

<span id="an_7:32">7:32</span> But I would have you to be free from
cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how
he may please the Lord:

<span id="an_7:33">7:33</span> but he that is married is careful for the
things of the world, how he may please his wife,

<span id="an_7:34">7:34</span> and is divided. \[So\] also the woman
that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord,
that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married
is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.

<span id="an_7:35">7:35</span> And this I say for your own profit; not
that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that
ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.

<span id="an_7:36">7:36</span> But if any man thinketh that he behaveth
himself unseemly toward his virgin \[daughter\], if she be past the
flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he will; he
sinneth not; let them marry.

<span id="an_7:37">7:37</span> But he that standeth stedfast in his
heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching in his own heart,
to keep his own virgin \[daughter\], shall do well.

<span id="an_7:38">7:38</span> So then both he that giveth his own
virgin \[daughter\] in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not
in marriage shall do better.

<span id="an_7:39">7:39</span> A wife is bound for so long time as her
husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to
whom she will; only in the Lord.

<span id="an_7:40">7:40</span> But she is happier if she abide as she
is, after my judgment: and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> Now concerning things sacrificed to idols:
We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love
edifieth.

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> If any man thinketh that he knoweth
anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know;

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> but if any man loveth God, the same is
known by him.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> Concerning therefore the eating of things
sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is \[anything\] in the world,
and that there is no God but one.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> For though there be that are called gods,
whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many;

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> yet to us there is one God, the Father, of
whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ,
through whom are all things, and we through him.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> Howbeit there is not in all men that
knowledge: but some, being used until now to the idol, eat as \[of\] a
thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> But food will not commend us to God:
neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the
better.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> But take heed lest by any means this
liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> For if a man see thee who hast knowledge
sitting at meat in an idol's temple, will not his conscience, if he is
weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> For through thy knowledge he that is weak
perisheth, the brother for whose sake Christ died.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> And thus, sinning against the brethren,
and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin against Christ.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> Wherefore, if meat causeth my brother to
stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I cause not my brother
to stumble.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I
not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not ye my work in the Lord?

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> If to others I am not an apostle, yet at
least I am to you; for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> My defence to them that examine me is this.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> Have we no right to eat and to drink?

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> Have we no right to lead about a wife that
is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the
Lord, and Cephas?

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> Or I only and Barnabas, have we not a right
to forbear working?

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> What soldier ever serveth at his own
charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not the fruit thereof? Or
who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> Do I speak these things after the manner of
men? or saith not the law also the same?

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou
shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. Is it for the
oxen that God careth,

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> or saith he it assuredly for our sake?
Yea, for our sake it was written: because he that ploweth ought to plow
in hope, and he that thresheth, \[to thresh\] in hope of partaking.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> If we sowed unto you spiritual things, is
it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things?

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> If others partake of \[this\] right over
you, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we
bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> Know ye not that they that minister about
sacred things eat \[of\] the things of the temple, \[and\] they that
wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar?

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> Even so did the Lord ordain that they
that proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> But I have used none of these things: and
I write not these things that it may be so done in my case; for \[it
were\] good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my
glorifying void.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> For if I preach the gospel, I have
nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me,
if I preach not the gospel.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> For if I do this of mine own will, I have
a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship intrusted to
me.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> What then is my reward? That, when I
preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to
use to the full my right in the gospel.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> For though I was free from all \[men,\] I
brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I
might gain Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, not
being myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the
law;

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> to them that are without law, as without
law, not being without law to God, but under law to Christ, that I might
gain them that are without law.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> To the weak I became weak, that I might
gain the weak: I am become all things to all men, that I may by all
means save some.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> And I do all things for the gospel's
sake, that I may be a joint partaker thereof.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> Know ye not that they that run in a race
run all, but one receiveth the prize? Even so run; that ye may attain.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> And every man that striveth in the games
exerciseth self-control in all things. Now they \[do it\] to receive a
corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> I therefore so run, as not uncertainly;
so fight I, as not beating the air:

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> but I buffet my body, and bring it into
bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached to others, I
myself should be rejected.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> For I would not, brethren, have you
ignorant, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed
through the sea;

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> and were all baptized unto Moses in the
cloud and in the sea;

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> and did all eat the same spiritual food;

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> and did all drink the same spiritual
drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the
rock was Christ.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> Howbeit with most of them God was not
well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> Now these things were our examples, to
the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of
them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose
up to play.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> Neither let us commit fornication, as
some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> Neither let us make trial of the Lord, as
some of them made trial, and perished by the serpents.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> Neither murmur ye, as some of them
murmured, and perished by the destroyer.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> Now these things happened unto them by
way of example; and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the
ends of the ages are come.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> Wherefore let him that thinketh he
standeth take heed lest he fall.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> There hath no temptation taken you but
such as man can bear: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be
tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also
the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> Wherefore, my beloved, flee from
idolatry.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I
say.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> The cup of blessing which we bless, is
it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is
it not a communion of the body of Christ?

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> seeing that we, who are many, are one
bread, one body: for we are all partake of the one bread.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> Behold Israel after the flesh: have not
they that eat the sacrifices communion with the altar?

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> What say I then? that a thing
sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> But \[I say\], that the things which
the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I
would not that ye should have communion with demons.

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord,
and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and
of the table of demons.

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?
are we stronger than he?

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> All things are lawful; but not all
things are expedient. All things are lawful; but not all things edify.

<span id="an_10:24">10:24</span> Let no man seek his own, but \[each\]
his neighbor's \[good\].

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> Whatsoever is sold in the shambles,
eat, asking no question for conscience' sake,

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> for the earth is the Lord's, and the
fulness thereof.

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> If one of them that believe not biddeth
you \[to a feast\], and ye are disposed to go; whatsoever is set before
you, eat, asking no question for conscience' sake.

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> But if any man say unto you, This hath
been offered in sacrifice, eat not, for his sake that showed it, and for
conscience sake:

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> conscience, I say, not thine own, but
the other's; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience?

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> If I partake with thankfulness, why am
I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or
whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> Give no occasions of stumbling, either
to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God:

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> even as I also please all men in all
things, not seeking mine own profit, but the \[profit\] of the many,
that they may be saved.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> Be ye imitators of me, even as I also am
of Christ.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> Now I praise you that ye remember me in
all things, and hold fast the traditions, even as I delivered them to
you.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> But I would have you know, that the head
of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the
head of Christ is God.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> Every man praying or prophesying, having
his head covered, dishonoreth his head.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> But every woman praying or prophesying
with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head; for it is one and the same
thing as if she were shaven.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> For if a woman is not veiled, let her
also be shorn: but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven,
let her be veiled.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> For a man indeed ought not to have his
head veiled, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the
woman is the glory of the man.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> For the man is not of the woman; but the
woman of the man:

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> for neither was the man created for the
woman; but the woman for the man:

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> for this cause ought the woman to have
\[a sign of\] authority on her head, because of the angels.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> Nevertheless, neither is the woman
without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> For as the woman is of the man, so is
the man also by the woman; but all things are of God.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> Judge ye in yourselves: is it seemly
that a woman pray unto God unveiled?

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> Doth not even nature itself teach you,
that, if a man have long hair, it is a dishonor to him?

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> But if a woman have long hair, it is a
glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> But if any man seemeth to be
contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> But in giving you this charge, I praise
you not, that ye come together not for the better but for the worse.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> For first of all, when ye come together
in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and I partly
believe it.

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> For there must be also factions among
you, that they that are approved may be made manifest among you.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> When therefore ye assemble yourselves
together, it is not possible to eat the Lord's supper:

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> for in your eating each one taketh
before \[other\] his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is
drunken.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> What, have ye not houses to eat and to
drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and put them to shame that
have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this I praise
you not.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> For I received of the Lord that which
also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he
was betrayed took bread;

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> and when he had given thanks, he brake
it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance
of me.

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> In like manner also the cup, after
supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as
often as ye drink \[it\], in remembrance of me.

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> For as often as ye eat this bread, and
drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord's death till he come.

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread
or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of
the body and the blood of the Lord.

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> But let a man prove himself, and so let
him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth
and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body.

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> For this cause many among you are weak
and sickly, and not a few sleep.

<span id="an_11:31">11:31</span> But if we discerned ourselves, we
should not be judged.

<span id="an_11:32">11:32</span> But when we are judged, we are
chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.

<span id="an_11:33">11:33</span> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come
together to eat, wait one for another.

<span id="an_11:34">11:34</span> If any man is hungry, let him eat at
home; that your coming together be not unto judgment. And the rest will
I set in order whensoever I come.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> Now concerning spiritual \[gifts\],
brethren, I would not have you ignorant.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> Ye know that when ye were Gentiles \[ye
were\] led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might led.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> Wherefore I make known unto you, that no
man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema; and no man
can say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit.

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> Now there are diversities of gifts, but
the same Spirit.

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> And there are diversities of
ministrations, and the same Lord.

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> And there are diversities of workings,
but the same God, who worketh all things in all.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> But to each one is given the
manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> For to one is given through the Spirit
the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to
the same Spirit:

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> to another faith, in the same Spirit; and
to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit;

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> and to another workings of miracles;
and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; to
another \[divers\] kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation
of tongues:

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> but all these worketh the one and the
same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will.

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> For as the body is one, and hath many
members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so
also is Christ.

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> For in one Spirit were we all baptized
into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were
all made to drink of one Spirit.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> For the body is not one member, but
many.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> If the foot shall say, Because I am not
the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> And if the ear shall say, Because I am
not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> If the whole body were an eye, where
were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> But now hath God set the members each
one of them in the body, even as it pleased him.

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> And if they were all one member, where
were the body?

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> But now they are many members, but one
body.

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> And the eye cannot say to the hand, I
have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of
you.

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> Nay, much rather, those members of the
body which seem to be more feeble are necessary:

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> and those \[parts\] of the body, which
we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor;
and our uncomely \[parts\] have more abundant comeliness;

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> whereas our comely \[parts\] have no
need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to
that \[part\] which lacked;

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> that there should be no schism in the
body; but \[that\] the members should have the same care one for
another.

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> And whether one member suffereth, all
the members suffer with it; or \[one\] member is honored, all the
members rejoice with it.

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> Now ye are the body of Christ, and
severally members thereof.

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> And God hath set some in the church,
first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then
gifts of healings, helps, governments, \[divers\] kinds of tongues.

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> Are all apostles? are all prophets? are
all teachers? are all \[workers of\] miracles?

<span id="an_12:30">12:30</span> have all gifts of healings? do all
speak with tongues? do all interpret?

<span id="an_12:31">12:31</span> But desire earnestly the greater gifts.
And moreover a most excellent way show I unto you.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> If I speak with the tongues of men and of
angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass, or a clanging
cymbal.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> And if I have \[the gift of\] prophecy,
and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as
to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> And if I bestow all my goods to feed
\[the poor\], and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it
profiteth me nothing.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> Love suffereth long, \[and\] is kind;
love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh
not its own, is not provoked, taketh not account of evil;

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but
rejoiceth with the truth;

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> beareth all things, believeth all things,
hopeth all things, endureth all things.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> Love never faileth: but whether \[there
be\] prophecies, they shall be done away; whether \[there be\] tongues,
they shall cease; whether \[there be\] knowledge, it shall be done away.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> For we know in part, and we prophesy in
part;

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> but when that which is perfect is come,
that which is in part shall be done away.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> When I was a child, I spake as a child,
I felt as a child, I thought as a child: now that I am become a man, I
have put away childish things.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but
then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know fully even
as also I was fully known.

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> But now abideth faith, hope, love,
these three; and the greatest of these is love.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> Follow after love; yet desire earnestly
spiritual \[gifts\], but rather that ye may prophesy.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh
not unto men, but unto God; for no man understandeth; but in the spirit
he speaketh mysteries.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men
edification, and exhortation, and consolation.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth
himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> Now I would have you all speak with
tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy: and greater is he that
prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret,
that the church may receive edifying.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> But now, brethren, if I come unto you
speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you
either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of
teaching?

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> Even things without life, giving a voice,
whether pipe or harp, if they give not a distinction in the sounds, how
shall it be known what is piped or harped?

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> For if the trumpet give an uncertain
voice, who shall prepare himself for war?

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> So also ye, unless ye utter by the tongue
speech easy to understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye
will be speaking into the air.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> There are, it may be, so many kinds of
voices in the world, and no \[kind\] is without signification.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> If then I know not the meaning of the
voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh
will be a barbarian unto me.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> So also ye, since ye are zealous of
spiritual \[gifts\], seek that ye may abound unto the edifying of the
church.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> Wherefore let him that speaketh in a
tongue pray that he may interpret.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit
prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> What is it then? I will pray with the
spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with
the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> Else if thou bless with the spirit, how
shall he that filleth the place of the unlearned say the Amen at thy
giving of thanks, seeing he knoweth not what thou sayest?

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> For thou verily givest thanks well, but
the other is not edified.

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> I thank God, I speak with tongues more
than you all:

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> howbeit in the church I had rather
speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others
also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> Brethren, be not children in mind: yet
in malice be ye babes, but in mind be men.

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> In the law it is written, By men of
strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak unto this
people; and not even thus will they hear me, saith the Lord.

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not
to them that believe, but to the unbelieving: but prophesying \[is for a
sign\], not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe.

<span id="an_14:23">14:23</span> If therefore the whole church be
assembled together and all speak with tongues, and there come in men
unlearned or unbelieving, will they not say that ye are mad?

<span id="an_14:24">14:24</span> But if all prophesy, and there come in
one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all, he is judged by
all;

<span id="an_14:25">14:25</span> the secrets of his heart are made
manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God,
declaring that God is among you indeed.

<span id="an_14:26">14:26</span> What is it then, brethren? When ye come
together, each one hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a revelation,
hath a tongue, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto
edifying.

<span id="an_14:27">14:27</span> If any man speaketh in a tongue, \[let
it be\] by two, or at the most three, and \[that\] in turn; and let one
interpret:

<span id="an_14:28">14:28</span> but if there be no interpreter, let him
keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.

<span id="an_14:29">14:29</span> And let the prophets speak \[by\] two
or three, and let the others discern.

<span id="an_14:30">14:30</span> But if a revelation be made to another
sitting by, let the first keep silence.

<span id="an_14:31">14:31</span> For ye all can prophesy one by one,
that all may learn, and all may be exhorted;

<span id="an_14:32">14:32</span> and the spirits of the prophets are
subject to the prophets;

<span id="an_14:33">14:33</span> for God is not \[a God\] of confusion,
but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,

<span id="an_14:34">14:34</span> let the women keep silence in the
churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but let them be in
subjection, as also saith the law.

<span id="an_14:35">14:35</span> And if they would learn anything, let
them ask their own husbands at home: for it is shameful for a woman to
speak in the church.

<span id="an_14:36">14:36</span> What? was it from you that the word of
God went forth? or came it unto you alone?

<span id="an_14:37">14:37</span> If any man thinketh himself to be a
prophet, or spiritual, let him take knowledge of the things which I
write unto you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.

<span id="an_14:38">14:38</span> But if any man is ignorant, let him be
ignorant.

<span id="an_14:39">14:39</span> Wherefore, my brethren, desire
earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.

<span id="an_14:40">14:40</span> But let all things be done decently and
in order.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> Now I make known unto you brethren, the
gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye received, wherein also
ye stand,

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> by which also ye are saved, if ye hold
fast the word which I preached unto you, except ye believed in vain.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> For I delivered unto you first of all
that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to
the scriptures;

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> and that he was buried; and that he hath
been raised on the third day according to the scriptures;

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> and that he appeared to Cephas; then to
the twelve;

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> then he appeared to above five hundred
brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now, but some
are fallen asleep;

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> then he appeared to James; then to all
the apostles;

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> and last of all, as to the \[child\]
untimely born, he appeared to me also.

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> For I am the least of the apostles, that
am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of
God.

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> But by the grace of God I am what I am:
and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain; but I
labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God
which was with me.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> Whether then \[it be\] I or they, so we
preach, and so ye believed.

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> Now if Christ is preached that he hath
been raised from the dead, how say some among you that there is no
resurrection of the dead?

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> But if there is no resurrection of the
dead, neither hath Christ been raised:

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> and if Christ hath not been raised,
then is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> Yea, we are found false witnesses of
God; because we witnessed of God that he raised up Christ: whom he
raised not up, if so be that the dead are not raised.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> For if the dead are not raised, neither
hath Christ been raised:

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> and if Christ hath not been raised,
your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> Then they also that are fallen asleep
in Christ have perished.

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> If we have only hoped in Christ in this
life, we are of all men most pitiable.

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> But now hath Christ been raised from
the dead, the firstfruits of them that are asleep.

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> For since by man \[came\] death, by man
\[came\] also the resurrection of the dead.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> For as in Adam all die, so also in
Christ shall all be made alive.

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> But each in his own order: Christ the
firstfruits; then they that are Christ's, at his coming.

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> Then \[cometh\] the end, when he shall
deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have
abolished all rule and all authority and power.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> For he must reign, till he hath put all
his enemies under his feet.

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> The last enemy that shall be abolished
is death.

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> For, He put all things in subjection
under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put in subjection, it
is evident that he is excepted who did subject all things unto him.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> And when all things have been subjected
unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subjected to him that did
subject all things unto him, that God may be all in all.

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> Else what shall they do that are
baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are
they baptized for them?

<span id="an_15:30">15:30</span> Why do we also stand in jeopardy every
hour?

<span id="an_15:31">15:31</span> I protest by that glorifying in you,
brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.

<span id="an_15:32">15:32</span> If after the manner of men I fought
with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me? If the dead are not
raised, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.

<span id="an_15:33">15:33</span> Be not deceived: Evil companionships
corrupt good morals.

<span id="an_15:34">15:34</span> Awake to soberness righteously, and sin
not; for some have no knowledge of God: I speak \[this\] to move you to
shame.

<span id="an_15:35">15:35</span> But some one will say, How are the dead
raised? and with what manner of body do they come?

<span id="an_15:36">15:36</span> Thou foolish one, that which thou
thyself sowest is not quickened except it die:

<span id="an_15:37">15:37</span> and that which thou sowest, thou sowest
not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or
of some other kind;

<span id="an_15:38">15:38</span> but God giveth it a body even as it
pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.

<span id="an_15:39">15:39</span> All flesh is not the same flesh: but
there is one \[flesh\] of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another
flesh of birds, and another of fishes.

<span id="an_15:40">15:40</span> There are also celestial bodies, and
bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the
\[glory\] of the terrestrial is another.

<span id="an_15:41">15:41</span> There is one glory of the sun, and
another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star
differeth from another star in glory.

<span id="an_15:42">15:42</span> So also is the resurrection of the
dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:

<span id="an_15:43">15:43</span> it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in
glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:

<span id="an_15:44">15:44</span> it is sown a natural body; it is raised
a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual
\[body\].

<span id="an_15:45">15:45</span> So also it is written, The first man
Adam became a living soul. The last Adam \[became\] a life-giving
spirit.

<span id="an_15:46">15:46</span> Howbeit that is not first which is
spiritual, but that which is natural; then that which is spiritual.

<span id="an_15:47">15:47</span> The first man is of the earth, earthy:
the second man is of heaven.

<span id="an_15:48">15:48</span> As is the earthy, such are they also
that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are
heavenly.

<span id="an_15:49">15:49</span> And as we have borne the image of the
earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.

<span id="an_15:50">15:50</span> Now this I say, brethren, that flesh
and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption
inherit incorruption.

<span id="an_15:51">15:51</span> Behold, I tell you a mystery: We all
shall not sleep, but we shall all be changed,

<span id="an_15:52">15:52</span> in a moment, in the twinkling of an
eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall
be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

<span id="an_15:53">15:53</span> For this corruptible must put on
incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.

<span id="an_15:54">15:54</span> But when this corruptible shall have
put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then
shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in
victory.

<span id="an_15:55">15:55</span> O death, where is thy victory? O death,
where is thy sting?

<span id="an_15:56">15:56</span> The sting of death is sin; and the
power of sin is the law:

<span id="an_15:57">15:57</span> but thanks be to God, who giveth us the
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_15:58">15:58</span> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be ye
stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,
forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not vain in the Lord.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> Now concerning the collection for the
saints, as I gave order to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> Upon the first day of the week let each
one of you lay by him in store, as he may prosper, that no collections
be made when I come.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> And when I arrive, whomsoever ye shall
approve, them will I send with letters to carry your bounty unto
Jerusalem:

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> and if it be meet for me to go also, they
shall go with me.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> But I will come unto you, when I shall
have passed through Macedonia; for I pass through Macedonia;

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> but with you it may be that I shall
abide, or even winter, that ye may set me forward on my journey
whithersoever I go.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> For I do not wish to see you now by the
way; for I hope to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> But I will tarry at Ephesus until
Pentecost;

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> for a great door and effectual is opened
unto me, and there are many adversaries.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> Now if Timothy come, see that he be
with you without fear; for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also
do:

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> let no man therefore despise him. But
set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come unto me: for I
expect him with the brethren.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> But as touching Apollos the brother, I
besought him much to come unto you with the brethren: and it was not all
\[his\] will to come now; but he will come when he shall have
opportunity.

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit
you like men, be strong.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> Let all that ye do be done in love.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> Now I beseech you, brethren (ye know
the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that
they have set themselves to minister unto the saints),

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> that ye also be in subjection unto
such, and to every one that helpeth in the work and laboreth.

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> And I rejoice at the coming of
Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on
your part they supplied.

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> For they refreshed my spirit and yours:
acknowledge ye therefore them that are such.

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila
and Prisca salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their
house.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> All the brethren salute you. Salute one
another with a holy kiss.

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> The salutation of me Paul with mine own
hand.

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> If any man loveth not the Lord, let him
be anathema. Maranatha.

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be
with you.

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> My love be with you all in Christ
Jesus. Amen.
