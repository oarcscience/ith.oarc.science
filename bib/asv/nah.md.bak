### American Standard Version: Nahum

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The burden of Nineveh. The book of the
vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Jehovah is a jealous God and avengeth;
Jehovah avengeth and is full of wrath; Jehovah taketh vengeance on his
adversaries, and he reserveth \[wrath\] for his enemies.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Jehovah is slow to anger, and great in
power, and will by no means clear \[the guilty\]: Jehovah hath his way
in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his
feet.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and
drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel; and the flower
of Lebanon languisheth.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> The mountains quake at him, and the hills
melt; and the earth is upheaved at his presence, yea, the world, and all
that dwell therein.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> Who can stand before his indignation? and
who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his wrath is poured out
like fire, and the rocks are broken asunder by him.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Jehovah is good, a stronghold in the day of
trouble; and he knoweth them that take refuge in him.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> But with an over-running flood he will make
a full end of her place, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> What do ye devise against Jehovah? he will
make a full end; affliction shall not rise up the second time.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> For entangled like thorns, and drunken as
with their drink, they are consumed utterly as dry stubble.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> There is one gone forth out of thee, that
deviseth evil against Jehovah, that counselleth wickedness.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Thus saith Jehovah: Though they be in
full strength, and likewise many, even so shall they be cut down, and he
shall pass away. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no
more.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> And now will I break his yoke from off
thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> And Jehovah hath given commandment
concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of
thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image; I will
make thy grave; for thou art vile.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> Behold, upon the mountains the feet of
him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! Keep thy feasts,
O Judah, perform thy vows; for the wicked one shall no more pass through
thee; he is utterly cut off.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> He that dasheth in pieces is come up
against thee: keep the fortress, watch the way, make thy loins strong,
fortify thy power mightily.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> For Jehovah restoreth the excellency of
Jacob, as the excellency of Israel; for the emptiers have emptied them
out, and destroyed their vine-branches.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> The shield of his mighty men is made red,
the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots flash with steel in the day
of his preparation, and the cypress \[spears\] are brandished.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> The chariots rage in the streets; they rush
to and fro in the broad ways: the appearance of them is like torches;
they run like the lightnings.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> He remembereth his nobles: they stumble in
their march; they make haste to the wall thereof, and the mantelet is
prepared.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> The gates of the rivers are opened, and the
palace is dissolved.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> And it is decreed: she is uncovered, she is
carried away; and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves, beating
upon their breasts.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> But Nineveh hath been from of old like a
pool of water: yet they flee away. Stand, stand, \[they cry\]; but none
looketh back.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil
of gold; for there is no end of the store, the glory of all goodly
furniture.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> She is empty, and void, and waste; and
the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and anguish is in all
loins, and the faces of them all are waxed pale.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Where is the den of the lions, and the
feeding-place of the young lions, where the lion \[and\] the lioness
walked, the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid?

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> The lion did tear in pieces enough for
his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with
prey, and his dens with ravin.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> Behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah
of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall
devour thy young lions; and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and
the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of
lies and rapine; the prey departeth not.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> The noise of the whip, and the noise of the
rattling of wheels, and prancing horses, and bounding chariots,

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> the horseman mounting, and the flashing
sword, and the glittering spear, and a multitude of slain, and a great
heap of corpses, and there is no end of the bodies; they stumble upon
their bodies;-

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> because of the multitude of the whoredoms
of the well-favored harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth
nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah of
hosts, and I will uncover thy skirts upon thy face; and I will show the
nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> And I will cast abominable filth upon thee,
and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazing-stock.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> And it shall come to pass, that all they
that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid
waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Art thou better than No-amon, that was
situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about her; whose
rampart was the sea, \[and\] her wall was of the sea?

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and
it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> Yet was she carried away, she went into
captivity; her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head of
all the streets; and they cast lots for her honorable men, and all her
great men were bound in chains.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Thou also shalt be drunken; thou shalt be
hid; thou also shalt seek a stronghold because of the enemy.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> All thy fortresses shall be \[like\]
fig-trees with the first-ripe figs: if they be shaken, they fall into
the mouth of the eater.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Behold, thy people in the midst of thee
are women; the gates of thy land are set wide open unto thine enemies:
the fire hath devoured thy bars.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> Draw thee water for the siege; strengthen
thy fortresses; go into the clay, and tread the mortar; make strong the
brickkiln.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> There shall the fire devour thee; the
sword shall cut thee off; it shall devour thee like the canker-worm:
make thyself many as the canker-worm; make thyself many as the locust.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above
the stars of heaven: the canker-worm ravageth, and fleeth away.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> Thy princes are as the locusts, and thy
marshals as the swarms of grasshoppers, which encamp in the hedges in
the cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place
is not known where they are.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria;
thy nobles are at rest; thy people are scattered upon the mountains, and
there is none to gather them.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> There is no assuaging of thy hurt: thy
wound is grievous: all that hear the report of thee clap their hands
over thee; for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?
