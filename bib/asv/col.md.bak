### American Standard Version: Colossians

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through
the will of God, and Timothy our brother,

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> To the saints and faithful brethren in
Christ \[that are\] at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our
Father.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> We give thanks to God the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus,
and of the love which ye have toward all the saints,

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> because of the hope which is laid up for
you in the heavens, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of
the gospel,

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> which is come unto you; even as it is also
in all the world bearing fruit and increasing, as \[it doth\] in you
also, since the day ye heard and knew the grace of God in truth;

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> even as ye learned of Epaphras our beloved
fellow-servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> who also declared unto us your love in the
Spirit.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> For this cause we also, since the day we
heard \[it\], do not cease to pray and make request for you, that ye may
be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and
understanding,

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> to walk worthily of the Lord unto all
pleasing, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the
knowledge of God;

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> strengthened with all power, according to
the might of his glory, unto all patience and longsuffering with joy;

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> giving thanks unto the Father, who made
us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> who delivered us out of the power of
darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love;

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> in whom we have our redemption, the
forgiveness of our sins:

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> who is the image of the invisible God,
the firstborn of all creation;

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> for in him were all things created, in
the heavens and upon the earth, things visible and things invisible,
whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things
have been created through him, and unto him;

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> and he is before all things, and in him
all things consist.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> And he is the head of the body, the
church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all
things he might have the preeminence.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> For it was the good pleasure \[of the
Father\] that in him should all the fulness dwell;

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> and through him to reconcile all things
unto himself, having made peace through the blood of his cross; through
him, \[I say\], whether things upon the earth, or things in the heavens.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> And you, being in time past alienated and
enemies in your mind in your evil works,

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> yet now hath he reconciled in the body of
his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and
unreproveable before him:

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> if so be that ye continue in the faith,
grounded and stedfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel
which ye heard, which was preached in all creation under heaven; whereof
I Paul was made a minister.

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your
sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of
Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church;

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> whereof I was made a minister, according
to the dispensation of God which was given me to you-ward, to fulfil the
word of God,

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> \[even\] the mystery which hath been hid
for ages and generations: but now hath it been manifested to his saints,

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> to whom God was pleased to make known
what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles,
which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:

<span id="an_1:28">1:28</span> whom we proclaim, admonishing every man
and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man
perfect in Christ;

<span id="an_1:29">1:29</span> whereunto I labor also, striving
according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> For I would have you know how greatly I
strive for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not
seen my face in the flesh;

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> that their hearts may be comforted, they
being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance
of understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, \[even\]
Christ,

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge hidden.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> This I say, that no one may delude you with
persuasiveness of speech.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> For though I am absent in the flesh, yet am
I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the
stedfastness of your faith in Christ.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> As therefore ye received Christ Jesus the
Lord, \[so\] walk in him,

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> rooted and builded up in him, and
established in your faith, even as ye were taught, abounding in
thanksgiving.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Take heed lest there shall be any one that
maketh spoil of you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the
tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after
Christ:

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the
Godhead bodily,

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> and in him ye are made full, who is the
head of all principality and power:

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> in whom ye were also circumcised with a
circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the
flesh, in the circumcision of Christ;

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> having been buried with him in baptism,
wherein ye were also raised with him through faith in the working of
God, who raised him from the dead.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And you, being dead through your
trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, you, \[I say\], did he
make alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses;

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> having blotted out the bond written in
ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us: and he hath
taken it out that way, nailing it to the cross;

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> having despoiled the principalities and
the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> Let no man therefore judge you in meat,
or in drink, or in respect of a feast day or a new moon or a sabbath
day:

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> which are a shadow of the things to come;
but the body is Christ's.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> Let no man rob you of your prize by a
voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things
which he hath seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> and not holding fast the Head, from whom
all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and
bands, increasing with the increase of God.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> If ye died with Christ from the rudiments
of the world, why, as though living in the world, do ye subject
yourselves to ordinances,

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> Handle not, nor taste, nor touch

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> (all which things are to perish with the
using), after the precepts and doctrines of men?

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> Which things have indeed a show of wisdom
in will-worship, and humility, and severity to the body; \[but are\] not
of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> If then ye were raised together with
Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the
right hand of God.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Set your mind on the things that are above,
not on the things that are upon the earth.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> For ye died, and your life is hid with
Christ in God.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> When Christ, \[who is\] our life, shall be
manifested, then shall ye also with him be manifested in glory.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Put to death therefore your members which
are upon the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and
covetousness, which is idolatry;

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> for which things' sake cometh the wrath of
God upon the sons of disobedience:

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> wherein ye also once walked, when ye lived
in these things;

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> but now do ye also put them all away:
anger, wrath, malice, railing, shameful speaking out of your mouth:

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> lie not one to another; seeing that ye have
put off the old man with his doings,

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> and have put on the new man, that is
being renewed unto knowledge after the image of him that created him:

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> where there cannot be Greek and Jew,
circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman;
but Christ is all, and in all.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Put on therefore, as God's elect, holy
and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness,
longsuffering;

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> forbearing one another, and forgiving
each other, if any man have a complaint against any; even as the Lord
forgave you, so also do ye:

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> and above all these things \[put on\]
love, which is the bond of perfectness.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> And let the peace of Christ rule in your
hearts, to the which also ye were called in one body; and be ye
thankful.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> Let the word of Christ dwell in you
richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms
\[and\] hymns \[and\] spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts
unto God.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> And whatsoever ye do, in word or in deed,
\[do\] all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the
Father through him.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> Wives, be in subjection to your husbands,
as is fitting in the Lord.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> Husbands, love your wives, and be not
bitter against them.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> Children, obey your parents in all
things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> Fathers, provoke not your children, that
they be not discouraged.

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> Servants, obey in all things them that
are your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as
men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord:

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> whatsoever ye do, work heartily, as unto
the Lord, and not unto men;

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> knowing that from the Lord ye shall
receive the recompense of the inheritance: ye serve the Lord Christ.

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> For he that doeth wrong shall receive
again for the wrong that he hath done: and there is no respect of
persons.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Masters, render unto your servants that
which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> Continue stedfastly in prayer, watching
therein with thanksgiving;

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> withal praying for us also, that God may
open unto us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for
which I am also in bonds;

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> that I may make it manifest, as I ought to
speak.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Walk in wisdom toward them that are
without, redeeming the time.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> Let your speech be always with grace,
seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer each one.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> All my affairs shall Tychicus make known
unto you, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-servant
in the Lord:

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> whom I have sent you for this very purpose,
that ye may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts;

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> together with Onesimus, the faithful and
beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all
things that \[are done\] here.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> Aristarchus my fellow-prisoner saluteth
you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (touching whom ye received
commandments; if he come unto you, receive him),

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> and Jesus that is called Justus, who are
of the circumcision: these only \[are my\] fellow-workers unto the
kingdom of God, men that have been a comfort unto me.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of
Christ Jesus, saluteth you, always striving for you in his prayers, that
ye may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> For I bear him witness, that he hath much
labor for you, and for them in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas
salute you.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> Salute the brethren that are in Laodicea,
and Nymphas, and the church that is in their house.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> And when this epistle hath been read
among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans;
and that ye also read the epistle from Laodicea.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> And say to Archippus, Take heed to the
ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> The salutation of me Paul with mine own
hand. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you.
