<span id="an_1:44">1:44</span> These are they that were numbered, whom
Moses and Aaron numbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men:
they were each one for his fathers' house.

<span id="an_1:45">1:45</span> So all they that were numbered of the

<span id="an_1:46">1:46</span> even all they that were numbered were six
hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.

<span id="an_1:47">1:47</span> But the Levites after the tribe of their
fathers were not numbered among them.

<span id="an_1:48">1:48</span> For Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_1:49">1:49</span> Only the tribe of Levi thou shalt not
number, neither shalt thou take the sum of them among the children of
Israel;

<span id="an_1:50">1:50</span> but appoint thou the Levites over the
tabernacle of the testimony, and over all the furniture thereof, and
over all that belongeth to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all
the furniture thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp
round about the tabernacle.

<span id="an_1:51">1:51</span> And when the tabernacle setteth forward,
the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be
pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh
shall be put to death.

<span id="an_1:52">1:52</span> And the children of Israel shall pitch
their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own
standard, according to their hosts.

<span id="an_1:53">1:53</span> But the Levites shall encamp round about
the tabernacle of the testimony, that there be no wrath upon the
congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the
charge of the tabernacle of the testimony.

<span id="an_1:54">1:54</span> Thus did the children of Israel;
according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so did they.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto
Aaron, saying,

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> The children of Israel shall encamp every
man by his own standard, with the ensigns of their fathers' houses: over
against the tent of meeting shall they encamp round about.

were a hundred thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four
hundred, according to their hosts. They shall set forth first.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> On the south side shall be the standard
of the camp of Reuben according to their hosts: and the prince of the
children of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> And his host, and those that were
numbered thereof, were forty and six thousand and five hundred.

be the tribe of Simeon: and the prince of the children of Simeon shall
be Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And his host, and those that were
numbered of them, were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> And the tribe of Gad: and the prince of
the children of Gad shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel.

fifty.

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> All that were numbered of the camp of
Reuben were a hundred thousand and fifty and one thousand and four
hundred and fifty, according to their hosts. And they shall set forth
second.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> Then the tent of meeting shall set
forward, with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps: as they
encamp, so shall they set forward, every man in his place, by their
standards.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> On the west side shall be the standard of
the camp of Ephraim according to their hosts: and the prince of the
children of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> And his host, and those that were
numbered of them, were forty thousand and five hundred.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> And next unto him shall be the tribe of
Manasseh: and the prince of the children of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel
the son of Pedahzur.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> And his host, and those that were
numbered of them, were thirty and two thousand and two hundred.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> And the tribe of Benjamin: and the prince
of the children of Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni.

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> And his host, and those that were
numbered of them, were thirty and five thousand and four hundred.

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> All that were numbered of the camp of
Ephraim were a hundred thousand and eight thousand and a hundred,
according to their hosts. And they shall set forth third.

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> On the north side shall be the standard

children of Dan shall be Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

<span id="an_2:26">2:26</span> And his host, and those that were

They shall set forth hindmost by their standards.

<span id="an_2:32">2:32</span> These are they that were numbered of the
children of Israel by their fathers' houses: all that were numbered of
the camps according to their hosts were six hundred thousand and three
thousand and five hundred and fifty.

<span id="an_2:33">2:33</span> But the Levites were not numbered among
the children of Israel; as Jehovah commanded Moses.

<span id="an_2:34">2:34</span> Thus did the children of Israel;
according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so they encamped by their
standards, and so they set forward, every one by their families,
according to their fathers' houses.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Now these are the generations of Aaron and
Moses in the day that Jehovah spake with Moses in mount Sinai.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> And these are the names of the sons of
Aaron: Nadab the first-born, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> These are the names of the sons of Aaron,
the priests that were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the
priest's office.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> And Nadab and Abihu died before Jehovah,
when they offered strange fire before Jehovah, in the wilderness of
Sinai, and they had no children; and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in
the priest's office in the presence of Aaron their father.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them
before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> And they shall keep his charge, and the
charge of the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, to do the
service of the tabernacle.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> And they shall keep all the furniture of
the tent of meeting, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the
service of the tabernacle.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron
and to his sons: they are wholly given unto him on the behalf of the
children of Israel.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his
sons, and they shall keep their priesthood: and the stranger that cometh
nigh shall be put to death.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> And I, behold, I have taken the Levites
from among the children of Israel instead of all the first-born that
openeth the womb among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be
mine:

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> for all the first-born are mine; on the
day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto
me all the first-born in Israel, both man and beast; mine they shall be:
I am Jehovah.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the
wilderness of Sinai, saying,

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> Number the children of Levi by their
fathers' houses, by their families: every male from a month old and
upward shalt thou number them.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> And Moses numbered them according to the
word of Jehovah, as he was commanded.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> And these were the sons of Levi by their
names: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> And these are the names of the sons of
Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> And the sons of Kohath by their families:
Amram, and Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> And the sons of Merari by their families:
Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to
their fathers' houses.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> Of Gershon was the family of the
Libnites, and the family of the Shimeites: these are the families of the
Gershonites.

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> Those that were numbered of them,
according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward,
even those that were numbered of them were seven thousand and five
hundred.

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> The families of the Gershonites shall
encamp behind the tabernacle westward.

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> And the prince of the fathers' house of
the Gershonites shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael.

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> And the charge of the sons of Gershon in
the tent of meeting shall be the tabernacle, and the Tent, the covering
thereof, and the screen for the door of the tent of meeting,

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> and the hangings of the court, and the
screen for the door of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the
altar round about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof.

<span id="an_3:27">3:27</span> And of Kohath was the family of the
Amramites, and the family of the Izharites, and the family of the
Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites: these are the families of
the Kohathites.

<span id="an_3:28">3:28</span> According to the number of all the males,
from a month old and upward, there were eight thousand and six hundred,
keeping the charge of the sanctuary.

<span id="an_3:29">3:29</span> The families of the sons of Kohath shall
encamp on the side of the tabernacle southward.

<span id="an_3:30">3:30</span> And the prince of the fathers' house of
the families of the Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.

<span id="an_3:31">3:31</span> And their charge shall be the ark, and
the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the
sanctuary wherewith they minister, and the screen, and all the service
thereof.

<span id="an_3:32">3:32</span> And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest
shall be prince of the princes of the Levites, \[and have\] the
oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary.

<span id="an_3:33">3:33</span> Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites,
and the family of the Mushites: these are the families of Merari.

<span id="an_3:34">3:34</span> And those that were numbered of them,
according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward,
were six thousand and two hundred.

<span id="an_3:35">3:35</span> And the prince of the fathers' house of
the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail: they shall encamp
on the side of the tabernacle northward.

<span id="an_3:36">3:36</span> And the appointed charge of the sons of
Merari shall be the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and
the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the instruments
thereof, and all the service thereof,

<span id="an_3:37">3:37</span> and the pillars of the court round about,
and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords.

<span id="an_3:38">3:38</span> And those that encamp before the
tabernacle eastward, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrising,
shall be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the
sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the stranger
that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

<span id="an_3:39">3:39</span> All that were numbered of the Levites,
whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of Jehovah, by their
families, all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two
thousand.

<span id="an_3:40">3:40</span> And Jehovah said unto Moses, Number all
the first-born males of the children of Israel from a month old and
upward, and take the number of their names.

<span id="an_3:41">3:41</span> And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I
am Jehovah) instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel;
and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the
cattle of the children of Israel:

<span id="an_3:42">3:42</span> and Moses numbered, as Jehovah commanded
him, all the first-born among the children of Israel.

<span id="an_3:43">3:43</span> And all the first-born males according to
the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were
numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and
threescore and thirteen.

<span id="an_3:44">3:44</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_3:45">3:45</span> Take the Levites instead of all the
first-born among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites
instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am Jehovah.

<span id="an_3:46">3:46</span> And for the redemption of the two hundred
and threescore and thirteen of the first-born of the children of Israel,
that are over and above \[the number of\] the Levites,

<span id="an_3:47">3:47</span> thou shalt take five shekels apiece by
the poll; after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them (the
shekel is twenty gerahs):

<span id="an_3:48">3:48</span> and thou shalt give the money, wherewith
the odd number of them is redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons.

<span id="an_3:49">3:49</span> And Moses took the redemption-money from
them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites;

<span id="an_3:50">3:50</span> from the first-born of the children of
Israel took he the money, a thousand three hundred and threescore and
five \[shekels\], after the shekel of the sanctuary:

<span id="an_3:51">3:51</span> and Moses gave the redemption-money unto
Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of Jehovah, as Jehovah
commanded Moses.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto
Aaron, saying,

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from
among the sons of Levi, by their families, by their fathers' houses,

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> from thirty years old and upward even until
fifty years old, all that enter upon the service, to do the work in the
tent of meeting.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> This is the service of the sons of Kohath
in the tent of meeting, \[about\] the most holy things:

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall
go in, and his sons, and they shall take down the veil of the screen,
and cover the ark of the testimony with it,

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> and shall put thereon a covering of
sealskin, and shall spread over it a cloth all of blue, and shall put in
the staves thereof.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> And upon the table of showbread they shall
spread a cloth of blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and
the bowls and the cups wherewith to pour out; and the continual bread
shall be thereon:

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> and they shall spread upon them a cloth of
scarlet, and cover the same with a covering of sealskin, and shall put
in the staves thereof.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> And they shall take a cloth of blue, and
cover the candlestick of the light, and its lamps, and its snuffers, and
its snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they
minister unto it:

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> and they shall put it and all the vessels
thereof within a covering of sealskin, and shall put it upon the frame.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> And upon the golden altar they shall
spread a cloth of blue, and cover it with a covering of sealskin, and
shall put in the staves thereof:

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> and they shall take all the vessels of
ministry, wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a
cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of sealskin, and shall put
them on the frame.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> And they shall take away the ashes from
the altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon:

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> and they shall put upon it all the
vessels thereof, wherewith they minister about it, the firepans, the
flesh-hooks, and the shovels, and the basins, all the vessels of the
altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering of sealskin, and put in
the staves thereof.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> And when Aaron and his sons have made an
end of covering the sanctuary, and all the furniture of the sanctuary,
as the camp is set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to
bear it: but they shall not touch the sanctuary, lest they die. These
things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> And the charge of Eleazar the son of
Aaron the priest shall be the oil for the light, and the sweet incense,
and the continual meal-offering, and the anointing oil, the charge of
all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is, the sanctuary, and the
furniture thereof.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto
Aaron, saying,

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> Cut ye not off the tribe of the families
of the Kohathites from among the Levites;

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> but thus do unto them, that they may
live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron
and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and
to his burden;

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> but they shall not go in to see the
sanctuary even for a moment, lest they die.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> Take the sum of the sons of Gershon also,
by their fathers' houses, by their families;

<span id="an_4:23">4:23</span> from thirty years old and upward until
fifty years old shalt thou number them; all that enter in to wait upon
the service, to do the work in the tent of meeting.

<span id="an_4:24">4:24</span> This is the service of the families of
the Gershonites, in serving and in bearing burdens:

<span id="an_4:25">4:25</span> they shall bear the curtains of the
tabernacle, and the tent of meeting, its covering, and the covering of
sealskin that is above upon it, and the screen for the door of the tent
of meeting,

<span id="an_4:26">4:26</span> and the hangings of the court, and the
screen for the door of the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle
and by the altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments
of their service, and whatsoever shall be done with them: therein shall
they serve.

<span id="an_4:27">4:27</span> At the commandment of Aaron and his sons
shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their
burden, and in all their service; and ye shall appoint unto them in
charge all their burden.

<span id="an_4:28">4:28</span> This is the service of the families of
the sons of the Gershonites in the tent of meeting: and their charge
shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

<span id="an_4:29">4:29</span> As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt
number them by their families, by their fathers' houses;

<span id="an_4:30">4:30</span> from thirty years old and upward even
unto fifty years old shalt thou number them, every one that entereth
upon the service, to do the work of the tent of meeting.

<span id="an_4:31">4:31</span> And this is the charge of their burden,
according to all their service in the tent of meeting: the boards of the
tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the
sockets thereof,

<span id="an_4:32">4:32</span> and the pillars of the court round about,
and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords, with all their
instruments, and with all their service: and by name ye shall appoint
the instruments of the charge of their burden.

<span id="an_4:33">4:33</span> This is the service of the families of
the sons of Merari, according to all their service, in the tent of
meeting, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

<span id="an_4:34">4:34</span> And Moses and Aaron and the princes of
the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families,
and by their fathers' houses,

<span id="an_4:35">4:35</span> from thirty years old and upward even
unto fifty years old, every one that entered upon the service, for work
in the tent of meeting:

<span id="an_4:36">4:36</span> and those that were numbered of them by
their families were two thousand seven hundred and fifty.

<span id="an_4:37">4:37</span> These are they that were numbered of the
families of the Kohathites, all that did serve in the tent of meeting,
whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of Jehovah by
Moses.

<span id="an_4:38">4:38</span> And those that were numbered of the sons
of Gershon, their families, and by their fathers' houses,

<span id="an_4:39">4:39</span> from thirty years old and upward even
unto fifty years old, every one that entered upon the service, for work
in the tent of meeting,

<span id="an_4:40">4:40</span> even those that were numbered of them, by
their families, by their fathers' houses, were two thousand and six
hundred and thirty.

<span id="an_4:41">4:41</span> These are they that were numbered of the
families of the sons of Gershon, all that did serve in the tent of
meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of
Jehovah.

<span id="an_4:42">4:42</span> And those that were numbered of the
families of the sons of Merari, by their families, by their fathers'
houses,

<span id="an_4:43">4:43</span> from thirty years old and upward even
unto fifty years old, every one that entered upon the service, for work
in the tent of meeting,

<span id="an_4:44">4:44</span> even those that were numbered of them by
their families, were three thousand and two hundred.

<span id="an_4:45">4:45</span> These are they that were numbered of the
families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according
to the commandment of Jehovah by Moses.

<span id="an_4:46">4:46</span> All those that were numbered of the
Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the princes of Israel numbered, by
their families, and by their fathers' houses,

<span id="an_4:47">4:47</span> from thirty years old and upward even
unto fifty years old, every one that entered in to do the work of
service, and the work of bearing burdens in the tent of meeting,

<span id="an_4:48">4:48</span> even those that were numbered of them,
were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore.

<span id="an_4:49">4:49</span> According to the commandment of Jehovah
they were numbered by Moses, every one according to his service, and
according to his burden: thus were they numbered of him, as Jehovah
commanded Moses.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Command the children of Israel, that they
put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and
whosoever is unclean by the dead:

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> both male and female shall ye put out,
without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camp, in
the midst whereof I dwell.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> And the children of Israel did so, and put
them out without the camp; as Jehovah spake unto Moses, so did the
children of Israel.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, When a
man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, so as to trespass
against Jehovah, and that soul shall be guilty;

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> then he shall confess his sin which he hath
done: and he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and add unto
it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him in respect of whom he
hath been guilty.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> But if the man have no kinsman to whom
restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which
is made unto Jehovah shall be the priest's; besides the ram of the
atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> And every heave-offering of all the holy
things of the children of Israel, which they present unto the priest,
shall be his.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> And every man's hallowed things shall be
his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, and
say unto them, If any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against
him,

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> and a man lie with her carnally, and it
be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be
defiled, and there be no witness against her, and she be not taken in
the act;

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> and the spirit of jealousy come upon him,
and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of
jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not
defiled:

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> then shall the man bring his wife unto
the priest, and shall bring her oblation for her, the tenth part of an
ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense
thereon; for it is a meal-offering of jealousy, a meal-offering of
memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> And the priest shall bring her near, and
set her before Jehovah:

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> and the priest shall take holy water in
an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the
tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> And the priest shall set the woman before
Jehovah, and let the hair of the woman's head go loose, and put the
meal-offering of memorial in her hands, which is the meal-offering of
jealousy: and the priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness
that causeth the curse.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> And the priest shall cause her to swear,
and shall say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou
have not gone aside to uncleanness, being under thy husband, be thou
free from this water of bitterness that causeth the curse.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> But if thou have gone aside, being under
thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee
besides thy husband:

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> then the priest shall cause the woman to
swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman,
Jehovah make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when Jehovah
doth make thy thigh to fall away, and thy body to swell;

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> and this water that causeth the curse
shall go into thy bowels, and make thy body to swell, and thy thigh to
fall away. And the woman shall say, Amen, Amen.

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> And the priest shall write these curses
in a book, and he shall blot them out into the water of bitterness:

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> and he shall make the woman drink the
water of bitterness that causeth the curse; and the water that causeth
the curse shall enter into her \[and become\] bitter.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> And the priest shall take the
meal-offering of jealousy out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the
meal-offering before Jehovah, and bring it unto the altar:

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> and the priest shall take a handful of
the meal-offering, as the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar,
and afterward shall make the woman drink the water.

<span id="an_5:27">5:27</span> And when he hath made her drink the
water, then it shall come to pass, if she be defiled, and have committed
a trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse
shall enter into her \[and become\] bitter, and her body shall swell,
and her thigh shall fall away: and the woman shall be a curse among her
people.

<span id="an_5:28">5:28</span> And if the woman be not defiled, but be
clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.

<span id="an_5:29">5:29</span> This is the law of jealousy, when a wife,
being under her husband, goeth aside, and is defiled;

<span id="an_5:30">5:30</span> or when the spirit of jealousy cometh
upon a man, and he is jealous of his wife; then shall he set the woman
before Jehovah, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.

<span id="an_5:31">5:31</span> And the man shall be free from iniquity,
and that woman shall bear her iniquity.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say
unto them, When either man or woman shall make a special vow, the vow of
a Nazirite, to separate himself unto Jehovah,

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> he shall separate himself from wine and
strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong
drink, neither shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes
or dried.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> All the days of his separation shall he eat
nothing that is made of the grape-vine, from the kernels even to the
husk.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> All the days of his vow of separation there
shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in which
he separateth himself unto Jehovah, he shall be holy; he shall let the
locks of the hair of his head grow long.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> All the days that he separateth himself
unto Jehovah he shall not come near to a dead body.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> He shall not make himself unclean for his
father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they
die; because his separation unto God is upon his head.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> All the days of his separation he is holy
unto Jehovah.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> And if any man die very suddenly beside
him, and he defile the head of his separation; then he shall shave his
head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> And on the eighth day he shall bring two
turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the
tent of meeting:

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> and the priest shall offer one for a
sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and make atonement for
him, for that he sinned by reason of the dead, and shall hallow his head
that same day.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> And he shall separate unto Jehovah the
days of his separation, and shall bring a he-lamb a year old for a
trespass-offering; but the former days shall be void, because his
separation was defiled.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> And this is the law of the Nazirite, when
the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the
door of the tent of meeting:

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> and he shall offer his oblation unto
Jehovah, one he-lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering,
and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish for a sin-offering, and one
ram without blemish for peace-offerings,

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes
of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil,
and their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> And the priest shall present them before
Jehovah, and shall offer his sin-offering, and his burnt-offering:

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> and he shall offer the ram for a
sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah, with the basket of unleavened
bread: the priest shall offer also the meal-offering thereof, and the
drink-offering thereof.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> And the Nazirite shall shave the head of
his separation at the door of the tent of meeting, and shall take the
hair of the head of his separation, and put it on the fire which is
under the sacrifice of peace-offerings.

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> And the priest shall take the boiled
shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one
unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazirite,
after he hath shaven \[the head of\] his separation;

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> and the priest shall wave them for a
wave-offering before Jehovah; this is holy for the priest, together with
the wave-breast and heave-thigh: and after that the Nazirite may drink
wine.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> This is the law of the Nazirite who
voweth, \[and of\] his oblation unto Jehovah for his separation, besides
that which he is able to get: according to his vow which he voweth, so
he must do after the law of his separation.

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons,
saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel: ye shall say
unto them,

<span id="an_6:24">6:24</span> Jehovah bless thee, and keep thee:

<span id="an_6:25">6:25</span> Jehovah make his face to shine upon thee,
and be gracious unto thee:

<span id="an_6:26">6:26</span> Jehovah lift up his countenance upon
thee, and give thee peace.

<span id="an_6:27">6:27</span> So shall they put my name upon the
children of Israel; and I will bless them.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> And it came to pass on the day that Moses
had made an end of setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and
sanctified it, and all the furniture thereof, and the altar and all the
vessels thereof, and had anointed them and sanctified them;

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> that the princes of Israel, the heads of
their fathers' houses, offered. These were the princes of the tribes,
these are they that were over them that were numbered:

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> and they brought their oblation before
Jehovah, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two of
the princes, and for each one an ox: and they presented them before the
tabernacle.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> Take it of them, that they may be \[used\]
in doing the service of the tent of meeting; and thou shalt give them
unto the Levites, to every man according to his service.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and
gave them unto the Levites.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the
sons of Gershon, according to their service:

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto
the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of
Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none,
because the service of the sanctuary belonged unto them; they bare it
upon their shoulders.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> And the princes offered for the
dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the
princes offered their oblation before the altar.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> And Jehovah said unto Moses, They shall
offer their oblation, each prince on his day, for the dedication of the
altar.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> And he that offered his oblation the
first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah:

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> and his oblation was one silver platter,
the weight whereof was a hundred and thirty \[shekels\], one silver bowl
of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them full
of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering;

of incense;

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> and for the sacrifice of peace-offerings,
two oxen, five rams, five he-goats, five he-lambs a year old: this was
the oblation of Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> On the second day Nethanel the son of

<span id="an_7:89">7:89</span> And when Moses went into the tent of
meeting to speak with him, then he heard the Voice speaking unto him
from above the mercy-seat that was upon the ark of the testimony, from
between the two cherubim: and he spake unto him.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When
thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of
the candlestick.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps
thereof \[so as to give light\] in front of the candlestick, as Jehovah
commanded Moses.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> And this was the work of the candlestick,
beaten work of gold; unto the base thereof, \[and\] unto the flowers
thereof, it was beaten work: according unto the pattern which Jehovah
had showed Moses, so he made the candlestick.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> Take the Levites from among the children of
Israel, and cleanse them.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> And thus shalt thou do unto them, to
cleanse them: sprinkle the water of expiation upon them, and let them
cause a razor to pass over all their flesh, and let them wash their
clothes, and cleanse themselves.

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> Then let them take a young bullock, and its
meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil; and another young bullock
shalt thou take for a sin-offering.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> And thou shalt present the Levites before
the tent of meeting: and thou shalt assemble the whole congregation of
the children of Israel:

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> and thou shalt present the Levites before
Jehovah. And the children of Israel shall lay their hands upon the
Levites:

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> and Aaron shall offer the Levites before
Jehovah for a wave-offering, on the behalf of the children of Israel,
that it may be theirs to do the service of Jehovah.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> And the Levites shall lay their hands
upon the heads of the bullocks: and offer thou the one for a
sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, unto Jehovah, to make
atonement for the Levites.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> And thou shalt set the Levites before
Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for a wave-offering unto
Jehovah.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from
among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> And after that shall the Levites go in to
do the service of the tent of meeting: and thou shalt cleanse them, and
offer them for a wave-offering.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> For they are wholly given unto me from
among the children of Israel; instead of all that openeth the womb, even
the first-born of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> For all the first-born among the children
of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote all the
first-born in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> And I have taken the Levites instead of
all the first-born among the children of Israel.

<span id="an_8:19">8:19</span> And I have given the Levites as a gift to
Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the
service of the children of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make
atonement for the children of Israel; that there be no plague among the
children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the
sanctuary.

<span id="an_8:20">8:20</span> Thus did Moses, and Aaron, and all the
congregation of the children of Israel, unto the Levites: according unto
all that Jehovah commanded Moses touching the Levites, so did the
children of Israel unto them.

<span id="an_8:21">8:21</span> And the Levites purified themselves from
sin, and they washed their clothes: and Aaron offered them for a
wave-offering before Jehovah; and Aaron made atonement for them to
cleanse them.

<span id="an_8:22">8:22</span> And after that went the Levites in to do
their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron, and before his sons:
as Jehovah had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto
them.

<span id="an_8:23">8:23</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_8:24">8:24</span> This is that which belongeth unto the
Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to
wait upon the service in the work of the tent of meeting:

<span id="an_8:25">8:25</span> and from the age of fifty years they
shall cease waiting upon the work, and shall serve no more,

<span id="an_8:26">8:26</span> but shall minister with their brethren in
the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus
shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charges.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the
wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they
were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> Moreover let the children of Israel keep
the passover in its appointed season.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> In the fourteenth day of this month, at
even, ye shall keep it in its appointed season: according to all the
statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances thereof, shall ye
keep it.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> And Moses spake unto the children of
Israel, that they should keep the passover.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> And they kept the passover in the first
\[month\], on the fourteenth day of the month, at even, in the
wilderness of Sinai: according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so
did the children of Israel.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> And there were certain men, who were
unclean by reason of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep
the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on
that day:

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> and those men said unto him, We are unclean
by reason of the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we
may not offer the oblation of Jehovah in its appointed season among the
children of Israel?

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> And Moses said unto them, Stay ye, that I
may hear what Jehovah will command concerning you.

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> Speak unto the children of Israel,
saying, If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by
reason of a dead body, or be on a journey afar off, yet he shall keep
the passover unto Jehovah.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> In the second month on the fourteenth day
at even they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and
bitter herbs:

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> they shall leave none of it unto the
morning, nor break a bone thereof: according to all the statute of the
passover they shall keep it.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> But the man that is clean, and is not on
a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut
off from his people; because he offered not the oblation of Jehovah in
its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> And if a stranger shall sojourn among
you, and will keep the passover unto Jehovah; according to the statute
of the passover, and according to the ordinance thereof, so shall he do:
ye shall have one statute, both for the sojourner, and for him that is
born in the land.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> And on the day that the tabernacle was
reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the
testimony: and at even it was upon the tabernacle as it were the
appearance of fire, until morning.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> So it was alway: the cloud covered it,
and the appearance of fire by night.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> And whenever the cloud was taken up from
over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in
the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel encamped.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> At the commandment of Jehovah the
children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of Jehovah they
encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained
encamped.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> And when the cloud tarried upon the
tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of
Jehovah, and journeyed not.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> And sometimes the cloud was a few days
upon the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of Jehovah they
remained encamped, and according to the commandment of Jehovah they
journeyed.

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> And sometimes the cloud was from evening
until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they
journeyed: or \[if it continued\] by day and by night, when the cloud
was taken up, they journeyed.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> Whether it were two days, or a month, or
a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding thereon, the
children of Israel remained encamped, and journeyed not; but when it was
taken up, they journeyed.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> At the commandment of Jehovah they
encamped, and at the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed: they kept
the charge of Jehovah, at the commandment of Jehovah by Moses.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> Make thee two trumpets of silver; of
beaten work shalt thou make them: and thou shalt use them for the
calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> And when they shall blow them, all the
congregation shall gather themselves unto thee at the door of the tent
of meeting.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> And if they blow but one, then the
princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves
unto thee.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that
lie on the east side shall take their journey.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> And when ye blow an alarm the second
time, the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey:
they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> But when the assembly is to be gathered
together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall
blow the trumpets; and they shall be to you for a statute for ever
throughout your generations.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> And when ye go to war in your land
against the adversary that oppresseth you, then ye shall sound an alarm
with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before Jehovah your God,
and ye shall be saved from your enemies.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> Also in the day of your gladness, and
in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow
the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your
peace-offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your
God: I am Jehovah your God.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> And it came to pass in the second year,
in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud
was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> And the children of Israel set forward
according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the
cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> And they first took their journey
according to the commandment of Jehovah by Moses.

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> And in the first \[place\] the standard
of the camp of the children of Judah set forward according to their
hosts: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> And over the host of the tribe of the
children of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> And over the host of the tribe of the
children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> And the tabernacle was taken down; and
the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bare the tabernacle, set
forward.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> And the standard of the camp of Reuben
set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Elizur the
son of Shedeur.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> And over the host of the tribe of the
children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

<span id="an_10:20">10:20</span> And over the host of the tribe of the
children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.

<span id="an_10:21">10:21</span> And the Kohathites set forward, bearing
the sanctuary: and \[the others\] did set up the tabernacle against
their coming.

<span id="an_10:22">10:22</span> And the standard of the camp of the
children of Ephraim set forward according to their hosts: and over his
host was Elishama the son of Ammihud.

<span id="an_10:23">10:23</span> And over the host of the tribe of the
children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

<span id="an_10:24">10:24</span> And over the host of the tribe of the
children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.

<span id="an_10:25">10:25</span> And the standard of the camp of the
children of Dan, which was the rearward of all the camps, set forward
according to their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of
Ammishaddai.

<span id="an_10:26">10:26</span> And over the host of the tribe of the
children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran.

<span id="an_10:27">10:27</span> And over the host of the tribe of the
children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.

<span id="an_10:28">10:28</span> Thus were the journeyings of the
children of Israel according to their hosts; and they set forward.

<span id="an_10:29">10:29</span> And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of
Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, We are journeying unto the
place of which Jehovah said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and
we will do thee good; for Jehovah hath spoken good concerning Israel.

<span id="an_10:30">10:30</span> And he said unto him, I will not go;
but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.

<span id="an_10:31">10:31</span> And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee;
forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and
thou shalt be to us instead of eyes.

<span id="an_10:32">10:32</span> And it shall be, if thou go with us,
yea, it shall be, that what good soever Jehovah shall do unto us, the
same will we do unto thee.

<span id="an_10:33">10:33</span> And they set forward from the mount of
Jehovah three days' journey; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went
before them three days' journey, to seek out a resting-place for them.

<span id="an_10:34">10:34</span> And the cloud of Jehovah was over them
by day, when they set forward from the camp.

<span id="an_10:35">10:35</span> And it came to pass, when the ark set
forward, that Moses said, Rise up, O Jehovah, and let thine enemies be
scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.

<span id="an_10:36">10:36</span> And when it rested, he said, Return, O
Jehovah, unto the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> And the people were as murmurers,
\[speaking\] evil in the ears of Jehovah: and when Jehovah heard it, his
anger was kindled; and the fire of Jehovah burnt among them, and
devoured in the uttermost part of the camp.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> And the people cried unto Moses; and
Moses prayed unto Jehovah, and the fire abated.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> And the name of that place was called
Taberah, because the fire of Jehovah burnt among them.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> And the mixed multitude that was among
them lusted exceedingly: and the children of Israel also wept again, and
said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> We remember the fish, which we did eat in
Egypt for nought; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the
onions, and the garlic:

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> but now our soul is dried away; there is
nothing at all save this manna to look upon.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> And the manna was like coriander seed,
and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> The people went about, and gathered it,
and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots,
and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> And when the dew fell upon the camp in
the night, the manna fell upon it.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> And Moses heard the people weeping
throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent: and the
anger of Jehovah was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> And Moses said unto Jehovah, Wherefore
hast thou dealt ill with thy servant? and wherefore have I not found
favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon
me?

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> Have I conceived all this people? have
I brought them forth, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy
bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child, unto the land
which thou swarest unto their fathers?

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> Whence should I have flesh to give unto
all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we
may eat.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> I am not able to bear all this people
alone, because it is too heavy for me.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> And if thou deal thus with me, kill me,
I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight; and let me
not see my wretchedness.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> And Jehovah said unto Moses, Gather
unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the
elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the
tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> And I will come down and talk with thee
there: and I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it
upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that
thou bear it not thyself alone.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> And say thou unto the people, Sanctify
yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept
in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it
was well with us in Egypt: therefore Jehovah will give you flesh, and ye
shall eat.

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days,
nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> but a whole month, until it come out at
your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you; because that ye have
rejected Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why
came we forth out of Egypt?

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> And Moses said, The people, among whom
I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give
them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> Shall flocks and herds be slain for
them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered
together for them, to suffice them?

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> And Jehovah said unto Moses, Is
Jehovah's hand waxed short? now shalt thou see whether my word shall
come to pass unto thee or not.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> And Moses went out, and told the people
the words of Jehovah: and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the
people, and set them round about the Tent.

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> And Jehovah came down in the cloud, and
spake unto him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and put it
upon the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the Spirit
rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> But there remained two men in the camp,
the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the
Spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but
had not gone out unto the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> And there ran a young man, and told
Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister
of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses,
forbid them.

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> And Moses said unto him, Art thou
jealous for my sake? would that all Jehovah's people were prophets, that
Jehovah would put his Spirit upon them!

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> And Moses gat him into the camp, he and
the elders of Israel.

<span id="an_11:31">11:31</span> And there went forth a wind from
Jehovah, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp,
about a day's journey on this side, and a day's journey on the other
side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the
earth.

<span id="an_11:32">11:32</span> And the people rose up all that day,
and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he
that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad
for themselves round about the camp.

<span id="an_11:33">11:33</span> While the flesh was yet between their
teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the
people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague.

<span id="an_11:34">11:34</span> And the name of that place was called
Kibrothhattaavah, because there they buried the people that lusted.

<span id="an_11:35">11:35</span> From Kibrothhattaavah the people
journeyed unto Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses
because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a
Cushite woman.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> And they said, Hath Jehovah indeed spoken
only with Moses? hath he not spoken also with us? And Jehovah heard it.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> Now the man Moses was very meek, above
all the men that were upon the face of the earth.

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> And Jehovah spake suddenly unto Moses,
and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tent of
meeting. And they three came out.

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> And Jehovah came down in a pillar of
cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam;
and they both came forth.

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> And he said, Hear now my words: if there
be a prophet among you, I Jehovah will make myself known unto him in a
vision, I will speak with him in a dream.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> My servant Moses is not so; he is
faithful in all my house:

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> with him will I speak mouth to mouth,
even manifestly, and not in dark speeches; and the form of Jehovah shall
he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my
servant, against Moses?

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> And the anger of Jehovah was kindled
against them; and he departed.

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> And the cloud removed from over the
Tent; and, behold, Miriam was leprous, as \[white as\] snow: and Aaron
looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> And Aaron said unto Moses, Oh, my lord,
lay not, I pray thee, sin upon us, for that we have done foolishly, and
for that we have sinned.

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of
whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb.

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> And Moses cried unto Jehovah, saying,
Heal her, O God, I beseech thee.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> And Jehovah said unto Moses, If her
father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days?
let her be shut up without the camp seven days, and after that she shall
be brought in again.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> And Miriam was shut up without the camp
seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in
again.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> And afterward the people journeyed from
Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> Send thou men, that they may spy out the
land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe
of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a prince among them.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> And Moses sent them from the wilderness
of Paran according to the commandment of Jehovah: all of them men who
were heads of the children of Israel.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> And these were their names: Of the tribe
of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son
of Hori.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of
Jephunneh.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of
Joseph.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son
of Nun.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son
of Raphu.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the
son of Sodi.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> Of the tribe of Joseph, \[namely\], of
the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of
Gemalli.

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son
of Michael.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son
of Vophsi.

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of
Machi.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> These are the names of the men that
Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun
Joshua.

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> And Moses sent them to spy out the land
of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way by the South, and go
up into the hill-country:

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> and see the land, what it is; and the
people that dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they
are few or many;

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> and what the land is that they dwell
in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell
in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> and what the land is, whether it is fat
or lean, whether there is wood therein, or not. And be ye of good
courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time
of the first-ripe grapes.

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> So they went up, and spied out the land
from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> And they went up by the South, and came
unto Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were
there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)

<span id="an_13:23">13:23</span> And they came unto the valley of
Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes,
and they bare it upon a staff between two; \[they brought\] also of the
pomegranates, and of the figs.

<span id="an_13:24">13:24</span> That place was called the valley of
Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down
from thence.

<span id="an_13:25">13:25</span> And they returned from spying out the
land at the end of forty days.

<span id="an_13:26">13:26</span> And they went and came to Moses, and to
Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the
wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and
unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.

<span id="an_13:27">13:27</span> And they told him, and said, We came
unto the land whither thou sentest us; and surely it floweth with milk
and honey; and this is the fruit of it.

<span id="an_13:28">13:28</span> Howbeit the people that dwell in the
land are strong, and the cities are fortified, \[and\] very great: and
moreover we saw the children of Anak there.

<span id="an_13:29">13:29</span> Amalek dwelleth in the land of the
South: and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the
hill-country; and the Canaanite dwelleth by the sea, and along by the
side of the Jordan.

<span id="an_13:30">13:30</span> And Caleb stilled the people before
Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well
able to overcome it.

<span id="an_13:31">13:31</span> But the men that went up with him said,
We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than
we.

<span id="an_13:32">13:32</span> And they brought up an evil report of
the land which they had spied out unto the children of Israel, saying,
The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that
eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it
are men of great stature.

<span id="an_13:33">13:33</span> And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons
of Anak, who come of the Nephilim: and we were in our own sight as
grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> And all the congregation lifted up their
voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> And all the children of Israel murmured
against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto
them, Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would that we had
died in this wilderness!

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> And wherefore doth Jehovah bring us unto
this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be a
prey: were it not better for us to return into Egypt?

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> And they said one to another, Let us make
a captain, and let us return into Egypt.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces
before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the
son of Jephunneh, who were of them that spied out the land, rent their
clothes:

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> and they spake unto all the congregation
of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to
spy it out, is an exceeding good land.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> If Jehovah delight in us, then he will
bring us into this land, and give it unto us; a land which floweth with
milk and honey.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> Only rebel not against Jehovah, neither
fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence
is removed from over them, and Jehovah is with us: fear them not.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> But all the congregation bade stone
them with stones. And the glory of Jehovah appeared in the tent of
meeting unto all the children of Israel.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> And Jehovah said unto Moses, How long
will this people despise me? and how long will they not believe in me,
for all the signs which I have wrought among them?

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> I will smite them with the pestilence,
and disinherit them, and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier
than they.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> And Moses said unto Jehovah, Then the
Egyptians will hear it; for thou broughtest up this people in thy might
from among them;

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> and they will tell it to the
inhabitants of this land. They have heard that thou Jehovah art in the
midst of this people; for thou Jehovah art seen face to face, and thy
cloud standeth over them, and thou goest before them, in a pillar of
cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> Now if thou shalt kill this people as
one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak,
saying,

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> Because Jehovah was not able to bring
this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath
slain them in the wilderness.

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> And now, I pray thee, let the power of
the Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,

<span id="an_14:18">14:18</span> Jehovah is slow to anger, and abundant
in lovingkindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression; and that will
by no means clear \[the guilty\], visiting the iniquity of the fathers
upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation.

<span id="an_14:19">14:19</span> Pardon, I pray thee, the iniquity of
this people according unto the greatness of thy lovingkindness, and
according as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.

<span id="an_14:20">14:20</span> And Jehovah said, I have pardoned
according to thy word:

<span id="an_14:21">14:21</span> but in very deed, as I live, and as all
the earth shall be filled with the glory of Jehovah;

<span id="an_14:22">14:22</span> because all those men that have seen my
glory, and my signs, which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet
have tempted me these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;

<span id="an_14:23">14:23</span> surely they shall not see the land
which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that
despised me see it:

<span id="an_14:24">14:24</span> but my servant Caleb, because he had
another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring
into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.

<span id="an_14:25">14:25</span> Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite
dwell in the valley: to-morrow turn ye, and get you into the wilderness
by the way to the Red Sea.

<span id="an_14:26">14:26</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto
Aaron, saying,

<span id="an_14:27">14:27</span> How long \[shall I bear\] with this
evil congregation, that murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings
of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.

<span id="an_14:28">14:28</span> Say unto them, As I live, saith
Jehovah, surely as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:

<span id="an_14:29">14:29</span> your dead bodies shall fall in this
wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole
number, from twenty years old and upward, that have murmured against me,

<span id="an_14:30">14:30</span> surely ye shall not come into the land,
concerning which I sware that I would make you dwell therein, save Caleb
the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

<span id="an_14:31">14:31</span> But your little ones, that ye said
should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land
which ye have rejected.

<span id="an_14:32">14:32</span> But as for you, your dead bodies shall
fall in this wilderness.

<span id="an_14:33">14:33</span> And your children shall be wanderers in
the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your whoredoms, until your
dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness.

<span id="an_14:34">14:34</span> After the number of the days in which
ye spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, shall ye
bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my alienation.

<span id="an_14:35">14:35</span> I, Jehovah, have spoken, surely this
will I do unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together
against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they
shall die.

<span id="an_14:36">14:36</span> And the men, whom Moses sent to spy out
the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against
him, by bringing up an evil report against the land,

<span id="an_14:37">14:37</span> even those men that did bring up an
evil report of the land, died by the plague before Jehovah.

<span id="an_14:38">14:38</span> But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb
the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men that went to spy out
the land.

<span id="an_14:39">14:39</span> And Moses told these words unto all the
children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.

<span id="an_14:40">14:40</span> And they rose up early in the morning,
and gat them up to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we are here, and
will go up unto the place which Jehovah hath promised: for we have
sinned.

<span id="an_14:41">14:41</span> And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye
transgress the commandment of Jehovah, seeing it shall not prosper?

<span id="an_14:42">14:42</span> Go not up, for Jehovah is not among
you; that ye be not smitten down before your enemies.

<span id="an_14:43">14:43</span> For there the Amalekite and the
Canaanite are before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are
turned back from following Jehovah, therefore Jehovah will not be with
you.

<span id="an_14:44">14:44</span> But they presumed to go up to the top
of the mountain: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and
Moses, departed not out of the camp.

<span id="an_14:45">14:45</span> Then the Amalekite came down, and the
Canaanite who dwelt in that mountain, and smote them and beat them down,
even unto Hormah.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, and
say unto them, When ye are come into the land of your habitations, which
I give unto you,

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> and will make an offering by fire unto
Jehovah, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a
freewill-offering, or in your set feasts, to make a sweet savor unto
Jehovah, of the herd, or of the flock;

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> then shall he that offereth his oblation
offer unto Jehovah a meal-offering of a tenth part \[of an ephah\] of
fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil:

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> and wine for the drink-offering, the
fourth part of a hin, shalt thou prepare with the burnt-offering, or for
the sacrifice, for each lamb.

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a
meal-offering two tenth parts \[of an ephah\] of fine flour mingled with
the third part of a hin of oil:

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> and for the drink-offering thou shalt
offer the third part of a hin of wine, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> And when thou preparest a bullock for a
burnt-offering, or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for
peace-offerings unto Jehovah;

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> then shall he offer with the bullock a
meal-offering of three tenth parts \[of an ephah\] of fine flour mingled
with half a hin of oil:

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> and thou shalt offer for the
drink-offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a
sweet savor unto Jehovah.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> Thus shall it be done for each bullock,
or for each ram, or for each of the he-lambs, or of the kids.

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> According to the number that ye shall
prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> All that are home-born shall do these
things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a
sweet savor unto Jehovah.

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> And if a stranger sojourn with you, or
whosoever may be among you throughout your generations, and will offer
an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah; as ye do, so he
shall do.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> For the assembly, there shall be one
statute for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth \[with you\], a
statute for ever throughout your generations: as ye are, so shall the
sojourner be before Jehovah.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> One law and one ordinance shall be for
you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, and
say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> then it shall be, that, when ye eat of
the bread of the land, ye shall offer up a heave-offering unto Jehovah.

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> Of the first of your dough ye shall
offer up a cake for a heave-offering: as the heave-offering of the
threshing-floor, so shall ye heave it.

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> Of the first of your dough ye shall
give unto Jehovah a heave-offering throughout your generations.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> And when ye shall err, and not observe
all these commandments, which Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses,

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> even all that Jehovah hath commanded
you by Moses, from the day that Jehovah gave commandment, and onward
throughout your generations;

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> then it shall be, if it be done
unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the
congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a
sweet savor unto Jehovah, with the meal-offering thereof, and the
drink-offering thereof, according to the ordinance, and one he-goat for
a sin-offering.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> And the priest shall make atonement for
all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be
forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their oblation, an
offering made by fire unto Jehovah, and their sin-offering before
Jehovah, for their error:

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> and all the congregation of the
children of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger that sojourneth
among them; for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly.

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> And if one person sin unwittingly, then
he shall offer a she-goat a year old for a sin-offering.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> And the priest shall make atonement for
the soul that erreth, when he sinneth unwittingly, before Jehovah, to
make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven.

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> Ye shall have one law for him that
doeth aught unwittingly, for him that is home-born among the children of
Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.

<span id="an_15:30">15:30</span> But the soul that doeth aught with a
high hand, whether he be home-born or a sojourner, the same blasphemeth
Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

<span id="an_15:31">15:31</span> Because he hath despised the word of
Jehovah, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut
off; his iniquity shall be upon him.

<span id="an_15:32">15:32</span> And while the children of Israel were
in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath
day.

<span id="an_15:33">15:33</span> And they that found him gathering
sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.

<span id="an_15:34">15:34</span> And they put him in ward, because it
had not been declared what should be done to him.

<span id="an_15:35">15:35</span> And Jehovah said unto Moses, The man
shall surely be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with
stones without the camp.

<span id="an_15:36">15:36</span> And all the congregation brought him
without the camp, and stoned him to death with stones; as Jehovah
commanded Moses.

<span id="an_15:37">15:37</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_15:38">15:38</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, and
bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments
throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of each
border a cord of blue:

<span id="an_15:39">15:39</span> and it shall be unto you for a fringe,
that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of Jehovah,
and do them; and that ye follow not after your own heart and your own
eyes, after which ye use to play the harlot;

<span id="an_15:40">15:40</span> that ye may remember and do all my
commandments, and be holy unto your God.

<span id="an_15:41">15:41</span> I am Jehovah your God, who brought you
out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Jehovah your God.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of
Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and
On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took \[men\]:

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> and they rose up before Moses, with
certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the
congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown;

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> and they assembled themselves together
against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much
upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and
Jehovah is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the
assembly of Jehovah?

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his
face:

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> and he spake unto Korah and unto all his
company, saying, In the morning Jehovah will show who are his, and who
is holy, and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he
shall choose will he cause to come near unto him.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> This do: take you censers, Korah, and all
his company;

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> and put fire in them, and put incense
upon them before Jehovah to-morrow: and it shall be that the man whom
Jehovah doth choose, he \[shall be\] holy: ye take too much upon you, ye
sons of Levi.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> And Moses said unto Korah, Hear now, ye
sons of Levi:

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> \[seemeth it but\] a small thing unto
you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of
Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of the
tabernacle of Jehovah, and to stand before the congregation to minister
unto them;

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> and that he hath brought thee near, and
all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee? and seek ye the priesthood
also?

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> Therefore thou and all thy company are
gathered together against Jehovah: and Aaron, what is he that ye murmur
against him?

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> And Moses sent to call Dathan and
Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, We will not come up:

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> is it a small thing that thou hast
brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in
the wilderness, but thou must needs make thyself also a prince over us?

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> Moreover thou hast not brought us into
a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields
and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come
up.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> And Moses was very wroth, and said unto
Jehovah, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from
them, neither have I hurt one of them.

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and
all thy company before Jehovah, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow:

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> and take ye every man his censer, and
put incense upon them, and bring ye before Jehovah every man his censer,
two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each his censer.

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> And they took every man his censer, and
put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the
tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> And Korah assembled all the
congregation against them unto the door of the tent of meeting: and the
glory of Jehovah appeared unto all the congregation.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto
Aaron, saying,

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> Separate yourselves from among this
congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> And they fell upon their faces, and
said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and
wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> Speak unto the congregation, saying,
Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

<span id="an_16:25">16:25</span> And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan
and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.

<span id="an_16:26">16:26</span> And he spake unto the congregation,
saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and
touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.

<span id="an_16:27">16:27</span> So they gat them up from the tabernacle
of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came
out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their
sons, and their little ones.

<span id="an_16:28">16:28</span> And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know
that Jehovah hath sent me to do all these works; for \[I have\] not
\[done them\] of mine own mind.

<span id="an_16:29">16:29</span> If these men die the common death of
all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then
Jehovah hath not sent me.

<span id="an_16:30">16:30</span> But if Jehovah make a new thing, and
the ground open its mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain
unto them, and they go down alive into Sheol; then ye shall understand
that these men have despised Jehovah.

<span id="an_16:31">16:31</span> And it came to pass, as he made an end
of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was
under them;

<span id="an_16:32">16:32</span> and the earth opened its mouth, and
swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that
appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.

<span id="an_16:33">16:33</span> So they, and all that appertained to
them, went down alive into Sheol: and the earth closed upon them, and
they perished from among the assembly.

<span id="an_16:34">16:34</span> And all Israel that were round about
them fled at the cry of them; for they said, Lest the earth swallow us
up.

<span id="an_16:35">16:35</span> And fire came forth from Jehovah, and
devoured the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense.

<span id="an_16:36">16:36</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_16:37">16:37</span> Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the
priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou
the fire yonder; for they are holy,

<span id="an_16:38">16:38</span> even the censers of these sinners
against their own lives; and let them be made beaten plates for a
covering of the altar: for they offered them before Jehovah; therefore
they are holy; and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.

<span id="an_16:39">16:39</span> And Eleazar the priest took the brazen
censers, which they that were burnt had offered; and they beat them out
for a covering of the altar,

<span id="an_16:40">16:40</span> to be a memorial unto the children of
Israel, to the end that no stranger, that is not of the seed of Aaron,
come near to burn incense before Jehovah; that he be not as Korah, and
as his company: as Jehovah spake unto him by Moses.

<span id="an_16:41">16:41</span> But on the morrow all the congregation
of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron,
saying, Ye have killed the people of Jehovah.

<span id="an_16:42">16:42</span> And it came to pass, when the
congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they
looked toward the tent of meeting: and, behold, the cloud covered it,
and the glory of Jehovah appeared.

<span id="an_16:43">16:43</span> And Moses and Aaron came to the front
of the tent of meeting.

<span id="an_16:44">16:44</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_16:45">16:45</span> Get you up from among this
congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell upon
their faces.

<span id="an_16:46">16:46</span> And Moses said unto Aaron, Take they
censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and lay incense
thereon, and carry it quickly unto the congregation, and make atonement
for them: for there is wrath gone out from Jehovah; the plague is begun.

<span id="an_16:47">16:47</span> And Aaron took as Moses spake, and ran
into the midst of the assembly; and, behold, the plague was begun among
the people: and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the
people.

<span id="an_16:48">16:48</span> And he stood between the dead and the
living; and the plague was stayed.

<span id="an_16:49">16:49</span> Now they that died by the plague were
fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the
matter of Korah.

<span id="an_16:50">16:50</span> And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the
door of the tent of meeting: and the plague was stayed.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, and
take of them rods, one for each fathers' house, of all their princes
according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods: write thou every man's
name upon his rod.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon
the rod of Levi; for there shall be one rod for each head of their
fathers' houses.

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of
meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> And it shall come to pass, that the rod
of the man whom I shall choose shall bud: and I will make to cease from
me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against
you.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> And Moses spake unto the children of
Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one,
according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of
Aaron was among their rods.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> And Moses laid up the rods before Jehovah
in the tent of the testimony.

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that
Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and, behold, the rod of Aaron
for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced
blossoms, and bare ripe almonds.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> And Moses brought out all the rods from
before Jehovah unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and
took every man his rod.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> And Jehovah said unto Moses, Put back
the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept for a token against
the children of rebellion; that thou mayest make an end of their
murmurings against me, that they die not.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> Thus did Moses: as Jehovah commanded
him, so did he.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> And the children of Israel spake unto
Moses, saying, Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> Every one that cometh near, that cometh
near unto the tabernacle of Jehovah, dieth: shall we perish all of us?

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Thou and thy
sons and thy fathers' house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the
sanctuary; and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of
your priesthood.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi,
the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be
joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with
thee shall be before the tent of the testimony.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> And they shall keep thy charge, and the
charge of all the Tent: only they shall not come nigh unto the vessels
of the sanctuary and unto the altar, that they die not, neither they,
nor ye.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> And they shall be joined unto thee, and
keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the Tent:
and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> And ye shall keep the charge of the
sanctuary, and the charge of the altar; that there be wrath no more upon
the children of Israel.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> And I, behold, I have taken your brethren
the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are a gift,
given unto Jehovah, to do the service of the tent of meeting.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> And thou and thy sons with thee shall
keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within
the veil; and ye shall serve: I give you the priesthood as a service of
gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> And Jehovah spake unto Aaron, And I,
behold, I have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings, even all the
hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them
by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, as a portion for ever.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> This shall be thine of the most holy
things, \[reserved\] from the fire: every oblation of theirs, even every
meal-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every
trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be
most holy for thee and for thy sons.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> As the most holy things shalt thou eat
thereof; every male shall eat thereof: it shall be holy unto thee.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> And this is thine: the heave-offering
of their gift, even all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel; I
have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with
thee, as a portion for ever; every one that is clean in thy house shall
eat thereof.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> All the best of the oil, and all the
best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first-fruits of them which
they give unto Jehovah, to thee have I given them.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> The first-ripe fruits of all that is in
their land, which they bring unto Jehovah, shall be thine; every one
that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> Everything devoted in Israel shall be
thine.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> Everything that openeth the womb, of
all flesh which they offer unto Jehovah, both of man and beast shall be
thine: nevertheless the first-born of man shalt thou surely redeem, and
the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> And those that are to be redeemed of
them from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation,
for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the
same is twenty gerahs).

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> But the firstling of a cow, or the
firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem;
they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt
burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor unto
Jehovah.

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> And the flesh of them shall be thine,
as the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine.

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> All the heave-offerings of the holy
things, which the children of Israel offer unto Jehovah, have I given
thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever:
it is a covenant of salt for ever before Jehovah unto thee and to thy
seed with thee.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Thou shalt
have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any portion
among them: I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of
Israel.

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> And unto the children of Levi, behold,
I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for
their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting.

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> And henceforth the children of Israel
shall not come nigh the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die.

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> But the Levites shall do the service of
the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a
statute for ever throughout your generations; and among the children of
Israel they shall have no inheritance.

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> For the tithe of the children of
Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering unto Jehovah, I have given
to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore I have said unto them,
Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> Moreover thou shalt speak unto the
Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the
tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye
shall offer up a heave-offering of it for Jehovah, a tithe of the tithe.

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> And your heave-offering shall be
reckoned unto you, as though it were the grain of the threshing-floor,
and as the fulness of the winepress.

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> Thus ye also shall offer a
heave-offering unto Jehovah of all your tithes, which ye receive of the
children of Israel; and thereof ye shall give Jehovah's heave-offering
to Aaron the priest.

<span id="an_18:29">18:29</span> Out of all your gifts ye shall offer
every heave-offering of Jehovah, of all the best thereof, even the
hallowed part thereof out of it.

<span id="an_18:30">18:30</span> Therefore thou shalt say unto them,
When ye heave the best thereof from it, then it shall be reckoned unto
the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase
of the wine-press.

<span id="an_18:31">18:31</span> And ye shall eat it in every place, ye
and your households: for it is your reward in return for your service in
the tent of meeting.

<span id="an_18:32">18:32</span> And ye shall bear no sin by reason of
it, when ye have heaved from it the best thereof: and ye shall not
profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that ye die not.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto
Aaron, saying,

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> This is the statute of the law which
Jehovah hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that
they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish,
\[and\] upon which never came yoke.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the
priest, and he shall bring her forth without the camp, and one shall
slay her before his face:

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> and Eleazar the priest shall take of her
blood with his finger, and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the
tent of meeting seven times.

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> And one shall burn the heifer in his
sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he
burn:

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> and the priest shall take cedar-wood, and
hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the
heifer.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> Then the priest shall wash his clothes,
and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into
the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> And he that burneth her shall wash his
clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean
until the even.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> And a man that is clean shall gather up
the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean
place; and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of
Israel for a water for impurity: it is a sin-offering.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> And he that gathereth the ashes of the
heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it
shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that
sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> He that toucheth the dead body of any
man shall be unclean seven days:

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> the same shall purify himself therewith
on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he
purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be
clean.

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> Whosoever toucheth a dead person, the
body of a man that hath died, and purifieth not himself, defileth the
tabernacle of Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel:
because the water for impurity was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be
unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> This is the law when a man dieth in a
tent: every one that cometh into the tent, and every one that is in the
tent, shall be unclean seven days.

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> And every open vessel, which hath no
covering bound upon it, is unclean.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> And whosoever in the open field
toucheth one that is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a
man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> And for the unclean they shall take of
the ashes of the burning of the sin-offering; and running water shall be
put thereto in a vessel:

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> and a clean person shall take hyssop,
and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the
vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched
the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave:

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> and the clean person shall sprinkle
upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the
seventh day he shall purify him; and he shall wash his clothes, and
bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.

<span id="an_19:20">19:20</span> But the man that shall be unclean, and
shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of
the assembly, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of Jehovah: the
water for impurity hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.

<span id="an_19:21">19:21</span> And it shall be a perpetual statute
unto them: and he that sprinkleth the water for impurity shall wash his
clothes, and he that toucheth the water for impurity shall be unclean
until even.

<span id="an_19:22">19:22</span> And whatsoever the unclean person
toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be
unclean until even.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> And the children of Israel, even the
whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month:
and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried
there.

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> And there was no water for the
congregation: and they assembled themselves together against Moses and
against Aaron.

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> And the people strove with Moses, and
spake, saying, Would that we had died when our brethren died before
Jehovah!

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> And why have ye brought the assembly of
Jehovah into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our
beasts?

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> And wherefore have ye made us to come up
out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of
seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any
water to drink.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> And Moses and Aaron went from the
presence of the assembly unto the door of the tent of meeting, and fell
upon their faces: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto them.

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> Take the rod, and assemble the
congregation, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock
before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and thou shalt bring
forth to them water out of the rock; so thou shalt give the congregation
and their cattle drink.

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> And Moses took the rod from before
Jehovah, as he commanded him.

<span id="an_20:10">20:10</span> And Moses and Aaron gathered the
assembly together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye
rebels; shall we bring you forth water out of this rock?

<span id="an_20:11">20:11</span> And Moses lifted up his hand, and smote
the rock with his rod twice: and water came forth abundantly, and the
congregation drank, and their cattle.

<span id="an_20:12">20:12</span> And Jehovah said unto Moses and Aaron,
Because ye believed not in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the
children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this assembly into the
land which I have given them.

<span id="an_20:13">20:13</span> These are the waters of Meribah;
because the children of Israel strove with Jehovah, and he was
sanctified in them.

<span id="an_20:14">20:14</span> And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh
unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all
the travail that hath befallen us:

<span id="an_20:15">20:15</span> how our fathers went down into Egypt,
and we dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us,
and our fathers:

<span id="an_20:16">20:16</span> and when we cried unto Jehovah, he
heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt:
and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border.

<span id="an_20:17">20:17</span> Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy
land: we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will
we drink of the water of the wells: we will go along the king's highway;
we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have
passed thy border.

<span id="an_20:18">20:18</span> And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not
pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against thee.

<span id="an_20:19">20:19</span> And the children of Israel said unto
him, We will go up by the highway; and if we drink of thy water, I and
my cattle, then will I give the price thereof: let me only, without
\[doing\] anything \[else\], pass through on my feet.

<span id="an_20:20">20:20</span> And he said, Thou shalt not pass
through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a
strong hand.

<span id="an_20:21">20:21</span> Thus Edom refused to give Israel
passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.

<span id="an_20:22">20:22</span> And they journeyed from Kadesh: and the
children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came unto mount Hor.

<span id="an_20:23">20:23</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses and Aaron
in mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,

<span id="an_20:24">20:24</span> Aaron shall be gathered unto his
people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the
children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the waters of
Meribah.

<span id="an_20:25">20:25</span> Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and
bring them up unto mount Hor;

<span id="an_20:26">20:26</span> and strip Aaron of his garments, and
put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered \[unto his
people\], and shall die there.

<span id="an_20:27">20:27</span> And Moses did as Jehovah commanded: and
they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.

<span id="an_20:28">20:28</span> And Moses stripped Aaron of his
garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the
top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.

<span id="an_20:29">20:29</span> And when all the congregation saw that
Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of
Israel.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who
dwelt in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim;
and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive.

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> And Israel vowed a vow unto Jehovah, and
said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will
utterly destroy their cities.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> And Jehovah hearkened to the voice of
Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them
and their cities: and the name of the place was called Hormah.

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> And they journeyed from mount Hor by the
way to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the
people was much discouraged because of the way.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> And the people spake against God, and
against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in
the wilderness? for there is no bread, and there is no water; and our
soul loatheth this light bread.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> And Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the
people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> And the people came to Moses, and said,
We have sinned, because we have spoken against Jehovah, and against
thee; pray unto Jehovah, that he take away the serpents from us. And
Moses prayed for the people.

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> And Jehovah said unto Moses, Make thee a
fiery serpent, and set it upon a standard: and it shall come to pass,
that every one that is bitten, when he seeth it, shall live.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> And Moses made a serpent of brass, and
set it upon the standard: and it came to pass, that if a serpent had
bitten any man, when he looked unto the serpent of brass, he lived.

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> And the children of Israel journeyed,
and encamped in Oboth.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> And they journeyed from Oboth, and
encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward
the sunrising.

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> From thence they journeyed, and
encamped in the valley of Zered.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> From thence they journeyed, and
encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness,
that cometh out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the
border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> Wherefore it is said in the book of the
Wars of Jehovah, Vaheb in Suphah, And the valleys of the Arnon,

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> And the slope of the valleys That
inclineth toward the dwelling of Ar, And leaneth upon the border of
Moab.

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> And from thence \[they journeyed\] to
Beer: that is the well whereof Jehovah said unto Moses, Gather the
people together, and I will give them water.

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> Then sang Israel this song: Spring up,
O well; sing ye unto it:

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> The well, which the princes digged,
Which the nobles of the people delved, With the sceptre, \[and\] with
their staves. And from the wilderness \[they journeyed\] to Mattanah;

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from
Nahaliel to Bamoth;

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> and from Bamoth to the valley that is
in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh down upon the
desert.

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon
king of the Amorites, saying,

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> Let me pass through thy land: we will
not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the
water of the wells: we will go by the king's highway, until we have
passed thy border.

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> And Sihon would not suffer Israel to
pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and
went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he
fought against Israel.

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> And Israel smote him with the edge of
the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jabbok, even
unto the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was
strong.

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> And Israel took all these cities: and
Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all
the towns thereof.

<span id="an_21:26">21:26</span> For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the
king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab,
and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto the Arnon.

<span id="an_21:27">21:27</span> Wherefore they that speak in proverbs
say, Come ye to Heshbon; Let the city of Sihon be built and established:

<span id="an_21:28">21:28</span> For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, A
flame from the city of Sihon: It hath devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of
the high places of the Arnon.

<span id="an_21:29">21:29</span> Woe to thee, Moab! Thou art undone, O
people of Chemosh: He hath given his sons as fugitives, And his
daughters into captivity, Unto Sihon king of the Amorites.

<span id="an_21:30">21:30</span> We have shot at them; Heshbon is
perished even unto Dibon, And we have laid waste even unto Nophah, Which
\[reacheth\] unto Medeba.

<span id="an_21:31">21:31</span> Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the
Amorites.

<span id="an_21:32">21:32</span> And Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and
they took the towns thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.

<span id="an_21:33">21:33</span> And they turned and went up by the way
of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all
his people, to battle at Edrei.

<span id="an_21:34">21:34</span> And Jehovah said unto Moses, Fear him
not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his
land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the
Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.

<span id="an_21:35">21:35</span> So they smote him, and his sons and all
his people, until there was none left him remaining: and they possessed
his land.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> And the children of Israel journeyed, and
encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that
Israel had done to the Amorites.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> And Moab was sore afraid of the people,
because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children
of Israel.

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> And Moab said unto the elders of Midian,
Now will this multitude lick up all that is round about us, as the ox
licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king
of Moab at that time.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> And he sent messengers unto Balaam the
son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the
children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people
come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they
abide over against me.

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me
this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall
prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the
land; for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou
cursest is cursed.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> And the elders of Moab and the elders of
Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they
came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> And he said unto them, Lodge here this
night, and I will bring you word again, as Jehovah shall speak unto me:
and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> And God came unto Balaam, and said, What
men are these with thee?

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son
of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, \[saying\],

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> Behold, the people that is come out of
Egypt, it covereth the face of the earth: now, come curse me them;
peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them
out.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt
not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people; for they are blessed.

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> And Balaam rose up in the morning, and
said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land; for Jehovah
refuseth to give me leave to go with you.

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> And the princes of Moab rose up, and
they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> And Balak sent yet again princes, more,
and more honorable than they.

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> And they came to Balaam, and said to
him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee,
hinder thee from coming unto me:

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> for I will promote thee unto very great
honor, and whatsoever thou sayest unto me I will do: come therefore, I
pray thee, curse me this people.

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> And Balaam answered and said unto the
servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and
gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Jehovah my God, to do less or more.

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye
also here this night, that I may know what Jehovah will speak unto me
more.

<span id="an_22:20">22:20</span> And God came unto Balaam at night, and
said unto him, If the men are come to call thee, rise up, go with them;
but only the word which I speak unto thee, that shalt thou do.

<span id="an_22:21">22:21</span> And Balaam rose up in the morning, and
saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.

<span id="an_22:22">22:22</span> And God's anger was kindled because he
went; and the angel of Jehovah placed himself in the way for an
adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two
servants were with him.

<span id="an_22:23">22:23</span> And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah
standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass
turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote
the ass, to turn her into the way.

<span id="an_22:24">22:24</span> Then the angel of Jehovah stood in a
narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall
on that side.

<span id="an_22:25">22:25</span> And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah,
and she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against
the wall: and he smote her again.

<span id="an_22:26">22:26</span> And the angel of Jehovah went further,
and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the
right hand or to the left.

<span id="an_22:27">22:27</span> And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah,
and she lay down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he
smote the ass with his staff.

<span id="an_22:28">22:28</span> And Jehovah opened the mouth of the
ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou
hast smitten me these three times?

<span id="an_22:29">22:29</span> And Balaam said unto the ass, Because
thou hast mocked me, I would there were a sword in my hand, for now I
had killed thee.

<span id="an_22:30">22:30</span> And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I
thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden all thy life long unto this day?
was I ever wont to do so unto thee? and he said, Nay.

<span id="an_22:31">22:31</span> Then Jehovah opened the eyes of Balaam,
and he saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the way, with his sword
drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.

<span id="an_22:32">22:32</span> And the angel of Jehovah said unto him,
Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I am
come forth for an adversary, because thy way is perverse before me:

<span id="an_22:33">22:33</span> and the ass saw me, and turned aside
before me these three times: unless she had turned aside from me, surely
now I had even slain thee, and saved her alive.

<span id="an_22:34">22:34</span> And Balaam said unto the angel of
Jehovah, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way
against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back
again.

<span id="an_22:35">22:35</span> And the angel of Jehovah said unto
Balaam, Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak unto thee,
that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.

<span id="an_22:36">22:36</span> And when Balak heard that Balaam was
come, he went out to meet him unto the City of Moab, which is on the
border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border.

<span id="an_22:37">22:37</span> And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not
earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto
me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honor?

<span id="an_22:38">22:38</span> And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am
come unto thee: have I now any power at all to speak anything? the word
that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.

<span id="an_22:39">22:39</span> And Balaam went with Balak, and they
came unto Kiriath-huzoth.

<span id="an_22:40">22:40</span> And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep,
and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.

<span id="an_22:41">22:41</span> And it came to pass in the morning,
that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal;
and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people.

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here
seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and
Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy
burnt-offering, and I will go: peradventure Jehovah will come to meet
me; and whatsoever he showeth me I will tell thee. And he went to a bare
height.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> And God met Balaam: and he said unto him,
I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a
ram on every altar.

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> And Jehovah put a word in Balaam's mouth,
and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> And he returned unto him, and, lo, he was
standing by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> And he took up his parable, and said,
From Aram hath Balak brought me, The king of Moab from the mountains of
the East: Come, curse me Jacob, And come, defy Israel.

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> How shall I curse, whom God hath not
cursed? And how shall I defy, whom Jehovah hath not defied?

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> For from the top of the rocks I see him,
And from the hills I behold him: lo, it is a people that dwelleth alone,
And shall not be reckoned among the nations.

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or
number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous,
And let my last end be like his!

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast
thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou
hast blessed them altogether.

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> And he answered and said, Must I not
take heed to speak that which Jehovah putteth in my mouth?

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray
thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou
shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and
curse me them from thence.

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> And he took him into the field of
Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a
bullock and a ram on every altar.

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> And he said unto Balak, Stand here by
thy burnt-offering, while I meet \[Jehovah\] yonder.

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> And Jehovah met Balaam, and put a word
in his mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.

<span id="an_23:17">23:17</span> And he came to him, and, lo, he was
standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And
Balak said unto him, What hath Jehovah spoken?

<span id="an_23:18">23:18</span> And he took up his parable, and said,
Rise up, Balak, and hear; Hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:

<span id="an_23:19">23:19</span> God is not a man, that he should lie,
Neither the son of man, that he should repent: Hath he said, and will he
not do it? Or hath he spoken, and will he not make it good?

<span id="an_23:20">23:20</span> Behold, I have received \[commandment\]
to bless: And he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.

<span id="an_23:21">23:21</span> He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob;
Neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: Jehovah his God is with
him, And the shout of a king is among them.

<span id="an_23:22">23:22</span> God bringeth them forth out of Egypt;
He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox.

<span id="an_23:23">23:23</span> Surely there is no enchantment with
Jacob; Neither is there any divination with Israel: Now shalt it be said
of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!

<span id="an_23:24">23:24</span> Behold, the people riseth up as a
lioness, And as a lion doth he lift himself up: He shall not lie down
until he eat of the prey, And drink the blood of the slain.

<span id="an_23:25">23:25</span> And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither
curse them at all, nor bless them at all.

<span id="an_23:26">23:26</span> But Balaam answered and said unto
Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that Jehovah speaketh, that I must
do?

<span id="an_23:27">23:27</span> And Balak said unto Balaam, Come now, I
will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that
thou mayest curse me them from thence.

<span id="an_23:28">23:28</span> And Balak took Balaam unto the top of
Peor, that looketh down upon the desert.

<span id="an_23:29">23:29</span> And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me
here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.

<span id="an_23:30">23:30</span> And Balak did as Balaam had said, and
offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> And when Balaam saw that it pleased
Jehovah to bless Israel, he went not, as at the other times, to meet
with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw
Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came
upon him.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> And he took up his parable, and said,
Balaam the son of Beor saith, And the man whose eye was closed saith;

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> He saith, who heareth the words of God,
Who seeth the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes
open:

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, Thy
tabernacles, O Israel!

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> As valleys are they spread forth, As
gardens by the river-side, As lign-aloes which Jehovah hath planted, As
cedar-trees beside the waters.

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> Water shall flow from his buckets, And
his seed shall be in many waters, And his king shall be higher than
Agag, And his kingdom shall be exalted.

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> God bringeth him forth out of Egypt; He
hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox: He shall eat up the nations
his adversaries, And shall break their bones in pieces, And smite
\[them\] through with his arrows.

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> He couched, he lay down as a lion, And as
a lioness; who shall rouse him up? Blessed be every one that blesseth
thee, And cursed be every one that curseth thee.

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> And Balak's anger was kindled against
Balaam, and he smote his hands together; and Balak said unto Balaam, I
called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether
blessed them these three times.

<span id="an_24:11">24:11</span> Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I
thought to promote thee unto great honor; but, lo, Jehovah hath kept
thee back from honor.

<span id="an_24:12">24:12</span> And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not
also to thy messengers that thou sentest unto me, saying,

<span id="an_24:13">24:13</span> If Balak would give me his house full
of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Jehovah, to do either
good or bad of mine own mind; what Jehovah speaketh, that will I speak?

<span id="an_24:14">24:14</span> And now, behold, I go unto my people:
come, \[and\] I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy
people in the latter days.

<span id="an_24:15">24:15</span> And he took up his parable, and said,
Balaam the son of Beor saith, And the man whose eye was closed saith;

<span id="an_24:16">24:16</span> He saith, who heareth the words of God,
And knoweth the knowledge of the Most High, Who seeth the vision of the
Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open:

<span id="an_24:17">24:17</span> I see him, but not now; I behold him,
but not nigh: There shall come forth a star out of Jacob, And a sceptre
shall rise out of Israel, And shall smite through the corners of Moab,
And break down all the sons of tumult.

<span id="an_24:18">24:18</span> And Edom shall be a possession, Seir
also shall be a possession, \[who were\] his enemies; While Israel doeth
valiantly.

<span id="an_24:19">24:19</span> And out of Jacob shall one have
dominion, And shall destroy the remnant from the city.

<span id="an_24:20">24:20</span> And he looked on Amalek, and took up
his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; But his
latter end shall come to destruction.

<span id="an_24:21">24:21</span> And he looked on the Kenite, and took
up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwelling-place, And thy nest is
set in the rock.

<span id="an_24:22">24:22</span> Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted,
Until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.

<span id="an_24:23">24:23</span> And he took up his parable, and said,
Alas, who shall live when God doeth this?

<span id="an_24:24">24:24</span> But ships \[shall come\] from the coast
of Kittim, And they shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber; And he
also shall come to destruction.

<span id="an_24:25">24:25</span> And Balaam rose up, and went and
returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.

<span id="an_25:1">25:1</span> And Israel abode in Shittim; and the
people began to play the harlot with the daughters of Moab:

<span id="an_25:2">25:2</span> for they called the people unto the
sacrifices of their gods; and the people did eat, and bowed down to
their gods.

<span id="an_25:3">25:3</span> And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor:
and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel.

<span id="an_25:4">25:4</span> And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take all the
chiefs of the people, and hang them up unto Jehovah before the sun, that
the fierce anger of Jehovah may turn away from Israel.

<span id="an_25:5">25:5</span> And Moses said unto the judges of Israel,
Slay ye every one his men that have joined themselves unto Baal-peor.

<span id="an_25:6">25:6</span> And, behold, one of the children of
Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the
sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children
of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting.

<span id="an_25:7">25:7</span> And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar,
the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the
congregation, and took a spear in his hand;

<span id="an_25:8">25:8</span> and he went after the man of Israel into
the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and
the woman through her body. So the plague was stayed from the children
of Israel.

<span id="an_25:9">25:9</span> And those that died by the plague were
twenty and four thousand.

<span id="an_25:10">25:10</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_25:11">25:11</span> Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son
of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of
Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I
consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.

<span id="an_25:12">25:12</span> Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him
my covenant of peace:

<span id="an_25:13">25:13</span> and it shall be unto him, and to his
seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he
was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.

<span id="an_25:14">25:14</span> Now the name of the man of Israel that
was slain, who was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son
of Salu, a prince of a fathers' house among the Simeonites.

<span id="an_25:15">25:15</span> And the name of the Midianitish woman
that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head of the people
of a fathers' house in Midian.

<span id="an_25:16">25:16</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_25:17">25:17</span> Vex the Midianites, and smite them;

<span id="an_25:18">25:18</span> for they vex you with their wiles,
wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the
matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who
was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.

<span id="an_26:1">26:1</span> And it came to pass after the plague,
that Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the
priest, saying,

<span id="an_26:2">26:2</span> Take the sum of all the congregation of
the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their
fathers' houses, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel.

<span id="an_26:3">26:3</span> And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake
with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,

<span id="an_26:4">26:4</span> \[Take the sum of the people\], from
twenty years old and upward; as Jehovah commanded Moses and the children
of Israel, that came forth out of the land of Egypt.

<span id="an_26:5">26:5</span> Reuben, the first-born of Israel; the
sons of Reuben: \[of\] Hanoch, the family of the Hanochites; of Pallu,

seven hundred and thirty.

<span id="an_26:8">26:8</span> And the sons of Pallu: Eliab.

<span id="an_26:9">26:9</span> And the sons of Eliab: Nemuel, and
Dathan, and Abiram. These are that Dathan and Abiram, who were called of
the congregation, who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the
company of Korah, when they strove against Jehovah,

<span id="an_26:10">26:10</span> and the earth opened its mouth, and
swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died; what time
the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men, and they became a sign.

not.

for an inheritance according to the number of names.

<span id="an_26:54">26:54</span> To the more thou shalt give the more
inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance: to
every one according to those that were numbered of him shall his
inheritance be given.

<span id="an_26:55">26:55</span> Notwithstanding, the land shall be
divided by lot: according to the names of the tribes of their fathers
they shall inherit.

<span id="an_26:56">26:56</span> According to the lot shall their
inheritance be divided between the more and the fewer.

<span id="an_26:57">26:57</span> And these are they that were numbered

<span id="an_26:59">26:59</span> And the name of Amram's wife was

bare unto Amram Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister.

<span id="an_26:60">26:60</span> And unto Aaron were born Nadab and
Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.

<span id="an_26:61">26:61</span> And Nadab and Abihu died, when they
offered strange fire before Jehovah.

<span id="an_26:62">26:62</span> And they that were numbered of them
were twenty and three thousand, every male from a month old and upward:
for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there
was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.

<span id="an_26:63">26:63</span> These are they that were numbered by
Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the
plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.

<span id="an_26:64">26:64</span> But among these there was not a man of
them that were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who numbered the
children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.

<span id="an_26:65">26:65</span> For Jehovah had said of them, They
shall surely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of
them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

<span id="an_27:1">27:1</span> Then drew near the daughters of
Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the
son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and
these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and
Milcah, and Tirzah.

<span id="an_27:2">27:2</span> And they stood before Moses, and before
Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, at
the door of the tent of meeting, saying,

<span id="an_27:3">27:3</span> Our father died in the wilderness, and he
was not among the company of them that gathered themselves together
against Jehovah in the company of Korah: but he died in his own sin; and
he had no sons.

<span id="an_27:4">27:4</span> Why should the name of our father be
taken away from among his family, because he had no son? Give unto us a
possession among the brethren of our father.

<span id="an_27:5">27:5</span> And Moses brought their cause before
Jehovah.

<span id="an_27:6">27:6</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_27:7">27:7</span> The daughters of Zelophehad speak right:
thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their
father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father
to pass unto them.

<span id="an_27:8">27:8</span> And thou shalt speak unto the children of
Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his
inheritance to pass unto his daughter.

<span id="an_27:9">27:9</span> And if he have no daughter, then ye shall
give his inheritance unto his brethren.

<span id="an_27:10">27:10</span> And if he have no brethren, then ye
shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren.

<span id="an_27:11">27:11</span> And if his father have no brethren,
then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him
of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the
children of Israel a statute \[and\] ordinance, as Jehovah commanded
Moses.

<span id="an_27:12">27:12</span> And Jehovah said unto Moses, Get thee
up into this mountain of Abarim, and behold the land which I have given
unto the children of Israel.

<span id="an_27:13">27:13</span> And when thou hast seen it, thou also
shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered;

<span id="an_27:14">27:14</span> because ye rebelled against my word in
the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me
at the waters before their eyes. (These are the waters of Meribah of
Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)

<span id="an_27:15">27:15</span> And Moses spake unto Jehovah, saying,

<span id="an_27:16">27:16</span> Let Jehovah, the God of the spirits of
all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,

<span id="an_27:17">27:17</span> who may go out before them, and who may
come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them
in; that the congregation of Jehovah be not as sheep which have no
shepherd.

<span id="an_27:18">27:18</span> And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take thee
Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay thy hand
upon him;

<span id="an_27:19">27:19</span> and set him before Eleazar the priest,
and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.

<span id="an_27:20">27:20</span> And thou shalt put of thine honor upon
him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may obey.

<span id="an_27:21">27:21</span> And he shall stand before Eleazar the
priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before
Jehovah: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come
in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the
congregation.

<span id="an_27:22">27:22</span> And Moses did as Jehovah commanded him;
and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before
all the congregation:

<span id="an_27:23">27:23</span> and he laid his hands upon him, and
gave him a charge, as Jehovah spake by Moses.

<span id="an_28:1">28:1</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_28:2">28:2</span> Command the children of Israel, and say
unto them, My oblation, my food for my offerings made by fire, of a
sweet savor unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due
season.

<span id="an_28:3">28:3</span> And thou shalt say unto them, This is the
offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto Jehovah: he-lambs a year
old without blemish, two day by day, for a continual burnt-offering.

<span id="an_28:4">28:4</span> The one lamb shalt thou offer in the
morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;

<span id="an_28:5">28:5</span> and the tenth part of an ephah of fine
flour for a meal-offering, mingled with the fourth part of a hin of
beaten oil.

<span id="an_28:6">28:6</span> It is a continual burnt-offering, which
was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire
unto Jehovah.

<span id="an_28:7">28:7</span> And the drink-offering thereof shall be
the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou
pour out a drink-offering of strong drink unto Jehovah.

<span id="an_28:8">28:8</span> And the other lamb shalt thou offer at
even: as the meal-offering of the morning, and as the drink-offering
thereof, thou shalt offer it, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor
unto Jehovah.

<span id="an_28:9">28:9</span> And on the sabbath day two he-lambs a
year old without blemish, and two tenth parts \[of an ephah\] of fine
flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and the drink-offering
thereof:

<span id="an_28:10">28:10</span> this is the burnt-offering of every
sabbath, besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering
thereof.

<span id="an_28:11">28:11</span> And in the beginnings of your months ye
shall offer a burnt-offering unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, and one
ram, seven he-lambs a year old without blemish;

<span id="an_28:12">28:12</span> and three tenth parts \[of an ephah\]
of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for each bullock;
and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil,
for the one ram;

<span id="an_28:13">28:13</span> and a tenth part of fine flour mingled
with oil for a meal-offering unto every lamb; for a burnt-offering of a
sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.

<span id="an_28:14">28:14</span> And their drink-offerings shall be half
a hin of wine for a bullock, and the third part of a hin for the ram,
and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb: this is the burnt-offering of
every month throughout the months of the year.

<span id="an_28:15">28:15</span> And one he-goat for a sin-offering unto
Jehovah; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt-offering, and
the drink-offering thereof.

<span id="an_28:16">28:16</span> And in the first month, on the
fourteenth day of the month, is Jehovah's passover.

<span id="an_28:17">28:17</span> And on the fifteenth day of this month
shall be a feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.

<span id="an_28:18">28:18</span> In the first day shall be a holy
convocation: ye shall do no servile work;

<span id="an_28:19">28:19</span> but ye shall offer an offering made by
fire, a burnt-offering unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, and one ram,
and seven he-lambs a year old; they shall be unto you without blemish;

<span id="an_28:20">28:20</span> and their meal-offering, fine flour
mingled with oil: three tenth parts shall ye offer for a bullock, and
two tenth parts for the ram;

<span id="an_28:21">28:21</span> a tenth part shalt thou offer for every
lamb of the seven lambs;

<span id="an_28:22">28:22</span> and one he-goat for a sin-offering, to
make atonement for you.

<span id="an_28:23">28:23</span> Ye shall offer these besides the
burnt-offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt-offering.

<span id="an_28:24">28:24</span> After this manner ye shall offer daily,
for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, of a sweet savor
unto Jehovah: it shall be offered besides the continual burnt-offering,
and the drink-offering thereof.

<span id="an_28:25">28:25</span> And on the seventh day ye shall have a
holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.

<span id="an_28:26">28:26</span> Also in the day of the first-fruits,
when ye offer a new meal-offering unto Jehovah in your \[feast of\]
weeks, ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work;

<span id="an_28:27">28:27</span> but ye shall offer a burnt-offering for
a sweet savor unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, one ram, seven he-lambs
a year old;

<span id="an_28:28">28:28</span> and their meal-offering, fine flour
mingled with oil, three tenth parts for each bullock, two tenth parts
for the one ram,

<span id="an_28:29">28:29</span> a tenth part for every lamb of the
seven lambs;

<span id="an_28:30">28:30</span> one he-goat, to make atonement for you.

<span id="an_28:31">28:31</span> Besides the continual burnt-offering,
and the meal-offering thereof, ye shall offer them (they shall be unto
you without blemish), and their drink-offerings.

<span id="an_29:1">29:1</span> And in the seventh month, on the first
day of the month, ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no
servile work: it is a day of blowing of trumpets unto you.

<span id="an_29:2">29:2</span> And ye shall offer a burnt-offering for a
sweet savor unto Jehovah: one young bullock, one ram, seven he-lambs a
year old without blemish;

<span id="an_29:3">29:3</span> and their meal-offering, fine flour
mingled with oil, three tenth parts for the bullock, two tenth parts for
the ram,

<span id="an_29:4">29:4</span> and one tenth part for every lamb of the
seven lambs;

<span id="an_29:5">29:5</span> and one he-goat for a sin-offering, to
make atonement for you;

<span id="an_29:6">29:6</span> besides the burnt-offering of the new
moon, and the meal-offering thereof, and the continual burnt-offering
and the meal-offering thereof, and their drink-offerings, according unto
their ordinance, for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto
Jehovah.

<span id="an_29:7">29:7</span> And on the tenth day of this seventh
month ye shall have a holy convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls:
ye shall do no manner of work;

<span id="an_29:8">29:8</span> but ye shall offer a burnt-offering unto
Jehovah for a sweet savor: one young bullock, one ram, seven he-lambs a
year old; they shall be unto you without blemish;

<span id="an_29:9">29:9</span> and their meal-offering, fine flour
mingled with oil, three tenth parts for the bullock, two tenth parts for
the one ram,

<span id="an_29:10">29:10</span> a tenth part for every lamb of the
seven lambs:

<span id="an_29:11">29:11</span> one he-goat for a sin-offering; besides
the sin-offering of atonement, and the continual burnt-offering, and the
meal-offering thereof, and their drink-offerings.

<span id="an_29:12">29:12</span> And on the fifteenth day of the seventh
month ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work, and
ye shall keep a feast unto Jehovah seven days:

<span id="an_29:13">29:13</span> and ye shall offer a burnt-offering, an
offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah; thirteen young
bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old; they shall be without
blemish;

<span id="an_29:14">29:14</span> and their meal-offering, fine flour
mingled with oil, three tenth parts for every bullock of the thirteen
bullocks, two tenth parts for each ram of the two rams,

<span id="an_29:15">29:15</span> and a tenth part for every lamb of the
fourteen lambs;

<span id="an_29:16">29:16</span> and one he-goat for a sin-offering,
besides the continual burnt-offering, the meal-offering thereof, and the
drink-offering thereof.

<span id="an_29:17">29:17</span> And on the second day \[ye shall
offer\] twelve young bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old
without blemish;

<span id="an_29:18">29:18</span> and their meal-offering and their
drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs,
according to their number, after the ordinance;

<span id="an_29:19">29:19</span> and one he-goat for a sin-offering;
besides the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, and
their drink-offerings.

<span id="an_29:20">29:20</span> And on the third day eleven bullocks,
two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without blemish;

<span id="an_29:21">29:21</span> and their meal-offering and their
drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs,
according to their number, after the ordinance;

<span id="an_29:22">29:22</span> and one he-goat for a sin-offering;
besides the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, and
the drink-offering thereof.

<span id="an_29:23">29:23</span> And on the fourth day ten bullocks, two
rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without blemish;

<span id="an_29:24">29:24</span> their meal-offering and their
drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs,
according to their number, after the ordinance;

<span id="an_29:25">29:25</span> and one he-goat for a sin-offering;
besides the continual burnt-offering, the meal-offering thereof, and the
drink-offering thereof.

<span id="an_29:26">29:26</span> And on the fifth day nine bullocks, two
rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without blemish;

<span id="an_29:27">29:27</span> and their meal-offering and their
drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs,
according to their number, after the ordinance;

<span id="an_29:28">29:28</span> and one he-goat for a sin-offering,
besides the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, and
the drink-offering thereof.

<span id="an_29:29">29:29</span> And on the sixth day eight bullocks,
two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without blemish;

<span id="an_29:30">29:30</span> and their meal-offering and their
drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs,
according to their number, after the ordinance;

<span id="an_29:31">29:31</span> and one he-goat for a sin-offering;
besides the continual burnt-offering, the meal-offering thereof, and the
drink-offerings thereof.

<span id="an_29:32">29:32</span> And on the seventh day seven bullocks,
two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without blemish;

<span id="an_29:33">29:33</span> and their meal-offering and their
drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs,
according to their number, after the ordinance;

<span id="an_29:34">29:34</span> and one he-goat for a sin-offering;
besides the continual burnt-offering, the meal-offering thereof, and the
drink-offering thereof.

<span id="an_29:35">29:35</span> On the eighth day ye shall have a
solemn assembly: ye shall do no servile work;

<span id="an_29:36">29:36</span> but ye shall offer a burnt-offering, an
offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah: one bullock, one
ram, seven he-lambs a year old without blemish;

<span id="an_29:37">29:37</span> their meal-offering and their
drink-offerings for the bullock, for the ram, and for the lambs, shall
be according to their number, after the ordinance:

<span id="an_29:38">29:38</span> and one he-goat for a sin-offering,
besides the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, and
the drink-offering thereof.

<span id="an_29:39">29:39</span> These ye shall offer unto Jehovah in
your set feasts, besides your vows, and your freewill-offerings, for
your burnt-offerings, and for your meal-offerings, and for your
drink-offerings, and for your peace-offerings.

<span id="an_29:40">29:40</span> And Moses told the children of Israel
according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses.

<span id="an_30:1">30:1</span> And Moses spake unto the heads of the
tribes of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which
Jehovah hath commanded.

<span id="an_30:2">30:2</span> When a man voweth a vow unto Jehovah, or
sweareth an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his
word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.

<span id="an_30:3">30:3</span> Also when a woman voweth a vow unto
Jehovah, and bindeth herself by a bond, being in her father's house, in
her youth,

<span id="an_30:4">30:4</span> and her father heareth her vow, and her
bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father holdeth his peace
at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath
bound her soul shall stand.

<span id="an_30:5">30:5</span> But if her father disallow her in the day
that he heareth, none of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath
bound her soul, shall stand: and Jehovah will forgive her, because her
father disallowed her.

<span id="an_30:6">30:6</span> And if she be \[married\] to a husband,
while her vows are upon her, or the rash utterance of her lips,
wherewith she hath bound her soul,

<span id="an_30:7">30:7</span> and her husband hear it, and hold his
peace at her in the day that he heareth it; then her vows shall stand,
and her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.

<span id="an_30:8">30:8</span> But if her husband disallow her in the
day that he heareth it, then he shall make void her vow which is upon
her, and the rash utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her
soul: and Jehovah will forgive her.

<span id="an_30:9">30:9</span> But the vow of a widow, or of her that is
divorced, \[even\] everything wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall
stand against her.

<span id="an_30:10">30:10</span> And if she vowed in her husband's
house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath,

<span id="an_30:11">30:11</span> and her husband heard it, and held his
peace at her, and disallowed her not; then all her vows shall stand, and
every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.

<span id="an_30:12">30:12</span> But if her husband made them null and
void in the day that he heard them, then whatsoever proceeded out of her
lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not
stand: her husband hath made them void; and Jehovah will forgive her.

<span id="an_30:13">30:13</span> Every vow, and every binding oath to
afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make
it void.

<span id="an_30:14">30:14</span> But if her husband altogether hold his
peace at her from day to day, then he establisheth all her vows, or all
her bonds, which are upon her: he hath established them, because he held
his peace at her in the day that he heard them.

<span id="an_30:15">30:15</span> But if he shall make them null and void
after that he hath heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity.

<span id="an_30:16">30:16</span> These are the statutes, which Jehovah
commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his
daughter, being in her youth, in her father's house.

<span id="an_31:1">31:1</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_31:2">31:2</span> Avenge the children of Israel of the
Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.

<span id="an_31:3">31:3</span> And Moses spake unto the people, saying,
Arm ye men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian,
to execute Jehovah's vengeance on Midian.

<span id="an_31:4">31:4</span> Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all
the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.

<span id="an_31:5">31:5</span> So there were delivered, out of the
thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed
for war.

<span id="an_31:6">31:6</span> And Moses sent them, a thousand of every
tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to
the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the
alarm in his hand.

<span id="an_31:7">31:7</span> And they warred against Midian, as
Jehovah commanded Moses; and they slew every male.

<span id="an_31:8">31:8</span> And they slew the kings of Midian with
the rest of their slain: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the
five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the
sword.

<span id="an_31:9">31:9</span> And the children of Israel took captive
the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their cattle, and all
their flocks, and all their goods, they took for a prey.

<span id="an_31:10">31:10</span> And all their cities in the places
wherein they dwelt, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire.

<span id="an_31:11">31:11</span> And they took all the spoil, and all
the prey, both of man and of beast.

<span id="an_31:12">31:12</span> And they brought the captives, and the
prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and unto Eleazar the priest, and unto
the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains
of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho.

<span id="an_31:13">31:13</span> And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and
all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the
camp.

<span id="an_31:14">31:14</span> And Moses was wroth with the officers
of the host, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who
came from the service of the war.

<span id="an_31:15">31:15</span> And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved
all the women alive?

<span id="an_31:16">31:16</span> Behold, these caused the children of
Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against
Jehovah in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the
congregation of Jehovah.

<span id="an_31:17">31:17</span> Now therefore kill every male among the
little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.

<span id="an_31:18">31:18</span> But all the women-children, that have
not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.

<span id="an_31:19">31:19</span> And encamp ye without the camp seven
days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any
slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, ye and
your captives.

<span id="an_31:20">31:20</span> And as to every garment, and all that
is made of skin, and all work of goats' \[hair\], and all things made of
wood, ye shall purify yourselves.

<span id="an_31:21">31:21</span> And Eleazar the priest said unto the
men of war that went to the battle, This is the statute of the law which
Jehovah hath commanded Moses:

<span id="an_31:22">31:22</span> howbeit the gold, and the silver, the
brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,

<span id="an_31:23">31:23</span> everything that may abide the fire, ye
shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless
it shall be purified with the water for impurity: and all that abideth
not the fire ye shall make to go through the water.

<span id="an_31:24">31:24</span> And ye shall wash your clothes on the
seventh day, and ye shall be clean; and afterward ye shall come into the
camp.

<span id="an_31:25">31:25</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_31:26">31:26</span> Take the sum of the prey that was
taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the
heads of the fathers' \[houses\] of the congregation;

<span id="an_31:27">31:27</span> and divide the prey into two parts:
between the men skilled in war, that went out to battle, and all the
congregation.

<span id="an_31:28">31:28</span> And levy a tribute unto Jehovah of the
men of war that went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, \[both\]
of the persons, and of the oxen, and of the asses, and of the flocks:

<span id="an_31:29">31:29</span> take it of their half, and give it unto
Eleazar the priest, for Jehovah's heave-offering.

<span id="an_31:30">31:30</span> And of the children of Israel's half,
thou shalt take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the
oxen, of the asses, and of the flocks, \[even\] of all the cattle, and
give them unto the Levites, that keep the charge of the tabernacle of
Jehovah.

<span id="an_31:31">31:31</span> And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as
Jehovah commanded Moses.

<span id="an_31:32">31:32</span> Now the prey, over and above the booty
which the men of war took, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand
and five thousand sheep,

<span id="an_31:33">31:33</span> and threescore and twelve thousand
oxen,

<span id="an_31:34">31:34</span> and threescore and one thousand asses,

<span id="an_31:35">31:35</span> and thirty and two thousand persons in
all, of the women that had not known man by lying with him.

<span id="an_31:36">31:36</span> And the half, which was the portion of
them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and
thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep:

<span id="an_31:37">31:37</span> and Jehovah's tribute of the sheep was
six hundred and threescore and fifteen.

<span id="an_31:38">31:38</span> And the oxen were thirty and six
thousand; of which Jehovah's tribute was threescore and twelve.

<span id="an_31:39">31:39</span> And the asses were thirty thousand and
five hundred; of which Jehovah's tribute was threescore and one.

<span id="an_31:40">31:40</span> And the persons were sixteen thousand;
of whom Jehovah's tribute was thirty and two persons.

<span id="an_31:41">31:41</span> And Moses gave the tribute, which was
Jehovah's heave-offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as Jehovah commanded
Moses.

<span id="an_31:42">31:42</span> And of the children of Israel's half,
which Moses divided off from the men that warred

<span id="an_31:43">31:43</span> (now the congregation's half was three
hundred thousand and thirty thousand, seven thousand and five hundred
sheep,

<span id="an_31:44">31:44</span> and thirty and six thousand oxen,

<span id="an_31:45">31:45</span> and thirty thousand and five hundred
asses,

<span id="an_31:46">31:46</span> and sixteen thousand persons),

<span id="an_31:47">31:47</span> even of the children of Israel's half,
Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of beast, and
gave them unto the Levites, that kept the charge of the tabernacle of
Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.

<span id="an_31:48">31:48</span> And the officers that were over the
thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and the captains of
hundreds, came near unto Moses;

<span id="an_31:49">31:49</span> and they said unto Moses, Thy servants
have taken the sum of the men of war that are under our charge, and
there lacketh not one man of us.

<span id="an_31:50">31:50</span> And we have brought Jehovah's oblation,
what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, ankle-chains, and
bracelets, signet-rings, ear-rings, and armlets, to make atonement for
our souls before Jehovah.

<span id="an_31:51">31:51</span> And Moses and Eleazar the priest took
the gold of them, even all wrought jewels.

<span id="an_31:52">31:52</span> And all the gold of the heave-offering
that they offered up to Jehovah, of the captains of thousands, and of
the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty
shekels.

<span id="an_31:53">31:53</span> (\[For\] the men of war had taken
booty, every man for himself.)

<span id="an_31:54">31:54</span> And Moses and Eleazar the priest took
the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it
into the tent of meeting, for a memorial for the children of Israel
before Jehovah.

<span id="an_32:1">32:1</span> Now the children of Reuben and the
children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw
the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a
place for cattle;

<span id="an_32:2">32:2</span> the children of Gad and the children of
Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto
the princes of the congregation, saying,

<span id="an_32:3">32:3</span> Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and
Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon,

<span id="an_32:4">32:4</span> the land which Jehovah smote before the
congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle; and thy servants have
cattle.

<span id="an_32:5">32:5</span> And they said, If we have found favor in
thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession;
bring us not over the Jordan.

<span id="an_32:6">32:6</span> And Moses said unto the children of Gad,
and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to the war, and
shall ye sit here?

<span id="an_32:7">32:7</span> And wherefore discourage ye the heart of
the children of Israel from going over into the land which Jehovah hath
given them?

<span id="an_32:8">32:8</span> Thus did your fathers, when I sent them
from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.

<span id="an_32:9">32:9</span> For when they went up unto the valley of
Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of
Israel, that they should not go into the land which Jehovah had given
them.

<span id="an_32:10">32:10</span> And Jehovah's anger was kindled in that
day, and he sware, saying,

<span id="an_32:11">32:11</span> Surely none of the men that came up out
of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I
sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not
wholly followed me:

<span id="an_32:12">32:12</span> save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the
Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; because they have wholly followed
Jehovah.

<span id="an_32:13">32:13</span> And Jehovah's anger was kindled against
Israel, and he made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty
years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of
Jehovah, was consumed.

<span id="an_32:14">32:14</span> And, behold, ye are risen up in your
fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce
anger of Jehovah toward Israel.

<span id="an_32:15">32:15</span> For if ye turn away from after him, he
will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye will destroy all
this people.

<span id="an_32:16">32:16</span> And they came near unto him, and said,
We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little
ones:

<span id="an_32:17">32:17</span> but we ourselves will be ready armed to
go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their
place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because
of the inhabitants of the land.

<span id="an_32:18">32:18</span> We will not return unto our houses,
until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.

<span id="an_32:19">32:19</span> For we will not inherit with them on
the other side of the Jordan, and forward; because our inheritance is
fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.

<span id="an_32:20">32:20</span> And Moses said unto them, If ye will do
this thing, if ye will arm yourselves to go before Jehovah to the war,

<span id="an_32:21">32:21</span> and every armed man of you will pass
over the Jordan before Jehovah, until he hath driven out his enemies
from before him,

<span id="an_32:22">32:22</span> and the land is subdued before Jehovah;
then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless towards Jehovah, and
towards Israel; and this land shall be unto you for a possession before
Jehovah.

<span id="an_32:23">32:23</span> But if ye will not do so, behold, ye
have sinned against Jehovah; and be sure your sin will find you out.

<span id="an_32:24">32:24</span> Build you cities for your little ones,
and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your
mouth.

<span id="an_32:25">32:25</span> And the children of Gad and the
children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my
lord commandeth.

<span id="an_32:26">32:26</span> Our little ones, our wives, our flocks,
and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead;

<span id="an_32:27">32:27</span> but thy servants will pass over, every
man that is armed for war, before Jehovah to battle, as my lord saith.

<span id="an_32:28">32:28</span> So Moses gave charge concerning them to
Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of
the fathers' \[houses\] of the tribes of the children of Israel.

<span id="an_32:29">32:29</span> And Moses said unto them, If the
children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the
Jordan, every man that is armed to battle, before Jehovah, and the land
shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead
for a possession:

<span id="an_32:30">32:30</span> but if they will not pass over with you
armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.

<span id="an_32:31">32:31</span> And the children of Gad and the
children of Reuben answered, saying, As Jehovah hath said unto thy
servants, so will we do.

<span id="an_32:32">32:32</span> We will pass over armed before Jehovah
into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance \[shall
remain\] with us beyond the Jordan.

<span id="an_32:33">32:33</span> And Moses gave unto them, even to the
children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto the half-tribe
of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the
Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to
the cities thereof with \[their\] borders, even the cities of the land
round about.

<span id="an_32:34">32:34</span> And the children of Gad built Dibon,
and Ataroth, and Aroer,

<span id="an_32:35">32:35</span> and Atrothshophan, and Jazer, and
Jogbehah,

<span id="an_32:36">32:36</span> and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran:
fortified cities, and folds for sheep.

<span id="an_32:37">32:37</span> And the children of Reuben built
Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,

<span id="an_32:38">32:38</span> and Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names
being changed,) and Sibmah: and they gave other names unto the cities
which they builded.

<span id="an_32:39">32:39</span> And the children of Machir the son of
Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites that
were therein.

<span id="an_32:40">32:40</span> And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the
son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.

<span id="an_32:41">32:41</span> And Jair the son of Manasseh went and
took the towns thereof, and called them Havvoth-jair.

<span id="an_32:42">32:42</span> And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the
villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.

<span id="an_33:1">33:1</span> These are the journeys of the children of
Israel, when they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their hosts
under the hand of Moses and Aaron.

<span id="an_33:2">33:2</span> And Moses wrote their goings out
according to their journeys by the commandment of Jehovah: and these are
their journeys according to their goings out.

<span id="an_33:3">33:3</span> And they journeyed from Rameses in the
first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow
after the passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in
the sight of all the Egyptians,

<span id="an_33:4">33:4</span> while the Egyptians were burying all
their first-born, whom Jehovah had smitten among them: upon their gods
also Jehovah executed judgments.

<span id="an_33:5">33:5</span> And the children of Israel journeyed from
Rameses, and encamped in Succoth.

<span id="an_33:6">33:6</span> And they journeyed from Succoth, and
encamped in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness.

<span id="an_33:7">33:7</span> And they journeyed from Etham, and turned
back unto Pihahiroth, which is before Baal-zephon: and they encamped
before Migdol.

<span id="an_33:8">33:8</span> And they journeyed from before Hahiroth,
and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness: and they
went three days' journey in the wilderness of Etham, and encamped in
Marah.

<span id="an_33:9">33:9</span> And they journeyed from Marah, and came
unto Elim: and in Elim were twelve springs of water, and threescore and
ten palm-trees; and they encamped there.

<span id="an_33:10">33:10</span> And they journeyed from Elim, and
encamped by the Red Sea.

<span id="an_33:11">33:11</span> And they journeyed from the Red Sea,
and encamped in the wilderness of Sin.

<span id="an_33:12">33:12</span> And they journeyed from the wilderness
of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah.

<span id="an_33:13">33:13</span> And they journeyed from Dophkah, and
encamped in Alush.

<span id="an_33:14">33:14</span> And they journeyed from Alush, and
encamped in Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drink.

<span id="an_33:15">33:15</span> And they journeyed from Rephidim, and
encamped in the wilderness of Sinai.

<span id="an_33:16">33:16</span> And they journeyed from the wilderness
of Sinai, and encamped in Kibroth-hattaavah.

<span id="an_33:17">33:17</span> And they journeyed from
Kibroth-hattaavah, and encamped in Hazeroth.

<span id="an_33:18">33:18</span> And they journeyed from Hazeroth, and
encamped in Rithmah.

<span id="an_33:19">33:19</span> And they journeyed from Rithmah, and
encamped in Rimmon-perez.

<span id="an_33:20">33:20</span> And they journeyed from Rimmon-perez,
and encamped in Libnah.

<span id="an_33:21">33:21</span> And they journeyed from Libnah, and
encamped in Rissah.

<span id="an_33:22">33:22</span> And they journeyed from Rissah, and
encamped in Kehelathah.

<span id="an_33:23">33:23</span> And they journeyed from Kehelathah, and
encamped in mount Shepher.

<span id="an_33:24">33:24</span> And they journeyed from mount Shepher,
and encamped in Haradah.

<span id="an_33:25">33:25</span> And they journeyed from Haradah, and
encamped in Makheloth.

<span id="an_33:26">33:26</span> And they journeyed from Makheloth, and
encamped in Tahath.

<span id="an_33:27">33:27</span> And they journeyed from Tahath, and
encamped in Terah.

<span id="an_33:28">33:28</span> And they journeyed from Terah, and
encamped in Mithkah.

<span id="an_33:29">33:29</span> And they journeyed from Mithkah, and
encamped in Hashmonah.

<span id="an_33:30">33:30</span> And they journeyed from Hashmonah, and
encamped in Moseroth.

<span id="an_33:31">33:31</span> And they journeyed from Moseroth, and
encamped in Bene-jaakan.

<span id="an_33:32">33:32</span> And they journeyed from Bene-jaakan,
and encamped in Hor-haggidgad.

<span id="an_33:33">33:33</span> And they journeyed from Hor-haggidgad,
and encamped in Jotbathah.

<span id="an_33:34">33:34</span> And they journeyed from Jotbathah, and
encamped in Abronah.

<span id="an_33:35">33:35</span> And they journeyed from Abronah, and
encamped in Ezion-geber.

<span id="an_33:36">33:36</span> And they journeyed from Ezion-geber,
and encamped in the wilderness of Zin (the same is Kadesh).

<span id="an_33:37">33:37</span> And they journeyed from Kadesh, and
encamped in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom.

<span id="an_33:38">33:38</span> And Aaron the priest went up into mount
Hor at the commandment of Jehovah, and died there, in the fortieth year
after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the
fifth month, on the first day of the month.

<span id="an_33:39">33:39</span> And Aaron was a hundred and twenty and
three years old when he died in mount Hor.

<span id="an_33:40">33:40</span> And the Canaanite, the king of Arad,
who dwelt in the South in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the
children of Israel.

<span id="an_33:41">33:41</span> And they journeyed from mount Hor, and
encamped in Zalmonah.

<span id="an_33:42">33:42</span> And they journeyed from Zalmonah, and
encamped in Punon.

<span id="an_33:43">33:43</span> And they journeyed from Punon, and
encamped in Oboth.

<span id="an_33:44">33:44</span> And they journeyed from Oboth, and
encamped in Iye-abarim, in the border of Moab.

<span id="an_33:45">33:45</span> And they journeyed from Iyim, and
encamped in Dibon-gad.

<span id="an_33:46">33:46</span> And they journeyed from Dibon-gad, and
encamped in Almon-diblathaim.

<span id="an_33:47">33:47</span> And they journeyed from
Almon-diblathaim, and encamped in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.

<span id="an_33:48">33:48</span> And they journeyed from the mountains
of Abarim, and encamped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.

<span id="an_33:49">33:49</span> And they encamped by the Jordan, from
Beth-jeshimoth even unto Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab.

<span id="an_33:50">33:50</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the
plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,

<span id="an_33:51">33:51</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, and
say unto them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,

<span id="an_33:52">33:52</span> then ye shall drive out all the
inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured
\[stones\], and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their
high places:

<span id="an_33:53">33:53</span> and ye shall take possession of the
land, and dwell therein; for unto you have I given the land to possess
it.

<span id="an_33:54">33:54</span> And ye shall inherit the land by lot
according to your families; to the more ye shall give the more
inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance:
wheresoever the lot falleth to any man, that shall be his; according to
the tribes of your fathers shall ye inherit.

<span id="an_33:55">33:55</span> But if ye will not drive out the
inhabitants of the land from before you, then shall those that ye let
remain of them be as pricks in your eyes, and as thorns in your sides,
and they shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.

<span id="an_33:56">33:56</span> And it shall come to pass, that, as I
thought to do unto them, so will I do unto you.

<span id="an_34:1">34:1</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_34:2">34:2</span> Command the children of Israel, and say
unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan (this is the land that
shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan
according to the borders thereof),

<span id="an_34:3">34:3</span> then your south quarter shall be from the
wilderness of Zin along by the side of Edom, and your south border shall
be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward;

<span id="an_34:4">34:4</span> and your border shall turn about
southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin; and the
goings out thereof shall be southward of Kadesh-barnea; and it shall go
forth to Hazar-addar, and pass along to Azmon;

<span id="an_34:5">34:5</span> and the border shall turn about from
Azmon unto the brook of Egypt, and the goings out thereof shall be at
the sea.

<span id="an_34:6">34:6</span> And for the western border, ye shall have
the great sea and the border \[thereof\]: this shall be your west
border.

<span id="an_34:7">34:7</span> And this shall be your north border: from
the great sea ye shall mark out for you mount Hor;

<span id="an_34:8">34:8</span> from mount Hor ye shall mark out unto the
entrance of Hamath; and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad;

<span id="an_34:9">34:9</span> and the border shall go forth to Ziphron,
and the goings out thereof shall be at Hazar-enan: this shall be your
north border.

<span id="an_34:10">34:10</span> And ye shall mark out your east border
from Hazar-enan to Shepham;

<span id="an_34:11">34:11</span> and the border shall go down from
Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go
down, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward;

<span id="an_34:12">34:12</span> and the border shall go down to the
Jordan, and the goings out thereof shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall
be your land according to the borders thereof round about.

<span id="an_34:13">34:13</span> And Moses commanded the children of
Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which
Jehovah hath commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the
half-tribe;

<span id="an_34:14">34:14</span> for the tribe of the children of Reuben
according to their fathers' houses, and the tribe of the children of Gad
according to their fathers' houses, have received, and the half-tribe of
Manasseh have received, their inheritance:

<span id="an_34:15">34:15</span> the two tribes and the half-tribe have
received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward
the sunrising.

<span id="an_34:16">34:16</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_34:17">34:17</span> These are the names of the men that
shall divide the land unto you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest, and
Joshua the son of Nun.

<span id="an_34:18">34:18</span> And ye shall take one prince of every
tribe, to divide the land for inheritance.

<span id="an_34:19">34:19</span> And these are the names of the men: Of
the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

<span id="an_34:20">34:20</span> And of the tribe of the children of
Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.

<span id="an_34:21">34:21</span> Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the
son of Chislon.

<span id="an_34:22">34:22</span> And of the tribe of the children of Dan
a prince, Bukki the son of Jogli.

<span id="an_34:23">34:23</span> Of the children of Joseph: of the tribe
of the children of Manasseh a prince, Hanniel the son of Ephod.

<span id="an_34:24">34:24</span> And of the tribe of the children of
Ephraim a prince, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.

<span id="an_34:25">34:25</span> And of the tribe of the children of
Zebulun a prince, Elizaphan the son of Parnach.

<span id="an_34:26">34:26</span> And of the tribe of the children of
Issachar a prince, Paltiel the son of Azzan.

<span id="an_34:27">34:27</span> And of the tribe of the children of
Asher a prince, Ahihud the son of Shelomi.

<span id="an_34:28">34:28</span> And of the tribe of the children of
Naphtali a prince, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.

<span id="an_34:29">34:29</span> These are they whom Jehovah commanded
to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of
Canaan.

<span id="an_35:1">35:1</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the
plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,

<span id="an_35:2">35:2</span> Command the children of Israel, that they
give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to
dwell in; and suburbs for the cities round about them shall ye give unto
the Levites.

<span id="an_35:3">35:3</span> And the cities shall they have to dwell
in; and their suburbs shall be for their cattle, and for their
substance, and for all their beasts.

<span id="an_35:4">35:4</span> And the suburbs of the cities, which ye
shall give unto the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and
outward a thousand cubits round about.

<span id="an_35:5">35:5</span> And ye shall measure without the city for
the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand
cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north
side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst. This shall be to
them the suburbs of the cities.

<span id="an_35:6">35:6</span> And the cities which ye shall give unto
the Levites, they shall be the six cities of refuge, which ye shall give
for the manslayer to flee unto: and besides them ye shall give forty and
two cities.

<span id="an_35:7">35:7</span> All the cities which ye shall give to the
Levites shall be forty and eight cities; them \[shall ye give\] with
their suburbs.

<span id="an_35:8">35:8</span> And concerning the cities which ye shall
give of the possession of the children of Israel, from the many ye shall
take many; and from the few ye shall take few: every one according to
his inheritance which he inheriteth shall give of his cities unto the
Levites.

<span id="an_35:9">35:9</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="an_35:10">35:10</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, and
say unto them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,

<span id="an_35:11">35:11</span> then ye shall appoint you cities to be
cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer that killeth any person
unwittingly may flee thither.

<span id="an_35:12">35:12</span> And the cities shall be unto you for
refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer die not, until he stand
before the congregation for judgment.

<span id="an_35:13">35:13</span> And the cities which ye shall give
shall be for you six cities of refuge.

<span id="an_35:14">35:14</span> Ye shall give three cities beyond the
Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan; they shall
be cities of refuge.

<span id="an_35:15">35:15</span> For the children of Israel, and for the
stranger and for the sojourner among them, shall these six cities be for
refuge; that every one that killeth any person unwittingly may flee
thither.

<span id="an_35:16">35:16</span> But if he smote him with an instrument
of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be
put to death.

<span id="an_35:17">35:17</span> And if he smote him with a stone in the
hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer
shall surely be put to death.

<span id="an_35:18">35:18</span> Or if he smote him with a weapon of
wood in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer:
the murderer shall surely be put to death.

<span id="an_35:19">35:19</span> The avenger of blood shall himself put
the murderer to death: when he meeteth him, he shall put him to death.

<span id="an_35:20">35:20</span> And if he thrust him of hatred, or
hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died,

<span id="an_35:21">35:21</span> or in enmity smote him with his hand,
so that he died; he that smote him shall surely be put to death; he is a
murderer: the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he
meeteth him.

<span id="an_35:22">35:22</span> But if he thrust him suddenly without
enmity, or hurled upon him anything without lying in wait,

<span id="an_35:23">35:23</span> or with any stone, whereby a man may
die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, so that he died, and he was
not his enemy, neither sought his harm;

<span id="an_35:24">35:24</span> then the congregation shall judge
between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these
ordinances;

<span id="an_35:25">35:25</span> and the congregation shall deliver the
manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation
shall restore him to his city of refuge, whither he was fled: and he
shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed
with the holy oil.

<span id="an_35:26">35:26</span> But if the manslayer shall at any time
go beyond the border of his city of refuge, whither he fleeth,

<span id="an_35:27">35:27</span> and the avenger of blood find him
without the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood slay
the manslayer; he shall not be guilty of blood,

<span id="an_35:28">35:28</span> because he should have remained in his
city of refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death
of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his
possession.

<span id="an_35:29">35:29</span> And these things shall be for a statute
\[and\] ordinance unto you throughout your generations in all your
dwellings.

<span id="an_35:30">35:30</span> Whoso killeth any person, the murderer
shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not
testify against any person that he die.

<span id="an_35:31">35:31</span> Moreover ye shall take no ransom for
the life of a murderer, that is guilty of death; but he shall surely be
put to death.

<span id="an_35:32">35:32</span> And ye shall take no ransom for him
that is fled to his city of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in
the land, until the death of the priest.

<span id="an_35:33">35:33</span> So ye shall not pollute the land
wherein ye are: for blood, it polluteth the land; and no expiation can
be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the
blood of him that shed it.

<span id="an_35:34">35:34</span> And thou shalt not defile the land
which ye inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell: for I, Jehovah, dwell
in the midst of the children of Israel.

<span id="an_36:1">36:1</span> And the heads of the fathers' \[houses\]
of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of
Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake
before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers'
\[houses\] of the children of Israel:

<span id="an_36:2">36:2</span> and they said, Jehovah commanded my lord
to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and
my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of Zelophehad
our brother unto his daughters.

<span id="an_36:3">36:3</span> And if they be married to any of the sons
of the \[other\] tribes of the children of Israel, then will their
inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will
be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so
will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.

<span id="an_36:4">36:4</span> And when the jubilee of the children of
Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be added unto the
inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will their
inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our
fathers.

<span id="an_36:5">36:5</span> And Moses commanded the children of
Israel according to the word of Jehovah, saying, The tribe of the sons
of Joseph speaketh right.

<span id="an_36:6">36:6</span> This is the thing which Jehovah doth
command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be
married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of
their father shall they be married.

<span id="an_36:7">36:7</span> So shall no inheritance of the children
of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall
cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.

<span id="an_36:8">36:8</span> And every daughter, that possesseth an
inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto
one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of
Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers.

<span id="an_36:9">36:9</span> So shall no inheritance remove from one
tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall
cleave every one to his own inheritance.

<span id="an_36:10">36:10</span> Even as Jehovah commanded Moses, so did
the daughters of Zelophehad:

<span id="an_36:11">36:11</span> for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and
Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their
father's brothers' sons.

<span id="an_36:12">36:12</span> They were married into the families of
the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and their inheritance remained
in the tribe of the family of their father.

<span id="an_36:13">36:13</span> These are the commandments and the
ordinances which Jehovah commanded by Moses unto the children of Israel
in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
