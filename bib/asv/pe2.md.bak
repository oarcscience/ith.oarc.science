### American Standard Version: 2 Peter

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus
Christ, to them that have obtained a like precious faith with us in the
righteousness of our God and \[the\] Saviour Jesus Christ:

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the
knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord;

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> seeing that his divine power hath granted
unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the
knowledge of him that called us by his own glory and virtue;

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> whereby he hath granted unto us his
precious and exceeding great promises; that through these ye may become
partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that
is in that world by lust.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Yea, and for this very cause adding on your
part all diligence, in your faith supply virtue; and in \[your\] virtue
knowledge;

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> and in \[your\] knowledge self-control; and
in \[your\] self-control patience; and in \[your\] patience godliness;

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> and in \[your\] godliness brotherly
kindness; and in \[your\] brotherly kindness love.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> For if these things are yours and abound,
they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful unto the knowledge of our
Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> For he that lacketh these things is blind,
seeing only what is near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old
sins.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Wherefore, brethren, give the more
diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these
things, ye shall never stumble:

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> for thus shall be richly supplied unto
you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Wherefore I shall be ready always to put
you in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and are
established in the truth which is with \[you\].

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> And I think it right, as long as I am in
this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> knowing that the putting off of my
tabernacle cometh swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ signified unto
me.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> Yea, I will give diligence that at every
time ye may be able after my decease to call these things to
remembrance.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> For we did not follow cunningly devised
fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> For he received from God the Father honor
and glory, when there was borne such a voice to him by the Majestic
Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased:

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> and this voice we \[ourselves\] heard
borne out of heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> And we have the word of prophecy \[made\]
more sure; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a lamp
shining in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in
your hearts:

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> knowing this first, that no prophecy of
scripture is of private interpretation.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> For no prophecy ever came by the will of
man: but men spake from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> But there arose false prophets also among
the people, as among you also there shall be false teachers, who shall
privily bring in destructive heresies, denying even the Master that
bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> And many shall follow their lascivious
doings; by reason of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken of.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And in covetousness shall they with feigned
words make merchandise of you: whose sentence now from of old lingereth
not, and their destruction slumbereth not.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> For if God spared not angels when they
sinned, but cast them down to hell, and committed them to pits of
darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> and spared not the ancient world, but
preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he
brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> and turning the cities of Sodom and
Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, having made them
an example unto those that should live ungodly;

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> and delivered righteous Lot, sore
distressed by the lascivious life of the wicked

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> (for that righteous man dwelling among
them, in seeing and hearing, vexed \[his\] righteous soul from day to
day with \[their\] lawless deeds):

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly
out of temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment unto the
day of judgment;

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> but chiefly them that walk after the
flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise dominion. Daring,
self-willed, they tremble not to rail at dignities:

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> whereas angels, though greater in might
and power, bring not a railing judgment against them before the Lord.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> But these, as creatures without reason,
born mere animals to be taken and destroyed, railing in matters whereof
they are ignorant, shall in their destroying surely be destroyed,

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> suffering wrong as the hire of
wrong-doing; \[men\] that count it pleasure to revel in the day-time,
spots and blemishes, revelling in their deceivings while they feast with
you;

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> having eyes full of adultery, and that
cannot cease from sin; enticing unstedfast souls; having a heart
exercised in covetousness; children of cursing;

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> forsaking the right way, they went
astray, having followed the way of Balaam the \[son\] of Beor, who loved
the hire of wrong-doing;

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> but he was rebuked for his own
transgression: a dumb ass spake with man's voice and stayed the madness
of the prophet.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> These are springs without water, and
mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been
reserved.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> For, uttering great swelling \[words\] of
vanity, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those
who are just escaping from them that live in error;

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> promising them liberty, while they
themselves are bondservants of corruption; for of whom a man is
overcome, of the same is he also brought into bondage.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> For if, after they have escaped the
defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome, the last
state is become worse with them than the first.

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> For it were better for them not to have
known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back
from the holy commandment delivered unto them.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> It has happened unto them according to
the true proverb, The dog turning to his own vomit again, and the sow
that had washed to wallowing in the mire.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> This is now, beloved, the second epistle
that I write unto you; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind
by putting you in remembrance;

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> that ye should remember the words which
were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandments of the
Lord and Saviour through your apostles:

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> knowing this first, that in the last days
mockers shall come with mockery, walking after their own lusts,

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> and saying, Where is the promise of his
coming? for, from the day that the fathers fell asleep, all things
continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> For this they willfully forget, that there
were heavens from of old, and an earth compacted out of water and amidst
water, by the word of God;

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> by which means the world that then was,
being overflowed with water, perished:

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> but the heavens that now are, and the
earth, by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved
against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> But forget not this one thing, beloved,
that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years
as one day.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> The Lord is not slack concerning his
promise, as some count slackness; but is longsuffering to you-ward, not
wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> But the day of the Lord will come as a
thief; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and
the elements shall be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the
works that are therein shall be burned up.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Seeing that these things are thus all to
be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in \[all\] holy
living and godliness,

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> looking for and earnestly desiring the
coming of the day of God, by reason of which the heavens being on fire
shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> But, according to his promise, we look
for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look
for these things, give diligence that ye may be found in peace, without
spot and blameless in his sight.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> And account that the longsuffering of our
Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to
the wisdom given to him, wrote unto you;

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> as also in all \[his\] epistles, speaking
in them of these things; wherein are some things hard to be understood,
which the ignorant and unstedfast wrest, as \[they do\] also the other
scriptures, unto their own destruction.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> Ye therefore, beloved, knowing \[these
things\] beforehand, beware lest, being carried away with the error of
the wicked, ye fall from your own stedfastness.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> But grow in the grace and knowledge of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him \[be\] the glory both now and
for ever. Amen.
