### American Standard Version: 1 Thessalonians

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the
church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
Grace to you and peace.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> We give thanks to God always for you all,
making mention \[of you\] in our prayers;

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> remembering without ceasing your work of
faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ,
before our God and Father;

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> knowing, brethren beloved of God, your
election,

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> how that our gospel came not unto you in
word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and \[in\] much
assurance; even as ye know what manner of men we showed ourselves toward
you for your sake.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And ye became imitators of us, and of the
Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy
Spirit;

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> so that ye became an ensample to all that
believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> For from you hath sounded forth the word of
the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your
faith to God-ward is gone forth; so that we need not to speak anything.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> For they themselves report concerning us
what manner of entering in we had unto you; and how ye turned unto God
from idols, to serve a living and true God,

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom
he raised from the dead, \[even\] Jesus, who delivereth us from the
wrath to come.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> For yourselves, brethren, know our entering
in unto you, that it hath not been found vain:

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> but having suffered before and been
shamefully treated, as ye know, at Philippi, we waxed bold in our God to
speak unto you the gospel of God in much conflict.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> For our exhortation \[is\] not of error,
nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> but even as we have been approved of God to
be intrusted with the gospel, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God
who proveth our hearts.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> For neither at any time were we found using
words of flattery, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness, God is
witness;

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> nor seeking glory of men, neither from you
nor from others, when we might have claimed authority as apostles of
Christ.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> But we were gentle in the midst of you, as
when a nurse cherisheth her own children:

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> even so, being affectionately desirous of
you, we were well pleased to impart unto you, not the gospel of God
only, but also our own souls, because ye were become very dear to us.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> For ye remember, brethren, our labor and
travail: working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we
preached unto you the gospel of God.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> Ye are witnesses, and God \[also\], how
holily and righteously and unblameably we behaved ourselves toward you
that believe:

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> as ye know how we \[dealt with\] each one
of you, as a father with his own children, exhorting you, and
encouraging \[you\], and testifying,

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> to the end that ye should walk worthily
of God, who calleth you into his own kingdom and glory.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And for this cause we also thank God
without ceasing, that, when ye received from us the word of the message,
\[even the word\] of God, ye accepted \[it\] not \[as\] the word of men,
but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also worketh in you that
believe.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> For ye, brethren, became imitators of the
churches of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus: for ye also
suffered the same things of your own countrymen, even as they did of the
Jews;

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> who both killed the Lord Jesus and the
prophets, and drove out us, and pleased not God, and are contrary to all
men;

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles
that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always: but the wrath is
come upon them to the uttermost.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> But we, brethren, being bereaved of you
for a short season, in presence not in heart, endeavored the more
exceedingly to see your face with great desire:

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> because we would fain have come unto you,
I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of
glorying? Are not even ye, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> For ye are our glory and our joy.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Wherefore when we could no longer forbear,
we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone;

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> and sent Timothy, our brother and God's
minister in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort
\[you\] concerning your faith;

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> that no man be moved by these afflictions;
for yourselves know that hereunto we are appointed.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> For verily, when we were with you, we told
you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction; even as it came to
pass, and ye know.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> For this cause I also, when I could no
longer forbear, sent that I might know your faith, lest by any means the
tempter had tempted you, and our labor should be in vain.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> But when Timothy came even now unto us from
you, and brought us glad tidings of your faith and love, and that ye
have good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, even as we also
\[to see\] you;

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> for this cause, brethren, we were comforted
over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith:

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> for now we live, if ye stand fast in the
Lord.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> For what thanksgiving can we render again
unto God for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before
our God;

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> night and day praying exceedingly that we
may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Now may our God and Father himself, and
our Lord Jesus, direct our way unto you:

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> and the Lord make you to increase and
abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also
\[do\] toward you;

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> to the end he may establish your hearts
unblameable in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our
Lord Jesus with all his saints.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Finally then, brethren, we beseech and
exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that, as ye received of us how ye ought to
walk and to please God, even as ye do walk, --that ye abound more and
more.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> For ye know what charge we gave you through
the Lord Jesus.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> For this is the will of God, \[even\] your
sanctification, that ye abstain from fornication;

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> that each one of you know how to possess
himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> not in the passion of lust, even as the
Gentiles who know not God;

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> that no man transgress, and wrong his
brother in the matter: because the Lord is an avenger in all these
things, as also we forewarned you and testified.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> For God called us not for uncleanness, but
in sanctification.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> Therefore he that rejecteth, rejecteth not
man, but God, who giveth his Holy Spirit unto you.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> But concerning love of the brethren ye have
no need that one write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to
love one another;

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> for indeed ye do it toward all the
brethren that are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brethren, that ye
abound more and more;

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> and that ye study to be quiet, and to do
your own business, and to work with your hands, even as we charged you;

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> that ye may walk becomingly toward them
that are without, and may have need of nothing.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> But we would not have you ignorant,
brethren, concerning them that fall asleep; that ye sorrow not, even as
the rest, who have no hope.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> For if we believe that Jesus died and
rose again, even so them also that are fallen asleep in Jesus will God
bring with him.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> For this we say unto you by the word of
the Lord, that we that are alive, that are left unto the coming of the
Lord, shall in no wise precede them that are fallen asleep.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> For the Lord himself shall descend from
heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the
trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first;

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> then we that are alive, that are left,
shall together with them be caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord in
the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> Wherefore comfort one another with these
words.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> But concerning the times and the seasons,
brethren, ye have no need that aught be written unto you.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> For yourselves know perfectly that the day
of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> When they are saying, Peace and safety,
then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with
child; and they shall in no wise escape.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that
that day should overtake you as a thief:

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> for ye are all sons of light, and sons of
the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness;

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> so then let us not sleep, as do the rest,
but let us watch and be sober.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> For they that sleep sleep in the night: and
they that are drunken are drunken in the night.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> But let us, since we are of the day, be
sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet,
the hope of salvation.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> For God appointed us not into wrath, but
unto the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> who died for us, that, whether we wake or
sleep, we should live together with him.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> Wherefore exhort one another, and build
each other up, even as also ye do.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> But we beseech you, brethren, to know
them that labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish
you;

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> and to esteem them exceeding highly in
love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the
disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be
longsuffering toward all.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> See that none render unto any one evil
for evil; but always follow after that which is good, one toward
another, and toward all.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> Rejoice always;

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> pray without ceasing;

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> in everything give thanks: for this is
the will of God in Christ Jesus to you-ward.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> Quench not the Spirit;

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> despise not prophesyings;

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> prove all things; hold fast that which is
good;

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> abstain from every form of evil.

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> And the God of peace himself sanctify you
wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire,
without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> Faithful is he that calleth you, who will
also do it.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> Brethren, pray for us.

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.

<span id="an_5:27">5:27</span> I adjure you by the Lord that this
epistle be read unto all the brethren.

<span id="an_5:28">5:28</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you.
