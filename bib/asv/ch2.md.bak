### American Standard Version: 2 Chronicles

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> And Solomon the son of David was
strengthened in his kingdom, and Jehovah his God was with him, and
magnified him exceedingly.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> And Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the
captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every
prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers' \[houses\].

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> So Solomon, and all the assembly with him,
went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tent of
meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the
wilderness.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> But the ark of God had David brought up
from Kiriath-jearim to \[the place\] that David had prepared for it; for
he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezalel the
son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of
Jehovah: and Solomon and the assembly sought unto it.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And Solomon went up thither to the brazen
altar before Jehovah, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a
thousand burnt-offerings upon it.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> In that night did God appear unto Solomon,
and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast showed
great lovingkindness unto David my father, and hast made me king in his
stead.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Now, O Jehovah God, let thy promise unto
David my father be established; for thou hast made me king over a people
like the dust of the earth in multitude.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I
may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this thy
people, that is so great?

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> And God said to Solomon, Because this was
in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the
life of them that hate thee, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast
asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my
people, over whom I have made thee king:

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> wisdom and knowledge is granted unto
thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none
of the kings have had that have been before thee; neither shall there
any after thee have the like.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> So Solomon came from the high place that
was at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, unto Jerusalem; and he
reigned over Israel.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> And Solomon gathered chariots and
horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve
thousand horsemen, that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the
king at Jerusalem.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> And the king made silver and gold to be
in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees
that are in the lowland, for abundance.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> And the horses which Solomon had were
brought out of Egypt; the king's merchants received them in droves, each
drove at a price.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> And they fetched up and brought out of
Egypt a chariot for six hundred \[shekels\] of silver, and a horse for a
hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the
kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Now Solomon purposed to build a house for
the name of Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> And Solomon counted out threescore and ten
thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand men that were
hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee
them.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre,
saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him
cedars to build him a house to dwell therein, \[even so deal with me\].

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> Behold, I am about to build a house for the
name of Jehovah my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him
incense of sweet spices, and for the continual showbread, and for the
burnt-offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new
moons, and on the set feasts of Jehovah our God. This is \[an
ordinance\] for ever to Israel.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> And the house which I build is great; for
great is our God above all gods.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> But who is able to build him a house,
seeing heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I
then, that I should build him a house, save only to burn incense before
him?

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> Now therefore send me a man skilful to work
in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and
crimson, and blue, and that knoweth how to grave \[all manner of\]
gravings, \[to be\] with the skilful men that are with me in Judah and
in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Send me also cedar-trees, fir-trees, and
algum-trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that thy servants know how to
cut timber in Lebanon: and, behold, my servants shall be with thy
servants,

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> even to prepare me timber in abundance; for
the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> And, behold, I will give to thy servants,
the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat,
and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of
wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in
writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because Jehovah loveth his people, he
hath made thee king over them.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Huram said moreover, Blessed be Jehovah,
the God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David
the king a wise son, endued with discretion and understanding, that
should build a house for Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And now I have sent a skilful man, endued
with understanding, of Huram my father's,

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> the son of a woman of the daughters of
Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in
silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue,
and in fine linen, and in crimson, also to grave any manner of graving,
and to devise any device; that there may be \[a place\] appointed unto
him with thy skilful men, and with the skilful men of my lord David thy
father.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> Now therefore the wheat and the barley,
the oil and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto
his servants:

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as
much as thou shalt need; and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea
to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> And Solomon numbered all the sojourners
that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his
father had numbered them; and they were found a hundred and fifty
thousand and three thousand and six hundred.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> And he set threescore and ten thousand of
them to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the
mountains, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the
people at work.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Then Solomon began to build the house of
Jehovah at Jerusalem on mount Moriah, where \[Jehovah\] appeared unto
David his father, which he made ready in the place that David had
appointed, in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> And he began to build in the second \[day\]
of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Now these are the foundations which Solomon
laid for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after
the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> And the porch that was before \[the
house\], the length of it, according to the breadth of the house, was
twenty cubits, and the height a hundred and twenty; and he overlaid it
within with pure gold.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> And the greater house he ceiled with
fir-wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and wrought thereon
palm-trees and chains.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> And he garnished the house with precious
stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> He overlaid also the house, the beams, the
thresholds, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and
graved cherubim on the walls.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> And he made the most holy house: the length
thereof, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and
the breadth thereof twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold,
amounting to six hundred talents.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> And the weight of the nails was fifty
shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> And in the most holy house he made two
cherubim of image work; and they overlaid them with gold.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> And the wings of the cherubim were twenty
cubits long: the wing of the one \[cherub\] was five cubits, reaching to
the wall of the house; and the other wing was \[likewise\] five cubits,
reaching to the wing of the other cherub.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> And the wing of the other cherub was five
cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five
cubits \[also\], joining to the wing of the other cherub.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> The wings of these cherubim spread
themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their
faces were toward the house.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> And he made the veil of blue, and purple,
and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim thereon.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> Also he made before the house two pillars
of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of
each of them was five cubits.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> And he made chains in the oracle, and put
\[them\] on the tops of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates,
and put them on the chains.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> And he set up the pillars before the
temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the
name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left
Boaz.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty
cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and
ten cubits the height thereof.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits
from brim to brim, round in compass; and the height thereof was five
cubits; and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> And under it was the likeness of oxen,
which did compass it round about, for ten cubits, compassing the sea
round about. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking
toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking
toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set
upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> And it was a handbreadth thick; and the
brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a
lily: it received and held three thousand baths.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> He made also ten lavers, and put five on
the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as
belonged to the burnt-offering they washed in them; but the sea was for
the priests to wash in.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> And he made the ten candlesticks of gold
according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the
temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> He made also ten tables, and placed them in
the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made a
hundred basins of gold.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> Furthermore he made the court of the
priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the
doors of them with brass.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> And he set the sea on the right side \[of
the house\] eastward, toward the south.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> And Huram made the pots, and the shovels,
and the basins. So Huram made an end of doing the work that he wrought
for king Solomon in the house of God:

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> the two pillars, and the bowls, and the
two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, and the two networks
to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the
pillars,

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> and the four hundred pomegranates for the
two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the
two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> He made also the bases, and the lavers
made he upon the bases;

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> The pots also, and the shovels, and the
flesh-hooks, and all the vessels thereof, did Huram his father make for
king Solomon for the house of Jehovah of bright brass.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> In the plain of the Jordan did the king
cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> Thus Solomon made all these vessels in
great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> And Solomon made all the vessels that
were in the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon
was the showbread;

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> and the candlesticks with their lamps, to
burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> and the flowers, and the lamps, and the
tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold;

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> and the snuffers, and the basins, and the
spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold: and as for the entry of the
house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of
the house, \[to wit\], of the temple, were of gold.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Thus all the work that Solomon wrought for
the house of Jehovah was finished. And Solomon brought in the things
that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold, and
all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Then Solomon assembled the elders of
Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers'
\[houses\] of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the
ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> nd all the men of Israel assembled
themselves unto the king at the feast, which was \[in\] the seventh
month.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> And all the elders of Israel came: and the
Levites took up the ark;

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> and they brought up the ark, and the tent
of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these did
the priests the Levites bring up.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> And king Solomon and all the congregation
of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were before the ark,
sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for
multitude.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> And the priests brought in the ark of the
covenant of Jehovah unto its place, into the oracle of the house, to the
most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> For the cherubim spread forth their wings
over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the
staves thereof above.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> And the staves were so long that the ends
of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were
not seen without: and there it is unto this day.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> There was nothing in the ark save the two
tables which Moses put \[there\] at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant
with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And it came to pass, when the priests
were come out of the holy place, (for all the priests that were present
had sanctified themselves, and did not keep their courses;

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> also the Levites who were the singers,
all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their
brethren, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and psalteries and harps,
stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty
priests sounding with trumpets;)

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> it came to pass, when the trumpeters and
singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and
thanking Jehovah; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets
and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Jehovah, \[saying\],
For he is good; for his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever; that then
the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of Jehovah,

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> so that the priests could not stand to
minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of Jehovah filled the
house of God.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Then spake Solomon, Jehovah hath said that
he would dwell in the thick darkness.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> But I have built thee a house of
habitation, and a place for thee to dwell in for ever.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> And the king turned his face, and blessed
all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of
Israel, who spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his
hands fulfilled it, saying,

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> Since the day that I brought forth my
people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes
of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither
chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel:

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name
might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> Now it was in the heart of David my father
to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> But Jehovah said unto David my father,
Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst
well that it was in thy heart:

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> nevertheless thou shalt not build the
house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall
build the house for my name.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> And Jehovah hath performed his word that
he spake; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on
the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for
the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> And there have I set the ark, wherein is
the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with the children of Israel.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> And he stood before the altar of Jehovah
in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his
hands

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> (for Solomon had made a brazen scaffold,
five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had
set it in the midst of the court; and upon it he stood, and kneeled down
upon his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his
hands toward heaven;)

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> and he said, O Jehovah, the God of
Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven, or on earth; who keepest
covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants, that walk before thee
with all their heart;

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> who hast kept with thy servant David my
father that which thou didst promise him: yea, thou spakest with thy
mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of
Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast
promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit
on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to
walk in my law as thou hast walked before me.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of
Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant
David.

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> But will God in very deed dwell with men
on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain
thee; how much less this house which I have builded!

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of
thy servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto
the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee;

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> that thine eyes may be open toward this
house day and night, even toward the place whereof thou hast said that
thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy
servant shall pray toward this place.

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> And hearken thou to the supplications of
thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this
place: yea, hear thou from thy dwelling-place, even from heaven; and
when thou hearest forgive.

<span id="an_6:22">6:22</span> If a man sin against his neighbor, and an
oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he come \[and\] swear
before thine altar in this house;

<span id="an_6:23">6:23</span> then hear thou from heaven, and do, and
judge thy servants, requiting the wicked, to bring his way upon his own
head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his
righteousness.

<span id="an_6:24">6:24</span> And if thy people Israel be smitten down
before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn
again and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee
in this house;

<span id="an_6:25">6:25</span> then hear thou from heaven, and forgive
the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which
thou gavest to them and to their fathers.

<span id="an_6:26">6:26</span> When the heavens are shut up, and there
is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward
this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou
dost afflict them:

<span id="an_6:27">6:27</span> then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the
sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teachest them
the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land,
which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.

<span id="an_6:28">6:28</span> If there be in the land famine, if there
be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if
their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever
plague or whatsoever sickness there be;

<span id="an_6:29">6:29</span> what prayer and supplication soever be
made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man
his own plague and his own sorrow, and shall spread forth his hands
toward this house:

<span id="an_6:30">6:30</span> then hear thou from heaven thy
dwelling-place and forgive, and render unto every man according to all
his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest
the hearts of the children of men;)

<span id="an_6:31">6:31</span> that they may fear thee, to walk in thy
ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our
fathers.

<span id="an_6:32">6:32</span> Moreover concerning the foreigner, that
is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come from a far country for
thy great name's sake, and thy mighty hand, and thine outstretched arm;
when they shall come and pray toward this house:

<span id="an_6:33">6:33</span> then hear thou from heaven, even from thy
dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calleth to
thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name, and fear
thee, as doth thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house
which I have built is called by thy name.

<span id="an_6:34">6:34</span> If thy people go out to battle against
their enemies, by whatsoever way thou shalt send them, and they pray
unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I
have built for thy name;

<span id="an_6:35">6:35</span> then hear thou from heaven their prayer
and their supplication, and maintain their cause.

<span id="an_6:36">6:36</span> If they sin against thee (for there is no
man that sinneth not), and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to
the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto a land far off or
near;

<span id="an_6:37">6:37</span> yet if they shall bethink themselves in
the land whither they are carried captive, and turn again, and make
supplication unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have
sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly;

<span id="an_6:38">6:38</span> if they return unto thee with all their
heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither
they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which thou
gavest unto their fathers, and the city which thou hast chosen, and
toward the house which I have built for thy name:

<span id="an_6:39">6:39</span> then hear thou from heaven, even from thy
dwelling-place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their
cause, and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee.

<span id="an_6:40">6:40</span> Now, O my God, let, I beseech thee, thine
eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent, unto the prayer that is made
in this place.

<span id="an_6:41">6:41</span> Now therefore arise, O Jehovah God, into
thy resting-place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O
Jehovah God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in
goodness.

<span id="an_6:42">6:42</span> O Jehovah God, turn not away the face of
thine anointed: remember \[thy\] lovingkindnesses to David thy servant.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> Now when Solomon had made an end of
praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt-offering
and the sacrifices; and the glory of Jehovah filled the house.

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> And the priests could not enter into the
house of Jehovah, because the glory of Jehovah filled Jehovah's house.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> And all the children of Israel looked on,
when the fire came down, and the glory of Jehovah was upon the house;
and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the
pavement, and worshipped, and gave thanks unto Jehovah, \[saying\], For
he is good; for his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> Then the king and all the people offered
sacrifice before Jehovah.

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of
twenty and two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep.
So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> And the priests stood, according to their
offices; the Levites also with instruments of music of Jehovah, which
David the king had made to give thanks unto Jehovah, (for his
lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever,) when David praised by their
ministry: and the priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel
stood.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the
court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the
burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen
altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt-offering,
and the meal-offering, and the fat.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> So Solomon held the feast at that time
seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the
entrance of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> And on the eighth day they held a solemn
assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the
feast seven days.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> And on the three and twentieth day of the
seventh month he sent the people away unto their tents, joyful and glad
of heart for the goodness that Jehovah had showed unto David, and to
Solomon, and to Israel his people.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> Thus Solomon finished the house of
Jehovah, and the king's house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to
make in the house of Jehovah, and in his own house, he prosperously
effected.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> And Jehovah appeared to Solomon by night,
and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place
to myself for a house of sacrifice.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> If I shut up the heavens so that there is
no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send
pestilence among my people;

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> if my people, who are called by my name,
shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their
wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin,
and will heal their land.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine
ears attent, unto the prayer that is made in this place.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> For now have I chosen and hallowed this
house, that my name may be there for ever; and mine eyes and my heart
shall be there perpetually.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before
me as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have
commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances;

<span id="an_7:18">7:18</span> then I will establish the throne of thy
kingdom, according as I covenanted with David thy father, saying, There
shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.

<span id="an_7:19">7:19</span> But if ye turn away, and forsake my
statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go
and serve other gods, and worship them;

<span id="an_7:20">7:20</span> then will I pluck them up by the roots
out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have
hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and I will make it a
proverb and a byword among all peoples.

<span id="an_7:21">7:21</span> And this house, which is so high, every
one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall say, Why hath
Jehovah done thus unto this land, and to this house?

<span id="an_7:22">7:22</span> And they shall answer, Because they
forsook Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them forth out of
the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and
served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> And it came to pass at the end of twenty
years, wherein Solomon had built the house of Jehovah, and his own
house,

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> that the cities which Huram had given to
Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell
there.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and
prevailed against it.

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and
all the store-cities, which he built in Hamath.

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and
Beth-horon the nether, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> and Baalath, and all the store-cities that
Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his
horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in
Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> As for all the people that were left of the
Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
Jebusites, that were not of Israel;

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> of their children that were left after them
in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, of them did
Solomon raise a levy \[of bondservants\] unto this day.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> But of the children of Israel did Solomon
make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of
his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.

<span id="an_8:10">8:10</span> And these were the chief officers of king
Solomon, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.

<span id="an_8:11">8:11</span> And Solomon brought up the daughter of
Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for
her; for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of
Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of Jehovah hath
come.

<span id="an_8:12">8:12</span> Then Solomon offered burnt-offerings unto
Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah, which he had built before the porch,

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> even as the duty of every day required,
offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on
the new moons, and on the set feasts, three times in the year, \[even\]
in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the
feast of tabernacles.

<span id="an_8:14">8:14</span> And he appointed, according to the
ordinance of David his father, the courses of the priests to their
service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise, and to minister
before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers
also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God
commanded.

<span id="an_8:15">8:15</span> And they departed not from the
commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any
matter, or concerning the treasures.

<span id="an_8:16">8:16</span> Now all the work of Solomon was prepared
unto the day of the foundation of the house of Jehovah, and until it was
finished. \[So\] the house of Jehovah was completed.

<span id="an_8:17">8:17</span> Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to
Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom.

<span id="an_8:18">8:18</span> And Huram sent him by the hands of his
servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they
came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and fetched from thence four
hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> And when the queen of Sheba heard of the
fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at
Jerusalem, with a very great train, and camels that bare spices, and
gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to
Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> And Solomon told her all her questions; and
there was not anything hid from Solomon which he told her not.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> And when the queen of Sheba had seen the
wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> and the food of his table, and the sitting
of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel,
his cupbearers also, and their apparel, and his ascent by which he went
up unto the house of Jehovah; there was no more spirit in her.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> And she said to the king, It was a true
report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> Howbeit I believed not their words, until I
came, and mine eyes had seen it; and, behold, the half of the greatness
of thy wisdom was not told me: thou exceedest the fame that I heard.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy
servants, that stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted
in thee, to set thee on his throne, to be king for Jehovah thy God:
because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made
he thee king over them, to do justice and righteousness.

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> And she gave the king a hundred and twenty
talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones:
neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king
Solomon.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> And the servants also of Huram, and the
servants of Solomon, that brought gold from Ophir, brought algum-trees
and precious stones.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> And the king made of the algum-trees
terraces for the house of Jehovah, and for the king's house, and harps
and psalteries for the singers: and there were none such seen before in
the land of Judah.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> And king Solomon gave to the queen of
Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, besides that which she had
brought unto the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and
her servants.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> Now the weight of gold that came to
Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of
gold,

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> besides that which the traders and
merchants brought: and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the
country brought gold and silver to Solomon.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> And king Solomon made two hundred
bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred \[shekels\] of beaten gold went to
one buckler.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> And \[he made\] three hundred shields of
beaten gold; three hundred \[shekels\] of gold went to one shield: and
the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> Moreover the king made a great throne of
ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> nd there were six steps to the throne,
with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays
on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside
the stays.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> And twelve lions stood there on the one
side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in
any kingdom.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> And all king Solomon's drinking vessels
were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon
were of pure gold: silver was nothing accounted of in the days of
Solomon.

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> For the king had ships that went to
Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years came the
ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and
peacocks.

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of
the earth in riches and wisdom.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> And all the kings of the earth sought the
presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> And they brought every man his tribute,
vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, armor, and spices,
horses, and mules, a rate year by year.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> And Solomon had four thousand stalls for
horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in
the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> And he ruled over all the kings from the
River even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> And the king made silver to be in
Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that
are in the lowland, for abundance.

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> And they brought horses for Solomon out
of Egypt, and out of all lands.

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> Now the rest of the acts of Solomon,
first and last, are they not written in the history of Nathan the
prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions
of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all
Israel forty years.

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> And Solomon slept with his fathers, and
he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son
reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> And Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all
Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the
son of Nebat heard of it, (for he was in Egypt, whither he had fled from
the presence of king Solomon,) that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> And they sent and called him; and
Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spake to Rehoboam, saying,

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> Thy father made our yoke grievous: now
therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy
yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> And he said unto them, Come again unto me
after three days. And the people departed.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> And king Rehoboam took counsel with the
old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived,
saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> And they spake unto him, saying, If thou
be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them,
then they will be thy servants for ever.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> But he forsook the counsel of the old men
which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were
grown up with him, that stood before him.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> And he said unto them, What counsel give
ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me,
saying, Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> And the young men that were grown up
with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou say unto the people
that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make
thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger
is thicker than my father's loins.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> And now whereas my father did lade you
with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with
whips, but I \[will chastise you\] with scorpions.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> So Jeroboam and all the people came to
Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the
third day.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> And the king answered them roughly; and
king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> and spake to them after the counsel of
the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add
thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I \[will chastise you\]
with scorpions.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> So the king hearkened not unto the
people; for it was brought about of God, that Jehovah might establish
his word, which he spake by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of
Nebat.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> And when all Israel saw that the king
hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What
portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of
Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house,
David. So all Israel departed unto their tents.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> But as for the children of Israel that
dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who
was over the men subject to taskwork; and the children of Israel stoned
him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to
his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_10:19">10:19</span> So Israel rebelled against the house of
David unto this day.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem,
he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore
thousand chosen men, that were warriors, to fight against Israel, to
bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> But the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah
the man of God, saying,

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon,
king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> Thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not go up,
nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house; for this
thing is of me. So they hearkened unto the words of Jehovah, and
returned from going against Jeroboam.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and
built cities for defence in Judah.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> He built Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> And Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam,

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron,
which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> And he fortified the strongholds, and
put captains in them, and stores of victuals, and oil and wine.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> And in every city \[he put\] shields
and spears, and made them exceeding strong. And Judah and Benjamin
belonged to him.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> And the priests and the Levites that
were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> For the Levites left their suburbs and
their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his
sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest's office
unto Jehovah;

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> and he appointed him priests for the
high places, and for the he-goats, and for the calves which he had made.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> And after them, out of all the tribes
of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek Jehovah, the God of Israel,
came to Jerusalem to sacrifice unto Jehovah, the God of their fathers.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> So they strengthened the kingdom of
Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years; for
they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> And Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath
the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, \[and of\] Abihail the
daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> and she bare him sons: Jeush, and
Shemariah, and Zaham.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> And after her he took Maacah the
daughter of Absalom; and she bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and
Shelomith.

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter
of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen
wives, and threescore concubines, and begat twenty and eight sons and
threescore daughters.)

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son
of Maacah to be chief, \[even\] the prince among his brethren; for \[he
was minded\] to make him king.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of
all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, unto every
fortified city: and he gave them victuals in abundance. And he sought
\[for them\] many wives.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> And it came to pass, when the kingdom of
Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook the law of
Jehovah, and all Israel with him.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> And it came to pass in the fifth year of
king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem,
because they had trespassed against Jehovah,

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> with twelve hundred chariots, and
threescore thousand horsemen. And the people were without number that
came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> And he took the fortified cities which
pertained to Judah, and came unto Jerusalem.

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> Now Shemaiah the prophet came to
Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to
Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, Ye
have forsaken me, therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> Then the princes of Israel and the king
humbled themselves; and they said, Jehovah is righteous.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> And when Jehovah saw that they humbled
themselves, the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah, saying, They have
humbled themselves: I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some
deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the
hand of Shishak.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> Nevertheless they shall be his servants,
that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the
countries.

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> So Shishak king of Egypt came up against
Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the
treasures of the king's house: he took all away: he took away also the
shields of gold which Solomon had made.

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> And king Rehoboam made in their stead
shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the
guard, that kept the door of the king's house.

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> And it was so, that, as oft as the king
entered into the house of Jehovah, the guard came and bare them, and
brought them back into the guard-chamber.

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> And when he humbled himself, the wrath
of Jehovah turned from him, so as not to destroy him altogether: and
moreover in Judah there were good things \[found\].

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> So king Rehoboam strengthened himself
in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was forty and one years old when
he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city
which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his
name there: and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> And he did that which was evil, because
he set not his heart to seek Jehovah.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and
last, are they not written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and
of Iddo the seer, after the manner of genealogies? And there were wars
between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> And Rehoboam slept with his fathers,
and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his
stead.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam
began Abijah to reign over Judah.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and
his mother's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there
was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> And Abijah joined battle with an army of
valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam
set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen
men, who were mighty men of valor.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim,
which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam
and all Israel:

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> Ought ye not to know that Jehovah, the
God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to
him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the
servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his
lord.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> And there were gathered unto him
worthless men, base fellows, that strengthened themselves against
Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted,
and could not withstand them.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> And now ye think to withstand the kingdom
of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great
multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made
you for gods.

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> Have ye not driven out the priests of
Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests after
the manner of the peoples of \[other\] lands? so that whosoever cometh
to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may
be a priest of \[them that are\] no gods.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and
we have not forsaken him; and \[we have\] priests ministering unto
Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> and they burn unto Jehovah every
morning and every evening burnt-offerings and sweet incense: the
showbread also \[set they\] in order upon the pure table; and the
candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for
we keep the charge of Jehovah our God; but ye have forsaken him.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> And, behold, God is with us at our
head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm
against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah, the God
of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to
come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment
was behind them.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> And when Judah looked back, behold, the
battle was before and behind them; and they cried unto Jehovah, and the
priests sounded with the trumpets.

<span id="an_13:15">13:15</span> Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and
as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam
and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.

<span id="an_13:16">13:16</span> And the children of Israel fled before
Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.

<span id="an_13:17">13:17</span> And Abijah and his people slew them
with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred
thousand chosen men.

<span id="an_13:18">13:18</span> Thus the children of Israel were
brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because
they relied upon Jehovah, the God of their fathers.

<span id="an_13:19">13:19</span> And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and
took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with
the towns thereof, and Ephron with the towns thereof.

<span id="an_13:20">13:20</span> Neither did Jeroboam recover strength
again in the days of Abijah: and Jehovah smote him, and he died.

<span id="an_13:21">13:21</span> But Abijah waxed mighty, and took unto
himself fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen
daughters.

<span id="an_13:22">13:22</span> And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and
his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet
Iddo.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> So Abijah slept with his fathers, and
they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his
stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> And Asa did that which was good and right
in the eyes of Jehovah his God:

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> for he took away the foreign altars, and
the high places, and brake down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim,

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah, the
God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> Also he took away out of all the cities
of Judah the high places and the sun-images: and the kingdom was quiet
before him.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> And he built fortified cities in Judah;
for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because
Jehovah had given him rest.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> For he said unto Judah, Let us build
these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars;
the land is yet before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God; we
have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built
and prospered.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> And Asa had an army that bare bucklers
and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin,
that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all
these were mighty men of valor.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> And there came out against them Zerah the
Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred
chariots; and he came unto Mareshah.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> Then Asa went out to meet him, and they
set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> And Asa cried unto Jehovah his God, and
said, Jehovah, there is none besides thee to help, between the mighty
and him that hath no strength: help us, O Jehovah our God; for we rely
on thee, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O Jehovah,
thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> So Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before
Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> And Asa and the people that were with
him pursued them unto Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many
that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before
Jehovah, and before his host; and they carried away very much booty.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> And they smote all the cities round
about Gerar; for the fear of Jehovah came upon them: and they despoiled
all the cities; for there was much spoil in them.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> They smote also the tents of cattle,
and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to
Jerusalem.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah
the son of Oded:

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> and he went out to meet Asa, and said
unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: Jehovah is with
you, while ye are with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you;
but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> Now for a long season Israel was without
the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law:

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> But when in their distress they turned
unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> And in those times there was no peace to
him that went out, nor to him that came in; but great vexations were
upon all the inhabitants of the lands.

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> And they were broken in pieces, nation
against nation, and city against city; for God did vex them with all
adversity.

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> But be ye strong, and let not your hands
be slack; for your work shall be rewarded.

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> And when Asa heard these words, and the
prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the
abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the
cities which he had taken from the hill-country of Ephraim; and he
renewed the altar of Jehovah, that was before the porch of Jehovah.

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin,
and them that sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out
of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they
saw that Jehovah his God was with him.

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> So they gathered themselves together at
Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> And they sacrificed unto Jehovah in
that day, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and
seven thousand sheep.

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> And they entered into the covenant to
seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with
all their soul;

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> and that whosoever would not seek
Jehovah, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or
great, whether man or woman.

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> And they sware unto Jehovah with a loud
voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> And all Judah rejoiced at the oath; for
they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole
desire; and he was found of them: and Jehovah gave them rest round
about.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> And also Maacah, the mother of Asa the
king, he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable
image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and made dust of it,
and burnt it at the brook Kidron.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> But the high places were not taken away
out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> And he brought into the house of God
the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had
dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> And there was no more war unto the five
and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> In the six and thirtieth year of the
reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built
Ramah, that he might not suffer any one to go out or come in to Asa king
of Judah.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> Then Asa brought out silver and gold out
of the treasures of the house of Jehovah and of the king's house, and
sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> \[There is\] a league between me and
thee, as \[there was\] between my father and thy father: behold, I have
sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of
Israel, that he may depart from me.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa,
and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and
they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store-cities of
Naphtali.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> And it came to pass, when Baasha heard
thereof, that he left off building Ramah, and let his work cease.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> Then Asa the king took all Judah; and
they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith
Baasha had builded; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> And at that time Hanani the seer came to
Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the
king of Syria, and hast not relied on Jehovah thy God, therefore is the
host of the king of Syria escaped out of thy hand.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a
huge host, with chariots and horsemen exceeding many? yet, because thou
didst rely on Jehovah, he delivered them into thy hand.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> For the eyes of Jehovah run to and fro
throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them
whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly; for
from henceforth thou shalt have wars.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and
put him in the prison-house; for he was in a rage with him because of
this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and
last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> And in the thirty and ninth year of his
reign Asa was diseased in his feet; his disease was exceeding great: yet
in his disease he sought not to Jehovah, but to the physicians.

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> And Asa slept with his fathers, and
died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> And they buried him in his own
sepulchres, which he had hewn out for himself in the city of David, and
laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds
\[of spices\] prepared by the perfumers' art: and they made a very great
burning for him.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his
stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> And he placed forces in all the fortified
cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the
cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> And Jehovah was with Jehoshaphat, because
he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto the
Baalim,

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> but sought to the God of his father, and
walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> Therefore Jehovah established the kingdom
in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat tribute; and he had
riches and honor in abundance.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> And his heart was lifted up in the ways
of Jehovah: and furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherim
out of Judah.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> Also in the third year of his reign he
sent his princes, even Ben-hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and
Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah,
and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and
Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, the Levites;
and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> And they taught in Judah, having the book
of the law of Jehovah with them; and they went about throughout all the
cities of Judah, and taught among the people.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> And the fear of Jehovah fell upon all
the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made
no war against Jehoshaphat.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> And some of the Philistines brought
Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute; the Arabians also brought
him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand
and seven hundred he-goats.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> And Jehoshaphat waxed great
exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles and cities of store.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> And he had many works in the cities of
Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> And this was the numbering of them
according to their fathers' houses: Of Judah, the captains of thousands:
Adnah the captain, and with him mighty men of valor three hundred
thousand;

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> and next to him Jehohanan the captain,
and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand;

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> and next to him Amasiah the son of
Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto Jehovah; and with him two
hundred thousand mighty men of valor.

<span id="an_17:17">17:17</span> And of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of
valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;

<span id="an_17:18">17:18</span> and next to him Jehozabad and with him
a hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for war.

<span id="an_17:19">17:19</span> These were they that waited on the
king, besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout
all Judah.

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in
abundance; and he joined affinity with Ahab.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> And after certain years he went down to
Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance,
and for the people that were with him, and moved him to go up \[with
him\] to Ramoth-gilead.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> And Ahab king of Israel said unto
Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he
answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and \[we
will be\] with thee in the war.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of
Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of Jehovah.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> Then the king of Israel gathered the
prophets together, four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to
Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for
God will deliver it into the hand of the king.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a
prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him?

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> And the king of Israel said unto
Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah: but
I hate him; for he never prophesieth good concerning me, but always
evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not
the king say so.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> Then the king of Israel called an
officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat
the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and
they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of
Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made
him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, With these shalt thou
push the Syrians, until they be consumed.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> And all the prophets prophesied so,
saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for Jehovah will deliver it
into the hand of the king.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> And the messenger that went to call
Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets
\[declare\] good to the king with one mouth: let thy word therefore, I
pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> And Micaiah said, As Jehovah liveth,
what my God saith, that will I speak.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> And when he was come to the king, the
king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or
shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper; and they shall be
delivered into your hand.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> And the king said to him, How many
times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth
in the name of Jehovah?

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> And he said, I saw all Israel scattered
upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Jehovah said,
These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> And the king of Israel said to
Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good
concerning me, but evil?

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> And \[Micaiah\] said, Therefore hear ye
the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting upon his throne, and all the
host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab
king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one
spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> And there came forth a spirit, and
stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him. And Jehovah said unto
him, Wherewith?

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> And he said, I will go forth, and will
be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou
shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also: go forth, and do so.

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> Now therefore, behold, Jehovah hath put
a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets; and Jehovah hath
spoken evil concerning thee.

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came
near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the
Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak unto thee?

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt
see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide
thyself.

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> And the king of Israel said, Take ye
Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to
Joash the king's son;

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> and say, Thus saith the king, Put this
fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with
water of affliction, until I return in peace.

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> And Micaiah said, If thou return at all
in peace, Jehovah hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples,
all of you.

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat
the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.

<span id="an_18:29">18:29</span> And the king of Israel said unto
Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put
thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they
went into the battle.

<span id="an_18:30">18:30</span> Now the king of Syria had commanded the
captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great,
save only with the king of Israel.

<span id="an_18:31">18:31</span> And it came to pass, when the captains
of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of
Israel. Therefore they turned about to fight against him: but
Jehoshaphat cried out, and Jehovah helped him; and God moved them \[to
depart\] from him.

<span id="an_18:32">18:32</span> And it came to pass, when the captains
of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned
back from pursuing him.

<span id="an_18:33">18:33</span> And a certain man drew his bow at a
venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor:
wherefore he said to the driver of the chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry
me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.

<span id="an_18:34">18:34</span> And the battle increased that day:
howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the
Syrians until the even; and about the time of the going down of the sun
he died.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah
returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went
out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the
wicked, and love them that hate Jehovah? for this thing wrath is upon
thee from before Jehovah.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> Nevertheless there are good things found
in thee, in that thou hast put away the Asheroth out of the land, and
hast set thy heart to seek God.

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and
he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to the hill-country
of Ephraim, and brought them back unto Jehovah, the God of their
fathers.

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> And he set judges in the land throughout
all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> and said to the judges, Consider what ye
do: for ye judge not for man, but for Jehovah; and \[he is\] with you in
the judgment.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> Now therefore let the fear of Jehovah be
upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with Jehovah our
God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes.

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set
of the Levites and the priests, and of the heads of the fathers'
\[houses\] of Israel, for the judgment of Jehovah, and for
controversies. And they returned to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> And he charged them, saying, Thus shall
ye do in the fear of Jehovah, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> And whensoever any controversy shall
come to you from your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood
and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, ye
shall warn them, that they be not guilty towards Jehovah, and so wrath
come upon you and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not be
guilty.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> And, behold, Amariah the chief priest
is over you in all matters of Jehovah; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael,
the ruler of the house of Judah, in all the king's matters: also the
Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and Jehovah be
with the good.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> And it came to pass after this, that the
children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them some of the
Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> Then there came some that told
Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from
beyond the sea from Syria; and, behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar (the
same is En-gedi).

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself
to seek unto Jehovah; and he proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> And Judah gathered themselves together,
to seek \[help\] of Jehovah: even out of all the cities of Judah they
came to seek Jehovah.

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> And Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of
Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of Jehovah, before the new court;

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> and he said, O Jehovah, the God of our
fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and art not thou ruler over all the
kingdoms of the nations? and in thy hand is power and might, so that
none is able to withstand thee.

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> Didst not thou, O our God, drive out the
inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and give it to the
seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> And they dwelt therein, and have built
thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying,

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> If evil come upon us, the sword,
judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house, and
before thee, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee in our
affliction, and thou wilt hear and save.

<span id="an_20:10">20:10</span> And now, behold, the children of Ammon
and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when
they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and
destroyed them not;

<span id="an_20:11">20:11</span> behold, how they reward us, to come to
cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.

<span id="an_20:12">20:12</span> O our God, wilt thou not judge them?
for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us;
neither know we what to do: but out eyes are upon thee.

<span id="an_20:13">20:13</span> And all Judah stood before Jehovah,
with their little ones, their wives, and their children.

<span id="an_20:14">20:14</span> Then upon Jahaziel the son of
Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah,
the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of Jehovah in the
midst of the assembly;

<span id="an_20:15">20:15</span> and he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and
ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat: Thus saith
Jehovah unto you, Fear not ye, neither be dismayed by reason of this
great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.

<span id="an_20:16">20:16</span> To-morrow go ye down against them:
behold, they come up by the ascent of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the
end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel.

<span id="an_20:17">20:17</span> Ye shall not need to fight in this
\[battle\]: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of
Jehovah with you, O Judah and Jerusalem; fear not, nor be dismayed:
to-morrow go out against them: for Jehovah is with you.

<span id="an_20:18">20:18</span> And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his
face to the ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell
down before Jehovah, worshipping Jehovah.

<span id="an_20:19">20:19</span> And the Levites, of the children of the
Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise
Jehovah, the God of Israel, with an exceeding loud voice.

<span id="an_20:20">20:20</span> And they rose early in the morning, and
went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth,
Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of
Jerusalem: believe in Jehovah your God, so shall ye be established;
believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.

<span id="an_20:21">20:21</span> And when he had taken counsel with the
people, he appointed them that should sing unto Jehovah, and give praise
in holy array, as they went out before the army, and say, Give thanks
unto Jehovah; for his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_20:22">20:22</span> And when they began to sing and to
praise, Jehovah set liers-in-wait against the children of Ammon, Moab,
and mount Seir, that were come against Judah; and they were smitten.

<span id="an_20:23">20:23</span> For the children of Ammon and Moab
stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and
destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir,
every one helped to destroy another.

<span id="an_20:24">20:24</span> And when Judah came to the watch-tower
of the wilderness, they looked upon the multitude; and, behold, they
were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none that escaped.

<span id="an_20:25">20:25</span> And when Jehoshaphat and his people
came to take the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both
riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for
themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in
taking the spoil, it was so much.

<span id="an_20:26">20:26</span> And on the fourth day they assembled
themselves in the valley of Beracah; for there they blessed Jehovah:
therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah unto
this day.

<span id="an_20:27">20:27</span> Then they returned, every man of Judah
and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to
Jerusalem with joy; for Jehovah had made them to rejoice over their
enemies.

<span id="an_20:28">20:28</span> And they came to Jerusalem with
psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_20:29">20:29</span> And the fear of God was on all the
kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that Jehovah fought against
the enemies of Israel.

<span id="an_20:30">20:30</span> So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet;
for his God gave him rest round about.

<span id="an_20:31">20:31</span> And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he
was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned
twenty and five years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Azubah the
daughter of Shilhi.

<span id="an_20:32">20:32</span> And he walked in the way of Asa his
father, and turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the
eyes of Jehovah.

<span id="an_20:33">20:33</span> Howbeit the high places were not taken
away; neither as yet had the people set their hearts unto the God of
their fathers.

<span id="an_20:34">20:34</span> Now the rest of the acts of
Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of
Jehu the son of Hanani, which is inserted in the book of the kings of
Israel.

<span id="an_20:35">20:35</span> And after this did Jehoshaphat king of
Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel; the same did very
wickedly:

<span id="an_20:36">20:36</span> and he joined himself with him to make
ships to go to Tarshish; and they made the ships in Ezion-geber.

<span id="an_20:37">20:37</span> Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of
Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast
joined thyself with Ahaziah, Jehovah hath destroyed thy works. And the
ships were broken, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers,
and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Jehoram his
son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> And he had brethren, the sons of
Jehoshaphat: Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and
Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of
Israel.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> And their father gave them great gifts,
of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in
Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram, because he was the
first-born.

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> Now when Jehoram was risen up over the
kingdom of his father, and had strengthened himself, he slew all his
brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> Jehoram was thirty and two years old when
he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> And he walked in the way of the kings of
Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for he had the daughter of Ahab to
wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> Howbeit Jehovah would not destroy the
house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and
as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children alway.

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> In his days Edom revolted from under the
hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> Then Jehoram passed over with his
captains, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and
smote the Edomites that compassed him about, and the captains of the
chariots.

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> So Edom revolted from under the hand of
Judah unto this day: then did Libnah revolt at the same time from under
his hand, because he had forsaken Jehovah, the God of his fathers.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> Moreover he made high places in the
mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the
harlot, and led Judah astray.

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> And there came a writing to him from
Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy
father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy
father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> but hast walked in the way of the kings
of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play
the harlot, like as the house of Ahab did, and also hast slain thy
brethren of thy father's house, who were better than thyself:

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> behold, Jehovah will smite with a great
plague thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy
substance;

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> and thou shalt have great sickness by
disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the
sickness, day by day.

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> And Jehovah stirred up against Jehoram
the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians that are beside the
Ethiopians:

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> and they came up against Judah, and
brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the
king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never
a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> And after all this Jehovah smote him in
his bowels with an incurable disease.

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> And it came to pass, in process of
time, at the end of two years, that his bowels fell out by reason of his
sickness, and he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning
for him, like the burning of his fathers.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> Thirty and two years old was he when he
began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years: and he departed
without being desired; and they buried him in the city of David, but not
in the sepulchres of the kings.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made
Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead; for the band of men that
came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah
the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when
he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and his
mother's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> He also walked in the ways of the house
of Ahab; for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> And he did that which was evil in the
sight of Jehovah, as did the house of Ahab; for they were his
counsellors after the death of his father, to his destruction.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> He walked also after their counsel, and
went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael
king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram.

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> And he returned to be healed in Jezreel
of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he fought against
Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went
down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of
God, in that he went unto Joram: for when he was come, he went out with
Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah had anointed to cut
off the house of Ahab.

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> And it came to pass, when Jehu was
executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, that he found the princes of
Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, ministering to Ahaziah,
and slew them.

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> And he sought Ahaziah, and they caught
him (now he was hiding in Samaria), and they brought him to Jehu, and
slew him; and they buried him, for they said, He is the son of
Jehoshaphat, who sought Jehovah with all his heart. And the house of
Ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom.

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah
saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of
the house of Judah.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the
king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the
king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in the
bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of
Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from
Athaliah, so that she slew him not.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> And he was with them hid in the house
of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> And in the seventh year Jehoiada
strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son
of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of
Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri,
into covenant with him.

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> And they went about in Judah, and
gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of
fathers' \[houses\] of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> And all the assembly made a covenant with
the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's
son shall reign, as Jehovah hath spoken concerning the sons of David.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> This is the thing that ye shall do: a
third part of you, that come in on the sabbath, of the priests and of
the Levites, shall be porters of the thresholds;

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> and a third part shall be at the king's
house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the
people shall be in the courts of the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> But let none come into the house of
Jehovah, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they
shall come in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the
charge of Jehovah.

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> And the Levites shall compass the king
round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever
cometh into the house, let him be slain: and be ye with the king when he
cometh in, and when he goeth out.

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> So the Levites and all Judah did
according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every
man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath; with those that
were to go out on the sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the
courses.

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> And Jehoiada the priest delivered to the
captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had
been king David's, which were in the house of God.

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> And he set all the people, every man
with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the
left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king
round about.

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> Then they brought out the king's son,
and put the crown upon him, and \[gave him\] the testimony, and made him
king: and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him; and they said, \[Long\]
live the king.

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> And when Athaliah heard the noise of
the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into
the house of Jehovah:

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> and she looked, and, behold, the king
stood by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpets
by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets;
the singers also \[played\] on instruments of music, and led the singing
of praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason! treason!

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> And Jehoiada the priest brought out the
captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them,
Have her forth between the ranks; and whoso followeth her, let him be
slain with the sword: for the priest said, Slay her not in the house of
Jehovah.

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> So they made way for her; and she went
to the entrance of the horse gate to the king's house: and they slew her
there.

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> And Jehoiada made a covenant between
himself, and all the people, and the king, that they should be Jehovah's
people.

<span id="an_23:17">23:17</span> And all the people went to the house of
Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces,
and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.

<span id="an_23:18">23:18</span> And Jehoiada appointed the officers of
the house of Jehovah under the hand of the priests the Levites, whom
David had distributed in the house of Jehovah, to offer the
burnt-offerings of Jehovah, as it is written in the law of Moses, with
rejoicing and with singing, according to the order of David.

<span id="an_23:19">23:19</span> And he set the porters at the gates of
the house of Jehovah, that none that was unclean in anything should
enter in.

<span id="an_23:20">23:20</span> And he took the captains of hundreds,
and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of
the land, and brought down the king from the house of Jehovah: and they
came through the upper gate unto the king's house, and set the king upon
the throne of the kingdom.

<span id="an_23:21">23:21</span> So all the people of the land rejoiced,
and the city was quiet. And Athaliah they had slain with the sword.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> Joash was seven years old when he began
to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name
was Zibiah, of Beer-sheba.

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> And Joash did that which was right in the
eyes of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and
he begat sons and daughters.

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> And it came to pass after this, that
Joash was minded to restore the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> And he gathered together the priests and
the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and
gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to
year; and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it
not.

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> And the king called for Jehoiada the
chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to
bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tax of Moses the servant
of Jehovah, and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent of the
testimony?

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked
woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things
of the house of Jehovah did they bestow upon the Baalim.

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> So the king commanded, and they made a
chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> And they made a proclamation through
Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for Jehovah the tax that Moses the
servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> And all the princes and all the people
rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made
an end.

<span id="an_24:11">24:11</span> And it was so, that, at what time the
chest was brought unto the king's officers by the hand of the Levites,
and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the
chief priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and
carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered
money in abundance.

<span id="an_24:12">24:12</span> And the king and Jehoiada gave it to
such as did the work of the service of the house of Jehovah; and they
hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of Jehovah, and also
such as wrought iron and brass to repair the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_24:13">24:13</span> So the workmen wrought, and the work of
repairing went forward in their hands, and they set up the house of God
in its state, and strengthened it.

<span id="an_24:14">24:14</span> And when they had made an end, they
brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were
made vessels for the house of Jehovah, even vessels wherewith to
minister and to offer, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And
they offered burnt-offerings in the house of Jehovah continually all the
days of Jehoiada.

<span id="an_24:15">24:15</span> But Jehoiada waxed old and was full of
days, and he died; a hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.

<span id="an_24:16">24:16</span> And they buried him in the city of
David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward
God and his house.

<span id="an_24:17">24:17</span> Now after the death of Jehoiada came
the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king
hearkened unto them.

<span id="an_24:18">24:18</span> And they forsook the house of Jehovah,
the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols: and
wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness.

<span id="an_24:19">24:19</span> Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring
them again unto Jehovah; and they testified against them: but they would
not give ear.

<span id="an_24:20">24:20</span> And the Spirit of God came upon
Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people,
and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments
of Jehovah, so that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken Jehovah,
he hath also forsaken you.

<span id="an_24:21">24:21</span> And they conspired against him, and
stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of
the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_24:22">24:22</span> Thus Joash the king remembered not the
kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son.
And when he died, he said, Jehovah look upon it, and require it.

<span id="an_24:23">24:23</span> And it came to pass at the end of the
year, that the army of the Syrians came up against him: and they came to
Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from
among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of
Damascus.

<span id="an_24:24">24:24</span> For the army of the Syrians came with a
small company of men; and Jehovah delivered a very great host into their
hand, because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers. So
they executed judgment upon Joash.

<span id="an_24:25">24:25</span> And when they were departed for him
(for they left him very sick), his own servants conspired against him
for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his
bed, and he died; and they buried him in the city of David, but they
buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.

<span id="an_24:26">24:26</span> And these are they that conspired
against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the
son of Shimrith the Moabitess.

<span id="an_24:27">24:27</span> Now concerning his sons, and the
greatness of the burdens \[laid\] upon him, and the rebuilding of the
house of God, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of
the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_25:1">25:1</span> Amaziah was twenty and five years old
when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in
Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_25:2">25:2</span> And he did that which was right in the
eyes of Jehovah, but not with a perfect heart.

<span id="an_25:3">25:3</span> Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was
established unto him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king
his father.

<span id="an_25:4">25:4</span> But he put not their children to death,
but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of
Moses, as Jehovah commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the
children, neither shall the children die for the fathers; but every man
shall die for his own sin.

<span id="an_25:5">25:5</span> Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together,
and ordered them according to their fathers' houses, under captains of
thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin: and he
numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them three
hundred thousand chosen men, able to go forth to war, that could handle
spear and shield.

<span id="an_25:6">25:6</span> He hired also a hundred thousand mighty
men of valor out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver.

<span id="an_25:7">25:7</span> But there came a man of God to him,
saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for Jehovah is
not with Israel, \[to wit\], with all the children of Ephraim.

<span id="an_25:8">25:8</span> But if thou wilt go, do \[valiantly\], be
strong for the battle: God will cast thee down before the enemy; for God
hath power to help, and to cast down.

<span id="an_25:9">25:9</span> And Amaziah said to the man of God, But
what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army
of Israel? And the man of God answered, Jehovah is able to give thee
much more than this.

<span id="an_25:10">25:10</span> Then Amaziah separated them, \[to
wit\], the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again:
wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they
returned home in fierce anger.

<span id="an_25:11">25:11</span> And Amaziah took courage, and led forth
his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and smote of the children of
Seir ten thousand.

<span id="an_25:12">25:12</span> And \[other\] ten thousand did the
children of Judah carry away alive, and brought them unto the top of the
rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were
broken in pieces.

<span id="an_25:13">25:13</span> But the men of the army whom Amaziah
sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the
cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote of them
three thousand, and took much spoil.

<span id="an_25:14">25:14</span> Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah
was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of
the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down
himself before them, and burned incense unto them.

<span id="an_25:15">25:15</span> Wherefore the anger of Jehovah was
kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, who said unto
him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which have not
delivered their own people out of thy hand?

<span id="an_25:16">25:16</span> And it came to pass, as he talked with
him, that \[the king\] said unto him, Have we made thee of the king's
counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet
forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee,
because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.

<span id="an_25:17">25:17</span> Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice,
and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel,
saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.

<span id="an_25:18">25:18</span> And Joash king of Israel sent to
Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to
the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to
wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod
down the thistle.

<span id="an_25:19">25:19</span> Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten
Edom; and thy heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why
shouldest thou meddle to \[thy\] hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even
thou, and Judah with thee?

<span id="an_25:20">25:20</span> But Amaziah would not hear; for it was
of God, that he might deliver them into the hand \[of their enemies\],
because they had sought after the gods of Edom.

<span id="an_25:21">25:21</span> So Joash king of Israel went up; and he
and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at
Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.

<span id="an_25:22">25:22</span> And Judah was put to the worse before
Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.

<span id="an_25:23">25:23</span> And Joash king of Israel took Amaziah
king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh,
and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from
the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

<span id="an_25:24">25:24</span> And \[he took\] all the gold and
silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with
Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and
returned to Samaria.

<span id="an_25:25">25:25</span> And Amaziah the son of Joash king of
Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel
fifteen years.

<span id="an_25:26">25:26</span> Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah,
first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of
Judah and Israel?

<span id="an_25:27">25:27</span> Now from the time that Amaziah did turn
away from following Jehovah they made a conspiracy against him in
Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish,
and slew him there.

<span id="an_25:28">25:28</span> And they brought him upon horses, and
buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.

<span id="an_26:1">26:1</span> And all the people of Judah took Uzziah,
who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father
Amaziah.

<span id="an_26:2">26:2</span> He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah,
after that the king slept with his fathers.

<span id="an_26:3">26:3</span> Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he
began to reign; and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem: and his
mother's name was Jechiliah, of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_26:4">26:4</span> And he did that which was right in the
eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.

<span id="an_26:5">26:5</span> And he set himself to seek God in the
days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God: and as
long as he sought Jehovah, God made him to prosper.

<span id="an_26:6">26:6</span> And he went forth and warred against the
Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh,
and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in \[the country of\]
Ashdod, and among the Philistines.

<span id="an_26:7">26:7</span> And God helped him against the
Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the
Meunim.

<span id="an_26:8">26:8</span> And the Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah:
and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt; for he waxed
exceeding strong.

<span id="an_26:9">26:9</span> Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem
at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning \[of the
wall\], and fortified them.

<span id="an_26:10">26:10</span> And he built towers in the wilderness,
and hewed out many cisterns, for he had much cattle; in the lowland
also, and in the plain: \[and he had\] husbandmen and vinedressers in
the mountains and in the fruitful fields; for he loved husbandry.

<span id="an_26:11">26:11</span> Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting
men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their
reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the
hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.

<span id="an_26:12">26:12</span> The whole number of the heads of
fathers' \[houses\], even the mighty men of valor, was two thousand and
six hundred.

<span id="an_26:13">26:13</span> And under their hand was an army, three
hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with
mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.

<span id="an_26:14">26:14</span> And Uzziah prepared for them, even for
all the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and
bows, and stones for slinging.

<span id="an_26:15">26:15</span> And he made in Jerusalem engines,
invented by skilful men, to be on the towers and upon the battlements,
wherewith to shoot arrows and great stones. And his name spread far
abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.

<span id="an_26:16">26:16</span> But when he was strong, his heart was
lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against Jehovah
his God; for he went into the temple of Jehovah to burn incense upon the
altar of incense.

<span id="an_26:17">26:17</span> And Azariah the priest went in after
him, and with him fourscore priests of Jehovah, that were valiant men:

<span id="an_26:18">26:18</span> and they withstood Uzziah the king, and
said unto him, It pertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto
Jehovah, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to
burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither
shall it be for thine honor from Jehovah God.

<span id="an_26:19">26:19</span> Then Uzziah was wroth; and he had a
censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was wroth with the
priests, the leprosy brake forth in his forehead before the priests in
the house of Jehovah, beside the altar of incense.

<span id="an_26:20">26:20</span> And Azariah the chief priest, and all
the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his
forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from thence; yea, himself
hasted also to go out, because Jehovah had smitten him.

<span id="an_26:21">26:21</span> And Uzziah the king was a leper unto
the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house, being a leper; for
he was cut off from the house of Jehovah: and Jotham his son was over
the king's house, judging the people of the land.

<span id="an_26:22">26:22</span> Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah,
first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.

<span id="an_26:23">26:23</span> So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and
they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged
to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned
in his stead.

<span id="an_27:1">27:1</span> Jotham was twenty and five years old when
he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his
mother's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.

<span id="an_27:2">27:2</span> And he did that which was right in the
eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Uzziah had done:
howbeit he entered not into the temple of Jehovah. And the people did
yet corruptly.

<span id="an_27:3">27:3</span> He built the upper gate of the house of
Jehovah, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.

<span id="an_27:4">27:4</span> Moreover he built cities in the
hill-country of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.

<span id="an_27:5">27:5</span> He fought also with the king of the
children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon
gave him the same year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand
measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children
of Ammon render unto him, in the second year also, and in the third.

<span id="an_27:6">27:6</span> So Jotham became mighty, because he
ordered his ways before Jehovah his God.

<span id="an_27:7">27:7</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and
all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the
kings of Israel and Judah.

<span id="an_27:8">27:8</span> He was five and twenty years old when he
began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_27:9">27:9</span> And Jotham slept with his fathers, and
they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his
stead.

<span id="an_28:1">28:1</span> Ahaz was twenty years old when he began
to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not that
which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, like David his father;

<span id="an_28:2">28:2</span> but he walked in the ways of the kings of
Israel, and made also molten images for the Baalim.

<span id="an_28:3">28:3</span> Moreover he burnt incense in the valley
of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, according to
the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the
children of Israel.

<span id="an_28:4">28:4</span> And he sacrificed and burnt incense in
the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.

<span id="an_28:5">28:5</span> Wherefore Jehovah his God delivered him
into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away
of his a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus. And
he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him
with a great slaughter.

<span id="an_28:6">28:6</span> For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in
Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men;
because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers.

<span id="an_28:7">28:7</span> And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew
Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah
that was next to the king.

<span id="an_28:8">28:8</span> And the children of Israel carried away
captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and
daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the
spoil to Samaria.

<span id="an_28:9">28:9</span> But a prophet of Jehovah was there, whose
name was Oded: and he went out to meet the host that came to Samaria,
and said unto them, Behold, because Jehovah, the God of your fathers,
was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have
slain them in a rage which hath reached up to heaven.

<span id="an_28:10">28:10</span> And now ye purpose to keep under the
children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you:
\[but\] are there not even with you trespasses of your own against
Jehovah your God?

<span id="an_28:11">28:11</span> Now hear me therefore, and send back
the captives, that ye have taken captive of your brethren; for the
fierce wrath of Jehovah is upon you.

<span id="an_28:12">28:12</span> Then certain of the heads of the
children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of
Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of
Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,

<span id="an_28:13">28:13</span> and said unto them, Ye shall not bring
in the captives hither: for ye purpose that which will bring upon us a
trespass against Jehovah, to add unto our sins and to our trespass; for
our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.

<span id="an_28:14">28:14</span> So the armed men left the captives and
the spoil before the princes and all the assembly.

<span id="an_28:15">28:15</span> And the men that have been mentioned by
name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that
were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to
eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them
upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm-trees, unto
their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.

<span id="an_28:16">28:16</span> At that time did king Ahaz send unto
the kings of Assyria to help him.

<span id="an_28:17">28:17</span> For again the Edomites had come and
smitten Judah, and carried away captives.

<span id="an_28:18">28:18</span> The Philistines also had invaded the
cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken
Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with the towns
thereof, and Timnah with the towns thereof, Gimzo also and the towns
thereof: and they dwelt there.

<span id="an_28:19">28:19</span> For Jehovah brought Judah low because
of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had dealt wantonly in Judah, and
trespassed sore against Jehovah.

<span id="an_28:20">28:20</span> And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria
came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.

<span id="an_28:21">28:21</span> For Ahaz took away a portion out of the
house of Jehovah, and out of the house of the king and of the princes,
and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but it helped him not.

<span id="an_28:22">28:22</span> And in the time of his distress did he
trespass yet more against Jehovah, this same king Ahaz.

<span id="an_28:23">28:23</span> For he sacrificed unto the gods of
Damascus, which smote him; and he said, Because the gods of the kings of
Syria helped them, \[therefore\] will I sacrifice to them, that they may
help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.

<span id="an_28:24">28:24</span> And Ahaz gathered together the vessels
of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God,
and shut up the doors of the house of Jehovah; and he made him altars in
every corner of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_28:25">28:25</span> And in every city of Judah he made high
places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger Jehovah,
the God of his fathers.

<span id="an_28:26">28:26</span> Now the rest of his acts, and all his
ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings
of Judah and Israel.

<span id="an_28:27">28:27</span> And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and
they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem; for they brought him not
into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned
in his stead.

<span id="an_29:1">29:1</span> Hezekiah began to reign when he was five
and twenty years old; and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem:
and his mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.

<span id="an_29:2">29:2</span> And he did that which was right in the
eyes of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done.

<span id="an_29:3">29:3</span> He in the first year of his reign, in the
first month, opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and repaired
them.

<span id="an_29:4">29:4</span> And he brought in the priests and the
Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east,

<span id="an_29:5">29:5</span> and said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites;
now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of Jehovah, the God of
your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.

<span id="an_29:6">29:6</span> For our fathers have trespassed, and done
that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah our God, and have forsaken
him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Jehovah,
and turned their backs.

<span id="an_29:7">29:7</span> Also they have shut up the doors of the
porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered
burnt-offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel.

<span id="an_29:8">29:8</span> Wherefore the wrath of Jehovah was upon
Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to be tossed to and fro,
to be an astonishment, and a hissing, as ye see with your eyes.

<span id="an_29:9">29:9</span> For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the
sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for
this.

<span id="an_29:10">29:10</span> Now it is in my heart to make a
covenant with Jehovah, the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn
away from us.

<span id="an_29:11">29:11</span> My sons, be not now negligent; for
Jehovah hath chosen you to stand before him, to minister unto him, and
that ye should be his ministers, and burn incense.

<span id="an_29:12">29:12</span> Then the Levites arose, Mahath, the son
of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites;
and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of
Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the
son of Joah;

<span id="an_29:13">29:13</span> and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri
and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;

<span id="an_29:14">29:14</span> and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and
Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.

<span id="an_29:15">29:15</span> And they gathered their brethren, and
sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the
king by the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_29:16">29:16</span> And the priests went in unto the inner
part of the house of Jehovah, to cleanse it, and brought out all the
uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah into the court of
the house of Jehovah. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad to
the brook Kidron.

<span id="an_29:17">29:17</span> Now they began on the first \[day\] of
the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came
they to the porch of Jehovah; and they sanctified the house of Jehovah
in eight days: and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an
end.

<span id="an_29:18">29:18</span> Then they went in to Hezekiah the king
within \[the palace\], and said, We have cleansed all the house of
Jehovah, and the altar of burnt-offering, with all the vessels thereof,
and the table of showbread, with all the vessels thereof.

<span id="an_29:19">29:19</span> Moreover all the vessels, which king
Ahaz in his reign did cast away when he trespassed, have we prepared and
sanctified; and, behold, they are before the altar of Jehovah.

<span id="an_29:20">29:20</span> Then Hezekiah the king arose early, and
gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_29:21">29:21</span> And they brought seven bullocks, and
seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats, for a sin-offering for
the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. And he commanded the
priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of Jehovah.

<span id="an_29:22">29:22</span> So they killed the bullocks, and the
priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: and they
killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed
also the lambs, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar.

<span id="an_29:23">29:23</span> And they brought near the he-goats for
the sin-offering before the king and the assembly; and they laid their
hands upon them:

<span id="an_29:24">29:24</span> and the priests killed them, and they
made a sin-offering with their blood upon the altar, to make atonement
for all Israel; for the king commanded \[that\] the burnt-offering and
the sin-offering \[should be made\] for all Israel.

<span id="an_29:25">29:25</span> And he set the Levites in the house of
Jehovah with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the
commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the
prophet; for the commandment was of Jehovah by his prophets.

<span id="an_29:26">29:26</span> And the Levites stood with the
instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.

<span id="an_29:27">29:27</span> And Hezekiah commanded to offer the
burnt-offering upon the altar. And when the burnt-offering began, the
song of Jehovah began also, and the trumpets, together with the
instruments of David king of Israel.

<span id="an_29:28">29:28</span> And all the assembly worshipped, and
the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this \[continued\]
until the burnt-offering was finished.

<span id="an_29:29">29:29</span> And when they had made an end of
offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves
and worshipped.

<span id="an_29:30">29:30</span> Moreover Hezekiah the king and the
princes commanded the Levites to sing praises unto Jehovah with the
words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with
gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.

<span id="an_29:31">29:31</span> Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye
have consecrated yourselves unto Jehovah; come near and bring sacrifices
and thank-offerings into the house of Jehovah. And the assembly brought
in sacrifices and thank-offerings; and as many as were of a willing
heart \[brought\] burnt-offerings.

<span id="an_29:32">29:32</span> And the number of the burnt-offerings
which the assembly brought was threescore and ten bullocks, a hundred
rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt-offering to
Jehovah.

<span id="an_29:33">29:33</span> And the consecrated things were six
hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.

<span id="an_29:34">29:34</span> But the priests were too few, so that
they could not flay all the burnt-offerings: wherefore their brethren
the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the
priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in
heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.

<span id="an_29:35">29:35</span> And also the burnt-offerings were in
abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and with the
drink-offerings for every burnt-offering. So the service of the house of
Jehovah was set in order.

<span id="an_29:36">29:36</span> And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the
people, because of that which God had prepared for the people: for the
thing was done suddenly.

<span id="an_30:1">30:1</span> And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and
Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should
come to the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto
Jehovah, the God of Israel.

<span id="an_30:2">30:2</span> For the king had taken counsel, and his
princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the
second month.

<span id="an_30:3">30:3</span> For they could not keep it at that time,
because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number,
neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_30:4">30:4</span> And the thing was right in the eyes of
the king and of all the assembly.

<span id="an_30:5">30:5</span> So they established a decree to make
proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that
they should come to keep the passover unto Jehovah, the God of Israel,
at Jerusalem: for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as
it is written.

<span id="an_30:6">30:6</span> So the posts went with the letters from
the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according
to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn
again unto Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may
return to the remnant that are escaped of you out of the hand of the
kings of Assyria.

<span id="an_30:7">30:7</span> And be not ye like your fathers, and like
your brethren, who trespassed against Jehovah, the God of their fathers,
so that he gave them up to desolation, as ye see.

<span id="an_30:8">30:8</span> Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your
fathers were; but yield yourselves unto Jehovah, and enter into his
sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever, and serve Jehovah your
God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you.

<span id="an_30:9">30:9</span> For if ye turn again unto Jehovah, your
brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that led
them captive, and shall come again into this land: for Jehovah your God
is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if
ye return unto him.

<span id="an_30:10">30:10</span> So the posts passed from city to city
through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun: but they
laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.

<span id="an_30:11">30:11</span> Nevertheless certain men of Asher and
Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_30:12">30:12</span> Also upon Judah came the hand of God to
give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the
princes by the word of Jehovah.

<span id="an_30:13">30:13</span> And there assembled at Jerusalem much
people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very
great assembly.

<span id="an_30:14">30:14</span> And they arose and took away the altars
that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away,
and cast them into the brook Kidron.

<span id="an_30:15">30:15</span> Then they killed the passover on the
fourteenth \[day\] of the second month: and the priests and the Levites
were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt-offerings
into the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_30:16">30:16</span> And they stood in their place after
their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests
sprinkled the blood \[which they received\] of the hand of the Levites.

<span id="an_30:17">30:17</span> For there were many in the assembly
that had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites had the charge
of killing the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify
them unto Jehovah.

<span id="an_30:18">30:18</span> For a multitude of the people, even
many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed
themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it is written.
For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good Jehovah pardon every
one

<span id="an_30:19">30:19</span> that setteth his heart to seek God,
Jehovah, the God of his fathers, though \[he be\] not \[cleansed\]
according to the purification of the sanctuary.

<span id="an_30:20">30:20</span> And Jehovah hearkened to Hezekiah, and
healed the people.

<span id="an_30:21">30:21</span> And the children of Israel that were
present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with
great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Jehovah day by
day, \[singing\] with loud instruments unto Jehovah.

<span id="an_30:22">30:22</span> And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all
the Levites that had good understanding \[in the service\] of Jehovah.
So they did eat throughout the feast for the seven days, offering
sacrifices of peace-offerings, and making confession to Jehovah, the God
of their fathers.

<span id="an_30:23">30:23</span> And the whole assembly took counsel to
keep other seven days; and they kept \[other\] seven days with gladness.

<span id="an_30:24">30:24</span> For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to
the assembly for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep;
and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bullocks and ten
thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.

<span id="an_30:25">30:25</span> And all the assembly of Judah, with the
priests and the Levites, and all the assembly that came out of Israel,
and the sojourners that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt
in Judah, rejoiced.

<span id="an_30:26">30:26</span> So there was great joy in Jerusalem;
for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was
not the like in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_30:27">30:27</span> Then the priests the Levites arose and
blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up
to his holy habitation, even unto heaven.

<span id="an_31:1">31:1</span> Now when all this was finished, all
Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake in
pieces the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim, and brake down the high
places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and
Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of
Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.

<span id="an_31:2">31:2</span> And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the
priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his
service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt-offerings and for
peace-offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the
gates of the camp of Jehovah.

<span id="an_31:3">31:3</span> \[He appointed\] also the king's portion
of his substance for the burnt-offerings, \[to wit\], for the morning
and evening burnt-offerings, and the burnt-offerings for the sabbaths,
and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the
law of Jehovah.

<span id="an_31:4">31:4</span> Moreover he commanded the people that
dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites,
that they might give themselves to the law of Jehovah.

<span id="an_31:5">31:5</span> And as soon as the commandment came
abroad, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first-fruits of
grain, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the
field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.

<span id="an_31:6">31:6</span> And the children of Israel and Judah,
that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of
oxen and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated
unto Jehovah their God, and laid them by heaps.

<span id="an_31:7">31:7</span> In the third month they began to lay the
foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.

<span id="an_31:8">31:8</span> And when Hezekiah and the princes came
and saw the heaps, they blessed Jehovah, and his people Israel.

<span id="an_31:9">31:9</span> Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and
the Levites concerning the heaps.

<span id="an_31:10">31:10</span> And Azariah the chief priest, of the
house of Zadok, answered him and said, Since \[the people\] began to
bring the oblations into the house of Jehovah, we have eaten and had
enough, and have left plenty: for Jehovah hath blessed his people; and
that which is left is this great store.

<span id="an_31:11">31:11</span> Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare
chambers in the house of Jehovah; and they prepared them.

<span id="an_31:12">31:12</span> And they brought in the oblations and
the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: and over them Conaniah
the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was second.

<span id="an_31:13">31:13</span> And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath,
and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and
Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and
Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah
the ruler of the house of God.

<span id="an_31:14">31:14</span> And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite,
the porter at the east \[gate\], was over the freewill-offerings of God,
to distribute the oblations of Jehovah, and the most holy things.

<span id="an_31:15">31:15</span> And under him were Eden, and Miniamin,
and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the
priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brethren by courses,
as well to the great as to the small:

<span id="an_31:16">31:16</span> besides them that were reckoned by
genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even every one that
entered into the house of Jehovah, as the duty of every day required,
for their service in their offices according to their courses;

<span id="an_31:17">31:17</span> and them that were reckoned by
genealogy of the priests by their fathers' houses, and the Levites from
twenty years old and upward, in their offices by their courses;

<span id="an_31:18">31:18</span> and them that were reckoned by
genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and
their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their office of
trust they sanctified themselves in holiness.

<span id="an_31:19">31:19</span> Also for the sons of Aaron the priests,
that were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every city,
there were men that were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the
males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogy
among the Levites.

<span id="an_31:20">31:20</span> And thus did Hezekiah throughout all
Judah; and he wrought that which was good and right and faithful before
Jehovah his God.

<span id="an_31:21">31:21</span> And in every work that he began in the
service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to
seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.

<span id="an_32:1">32:1</span> After these things, and this
faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah,
and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for
himself.

<span id="an_32:2">32:2</span> And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib
was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,

<span id="an_32:3">32:3</span> he took counsel with his princes and his
mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the
city; and they helped him.

<span id="an_32:4">32:4</span> So there was gathered much people
together, and they stopped all the fountains, and the brook that flowed
through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria
come, and find much water?

<span id="an_32:5">32:5</span> And he took courage, and built up all the
wall that was broken down, and raised \[it\] up to the towers, and the
other wall without, and strengthened Millo \[in\] the city of David, and
made weapons and shields in abundance.

<span id="an_32:6">32:6</span> And he set captains of war over the
people, and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate
of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,

<span id="an_32:7">32:7</span> Be strong and of good courage, be not
afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude
that is with him; for there is a greater with us than with him:

<span id="an_32:8">32:8</span> with him is an arm of flesh; but with us
is Jehovah our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people
rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.

<span id="an_32:9">32:9</span> After this did Sennacherib king of
Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (now he was before Lachish, and
all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah
that were at Jerusalem, saying,

<span id="an_32:10">32:10</span> Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria,
Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide the siege in Jerusalem?

<span id="an_32:11">32:11</span> Doth not Hezekiah persuade you, to give
you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God will
deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

<span id="an_32:12">32:12</span> Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away
his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem,
saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and upon it shall ye burn
incense?

<span id="an_32:13">32:13</span> Know ye not what I and my fathers have
done unto all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of
the lands in any wise able to deliver their land out of my hand?

<span id="an_32:14">32:14</span> Who was there among all the gods of
those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his
people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out
of my hand?

<span id="an_32:15">32:15</span> Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive
you, nor persuade you after this manner, neither believe ye him; for no
god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my
hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God
deliver you out of my hand?

<span id="an_32:16">32:16</span> And his servants spake yet more against
Jehovah God, and against his servant Hezekiah.

<span id="an_32:17">32:17</span> He wrote also letters, to rail on
Jehovah, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the
gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people
out of my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out
of my hand.

<span id="an_32:18">32:18</span> And they cried with a loud voice in the
Jews' language unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to
affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.

<span id="an_32:19">32:19</span> And they spake of the God of Jerusalem,
as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men's
hands.

<span id="an_32:20">32:20</span> And Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the
prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven.

<span id="an_32:21">32:21</span> And Jehovah sent an angel, who cut off
all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains, in the camp
of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own
land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came
forth from his own bowels slew him there with the sword.

<span id="an_32:22">32:22</span> Thus Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of
Assyria, and from the hand of all \[others\], and guided them on every
side.

<span id="an_32:23">32:23</span> And many brought gifts unto Jehovah to
Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah; so that he was
exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.

<span id="an_32:24">32:24</span> In those days Hezekiah was sick even
unto death: and he prayed unto Jehovah; and he spake unto him, and gave
him a sign.

<span id="an_32:25">32:25</span> But Hezekiah rendered not again
according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up:
therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.

<span id="an_32:26">32:26</span> Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled
himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Jehovah came not upon them in the days
of Hezekiah.

<span id="an_32:27">32:27</span> And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches
and honor: and he provided him treasuries for silver, and for gold, and
for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner
of goodly vessels;

<span id="an_32:28">32:28</span> store-houses also for the increase of
grain and new wine and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and
flocks in folds.

<span id="an_32:29">32:29</span> Moreover he provided him cities, and
possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very
much substance.

<span id="an_32:30">32:30</span> This same Hezekiah also stopped the
upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on
the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his
works.

<span id="an_32:31">32:31</span> Howbeit in \[the business of\] the
ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of
the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he
might know all that was in his heart.

<span id="an_32:32">32:32</span> Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah,
and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the
prophet the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

<span id="an_32:33">32:33</span> And Hezekiah slept with his fathers,
and they buried him in the ascent of the sepulchres of the sons of
David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at
his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_33:1">33:1</span> Manasseh was twelve years old when he
began to reign; and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_33:2">33:2</span> And he did that which was evil in the
sight of Jehovah, after the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah
cast out before the children of Israel.

<span id="an_33:3">33:3</span> For he built again the high places which
Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for the
Baalim, and made Asheroth, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and
served them.

<span id="an_33:4">33:4</span> And he built altars in the house of
Jehovah, whereof Jehovah said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.

<span id="an_33:5">33:5</span> And he built altars for all the host of
heaven in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_33:6">33:6</span> He also made his children to pass through
the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he practised augury,
and used enchantments, and practised sorcery, and dealt with them that
had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the
sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.

<span id="an_33:7">33:7</span> And he set the graven image of the idol,
which he had made, in the house of God, of which God said to David and
to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen
out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:

<span id="an_33:8">33:8</span> neither will I any more remove the foot
of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if
only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all
the law and the statutes and the ordinances \[given\] by Moses.

<span id="an_33:9">33:9</span> And Manasseh seduced Judah and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did evil more than did the
nations whom Jehovah destroyed before the children of Israel.

<span id="an_33:10">33:10</span> And Jehovah spake to Manasseh, and to
his people; but they gave no heed.

<span id="an_33:11">33:11</span> Wherefore Jehovah brought upon them the
captains of the host of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in
chains, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.

<span id="an_33:12">33:12</span> And when he was in distress, he
besought Jehovah his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of
his fathers.

<span id="an_33:13">33:13</span> And he prayed unto him; and he was
entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to
Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah he was God.

<span id="an_33:14">33:14</span> Now after this he built an outer wall
to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to
the entrance at the fish gate; and he compassed Ophel about \[with it\],
and raised it up to a very great height: and he put valiant captains in
all the fortified cities of Judah.

<span id="an_33:15">33:15</span> And he took away the foreign gods, and
the idol out of the house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he had
built in the mount of the house of Jehovah, and in Jerusalem, and cast
them out of the city.

<span id="an_33:16">33:16</span> And he built up the altar of Jehovah,
and offered thereon sacrifices of peace-offerings and of thanksgiving,
and commanded Judah to serve Jehovah, the God of Israel.

<span id="an_33:17">33:17</span> Nevertheless the people sacrificed
still in the high places, but only unto Jehovah their God.

<span id="an_33:18">33:18</span> Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh,
and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to
him in the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, behold, they are written
among the acts of the kings of Israel.

<span id="an_33:19">33:19</span> His prayer also, and how \[God\] was
entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places
wherein he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the graven
images, before he humbled himself: behold, they are written in the
history of Hozai.

<span id="an_33:20">33:20</span> So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and
they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_33:21">33:21</span> Amon was twenty and two years old when
he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_33:22">33:22</span> And he did that which was evil in the
sight of Jehovah, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed unto
all the graven images which Manasseh his father had made, and served
them.

<span id="an_33:23">33:23</span> And he humbled not himself before
Jehovah, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon
trespassed more and more.

<span id="an_33:24">33:24</span> And his servants conspired against him,
and put him to death in his own house.

<span id="an_33:25">33:25</span> But the people of the land slew all
them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land
made Josiah his son king in his stead.

<span id="an_34:1">34:1</span> Josiah was eight years old when he began
to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_34:2">34:2</span> And he did that which was right in the
eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of David his father, and turned
not aside to the right hand or to the left.

<span id="an_34:3">34:3</span> For in the eighth year of his reign,
while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his
father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem
from the high places, and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the
molten images.

<span id="an_34:4">34:4</span> And they brake down the altars of the
Baalim in his presence; and the sun-images that were on high above them
he hewed down; and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten
images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it upon
the graves \[of them\] that had sacrificed unto them.

<span id="an_34:5">34:5</span> And he burnt the bones of the priests
upon their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.

<span id="an_34:6">34:6</span> And \[so did he\] in the cities of
Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, in their ruins
round about.

<span id="an_34:7">34:7</span> And he brake down the altars, and beat
the Asherim and the graven images into powder, and hewed down all the
sun-images throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_34:8">34:8</span> Now in the eighteenth year of his reign,
when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of
Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of
Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Jehovah his God.

<span id="an_34:9">34:9</span> And they came to Hilkiah the high priest,
and delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which
the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered of the hand of
Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah
and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_34:10">34:10</span> And they delivered it into the hand of
the workmen that had the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and the
workmen that wrought in the house of Jehovah gave it to mend and repair
the house;

<span id="an_34:11">34:11</span> even to the carpenters and to the
builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and
to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.

<span id="an_34:12">34:12</span> And the men did the work faithfully:
and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the
sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the
Kohathites, to set it forward; and \[others of\] the Levites, all that
were skilful with instruments of music.

<span id="an_34:13">34:13</span> Also they were over the bearers of
burdens, and set forward all that did the work in every manner of
service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and
porters.

<span id="an_34:14">34:14</span> And when they brought out the money
that was brought into the house of Jehovah, Hilkiah the priest found the
book of the law of Jehovah \[given\] by Moses.

<span id="an_34:15">34:15</span> And Hilkiah answered and said to
Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of
Jehovah. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.

<span id="an_34:16">34:16</span> And Shaphan carried the book to the
king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, All that was
committed to thy servants, they are doing.

<span id="an_34:17">34:17</span> And they have emptied out the money
that was found in the house of Jehovah, and have delivered it into the
hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.

<span id="an_34:18">34:18</span> And Shaphan the scribe told the king,
saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read
therein before the king.

<span id="an_34:19">34:19</span> And it came to pass, when the king had
heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.

<span id="an_34:20">34:20</span> And the king commanded Hilkiah, and
Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the
scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying,

<span id="an_34:21">34:21</span> Go ye, inquire of Jehovah for me, and
for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of
the book that is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is poured
out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Jehovah, to
do according unto all that is written in this book.

<span id="an_34:22">34:22</span> So Hilkiah, and they whom the king
\[had commanded\], went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum
the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she
dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they spake to her to that
effect.

<span id="an_34:23">34:23</span> And she said unto them, Thus saith
Jehovah, the God of Israel: Tell ye the man that sent you unto me,

<span id="an_34:24">34:24</span> Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will
bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all
the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the
king of Judah.

<span id="an_34:25">34:25</span> Because they have forsaken me, and have
burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with
all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out upon this
place, and it shall not be quenched.

<span id="an_34:26">34:26</span> But unto the king of Judah, who sent
you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith Jehovah,
the God of Israel: As touching the words which thou hast heard,

<span id="an_34:27">34:27</span> because thy heart was tender, and thou
didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against
this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and hast humbled
thyself before me, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also
have heard thee, saith Jehovah.

<span id="an_34:28">34:28</span> Behold, I will gather thee to thy
fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall
thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon
the inhabitants thereof. And they brought back word to the king.

<span id="an_34:29">34:29</span> Then the king sent and gathered
together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.

<span id="an_34:30">34:30</span> And the king went up to the house of
Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and
the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small:
and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that
was found in the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_34:31">34:31</span> And the king stood in his place, and
made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his
commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart,
and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were
written in this book.

<span id="an_34:32">34:32</span> And he caused all that were found in
Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand \[to it\]. And the inhabitants of
Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their
fathers.

<span id="an_34:33">34:33</span> And Josiah took away all the
abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of
Israel, and made all that were found in Israel to serve, even to serve
Jehovah their God. All his days they departed not from following
Jehovah, the God of their fathers.

<span id="an_35:1">35:1</span> And Josiah kept a passover unto Jehovah
in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth \[day\] of
the first month.

<span id="an_35:2">35:2</span> And he set the priests in their offices,
and encouraged them to the service of the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_35:3">35:3</span> And he said unto the Levites that taught
all Israel, that were holy unto Jehovah, Put the holy ark in the house
which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; there shall no
more be a burden upon your shoulders: now serve Jehovah your God, and
his people Israel.

<span id="an_35:4">35:4</span> And prepare yourselves after your
fathers' houses by your courses, according to the writing of David king
of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.

<span id="an_35:5">35:5</span> And stand in the holy place according to
the divisions of the fathers' houses of your brethren the children of
the people, and \[let there be for each\] a portion of a fathers' house
of the Levites.

<span id="an_35:6">35:6</span> And kill the passover, and sanctify
yourselves, and prepare for your brethren, to do according to the word
of Jehovah by Moses.

<span id="an_35:7">35:7</span> And Josiah gave to the children of the
people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all of them for the
passover-offerings, unto all that were present, to the number of thirty
thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's
substance.

<span id="an_35:8">35:8</span> And his princes gave for a
freewill-offering unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites.
Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of God, gave
unto the priests for the passover-offerings two thousand and six hundred
\[small cattle\], and three hundred oxen.

<span id="an_35:9">35:9</span> Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel,
his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the
Levites, gave unto the Levites for the passover-offerings five thousand
\[small cattle\], and five hundred oxen.

<span id="an_35:10">35:10</span> So the service was prepared, and the
priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their courses,
according to the king's commandment.

<span id="an_35:11">35:11</span> And they killed the passover, and the
priests sprinkled \[the blood which they received\] of their hand, and
the Levites flayed them.

<span id="an_35:12">35:12</span> And they removed the burnt-offerings,
that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers'
houses of the children of the people, to offer unto Jehovah, as it is
written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.

<span id="an_35:13">35:13</span> And they roasted the passover with fire
according to the ordinance: and the holy offerings boiled they in pots,
and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the
children of the people.

<span id="an_35:14">35:14</span> And afterward they prepared for
themselves, and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron
\[were busied\] in offering the burnt-offerings and the fat until night:
therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the
sons of Aaron.

<span id="an_35:15">35:15</span> And the singers the sons of Asaph were
in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and
Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters were at every gate:
they needed not to depart from their service; for their brethren the
Levites prepared for them.

<span id="an_35:16">35:16</span> So all the service of Jehovah was
prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer
burnt-offerings upon the altar of Jehovah, according to the commandment
of king Josiah.

<span id="an_35:17">35:17</span> And the children of Israel that were
present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened
bread seven days.

<span id="an_35:18">35:18</span> And there was no passover like to that
kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of
the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the
priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present,
and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_35:19">35:19</span> In the eighteenth year of the reign of
Josiah was this passover kept.

<span id="an_35:20">35:20</span> After all this, when Josiah had
prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against
Carchemish by the Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.

<span id="an_35:21">35:21</span> But he sent ambassadors to him, saying,
What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? \[I come\] not against
thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war; and God hath
commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from \[meddling with\] God, who
is with me, that he destroy thee not.

<span id="an_35:22">35:22</span> Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his
face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and
hearkened not unto the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to
fight in the valley of Megiddo.

<span id="an_35:23">35:23</span> And the archers shot at king Josiah;
and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.

<span id="an_35:24">35:24</span> So his servants took him out of the
chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him
to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchres of his
fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.

<span id="an_35:25">35:25</span> And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and
all the singing men and singing women spake of Josiah in their
lamentations unto this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel:
and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.

<span id="an_35:26">35:26</span> Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and
his good deeds, according to that which is written in the law of
Jehovah,

<span id="an_35:27">35:27</span> and his acts, first and last, behold,
they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

<span id="an_36:1">36:1</span> Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz
the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_36:2">36:2</span> Joahaz was twenty and three years old
when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_36:3">36:3</span> And the king of Egypt deposed him at
Jerusalem, and fined the land a hundred talents of silver and a talent
of gold.

<span id="an_36:4">36:4</span> And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his
brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to
Jehoiakim. And Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.

<span id="an_36:5">36:5</span> Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old
when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he
did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah his God.

<span id="an_36:6">36:6</span> Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king
of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.

<span id="an_36:7">36:7</span> Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the
vessels of the house of Jehovah to Babylon, and put them in his temple
at Babylon.

<span id="an_36:8">36:8</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim,
and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him,
behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah:
and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_36:9">36:9</span> Jehoiachin was eight years old when he
began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem:
and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.

<span id="an_36:10">36:10</span> And at the return of the year king
Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels
of the house of Jehovah, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah
and Jerusalem.

<span id="an_36:11">36:11</span> Zedekiah was twenty and one years old
when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:

<span id="an_36:12">36:12</span> and he did that which was evil in the
sight of Jehovah his God; he humbled not himself before Jeremiah the
prophet \[speaking\] from the mouth of Jehovah.

<span id="an_36:13">36:13</span> And he also rebelled against king
Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his
neck, and hardened his heart against turning unto Jehovah, the God of
Israel.

<span id="an_36:14">36:14</span> Moreover all the chiefs of the priests,
and the people, trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of
the nations; and they polluted the house of Jehovah which he had
hallowed in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_36:15">36:15</span> And Jehovah, the God of their fathers,
sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending, because he
had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling-place:

<span id="an_36:16">36:16</span> but they mocked the messengers of God,
and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of
Jehovah arose against his people, till there was no remedy.

<span id="an_36:17">36:17</span> Therefore he brought upon them the king
of the Chaldeans, who slew their young men with the sword in the house
of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or virgin, old
man or hoary-headed: he gave them all into his hand.

<span id="an_36:18">36:18</span> And all the vessels of the house of
God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the
treasures of the king, and of his princes, all these he brought to
Babylon.

<span id="an_36:19">36:19</span> And they burnt the house of God, and
brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with
fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.

<span id="an_36:20">36:20</span> And them that had escaped from the
sword carried he away to Babylon; and they were servants to him and his
sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:

<span id="an_36:21">36:21</span> to fulfil the word of Jehovah by the
mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths: \[for\] as
long as it lay desolate it kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten
years.

<span id="an_36:22">36:22</span> Now in the first year of Cyrus king of
Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be
accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so
that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and \[put it\]
also in writing, saying,

<span id="an_36:23">36:23</span> Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All
the kingdoms of the earth hath Jehovah, the God of heaven, given me; and
he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
Whosoever there is among you of all his people, Jehovah his God be with
him, and let him go up.
