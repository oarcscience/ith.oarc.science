### American Standard Version: Zephaniah

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The word of Jehovah which came unto
Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the
son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> I will utterly consume all things from off
the face of the ground, saith Jehovah.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> I will consume man and beast; I will
consume the birds of the heavens, and the fishes of the sea, and the
stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the
face of the ground, saith Jehovah.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> And I will stretch out my hand upon Judah,
and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the
remnant of Baal from this place, \[and\] the name of the Chemarim with
the priests;

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> and them that worship the host of heaven
upon the housetops; and them that worship, that swear to Jehovah and
swear by Malcam;

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> and them that are turned back from
following Jehovah; and those that have not sought Jehovah, nor inquired
after him.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord
Jehovah; for the day of Jehovah is at hand: for Jehovah hath prepared a
sacrifice, he hath consecrated his guests.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> And it shall come to pass in the day of
Jehovah's sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king's
sons, and all such as are clothed with foreign apparel.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> And in that day I will punish all those
that leap over the threshold, that fill their master's house with
violence and deceit.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> And in that day, saith Jehovah, there
shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and a wailing from the
second quarter, and a great crashing from the hills.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Wail, ye inhabitants of Maktesh; for all
the people of Canaan are undone; all they that were laden with silver
are cut off.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> And it shall come to pass at that time,
that I will search Jerusalem with lamps; and I will punish the men that
are settled on their lees, that say in their heart, Jehovah will not do
good, neither will he do evil.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> And their wealth shall become a spoil,
and their houses a desolation: yea, they shall build houses, but shall
not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but shall not drink
the wine thereof.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> The great day of Jehovah is near, it is
near and hasteth greatly, \[even\] the voice of the day of Jehovah; the
mighty man crieth there bitterly.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> That day is a day of wrath, a day of
trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of
darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> a day of the trumpet and alarm, against
the fortified cities, and against the high battlements.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> And I will bring distress upon men, that
they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against
Jehovah; and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as
dung.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> Neither their silver nor their gold shall
be able to deliver them in the day of Jehovah's wrath; but the whole
land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he will make an
end, yea, a terrible end, of all them that dwell in the land.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Gather yourselves together, yea, gather
together, O nation that hath no shame;

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> before the decree bring forth, \[before\]
the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of Jehovah come upon
you, before the day of Jehovah's anger come upon you.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> Seek ye Jehovah, all ye meek of the earth,
that have kept his ordinances; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may
be ye will be hid in the day of Jehovah's anger.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a
desolation; they shall drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron shall be
rooted up.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea-coast,
the nation of the Cherethites! The word of Jehovah is against you, O
Canaan, the land of the Philistines; I will destroy thee, that there
shall be no inhabitant.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> And the sea-coast shall be pastures, with
cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> And the coast shall be for the remnant of
the house of Judah; they shall feed \[their flocks\] thereupon; in the
houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening; for Jehovah their
God will visit them, and bring back their captivity.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the
revilings of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have reproached my
people, and magnified themselves against their border.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Therefore as I live, saith Jehovah of
hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the
children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and saltpits,
and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall make a prey
of them, and the remnant of my nation shall inherit them.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> This shall they have for their pride,
because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people
of Jehovah of hosts.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Jehovah will be terrible unto them; for
he will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him,
every one from his place, even all the isles of the nations.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by
my sword.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> And he will stretch out his hand against
the north, and destroy Assyria, and will make Nineveh a desolation, and
dry like the wilderness.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> And herds shall lie down in the midst of
her, all the beasts of the nations: both the pelican and the porcupine
shall lodge in the capitals thereof; \[their\] voice shall sing in the
windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds: for he hath laid bare
the cedar-work.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> This is the joyous city that dwelt
carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none besides me:
how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every
one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Woe to her that is rebellious and polluted!
to the oppressing city!

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> She obeyed not the voice; she received not
correction; she trusted not in Jehovah; she drew not near to her God.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Her princes in the midst of her are roaring
lions; her judges are evening wolves; they leave nothing till the
morrow.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Her prophets are light and treacherous
persons; her priests have profaned the sanctuary, they have done
violence to the law.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> Jehovah in the midst of her is righteous;
he will not do iniquity; every morning doth he bring his justice to
light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> I have cut off nations; their battlements
are desolate; I have made their streets waste, so that none passeth by;
their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no
inhabitant.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> I said, Only fear thou me; receive
correction; so her dwelling shall not be cut off, \[according to\] all
that I have appointed concerning her: but they rose early and corrupted
all their doings.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Therefore wait ye for me, saith Jehovah,
until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to
gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them
mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be
devoured with the fire of my jealousy.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> For then will I turn to the peoples of a
pure language, that they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve
him with one consent.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my
suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine
offering.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> In that day shalt thou not be put to
shame for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me; for
then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proudly exulting
ones, and thou shalt no more be haughty in my holy mountain.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> But I will leave in the midst of thee an
afflicted and poor people, and they shall take refuge in the name of
Jehovah.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> The remnant of Israel shall not do
iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in
their mouth; for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them
afraid.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O
Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> Jehovah hath taken away thy judgments, he
hath cast out thine enemy: the King of Israel, even Jehovah, is in the
midst of thee; thou shalt not fear evil any more.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> In that day it shall be said to
Jerusalem, Fear thou not; O Zion, let not thy hands be slack.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee,
a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will
rest in his love; he will joy over thee with singing.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> I will gather them that sorrow for the
solemn assembly, who were of thee; \[to whom\] the burden upon her was a
reproach.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> Behold, at that time I will deal with all
them that afflict thee; and I will save that which is lame, and gather
that which was driven away; and I will make them a praise and a name,
whose shame hath been in all the earth.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> At that time will I bring you in, and at
that time will I gather you; for I will make you a name and a praise
among all the peoples of the earth, when I bring back your captivity
before your eyes, saith Jehovah.
