### American Standard Version: 1 Timothy

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according
to the commandment of God our Saviour, and Christ Jesus our hope;

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> unto Timothy, my true child in faith:
Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> As I exhorted thee to tarry at Ephesus,
when I was going into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge certain men
not to teach a different doctrine,

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> neither to give heed to fables and endless
genealogies, which minister questionings, rather than a dispensation of
God which is in faith; \[so do I now\].

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> But the end of the charge is love out of a
pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned:

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> from which things some having swerved have
turned aside unto vain talking;

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> desiring to be teachers of the law, though
they understand neither what they say, nor whereof they confidently
affirm.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> But we know that the law is good, if a man
use it lawfully,

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> as knowing this, that law is not made for a
righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and
sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and
murderers of mothers, for manslayers,

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> for fornicators, for abusers of
themselves with men, for menstealers, for liars, for false swearers, and
if there be any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine;

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> according to the gospel of the glory of
the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> I thank him that enabled me, \[even\]
Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he counted me faithful, appointing me to
\[his\] service;

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> though I was before a blasphemer, and a
persecutor, and injurious: howbeit I obtained mercy, because I did it
ignorantly in unbelief;

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> and the grace of our Lord abounded
exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all
acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of
whom I am chief:

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy,
that in me as chief might Jesus Christ show forth all his longsuffering,
for an ensample of them that should thereafter believe on him unto
eternal life.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> Now unto the King eternal, immortal,
invisible, the only God, \[be\] honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> This charge I commit unto thee, my child
Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to thee, that by
them thou mayest war the good warfare;

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> holding faith and a good conscience;
which some having thrust from them made shipwreck concerning the faith:

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom
I delivered unto Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> I exhort therefore, first of all, that
supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all
men;

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> for kings and all that are in high place;
that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> This is good and acceptable in the sight of
God our Saviour;

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> who would have all men to be saved, and
come to the knowledge of the truth.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> For there is one God, one mediator also
between God and men, \[himself\] man, Christ Jesus,

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> who gave himself a ransom for all; the
testimony \[to be borne\] in its own times;

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> whereunto I was appointed a preacher and an
apostle (I speak the truth, I lie not), a teacher of the Gentiles in
faith and truth.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> I desire therefore that the men pray in
every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and disputing.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> In like manner, that women adorn themselves
in modest apparel, with shamefastness and sobriety; not with braided
hair, and gold or pearls or costly raiment;

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> but (which becometh women professing
godliness) through good works.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Let a woman learn in quietness with all
subjection.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to
have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> For Adam was first formed, then Eve;

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> and Adam was not beguiled, but the woman
being beguiled hath fallen into transgression:

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> but she shall be saved through her
child-bearing, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification
with sobriety.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Faithful is the saying, If a man seeketh
the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> The bishop therefore must be without
reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, orderly,
given to hospitality, apt to teach;

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> no brawler, no striker; but gentle, not
contentious, no lover of money;

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> one that ruleth well his own house, having
\[his\] children in subjection with all gravity;

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> (but if a man knoweth not how to rule his
own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> not a novice, lest being puffed up he fall
into the condemnation of the devil.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Moreover he must have good testimony from
them that are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the
devil.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Deacons in like manner \[must be\] grave,
not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> holding the mystery of the faith in a pure
conscience.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> And let these also first be proved; then
let them serve as deacons, if they be blameless.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Women in like manner \[must be\] grave,
not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Let deacons be husbands of one wife,
ruling \[their\] children and their own houses well.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> For they that have served well as deacons
gain to themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith
which is in Christ Jesus.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> These things write I unto thee, hoping to
come unto thee shortly;

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> but if I tarry long, that thou mayest
know how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God, which is
the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> And without controversy great is the
mystery of godliness; He who was manifested in the flesh, Justified in
the spirit, Seen of angels, Preached among the nations, Believed on in
the world, Received up in glory.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> But the Spirit saith expressly, that in
later times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing
spirits and doctrines of demons,

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> through the hypocrisy of men that speak
lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> forbidding to marry, \[and commanding\] to
abstain from meats, which God created to be received with thanksgiving
by them that believe and know the truth.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> For every creature of God is good, and
nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving:

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> for it is sanctified through the word of
God and prayer.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> If thou put the brethren in mind of these
things, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished in the
words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which thou hast followed
\[until now\]:

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> but refuse profane and old wives' fables.
And exercise thyself unto godliness:

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> for bodily exercise is profitable for a
little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of
the life which now is, and of that which is to come.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all
acceptation.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> For to this end we labor and strive,
because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Saviour of
all men, specially of them that believe.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> These things command and teach.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou
an ensample to them that believe, in word, in manner of life, in love,
in faith, in purity.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> Till I come, give heed to reading, to
exhortation, to teaching.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> Neglect not the gift that is in thee,
which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the
presbytery.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> Be diligent in these things; give thyself
wholly to them; that thy progress may be manifest unto all.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> Take heed to thyself, and to thy
teaching. Continue in these things; for in doing this thou shalt save
both thyself and them that hear thee.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Rebuke not an elder, but exhort him as a
father; the younger men as brethren:

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> the elder women as mothers; the younger as
sisters, in all purity.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> Honor widows that are widows indeed.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> But if any widow hath children or
grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety towards their own
family, and to requite their parents: for this is acceptable in the
sight of God.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> Now she that is a widow indeed, and
desolate, hath her hope set on God, and continueth in supplications and
prayers night and day.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> But she that giveth herself to pleasure is
dead while she liveth.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> These things also command, that they may be
without reproach.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> But if any provideth not for his own, and
specially his own household, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than
an unbeliever.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> Let none be enrolled as a widow under
threescore years old, \[having been\] the wife of one man,

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> well reported of for good works; if she
hath brought up children, if she hath used hospitality to strangers, if
she hath washed the saints' feet, if she hath relieved the afflicted, if
she hath diligently followed every good work.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> But younger widows refuse: for when they
have waxed wanton against Christ, they desire to marry;

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> having condemnation, because they have
rejected their first pledge.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> And withal they learn also \[to be\]
idle, going about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers
also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> I desire therefore that the younger
\[widows\] marry, bear children, rule the household, give no occasion to
the adversary for reviling:

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> for already some are turned aside after
Satan.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> If any woman that believeth hath widows,
let her relieve them, and let not the church be burdened; that it mat
relieve them that are widows indeed.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> Let the elders that rule well be counted
worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in
teaching.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not
muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. And, The laborer is worthy
of his hire.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> Against an elder receive not an
accusation, except at \[the mouth of\] two or three witnesses.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> Them that sin reprove in the sight of
all, that the rest also may be in fear.

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> I charge \[thee\] in the sight of God,
and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things
without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> Lay hands hastily on no man, neither be
partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure.

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> Be no longer a drinker of water, but use
a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities.

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> Some men's sins are evident, going before
unto judgment; and some men also they follow after.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> In like manner also there are good works
that are evident; and such as are otherwise cannot be hid.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> Let as many as are servants under the yoke
count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and
the doctrine be not blasphemed.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> And they that have believing masters, let
them not despise them, because they are brethren; but let them serve
them the rather, because they that partake of the benefit are believing
and beloved. These things teach and exhort.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> If any man teacheth a different doctrine,
and consenteth not to sound words, \[even\] the words of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> he is puffed up, knowing nothing, but
doting about questionings and disputes of words, whereof cometh envy,
strife, railings, evil surmisings,

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> wranglings of men corrupted in mind and
bereft of the truth, supposing that godliness is a way of gain.

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> But godliness with contentment is great
gain:

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> for we brought nothing into the world, for
neither can we carry anything out;

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> but having food and covering we shall be
therewith content.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> But they that are minded to be rich fall
into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and hurtful lusts, such
as drown men in destruction and perdition.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> For the love of money is a root of all
kinds of evil: which some reaching after have been led astray from the
faith, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

<span id="an_6:11">6:11</span> But thou, O man of God, flee these
things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love,
patience, meekness.

<span id="an_6:12">6:12</span> Fight the good fight of the faith, lay
hold on the life eternal, whereunto thou wast called, and didst confess
the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.

<span id="an_6:13">6:13</span> I charge thee in the sight of God, who
giveth life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who before Pontius
Pilate witnessed the good confession;

<span id="an_6:14">6:14</span> that thou keep the commandment, without
spot, without reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:

<span id="an_6:15">6:15</span> which in its own times he shall show, who
is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;

<span id="an_6:16">6:16</span> who only hath immortality, dwelling in
light unapproachable; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom \[be\]
honor and power eternal. Amen.

<span id="an_6:17">6:17</span> Charge them that are rich in this present
world, that they be not highminded, nor have their hope set on the
uncertainty of riches, but on God, who giveth us richly all things to
enjoy;

<span id="an_6:18">6:18</span> that they do good, that they be rich in
good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to communicate;

<span id="an_6:19">6:19</span> laying up in store for themselves a good
foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on the life
which is \[life\] indeed.

<span id="an_6:20">6:20</span> O Timothy, guard that which is committed
unto \[thee\], turning away from the profane babblings and oppositions
of the knowledge which is falsely so called;

<span id="an_6:21">6:21</span> which some professing have erred
concerning the faith. Grace be with you.
