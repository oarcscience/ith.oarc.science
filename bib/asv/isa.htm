<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for Jehovah hath spoken: I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib; [but] Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children that deal corruptly! they have forsaken Jehovah, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are estranged [and gone] backward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;Why will ye be still stricken, that ye revolt more and more? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; [but] wounds, and bruises, and fresh stripes: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with oil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;Except Jehovah of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;Hear the word of Jehovah, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;What unto me is the multitude of your sacrifices? saith Jehovah: I have had enough of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample my courts?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; new moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies,- I cannot away with iniquity and the solemn meeting.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth; they are a trouble unto me; I am weary of bearing them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;learn to do well; seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;Come now, and let us reason together, saith Jehovah: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;How is the faithful city become a harlot! she that was full of justice! righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth bribes, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;Therefore saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;and I will turn my hand upon thee, and thoroughly purge away thy dross, and will take away all thy tin;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:26">1:26</A>&nbsp;and I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness, a faithful town.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:27">1:27</A>&nbsp;Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts with righteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:28">1:28</A>&nbsp;But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together, and they that forsake Jehovah shall be consumed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:29">1:29</A>&nbsp;For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:30">1:30</A>&nbsp;For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:31">1:31</A>&nbsp;And the strong shall be as tow, and his work as a spark; and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in the latter days, that the mountain of Jehovah's house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;And many peoples shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;And he will judge between the nations, and will decide concerning many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;For thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they are filled [with customs] from the east, and [are] soothsayers like the Philistines, and they strike hands with the children of foreigners.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;And their land is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land also is full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;And the mean man is bowed down, and the great man is brought low: therefore forgive them not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;The lofty looks of man shall be brought low, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;For there shall be a day of Jehovah of hosts upon all that is proud and haughty, and upon all that is lifted up; and it shall be brought low;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;and upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;and upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;and upon every lofty tower, and upon every fortified wall,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant imagery.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low; and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;And the idols shall utterly pass away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;And men shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake mightily the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;In that day men shall cast away their idols of silver, and their idols of gold, which have been made for them to worship, to the moles and to the bats;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;to go into the caverns of the rocks, and into the clefts of the ragged rocks, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake mightily the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein is he to be accounted of?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;For, behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah stay and staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge, and the prophet, and the diviner, and the elder;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counsellor, and the expert artificer, and the skilful enchanter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbor: the child shall behave himself proudly against the old man, and the base against the honorable.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;When a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, [saying], Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;in that day shall he lift up [his voice], saying, I will not be a healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: ye shall not make me ruler of the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; because their tongue and their doings are against Jehovah, to provoke the eyes of his glory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;The show of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have done evil unto themselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;Say ye of the righteous, that [it shall be] well [with him]; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;Woe unto the wicked! [it shall be] ill [with him]; for what his hands have done shall be done unto him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they that lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;Jehovah standeth up to contend, and standeth to judge the peoples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and the princes thereof: It is ye that have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;what mean ye that ye crush my people, and grind the face of the poor? saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;Moreover Jehovah said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and Jehovah will lay bare their secret parts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, and the cauls, and the crescents;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;the pendants, and the bracelets, and the mufflers;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;the headtires, and the ankle chains, and the sashes, and the perfume-boxes, and the amulets;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;the rings, and the nose-jewels;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;the festival robes, and the mantles, and the shawls, and the satchels;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;the hand-mirrors, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the veils.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet spices there shall be rottenness; and instead of a girdle, a rope; and instead of well set hair, baldness; and instead of a robe, a girding of sackcloth; branding instead of beauty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:26">3:26</A>&nbsp;And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall be desolate and sit upon the ground.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name; take thou away our reproach.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;In that day shall the branch of Jehovah be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit of burning.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah will create over the whole habitation of mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory [shall be spread] a covering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;And there shall be a pavilion for a shade in the day-time from the heat, and for a refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;Let me sing for my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;and he digged it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; I will break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;and I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor hoed; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression; for righteousness, but, behold, a cry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no room, and ye be made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;In mine ears [saith] Jehovah of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield [but] an ephah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that tarry late into the night, till wine inflame them!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;And the harp and the lute, the tabret and the pipe, and wine, are [in] their feasts; but they regard not the work of Jehovah, neither have they considered the operation of his hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;Therefore my people are gone into captivity for lack of knowledge; and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude are parched with thirst.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;Therefore Sheol hath enlarged its desire, and opened its mouth without measure; and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth among them, descend [into it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;And the mean man is bowed down, and the great man is humbled, and the eyes of the lofty are humbled:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;but Jehovah of hosts is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;Then shall the lambs feed as in their pasture, and the waste places of the fat ones shall wanderers eat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, and sin as it were with a cart rope;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;that say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:21">5:21</A>&nbsp;Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:22">5:22</A>&nbsp;Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:23">5:23</A>&nbsp;that justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:24">5:24</A>&nbsp;Therefore as the tongue of fire devoureth the stubble, and as the dry grass sinketh down in the flame, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust; because they have rejected the law of Jehovah of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:25">5:25</A>&nbsp;Therefore is the anger of Jehovah kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them; and the mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:26">5:26</A>&nbsp;And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss for them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:27">5:27</A>&nbsp;None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:28">5:28</A>&nbsp;whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses' hoofs shall be accounted as flint, and their wheels as a whirlwind:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:29">5:29</A>&nbsp;their roaring shall be like a lioness, they shall roar like young lions; yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and there shall be none to deliver.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:30">5:30</A>&nbsp;And they shall roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold, darkness [and] distress; and the light is darkened in the clouds thereof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;Above him stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin forgiven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I; send me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they sea with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;and Jehovah have removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;And if there be yet a tenth in it, it also shall in turn be eaten up: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remaineth, when they are felled; so the holy seed is the stock thereof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;Then said Jehovah unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fuller's field;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;and say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither let thy heart be faint, because of these two tails of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have purposed evil against thee, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set up a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeel;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;thus saith the Lord Jehovah, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken in pieces, so that is shall not be a people:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;and the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake again unto Ahaz, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;Ask thee a sign of Jehovah thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David: Is it a small thing for you to weary men, that ye will weary my God also?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;Butter and honey shall he eat, when he knoweth to refuse the evil, and choose the good.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land whose two kings thou abhorrest shall be forsaken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;Jehovah will bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah-[even] the king of Assyria.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:18">7:18</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:19">7:19</A>&nbsp;And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the clefts of the rocks, and upon all thorn-hedges, and upon all pastures.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:20">7:20</A>&nbsp;In that day will the Lord shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River, [even] with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also consume the beard.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:21">7:21</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall keep alive a young cow, and two sheep;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:22">7:22</A>&nbsp;and it shall come to pass, that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the midst of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:23">7:23</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, shall be for briers and thorns.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:24">7:24</A>&nbsp;With arrows and with bow shall one come thither, because all the land shall be briers and thorns.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:25">7:25</A>&nbsp;And all the hills that were digged with the mattock, thou shalt not come thither for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of sheep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah said unto me, Take thee a great tablet, and write upon it with the pen of a man, For Maher-shalal-hash-baz;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;and I will take unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said Jehovah unto me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and, My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be carried away before the king of Assyria.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah spake unto me yet again, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;Forasmuch as this people have refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the River, strong and many, [even] the king of Assyria and all his glory: and it shall come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;and it shall sweep onward into Judah; it shall overflow and pass through; it shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of its wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;Make an uproar, O ye peoples, and be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;Take counsel together, and it shall be brought to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;For Jehovah spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;Say ye not, A conspiracy, concerning all whereof this people shall say, A conspiracy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be in dread [thereof].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;Jehovah of hosts, him shall ye sanctify; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:15">8:15</A>&nbsp;And many shall stumble thereon, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:16">8:16</A>&nbsp;Bind thou up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;And I will wait for Jehovah, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:18">8:18</A>&nbsp;Behold, I and the children whom Jehovah hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Jehovah of hosts, who dwelleth in mount Zion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:19">8:19</A>&nbsp;And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits and unto the wizards, that chirp and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? on behalf of the living [should they seek] unto the dead?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:20">8:20</A>&nbsp;To the law and to the testimony! if they speak not according to this word, surely there is no morning for them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:21">8:21</A>&nbsp;And they shall pass through it, sore distressed and hungry; and it shall come to pass that, when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse by their king and by their God, and turn their faces upward:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:22">8:22</A>&nbsp;and they shall look unto the earth, and behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish; and into thick darkness [they shall be] driven away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;But there shall be no gloom to her that was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter time hath he made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;Thou hast multiplied the nation, thou hast increased their joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, thou hast broken as in the day of Midian.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;For all the armor of the armed man in the tumult, and the garments rolled in blood, shall be for burning, for fuel of fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;And all the people shall know, [even] Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in pride and in stoutness of heart,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;The bricks are fallen, but we will build with hewn stone; the sycomores are cut down, but we will put cedars in their place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;Therefore Jehovah will set up on high against him the adversaries of Rezin, and will stir up his enemies,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;the Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;Yet the people have not turned unto him that smote them, neither have they sought Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;Therefore Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm-branch and rush, in one day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;The elder and the honorable man, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;For they that lead this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men, neither will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows; for every one is profane and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;For wickedness burneth as the fire; it devoureth the briers and thorns; yea, it kindleth in the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in a column of smoke.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:19">9:19</A>&nbsp;Through the wrath of Jehovah of hosts is the land burnt up; and the people are as the fuel of fire: no man spareth his brother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:20">9:20</A>&nbsp;And one shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:21">9:21</A>&nbsp;Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers that write perverseness;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;to turn aside the needy from justice, and to rob the poor of my people of their right, that widows may be their spoil, and that they may make the fatherless their prey!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;They shall only bow down under the prisoners, and shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;Ho Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, the staff in whose hand is mine indignation!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;I will send him against a profane nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;For he saith, Are not my princes all of them kings?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:10">10:10</A>&nbsp;As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;Wherefore it shall come to pass, that, when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:13">10:13</A>&nbsp;For he hath said, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I have understanding: and I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures, and like a valiant man I have brought down them that sit [on thrones]:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;and my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the peoples; and as one gathereth eggs that are forsaken, have I gathered all the earth: and there was none that moved the wing, or that opened the mouth, or chirped.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? shall the saw magnify itself against him that wieldeth it? as if a rod should wield them that lift it up, [or] as if a staff should lift up [him that is] not wood.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:16">10:16</A>&nbsp;Therefore will the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory there shall be kindled a burning like the burning of fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:17">10:17</A>&nbsp;And the light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:18">10:18</A>&nbsp;And he will consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and it shall be as when a standard-bearer fainteth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:19">10:19</A>&nbsp;And the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, so that a child may write them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:20">10:20</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and they that are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again lean upon him that smote them, but shall lean upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:21">10:21</A>&nbsp;A remnant shall return, [even] the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:22">10:22</A>&nbsp;For though thy people, Israel, be as the sand of the sea, [only] a remnant of them shall return: a destruction [is] determined, overflowing with righteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:23">10:23</A>&nbsp;For a full end, and that determined, will the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, make in the midst of all the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:24">10:24</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian, though he smite thee with the rod, and lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:25">10:25</A>&nbsp;For yet a very little while, and the indignation [against thee] shall be accomplished, and mine anger [shall be directed] to his destruction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:26">10:26</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah of hosts will stir up against him a scourge, as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and his rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up after the manner of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:27">10:27</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall depart from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed by reason of fatness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:28">10:28</A>&nbsp;He is come to Aiath, he is passed through Migron; at Michmash he layeth up his baggage;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_13:19">13:19</A>&nbsp;And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans' pride, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:20">13:20</A>&nbsp;It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall shepherds make their flocks to lie down there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:21">13:21</A>&nbsp;But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and ostriches shall dwell there, and wild goats shall dance there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:22">13:22</A>&nbsp;And wolves shall cry in their castles, and jackals in the pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:1">14:1</A>&nbsp;For Jehovah will have compassion on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land: and the sojourner shall join himself with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_15:1">15:1</A>&nbsp;The burden of Moab. For in a night Ar of Moab is laid waste, [and] brought to nought; for in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste, [and] brought to nought.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:2">15:2</A>&nbsp;They are gone up to Bayith, and to Dibon, to the high places, to weep: Moab waileth over Nebo, and over Medeba; on all their heads is baldness, every beard is cut off.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:3">15:3</A>&nbsp;In their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth; on their housetops, and in their broad places, every one waileth, weeping abundantly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:4">15:4</A>&nbsp;And Heshbon crieth out, and Elealeh; their voice is heard even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; his soul trembleth within him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:5">15:5</A>&nbsp;My heart crieth out for Moab; her nobles [flee] unto Zoar, to Eglath-shelishi-yah: for by the ascent of Luhith with weeping they go up; for in the way of Horonaim they raise up a cry of destruction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:6">15:6</A>&nbsp;For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate; for the grass is withered away, the tender grass faileth, there is no green thing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:7">15:7</A>&nbsp;Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away over the brook of the willows.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:8">15:8</A>&nbsp;For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the wailing thereof unto Eglaim, and the wailing thereof unto Beer-elim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:9">15:9</A>&nbsp;For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; for I will bring yet more upon Dimon, a lion upon them of Moab that escape, and upon the remnant of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:1">16:1</A>&nbsp;Send ye the lambs for the ruler of the land from Selah to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:2">16:2</A>&nbsp;For it shall be that, as wandering birds, as a scattered nest, so shall the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:3">16:3</A>&nbsp;Give counsel, execute justice; make thy shade as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; betray not the fugitive.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:4">16:4</A>&nbsp;Let mine outcasts dwell with thee; as for Moab, be thou a covert to him from the face of the destroyer. For the extortioner is brought to nought, destruction ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:5">16:5</A>&nbsp;And a throne shall be established in lovingkindness; and one shall sit thereon in truth, in the tent of David, judging, and seeking justice, and swift to do righteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:6">16:6</A>&nbsp;We have heard of the pride of Moab, [that] he is very proud; even of his arrogancy, and his pride, and his wrath; his boastings are nought.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:7">16:7</A>&nbsp;Therefore shall Moab wail for Moab, every one shall wail: for the raisin-cakes of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn, utterly stricken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:8">16:8</A>&nbsp;For the fields of Heshbon languish, [and] the vine of Sibmah; the lords of the nations have broken down the choice branches thereof, which reached even unto Jazer, which wandered into the wilderness; its shoots were spread abroad, they passed over the sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:9">16:9</A>&nbsp;Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah; I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for upon thy summer fruits and upon thy harvest the [battle] shout is fallen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:10">16:10</A>&nbsp;And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the fruitful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither joyful noise: no treader shall tread out wine in the presses; I have made the [vintage] shout to cease.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:11">16:11</A>&nbsp;Wherefore my heart soundeth like a harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kir-heres.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:12">16:12</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, when Moab presenteth himself, when he wearieth himself upon the high place, and shall come to his sanctuary to pray, that he shall not prevail.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:13">16:13</A>&nbsp;This is the word that Jehovah spake concerning Moab in time past.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:14">16:14</A>&nbsp;But now Jehovah hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of a hireling, the glory of Moab shall be brought into contempt, with all his great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and of no account.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:1">17:1</A>&nbsp;The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:2">17:2</A>&nbsp;The cities of Aroer are forsaken; they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:3">17:3</A>&nbsp;And the fortress shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria; they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:4">17:4</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:5">17:5</A>&nbsp;And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the standing grain, and his arm reapeth the ears; yea, it shall be as when one gleaneth ears in the valley of Rephaim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:6">17:6</A>&nbsp;Yet there shall be left therein gleanings, as the shaking of an olive-tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost branches of a fruitful tree, saith Jehovah, the God of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:7">17:7</A>&nbsp;In that day shall men look unto their Maker, and their eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:8">17:8</A>&nbsp;And they shall not look to the altars, the work of their hands; neither shall they have respect to that which their fingers have made, either the Asherim, or the sun-images.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:9">17:9</A>&nbsp;In that day shall their strong cities be as the forsaken places in the wood and on the mountain top, which were forsaken from before the children of Israel; and it shall be a desolation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:10">17:10</A>&nbsp;For thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength; therefore thou plantest pleasant plants, and settest it with strange slips.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:11">17:11</A>&nbsp;In the day of thy planting thou hedgest it in, and in the morning thou makest thy seed to blossom; but the harvest fleeth away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:12">17:12</A>&nbsp;Ah, the uproar of many peoples, that roar like the roaring of the seas; and the rushing of nations, that rush like the rushing of mighty waters!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:13">17:13</A>&nbsp;The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but he shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like the whirling dust before the storm.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:14">17:14</A>&nbsp;At eventide, behold, terror; [and] before the morning they are not. This is the portion of them that despoil us, and the lot of them that rob us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:1">18:1</A>&nbsp;Ah, the land of the rustling of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:2">18:2</A>&nbsp;that sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of papyrus upon the waters, [saying], Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a people terrible from their beginning onward, a nation that meteth out and treadeth down, whose land the rivers divide!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:3">18:3</A>&nbsp;All ye inhabitants of the world, and ye dwellers on the earth, when an ensign is lifted up on the mountains, see ye; and when the trumpet is blown, hear ye.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:4">18:4</A>&nbsp;For thus hath Jehovah said unto me, I will be still, and I will behold in my dwelling-place, like clear heat in sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:5">18:5</A>&nbsp;For before the harvest, when the blossom is over, and the flower becometh a ripening grape, he will cut off the sprigs with pruning-hooks, and the spreading branches will he take away [and] cut down.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:6">18:6</A>&nbsp;They shall be left together unto the ravenous birds of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth; and the ravenous birds shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:7">18:7</A>&nbsp;In that time shall a present be brought unto Jehovah of hosts [from] a people tall and smooth, even from a people terrible from their beginning onward, a nation that meteth out and treadeth down, whose land the rivers divide, to the place of the name of Jehovah of hosts, the mount Zion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:1">19:1</A>&nbsp;The burden of Egypt. Behold, Jehovah rideth upon a swift cloud, and cometh unto Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall tremble at his presence; and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:2">19:2</A>&nbsp;And I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbor; city against city, [and] kingdom against kingdom.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:3">19:3</A>&nbsp;And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst of it; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek unto the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:4">19:4</A>&nbsp;And I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:5">19:5</A>&nbsp;And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and become dry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:6">19:6</A>&nbsp;And the rivers shall become foul; the streams of Egypt shall be diminished and dried up; the reeds and flags shall wither away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:7">19:7</A>&nbsp;The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the Nile, shall become dry, be driven away, and be no more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:8">19:8</A>&nbsp;And the fishers shall lament, and all they that cast angle into the Nile shall mourn, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:9">19:9</A>&nbsp;Moreover they that work in combed flax, and they that weave white cloth, shall be confounded.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:10">19:10</A>&nbsp;And the pillars [of Egypt] shall be broken in pieces; all they that work for hire [shall be] grieved in soul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:11">19:11</A>&nbsp;The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish; the counsel of the wisest counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:12">19:12</A>&nbsp;Where then are thy wise men? and let them tell thee now; and let them know what Jehovah of hosts hath purposed concerning Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:13">19:13</A>&nbsp;The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Memphis are deceived; they have caused Egypt to go astray, that are the corner-stone of her tribes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:14">19:14</A>&nbsp;Jehovah hath mingled a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in every work thereof, as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_19:16">19:16</A>&nbsp;In that day shall the Egyptians be like unto women; and they shall tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Jehovah of hosts, which he shaketh over them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:17">19:17</A>&nbsp;And the land of Judah shall become a terror unto Egypt; every one to whom mention is made thereof shall be afraid, because of the purpose of Jehovah of hosts, which he purposeth against it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:18">19:18</A>&nbsp;In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to Jehovah of hosts; one shall be called The city of destruction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:19">19:19</A>&nbsp;In that day shall there be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:20">19:20</A>&nbsp;And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto Jehovah of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they shall cry unto Jehovah because of oppressors, and he will send them a saviour, and a defender, and he will deliver them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:21">19:21</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know Jehovah in that day; yea, they shall worship with sacrifice and oblation, and shall vow a vow unto Jehovah, and shall perform it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:22">19:22</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah will smite Egypt, smiting and healing; and they shall return unto Jehovah, and he will be entreated of them, and will heal them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:23">19:23</A>&nbsp;In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians shall worship with the Assyrians.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:24">19:24</A>&nbsp;In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:25">19:25</A>&nbsp;for that Jehovah of hosts hath blessed them, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:1">20:1</A>&nbsp;In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and took it;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:2">20:2</A>&nbsp;at that time Jehovah spake by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go, and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put thy shoe from off thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_20:4">20:4</A>&nbsp;so shall the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt, and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:5">20:5</A>&nbsp;And they shall be dismayed and confounded, because of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_21:1">21:1</A>&nbsp;The burden of the wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it cometh from the wilderness, from a terrible land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:2">21:2</A>&nbsp;A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous man dealeth treacherously, and the destroyer destroyeth. Go up, O Elam; besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:3">21:3</A>&nbsp;Therefore are my loins filled with anguish; pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman in travail: I am pained so that I cannot hear; I am dismayed so that I cannot see.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:4">21:4</A>&nbsp;My heart fluttereth, horror hath affrighted me; the twilight that I desired hath been turned into trembling unto me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:5">21:5</A>&nbsp;They prepare the table, they set the watch, they eat, they drink: rise up, ye princes, anoint the shield.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:6">21:6</A>&nbsp;For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman: let him declare what he seeth:</p>

<p><A NAME="an_21:8">21:8</A>&nbsp;And he cried as a lion: O Lord, I stand continually upon the watch-tower in the day-time, and am set in my ward whole nights;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:9">21:9</A>&nbsp;and, behold, here cometh a troop of men, horsemen in pairs. And he answered and said, Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the graven images of her gods are broken unto the ground.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:10">21:10</A>&nbsp;O thou my threshing, and the grain of my floor! that which I have heard from Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:11">21:11</A>&nbsp;The burden of Dumah. One calleth unto me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:12">21:12</A>&nbsp;The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire ye: turn ye, come.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_21:16">21:16</A>&nbsp;For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar shall fail;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:17">21:17</A>&nbsp;and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be few; for Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath spoken it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:1">22:1</A>&nbsp;The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:2">22:2</A>&nbsp;O thou that art full of shoutings, a tumultuous city, a joyous town; thy slain are not slain with the sword, neither are they dead in battle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:3">22:3</A>&nbsp;All thy rulers fled away together, they were bound by the archers; all that were found of thee were bound together; they fled afar off.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:4">22:4</A>&nbsp;Therefore said I, Look away from me, I will weep bitterly; labor not to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:5">22:5</A>&nbsp;For it is a day of discomfiture, and of treading down, and of perplexity, from the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, in the valley of vision; a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the mountains.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:6">22:6</A>&nbsp;And Elam bare the quiver, with chariots of men [and] horsemen; and Kir uncovered the shield.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:7">22:7</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that thy choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:8">22:8</A>&nbsp;And he took away the covering of Judah; and thou didst look in that day to the armor in the house of the forest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:9">22:9</A>&nbsp;And ye saw the breaches of the city of David, that they were many; and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:10">22:10</A>&nbsp;and ye numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and ye brake down the houses to fortify the wall;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:11">22:11</A>&nbsp;ye made also a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But ye looked not unto him that had done this, neither had ye respect unto him that purposed it long ago.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:12">22:12</A>&nbsp;And in that day did the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:13">22:13</A>&nbsp;and behold, joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine: let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we shall die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:14">22:14</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah of hosts revealed himself in mine ears, Surely this iniquity shall not be forgiven you till ye die, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:15">22:15</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, Go, get thee unto this treasurer, even unto Shebna, who is over the house, [and say],</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:16">22:16</A>&nbsp;What doest thou here? and whom has thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out here a sepulchre? hewing him out a sepulchre on high, graving a habitation for himself in the rock!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:17">22:17</A>&nbsp;Behold, Jehovah, like a [strong] man, will hurl thee away violently; yea, he will wrap thee up closely.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:18">22:18</A>&nbsp;He will surely wind thee round and round, [and toss thee] like a ball into a large country; there shalt thou die, and there shall be the chariots of thy glory, thou shame of thy lord's house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:19">22:19</A>&nbsp;And I will thrust thee from thine office; and from thy station shalt thou be pulled down.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:20">22:20</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:21">22:21</A>&nbsp;and I will cloth him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand; and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:22">22:22</A>&nbsp;And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; and he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:23">22:23</A>&nbsp;And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a throne of glory to his father's house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:24">22:24</A>&nbsp;And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the flagons.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:25">22:25</A>&nbsp;In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, shall the nail that was fastened in a sure place give way; and it shall be hewn down, and fall; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off; for Jehovah hath spoken it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:1">23:1</A>&nbsp;The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Kittim it is revealed to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:2">23:2</A>&nbsp;Be still, ye inhabitants of the coast, thou whom the merchants of Sidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:3">23:3</A>&nbsp;And on great waters the seed of the Shihor, the harvest of the Nile, was her revenue; and she was the mart of nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:4">23:4</A>&nbsp;Be thou ashamed, O Sidon; for the sea hath spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, I have not travailed, nor brought forth, neither have I nourished young men, nor brought up virgins.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:5">23:5</A>&nbsp;When the report cometh to Egypt, they shall be sorely pained at the report of Tyre.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:6">23:6</A>&nbsp;Pass ye over to Tarshish; wail, ye inhabitants of the coast.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:7">23:7</A>&nbsp;Is this your joyous [city], whose antiquity is of ancient days, whose feet carried her afar off to sojourn?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:8">23:8</A>&nbsp;Who hath purposed this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:9">23:9</A>&nbsp;Jehovah of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:10">23:10</A>&nbsp;Pass through thy land as the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish; there is no restraint any more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:11">23:11</A>&nbsp;He hath stretched out his hand over the sea, he hath shaken the kingdoms: Jehovah hath given commandment concerning Canaan, to destroy the strongholds thereof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:12">23:12</A>&nbsp;And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon: arise, pass over to Kittim; even there shalt thou have no rest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:13">23:13</A>&nbsp;Behold, the land of the Chaldeans: this people was not; the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness; they set up their towers; they overthrew the palaces thereof; they made it a ruin.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:14">23:14</A>&nbsp;Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for your stronghold is laid waste.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:15">23:15</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy years it shall be unto Tyre as in the song of the harlot.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:16">23:16</A>&nbsp;Take a harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:17">23:17</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that Jehovah will visit Tyre, and she shall return to her hire, and shall play the harlot with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:18">23:18</A>&nbsp;And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to Jehovah: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before Jehovah, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:1">24:1</A>&nbsp;Behold, Jehovah maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:2">24:2</A>&nbsp;And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:3">24:3</A>&nbsp;The earth shall be utterly emptied, and utterly laid waste; for Jehovah hath spoken this word.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:4">24:4</A>&nbsp;The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the lofty people of the earth do languish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:5">24:5</A>&nbsp;The earth also is polluted under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, broken the everlasting covenant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:6">24:6</A>&nbsp;Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are found guilty: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:7">24:7</A>&nbsp;The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merry-hearted do sigh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:8">24:8</A>&nbsp;The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:9">24:9</A>&nbsp;They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:10">24:10</A>&nbsp;The waste city is broken down; every house is shut up, that no man may come in.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:11">24:11</A>&nbsp;There is a crying in the streets because of the wine; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:12">24:12</A>&nbsp;In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:13">24:13</A>&nbsp;For thus shall it be in the midst of the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive-tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:14">24:14</A>&nbsp;These shall lift up their voice, they shall shout; for the majesty of Jehovah they cry aloud from the sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:15">24:15</A>&nbsp;Wherefore glorify ye Jehovah in the east, even the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the isles of the sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:16">24:16</A>&nbsp;From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs: Glory to the righteous. But I said, I pine away, I pine away, woe is me! the treacherous have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:17">24:17</A>&nbsp;Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:18">24:18</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:19">24:19</A>&nbsp;The earth is utterly broken, the earth is rent asunder, the earth is shaken violently.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:20">24:20</A>&nbsp;The earth shall stagger like a drunken man, and shall sway to and fro like a hammock; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it, and it shall fall, and not rise again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:21">24:21</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will punish the host of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:22">24:22</A>&nbsp;And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison; and after many days shall they be visited.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:23">24:23</A>&nbsp;Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for Jehovah of hosts will reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem; and before his elders shall be glory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:1">25:1</A>&nbsp;O Jehovah, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things, [even] counsels of old, in faithfulness [and] truth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:2">25:2</A>&nbsp;For thou hast made of a city a heap, of a fortified city a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:3">25:3</A>&nbsp;Therefore shall a strong people glorify thee; a city of terrible nations shall fear thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:4">25:4</A>&nbsp;For thou hast been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:5">25:5</A>&nbsp;As the heat in a dry place wilt thou bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the terrible ones shall be brought low.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:6">25:6</A>&nbsp;And in this mountain will Jehovah of hosts make unto all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:7">25:7</A>&nbsp;And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering that covereth all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:8">25:8</A>&nbsp;He hath swallowed up death for ever; and the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the reproach of his people will he take away from off all the earth: for Jehovah hath spoken it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:9">25:9</A>&nbsp;And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is Jehovah; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:10">25:10</A>&nbsp;For in this mountain will the hand of Jehovah rest; and Moab shall be trodden down in his place, even as straw is trodden down in the water of the dung-hill.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:11">25:11</A>&nbsp;And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst thereof, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth [his hands] to swim; but [Jehovah] will lay low his pride together with the craft of his hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:12">25:12</A>&nbsp;And the high fortress of thy walls hath he brought down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:1">26:1</A>&nbsp;In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah: we have a strong city; salvation will he appoint for walls and bulwarks.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:2">26:2</A>&nbsp;Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth faith may enter in.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:3">26:3</A>&nbsp;Thou wilt keep [him] in perfect peace, [whose] mind [is] stayed [on thee]; because he trusteth in thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:4">26:4</A>&nbsp;Trust ye in Jehovah for ever; for in Jehovah, [even] Jehovah, is an everlasting rock.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:5">26:5</A>&nbsp;For he hath brought down them that dwell on high, the lofty city: he layeth it low, he layeth it low even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:6">26:6</A>&nbsp;The foot shall tread it down; even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:7">26:7</A>&nbsp;The way of the just is uprightness: thou that art upright dost direct the path of the just.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:8">26:8</A>&nbsp;Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O Jehovah, have we waited for thee; to thy name, even to thy memorial [name], is the desire of our soul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:9">26:9</A>&nbsp;With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee earnestly: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:10">26:10</A>&nbsp;Let favor be showed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness will he deal wrongfully, and will not behold the majesty of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:11">26:11</A>&nbsp;Jehovah, thy hand is lifted up, yet they see not: but they shall see [thy] zeal for the people, and be put to shame; yea, fire shall devour thine adversaries.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:12">26:12</A>&nbsp;Jehovah, thou wilt ordain peace for us; for thou hast also wrought all our works for us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:13">26:13</A>&nbsp;O Jehovah our God, other lords besides thee have had dominion over us; but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:14">26:14</A>&nbsp;[They are] dead, they shall not live; [they are] deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all remembrance of them to perish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:15">26:15</A>&nbsp;Thou hast increased the nation, O Jehovah, thou hast increased the nation; thou art glorified; thou hast enlarged all the borders of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:16">26:16</A>&nbsp;Jehovah, in trouble have they visited thee; they poured out a prayer [when] thy chastening was upon them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:17">26:17</A>&nbsp;Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain and crieth out in her pangs; so we have been before thee, O Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:18">26:18</A>&nbsp;We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:19">26:19</A>&nbsp;Thy dead shall live; my dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust; for thy dew is [as] the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast forth the dead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:20">26:20</A>&nbsp;Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:21">26:21</A>&nbsp;For, behold, Jehovah cometh forth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:1">27:1</A>&nbsp;In that day Jehovah with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan the swift serpent, and leviathan the crooked serpent; and he will slay the monster that is in the sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:2">27:2</A>&nbsp;In that day: A vineyard of wine, sing ye unto it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:3">27:3</A>&nbsp;I Jehovah am its keeper; I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:4">27:4</A>&nbsp;Wrath is not in me: would that the briers and thorns were against me in battle! I would march upon them, I would burn them together.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:5">27:5</A>&nbsp;Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; [yea], let him make peace with me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:6">27:6</A>&nbsp;In days to come shall Jacob take root; Israel shall blossom and bud; and they shall fill the face of the world with fruit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:7">27:7</A>&nbsp;Hath he smitten them as he smote those that smote them? or are they slain according to the slaughter of them that were slain by them?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:8">27:8</A>&nbsp;In measure, when thou sendest them away, thou dost contend with them; he hath removed [them] with his rough blast in the day of the east wind.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:9">27:9</A>&nbsp;Therefore by this shall the iniquity of Jacob be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, [so that] the Asherim and the sun-images shall rise no more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:10">27:10</A>&nbsp;For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:11">27:11</A>&nbsp;When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off; the women shall come, and set them on fire; for it is a people of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have compassion upon them, and he that formed them will show them no favor.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:12">27:12</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will beat off [his fruit] from the flood of the River unto the brook of Egypt; and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:13">27:13</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great trumpet shall be blown; and they shall come that were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and they that were outcasts in the land of Egypt; and they shall worship Jehovah in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:1">28:1</A>&nbsp;Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley of them that are overcome with wine!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:2">28:2</A>&nbsp;Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one; as a tempest of hail, a destroying storm, as a tempest of mighty waters overflowing, will he cast down to the earth with the hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:3">28:3</A>&nbsp;The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden under foot:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:4">28:4</A>&nbsp;and the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be as the first-ripe fig before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:5">28:5</A>&nbsp;In that day will Jehovah of hosts become a crown of glory, and a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:6">28:6</A>&nbsp;and a spirit of justice to him that sitteth in judgment, and strength to them that turn back the battle at the gate.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:7">28:7</A>&nbsp;And even these reel with wine, and stagger with strong drink; the priest and the prophet reel with strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they stagger with strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:8">28:8</A>&nbsp;For all tables are full of vomit [and] filthiness, [so that there is] no place [clean].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:9">28:9</A>&nbsp;Whom will he teach knowledge? and whom will he make to understand the message? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:10">28:10</A>&nbsp;For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:11">28:11</A>&nbsp;Nay, but by [men of] strange lips and with another tongue will he speak to this people;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:12">28:12</A>&nbsp;to whom he said, This is the rest, give ye rest to him that is weary; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:13">28:13</A>&nbsp;Therefore shall the word of Jehovah be unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little; that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:14">28:14</A>&nbsp;Wherefore hear the word of Jehovah, ye scoffers, that rule this people that is in Jerusalem:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:15">28:15</A>&nbsp;Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with Sheol are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:16">28:16</A>&nbsp;therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner -[stone] of sure foundation: he that believeth shall not be in haste.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:17">28:17</A>&nbsp;And I will make justice the line, and righteousness the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:18">28:18</A>&nbsp;And your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:19">28:19</A>&nbsp;As often as it passeth though, it shall take you; for morning by morning shall it pass through, by day and by night: and it shall be nought but terror to understand the message.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:20">28:20</A>&nbsp;For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it; and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:21">28:21</A>&nbsp;For Jehovah will rise up as in mount Perazim, he will be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may do his work, his strange work, and bring to pass his act, his strange act.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:22">28:22</A>&nbsp;Now therefore be ye not scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong; for a decree of destruction have I heard from the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, upon the whole earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:23">28:23</A>&nbsp;Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:24">28:24</A>&nbsp;Doth he that ploweth to sow plow continually? doth he [continually] open and harrow his ground?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:25">28:25</A>&nbsp;When he hath levelled the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and put in the wheat in rows, and the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in the border thereof?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:26">28:26</A>&nbsp;For his God doth instruct him aright, [and] doth teach him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:27">28:27</A>&nbsp;For the fitches are not threshed with a sharp [threshing] instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:28">28:28</A>&nbsp;Bread [grain] is ground; for he will not be always threshing it: and though the wheel of his cart and his horses scatter it, he doth not grind it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:29">28:29</A>&nbsp;This also cometh forth from Jehovah of hosts, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:1">29:1</A>&nbsp;Ho Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! add ye year to year; let the feasts come round:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:2">29:2</A>&nbsp;then will I distress Ariel, and there shall be mourning and lamentation; and she shall be unto me as Ariel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:3">29:3</A>&nbsp;And I will encamp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with posted troops, and I will raise siege works against thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:4">29:4</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust; and thy voice shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:5">29:5</A>&nbsp;But the multitude of thy foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones as chaff that passeth away: yea, it shall be in an instant suddenly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:6">29:6</A>&nbsp;She shall be visited of Jehovah of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:7">29:7</A>&nbsp;And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her stronghold, and that distress her, shall be as a dream, a vision of the night.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:8">29:8</A>&nbsp;And it shall be as when a hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:9">29:9</A>&nbsp;Tarry ye and wonder; take your pleasure and be blind: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:10">29:10</A>&nbsp;For Jehovah hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes, the prophets; and your heads, the seers, hath he covered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:11">29:11</A>&nbsp;And all vision is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I cannot, for it is sealed:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:12">29:12</A>&nbsp;and the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I am not learned.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:13">29:13</A>&nbsp;And the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw nigh [unto me], and with their mouth and with their lips to honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men which hath been taught [them];</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:14">29:14</A>&nbsp;therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:15">29:15</A>&nbsp;Woe unto them that hide deep their counsel from Jehovah, and whose works are in the dark, and that say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:16">29:16</A>&nbsp;Ye turn things upside down! Shall the potter be esteemed as clay; that the thing made should say of him that made it, He made me not; or the thing formed say of him that formed it, He hath no understanding?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:17">29:17</A>&nbsp;Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:18">29:18</A>&nbsp;And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:19">29:19</A>&nbsp;The meek also shall increase their joy in Jehovah, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:20">29:20</A>&nbsp;For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scoffer ceaseth, and all they that watch for iniquity are cut off;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:21">29:21</A>&nbsp;that make a man an offender in [his] cause, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nought.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:22">29:22</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith Jehovah, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:23">29:23</A>&nbsp;But when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name; yea, they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall stand in awe of the God of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:24">29:24</A>&nbsp;They also that err in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmur shall receive instruction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:1">30:1</A>&nbsp;Woe to the rebellious children, saith Jehovah, that take counsel, but not of me; and that make a league, but not of my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:2">30:2</A>&nbsp;that set out to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:3">30:3</A>&nbsp;Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:4">30:4</A>&nbsp;For their princes are at Zoan, and their ambassadors are come to Hanes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:5">30:5</A>&nbsp;They shall all be ashamed because of a people that cannot profit them, that are not a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:6">30:6</A>&nbsp;The burden of the beasts of the South. Through the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the humps of camels, to a people that shall not profit [them].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:7">30:7</A>&nbsp;For Egypt helpeth in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I called her Rahab that sitteth still.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:8">30:8</A>&nbsp;Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:9">30:9</A>&nbsp;For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of Jehovah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:10">30:10</A>&nbsp;that say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:11">30:11</A>&nbsp;get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:12">30:12</A>&nbsp;Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely thereon;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:13">30:13</A>&nbsp;therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly in an instant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:14">30:14</A>&nbsp;And he shall break it as a potter's vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing; so that there shall not be found among the pieces thereof a sherd wherewith to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:15">30:15</A>&nbsp;For thus said the Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength. And ye would not:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:16">30:16</A>&nbsp;but ye said, No, for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:17">30:17</A>&nbsp;One thousand [shall flee] at the threat of one; at the threat of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on a hill.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:18">30:18</A>&nbsp;And therefore will Jehovah wait, that he may be gracious unto you; and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for Jehovah is a God of justice; blessed are all they that wait for him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:19">30:19</A>&nbsp;For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem; thou shalt weep no more; he will surely be gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear, he will answer thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:20">30:20</A>&nbsp;And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be hidden anymore, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:21">30:21</A>&nbsp;and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it; when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:22">30:22</A>&nbsp;And ye shall defile the overlaying of thy graven images of silver, and the plating of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as an unclean thing; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:23">30:23</A>&nbsp;And he will give the rain for thy seed, wherewith thou shalt sow the ground; and bread of the increase of the ground, and it shall be fat and plenteous. In that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:24">30:24</A>&nbsp;the oxen likewise and the young asses that till the ground shall eat savory provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:25">30:25</A>&nbsp;And there shall be upon every lofty mountain, and upon every high hill, brooks [and] streams of waters, in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:26">30:26</A>&nbsp;Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that Jehovah bindeth up the hurt of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:27">30:27</A>&nbsp;Behold, the name of Jehovah cometh from far, burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is as a devouring fire;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:28">30:28</A>&nbsp;and his breath is as an overflowing stream, that reacheth even unto the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction: and a bridle that causeth to err [shall be] in the jaws of the peoples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:29">30:29</A>&nbsp;Ye shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come unto the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:30">30:30</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah will cause his glorious voice to be heard, and will show the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of [his] anger, and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast, and tempest, and hailstones.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:31">30:31</A>&nbsp;For through the voice of Jehovah shall the Assyrian be dismayed; with his rod will he smite [him].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:32">30:32</A>&nbsp;And every stroke of the appointed staff, which Jehovah shall lay upon him, shall be with [the sound of] tabrets and harps; and in battles with the brandishing [of his arm] will he fight with them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:33">30:33</A>&nbsp;For a Topheth is prepared of old; yea, for the king it is made ready; he hath made it deep and large; the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of Jehovah, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:1">31:1</A>&nbsp;Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, and rely on horses, and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very strong, but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek Jehovah!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:2">31:2</A>&nbsp;Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evil-doers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:3">31:3</A>&nbsp;Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit: and when Jehovah shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall stumble, and he that is helped shall fall, and they all shall be consumed together.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:4">31:4</A>&nbsp;For thus saith Jehovah unto me, As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey, if a multitude of shepherds be called forth against him, will not be dismayed at their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so will Jehovah of hosts come down to fight upon mount Zion, and upon the hill thereof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:5">31:5</A>&nbsp;As birds hovering, so will Jehovah of hosts protect Jerusalem; he will protect and deliver [it], he will pass over and preserve [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:6">31:6</A>&nbsp;Turn ye unto him from whom ye have deeply revolted, O children of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:7">31:7</A>&nbsp;For in that day they shall cast away every man his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:8">31:8</A>&nbsp;And the Assyrian shall fall by the sword, not of man; and the sword, not of men, shall devour him; and he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall become subject to taskwork.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:9">31:9</A>&nbsp;And his rock shall pass away by reason of terror, and his princes shall be dismayed at the ensign, saith Jehovah, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:1">32:1</A>&nbsp;Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in justice.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:2">32:2</A>&nbsp;And a man shall be as a hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest, as streams of water in a dry place, as the shade of a great rock in a weary land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:3">32:3</A>&nbsp;And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:4">32:4</A>&nbsp;And the heart of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:5">32:5</A>&nbsp;The fool shall be no more called noble, nor the churl said to be bountiful.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:6">32:6</A>&nbsp;For the fool will speak folly, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise profaneness, and to utter error against Jehovah, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and to cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:7">32:7</A>&nbsp;And the instruments of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the meek with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:8">32:8</A>&nbsp;But the noble deviseth noble things; and in noble things shall he continue.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:9">32:9</A>&nbsp;Rise up, ye women that are at ease, [and] hear my voice; ye careless daughters, give ear unto my speech.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:10">32:10</A>&nbsp;For days beyond a year shall ye be troubled, ye careless women; for the vintage shall fail, the ingathering shall not come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:11">32:11</A>&nbsp;Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones; strip you, and make you bare, and gird [sackcloth] upon your loins.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:12">32:12</A>&nbsp;They shall smite upon the breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:13">32:13</A>&nbsp;Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:14">32:14</A>&nbsp;For the palace shall be forsaken; the populous city shall be deserted; the hill and the watch-tower shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:15">32:15</A>&nbsp;until the Spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be esteemed as a forest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:16">32:16</A>&nbsp;Then justice shall dwell in the wilderness; and righteousness shall abide in the fruitful field.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:17">32:17</A>&nbsp;And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness and confidence for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:18">32:18</A>&nbsp;And my people shall abide in a peaceable habitation, and in safe dwellings, and in quiet resting-places.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:19">32:19</A>&nbsp;But it shall hail in the downfall of the forest; and the city shall be utterly laid low.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:20">32:20</A>&nbsp;Blessed are yet that sow beside all waters, that send forth the feet of the ox and the ass.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:1">33:1</A>&nbsp;Woe to thee that destroyest, and thou wast not destroyed; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee!

<p><A NAME="an_33:2">33:2</A>&nbsp;O Jehovah, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou our arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:3">33:3</A>&nbsp;At the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations are scattered.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_33:5">33:5</A>&nbsp;Jehovah is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with justice and righteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:6">33:6</A>&nbsp;And there shall be stability in thy times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge: the fear of Jehovah is thy treasure.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_33:16">33:16</A>&nbsp;He shall dwell on high; his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks; his bread shall be given [him]; his waters shall be sure.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_33:18">33:18</A>&nbsp;Thy heart shall muse on the terror: Where is he that counted, where is he that weighed [the tribute]? where is he that counted the towers?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:19">33:19</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not see the fierce people, a people of a deep speech that thou canst not comprehend, of a strange tongue that thou canst not understand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:20">33:20</A>&nbsp;Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tent that shall not be removed, the stakes whereof shall never be plucked up, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:21">33:21</A>&nbsp;But there Jehovah will be with us in majesty, a place of broad rivers and streams, wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_33:23">33:23</A>&nbsp;Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not strengthen the foot of their mast, they could not spread the sail: then was the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame took the prey.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:24">33:24</A>&nbsp;And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:1">34:1</A>&nbsp;Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye peoples: let the earth hear, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all things that come forth from it.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_34:5">34:5</A>&nbsp;For my sword hath drunk its fill in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:6">34:6</A>&nbsp;The sword of Jehovah is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for Jehovah hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_34:9">34:9</A>&nbsp;And the streams of [Edom] shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:10">34:10</A>&nbsp;It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever; from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:11">34:11</A>&nbsp;But the pelican and the porcupine shall possess it; and the owl and the raven shall dwell therein: and he will stretch over it the line of confusion, and the plummet of emptiness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:12">34:12</A>&nbsp;They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none shall be there; and all its princes shall be nothing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:13">34:13</A>&nbsp;And thorns shall come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles in the fortresses thereof; and it shall be a habitation of jackals, a court for ostriches.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:14">34:14</A>&nbsp;And the wild beasts of the desert shall meet with the wolves, and the wild goat shall cry to his fellow; yea, the night-monster shall settle there, and shall find her a place of rest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:15">34:15</A>&nbsp;There shall the dart-snake make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shade; yea, there shall the kites be gathered, every one with her mate.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:16">34:16</A>&nbsp;Seek ye out of the book of Jehovah, and read: no one of these shall be missing, none shall want her mate; for my mouth, it hath commanded, and his Spirit, it hath gathered them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:17">34:17</A>&nbsp;And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever; from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:1">35:1</A>&nbsp;The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:2">35:2</A>&nbsp;It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing; the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon: they shall see the glory of Jehovah, the excellency of our God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:3">35:3</A>&nbsp;Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:4">35:4</A>&nbsp;Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come [with] vengeance, [with] the recompense of God; he will come and save you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:5">35:5</A>&nbsp;Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:6">35:6</A>&nbsp;Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_35:8">35:8</A>&nbsp;And a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but is shall be for [the redeemed]: the wayfaring men, yea fools, shall not err [therein].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:9">35:9</A>&nbsp;No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast go up thereon; they shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk [there]:</p>

<p><A NAME="an_36:1">36:1</A>&nbsp;Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:2">36:2</A>&nbsp;And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:3">36:3</A>&nbsp;Then came forth unto him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:4">36:4</A>&nbsp;And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:5">36:5</A>&nbsp;I say, [thy] counsel and strength for the war are but vain words: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:6">36:6</A>&nbsp;Behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:7">36:7</A>&nbsp;But if thou say unto me, We trust in Jehovah our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:8">36:8</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:9">36:9</A>&nbsp;How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:10">36:10</A>&nbsp;And am I now come up without Jehovah against this land to destroy it? Jehovah said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:11">36:11</A>&nbsp;Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:12">36:12</A>&nbsp;But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? [hath he] not [sent me] to the men that sit upon the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:13">36:13</A>&nbsp;Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:14">36:14</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:15">36:15</A>&nbsp;neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us; this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:16">36:16</A>&nbsp;Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:17">36:17</A>&nbsp;until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:18">36:18</A>&nbsp;Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:19">36:19</A>&nbsp;Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:20">36:20</A>&nbsp;Who are they among all the gods of these countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:21">36:21</A>&nbsp;But they held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:22">36:22</A>&nbsp;Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:1">37:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:2">37:2</A>&nbsp;And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:3">37:3</A>&nbsp;And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:4">37:4</A>&nbsp;It may be Jehovah thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:5">37:5</A>&nbsp;So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:6">37:6</A>&nbsp;And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith Jehovah, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:7">37:7</A>&nbsp;Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear tidings, and shall return unto his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:8">37:8</A>&nbsp;So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:9">37:9</A>&nbsp;And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come out to fight against thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:10">37:10</A>&nbsp;Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:11">37:11</A>&nbsp;Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:12">37:12</A>&nbsp;Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:13">37:13</A>&nbsp;Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:14">37:14</A>&nbsp;And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:15">37:15</A>&nbsp;And Hezekiah prayed unto Jehovah, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:16">37:16</A>&nbsp;O Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, that sittest [above] the cherubim, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:17">37:17</A>&nbsp;Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to defy the living God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:18">37:18</A>&nbsp;Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries, and their land,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:19">37:19</A>&nbsp;and have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:20">37:20</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, O Jehovah our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art Jehovah, even thou only.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:21">37:21</A>&nbsp;Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:22">37:22</A>&nbsp;this is the word which Jehovah hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:23">37:23</A>&nbsp;Whom hast thou defied and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? [even] against the Holy One of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:24">37:24</A>&nbsp;By thy servants hast thou defied the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir-trees thereof; and I will enter into its farthest height, the forest of its fruitful field;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:25">37:25</A>&nbsp;I have digged and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:26">37:26</A>&nbsp;Hast thou not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that it should be thine to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:27">37:27</A>&nbsp;Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as a field [of grain] before it is grown up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:28">37:28</A>&nbsp;But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:29">37:29</A>&nbsp;Because of thy raging against me, and because thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:30">37:30</A>&nbsp;And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:31">37:31</A>&nbsp;And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:32">37:32</A>&nbsp;For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:33">37:33</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:34">37:34</A>&nbsp;By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:35">37:35</A>&nbsp;For I will defend this city to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:36">37:36</A>&nbsp;And the angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:37">37:37</A>&nbsp;So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:38">37:38</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:1">38:1</A>&nbsp;In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:2">38:2</A>&nbsp;Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto Jehovah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:3">38:3</A>&nbsp;and said, Remember now, O Jehovah, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:4">38:4</A>&nbsp;Then came the word of Jehovah to Isaiah, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:5">38:5</A>&nbsp;Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:6">38:6</A>&nbsp;And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:7">38:7</A>&nbsp;And this shall be the sign unto thee from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do this thing that he hath spoken:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:8">38:8</A>&nbsp;behold, I will cause the shadow on the steps, which is gone down on the dial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps. So the sun returned ten steps on the dial whereon it was gone down.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:9">38:9</A>&nbsp;The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:10">38:10</A>&nbsp;I said, In the noontide of my days I shall go into the gates of Sheol: I am deprived of the residue of my years.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:11">38:11</A>&nbsp;I said, I shall not see Jehovah, [even] Jehovah in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:12">38:12</A>&nbsp;My dwelling is removed, and is carried away from me as a shepherd's tent: I have rolled up, like a weaver, my life; he will cut me off from the loom: From day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:13">38:13</A>&nbsp;I quieted [myself] until morning; as a lion, so he breaketh all my bones: From day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:14">38:14</A>&nbsp;Like a swallow [or] a crane, so did I chatter; I did moan as a dove; mine eyes fail [with looking] upward: O Lord, I am oppressed, be thou my surety.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:15">38:15</A>&nbsp;What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:16">38:16</A>&nbsp;O Lord, by these things men live; And wholly therein is the life of my spirit: Wherefore recover thou me, and make me to live.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:17">38:17</A>&nbsp;Behold, [it was] for [my] peace [that] I had great bitterness: But thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption; For thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:18">38:18</A>&nbsp;For Sheol cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee: They that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:19">38:19</A>&nbsp;The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: The father to the children shall make known thy truth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:20">38:20</A>&nbsp;Jehovah is [ready] to save me: Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments All the days of our life in the house of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:21">38:21</A>&nbsp;Now Isaiah had said, Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he shall recover.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:22">38:22</A>&nbsp;Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of Jehovah?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:1">39:1</A>&nbsp;At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:2">39:2</A>&nbsp;And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:3">39:3</A>&nbsp;Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:4">39:4</A>&nbsp;Then said he, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:5">39:5</A>&nbsp;Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah of hosts:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:6">39:6</A>&nbsp;Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:7">39:7</A>&nbsp;And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:8">39:8</A>&nbsp;Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of Jehovah which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:1">40:1</A>&nbsp;Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:2">40:2</A>&nbsp;Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem; and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she hath received of Jehovah's hand double for all her sins.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:3">40:3</A>&nbsp;The voice of one that crieth, Prepare ye in the wilderness the way of Jehovah; make level in the desert a highway for our God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:4">40:4</A>&nbsp;Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the uneven shall be made level, and the rough places a plain:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:5">40:5</A>&nbsp;and the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:6">40:6</A>&nbsp;The voice of one saying, Cry. And one said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:7">40:7</A>&nbsp;The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, because the breath of Jehovah bloweth upon it; surely the people is grass.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:8">40:8</A>&nbsp;The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God shall stand forever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:9">40:9</A>&nbsp;O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion, get thee up on a high mountain; O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold, your God!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:10">40:10</A>&nbsp;Behold, the Lord Jehovah will come as a mighty one, and his arm will rule for him: Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:11">40:11</A>&nbsp;He will feed his flock like a shepherd, he will gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom, [and] will gently lead those that have their young.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:12">40:12</A>&nbsp;Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:13">40:13</A>&nbsp;Who hath directed the Spirit of Jehovah, or being his counsellor hath taught him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:14">40:14</A>&nbsp;With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:15">40:15</A>&nbsp;Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are accounted as the small dust of the balance: Behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:16">40:16</A>&nbsp;And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt-offering.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_45:5">45:5</A>&nbsp;I am Jehovah, and there is none else; besides me there is no God. I will gird thee, though thou hast not known me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:6">45:6</A>&nbsp;that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none besides me: I am Jehovah, and there is none else.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:7">45:7</A>&nbsp;I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil. I am Jehovah, that doeth all these things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:8">45:8</A>&nbsp;Distil, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, that it may bring forth salvation, and let it cause righteousness to spring up together; I, Jehovah, have created it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:9">45:9</A>&nbsp;Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! a potsherd among the potsherds of the earth! Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:10">45:10</A>&nbsp;Woe unto him that saith unto a father, What begettest thou? or to a woman, With what travailest thou?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:11">45:11</A>&nbsp;Thus saith Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: Ask me of the things that are to come; concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands, command ye me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:12">45:12</A>&nbsp;I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens; and all their host have I commanded.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:13">45:13</A>&nbsp;I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make straight all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let my exiles go free, not for price nor reward, saith Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:14">45:14</A>&nbsp;Thus saith Jehovah, The labor of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall go after thee, in chains they shall come over; and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, [saying], Surely God is in thee; and there is none else, there is no God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:15">45:15</A>&nbsp;Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:16">45:16</A>&nbsp;They shall be put to shame, yea, confounded, all of them; they shall go into confusion together that are makers of idols.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:17">45:17</A>&nbsp;[But] Israel shall be saved by Jehovah with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be put to shame nor confounded world without end.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:18">45:18</A>&nbsp;For thus saith Jehovah that created the heavens, the God that formed the earth and made it, that established it and created it not a waste, that formed it to be inhabited: I am Jehovah; and there is none else.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:19">45:19</A>&nbsp;I have not spoken in secret, in a place of the land of darkness; I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I, Jehovah, speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:20">45:20</A>&nbsp;Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:21">45:21</A>&nbsp;Declare ye, and bring [it] forth; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath showed this from ancient time? who hath declared it of old? have not I, Jehovah? and there is no God else besides me, a just God and a Saviour; there is none besides me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:22">45:22</A>&nbsp;Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:23">45:23</A>&nbsp;By myself have I sworn, the word is gone forth from my mouth [in] righteousness, and shall not return, that unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:24">45:24</A>&nbsp;Only in Jehovah, it is said of me, is righteousness and strength; even to him shall men come; and all they that were incensed against him shall be put to shame.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:25">45:25</A>&nbsp;In Jehovah shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:1">46:1</A>&nbsp;Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth; their idols are upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: the things that ye carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary [beast].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:2">46:2</A>&nbsp;They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:3">46:3</A>&nbsp;Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, that have been borne [by me] from their birth, that have been carried from the womb;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:4">46:4</A>&nbsp;and even to old age I am he, and even to hoar hairs will I carry [you]; I have made, and I will bear; yea, I will carry, and will deliver.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:5">46:5</A>&nbsp;To whom will ye like me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:6">46:6</A>&nbsp;Such as lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, they hire a goldsmith, and he maketh it a god; they fall down, yea, they worship.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:7">46:7</A>&nbsp;They bear it upon the shoulder, they carry it, and set it in its place, and it standeth, from its place shall it not remove: yea, one may cry unto it, yet can it not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:8">46:8</A>&nbsp;Remember this, and show yourselves men; bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:9">46:9</A>&nbsp;Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; [I am] God, and there is none like me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:10">46:10</A>&nbsp;declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not [yet] done; saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:11">46:11</A>&nbsp;calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country; yea, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed, I will also do it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:12">46:12</A>&nbsp;Hearken unto me, ye stout-hearted, that are far from righteousness:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_46:13">46:13</A>&nbsp;I bring near my righteousness, it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry; and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:1">47:1</A>&nbsp;Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:2">47:2</A>&nbsp;Take the millstones, and grind meal; remove thy veil, strip off the train, uncover the leg, pass through the rivers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:3">47:3</A>&nbsp;Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and will spare no man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:4">47:4</A>&nbsp;Our Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:5">47:5</A>&nbsp;Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for thou shalt no more be called The mistress of kingdoms.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:6">47:6</A>&nbsp;I was wroth with my people, I profaned mine inheritance, and gave them into thy hand: thou didst show them no mercy; upon the aged hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:7">47:7</A>&nbsp;And thou saidst, I shall be mistress for ever; so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end thereof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:8">47:8</A>&nbsp;Now therefore hear this, thou that art given to pleasures, that sittest securely, that sayest in thy heart, I am, and there is none else besides me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:9">47:9</A>&nbsp;but these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood; in their full measure shall they come upon thee, in the multitude of thy sorceries, and the great abundance of thine enchantments.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:10">47:10</A>&nbsp;For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness; thou hast said, None seeth me; thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee, and thou hast said in thy heart, I am, and there is none else besides me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:11">47:11</A>&nbsp;Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know the dawning thereof: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it away: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou knowest not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:12">47:12</A>&nbsp;Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast labored from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:13">47:13</A>&nbsp;Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels: let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from the things that shall come upon thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:14">47:14</A>&nbsp;Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: it shall not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire to sit before.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:15">47:15</A>&nbsp;Thus shall the things be unto thee wherein thou hast labored: they that have trafficked with thee from thy youth shall wander every one to his quarter; there shall be none to save thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:1">48:1</A>&nbsp;Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah; who swear by the name of Jehovah, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:2">48:2</A>&nbsp;(for they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; Jehovah of hosts is his name):</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:3">48:3</A>&nbsp;I have declared the former things from of old; yea, they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them: suddenly I did them, and they came to pass.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:4">48:4</A>&nbsp;Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:5">48:5</A>&nbsp;therefore I have declared it to thee from of old; before it came to pass I showed it thee; lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:6">48:6</A>&nbsp;Thou hast heard it; behold all this; and ye, will ye not declare it? I have showed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, which thou hast not known.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:7">48:7</A>&nbsp;They are created now, and not from of old; and before this day thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:8">48:8</A>&nbsp;Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from of old thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou didst deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:9">48:9</A>&nbsp;For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:10">48:10</A>&nbsp;Behold, I have refined thee, but not as silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:11">48:11</A>&nbsp;For mine own sake, for mine own sake, will I do it; for how should [my name] be profaned? and my glory will I not give to another.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:12">48:12</A>&nbsp;Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and Israel my called: I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:13">48:13</A>&nbsp;Yea, my hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spread out the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:14">48:14</A>&nbsp;Assemble yourselves, all ye, and hear; who among them hath declared these things? He whom Jehovah loveth shall perform his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm [shall be on] the Chaldeans.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:15">48:15</A>&nbsp;I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him; I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:16">48:16</A>&nbsp;Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; from the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord Jehovah hath sent me, and his Spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:17">48:17</A>&nbsp;Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am Jehovah thy God, who teacheth thee to profit, who leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:18">48:18</A>&nbsp;Oh that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:19">48:19</A>&nbsp;thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the grains thereof: his name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:20">48:20</A>&nbsp;Go ye forth from Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans; with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth: say ye, Jehovah hath redeemed his servant Jacob.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:21">48:21</A>&nbsp;And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:22">48:22</A>&nbsp;There is no peace, saith Jehovah, to the wicked.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:1">49:1</A>&nbsp;Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye peoples, from far: Jehovah hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:2">49:2</A>&nbsp;and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me: and he hath made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he kept me close:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:3">49:3</A>&nbsp;and he said unto me, Thou art my servant; Israel, in whom I will be glorified.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:4">49:4</A>&nbsp;But I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nought and vanity; yet surely the justice [due] to me is with Jehovah, and my recompense with my God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:5">49:5</A>&nbsp;And now saith Jehovah that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, and that Israel be gathered unto him (for I am honorable in the eyes of Jehovah, and my God is become my strength);</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:6">49:6</A>&nbsp;yea, he saith, It is too light a thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:7">49:7</A>&nbsp;Thus saith Jehovah, the Redeemer of Israel, [and] his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers: Kings shall see and arise; princes, and they shall worship; because of Jehovah that is faithful, [even] the Holy One of Israel, who hath chosen thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:8">49:8</A>&nbsp;Thus saith Jehovah, In an acceptable time have I answered thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee; and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to raise up the land, to make them inherit the desolate heritages:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:9">49:9</A>&nbsp;saying to them that are bound, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and on all bare heights shall be their pasture.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:10">49:10</A>&nbsp;They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them will lead them, even by springs of water will he guide them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:11">49:11</A>&nbsp;And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:12">49:12</A>&nbsp;Lo, these shall come from far; and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:13">49:13</A>&nbsp;Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for Jehovah hath comforted his people, and will have compassion upon his afflicted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:14">49:14</A>&nbsp;But Zion said, Jehovah hath forsaken me, and the Lord hath forgotten me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:15">49:15</A>&nbsp;Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, these may forget, yet will not I forget thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:16">49:16</A>&nbsp;Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:17">49:17</A>&nbsp;Thy children make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth from thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:18">49:18</A>&nbsp;Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith Jehovah, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all as with an ornament, and gird thyself with them, like a bride.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:19">49:19</A>&nbsp;For, as for thy waste and thy desolate places, and thy land that hath been destroyed, surely now shalt thou be too strait for the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:20">49:20</A>&nbsp;The children of thy bereavement shall yet say in thine ears, The place is too strait for me; give place to me that I may dwell.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:21">49:21</A>&nbsp;Then shalt thou say in thy heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have been bereaved of my children, and am solitary, an exile, and wandering to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where were they?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:22">49:22</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations, and set up my ensign to the peoples; and they shall bring thy sons in their bosom, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:23">49:23</A>&nbsp;And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their faces to the earth, and lick the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah; and they that wait for me shall not be put to shame.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:24">49:24</A>&nbsp;Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captives be delivered?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:25">49:25</A>&nbsp;But thus saith Jehovah, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered; for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:26">49:26</A>&nbsp;And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I, Jehovah, am thy Saviour, and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:1">50:1</A>&nbsp;Thus saith Jehovah, Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, wherewith I have put her away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities were ye sold, and for your transgressions was your mother put away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:2">50:2</A>&nbsp;Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stink, because there is no water, and die for thirst.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:3">50:3</A>&nbsp;I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:4">50:4</A>&nbsp;The Lord Jehovah hath given me the tongue of them that are taught, that I may know how to sustain with words him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as they that are taught.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:5">50:5</A>&nbsp;The Lord Jehovah hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away backward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:6">50:6</A>&nbsp;I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from shame and spitting.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:7">50:7</A>&nbsp;For the Lord Jehovah will help me; therefore have I not been confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:8">50:8</A>&nbsp;He is near that justifieth me; who will content with me? let us stand up together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:9">50:9</A>&nbsp;Behold, the Lord Jehovah will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? behold, all they shall wax old as a garment, the moth shall eat them up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:10">50:10</A>&nbsp;Who is among you that feareth Jehovah, that obeyeth the voice of his servant? he that walketh in darkness, and hath no light, let him trust in the name of Jehovah, and rely upon his God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:11">50:11</A>&nbsp;Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that gird yourselves about with firebrands; walk ye in the flame of your fire, and among the brands that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of my hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:1">51:1</A>&nbsp;Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek Jehovah: look unto the rock whence ye were hewn, and to the hold of the pit whence ye were digged.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:2">51:2</A>&nbsp;Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you; for when he was but one I called him, and I blessed him, and made him many.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:3">51:3</A>&nbsp;For Jehovah hath comforted Zion; he hath comforted all her waste places, and hath made her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of Jehovah; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:4">51:4</A>&nbsp;Attend unto me, O my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall go forth from me, and I will establish my justice for a light of the peoples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:5">51:5</A>&nbsp;My righteousness is near, my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the peoples; the isles shall wait for me, and on mine arm shall they trust.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:6">51:6</A>&nbsp;Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment; and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:7">51:7</A>&nbsp;Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye dismayed at their revilings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:8">51:8</A>&nbsp;For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool; but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation unto all generations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:9">51:9</A>&nbsp;Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of Jehovah; awake, as in the days of old, the generations of ancient times. Is it not thou that didst cut Rahab in pieces, that didst pierce the monster?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:10">51:10</A>&nbsp;Is it not thou that driedst up the sea, the waters of the great deep; that madest the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:11">51:11</A>&nbsp;And the ransomed of Jehovah shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain gladness and joy; [and] sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:12">51:12</A>&nbsp;I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou art afraid of man that shall die, and of the son of man that shall be made as grass;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:13">51:13</A>&nbsp;and hast forgotten Jehovah thy Maker, that stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and fearest continually all the day because of the fury of the oppressor, when he maketh ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:14">51:14</A>&nbsp;The captive exile shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not die [and go down] into the pit, neither shall his bread fail.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:15">51:15</A>&nbsp;For I am Jehovah thy God, who stirreth up the sea, so that the waves thereof roar: Jehovah of hosts is his name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:16">51:16</A>&nbsp;And I have put my words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:17">51:17</A>&nbsp;Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, that hast drunk at the hand of Jehovah the cup of his wrath; thou hast drunken the bowl of the cup of staggering, and drained it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:18">51:18</A>&nbsp;There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand among all the sons that she hath brought up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:19">51:19</A>&nbsp;These two things are befallen thee, who shall bemoan thee? desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword; how shall I comfort thee?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:20">51:20</A>&nbsp;Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net; they are full of the wrath of Jehovah, the rebuke of thy God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:21">51:21</A>&nbsp;Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but now with wine:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:22">51:22</A>&nbsp;Thus saith thy Lord Jehovah, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thy hand the cup of staggering, even the bowl of the cup of my wrath; thou shalt no more drink it again:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:23">51:23</A>&nbsp;and I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee, that have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over; and thou hast laid thy back as the ground, and as the street, to them that go over.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:1">52:1</A>&nbsp;Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:2">52:2</A>&nbsp;Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit [on thy throne], O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bonds of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:3">52:3</A>&nbsp;For thus saith Jehovah, Ye were sold for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:4">52:4</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the Lord Jehovah, My people went down at the first into Egypt to sojourn there: and the Assyrian hath oppressed them without cause.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:5">52:5</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, what do I here, saith Jehovah, seeing that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them do howl, saith Jehovah, and my name continually all the day is blasphemed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:6">52:6</A>&nbsp;Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore [they shall know] in that day that I am he that doth speak; behold, it is I.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:7">52:7</A>&nbsp;How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation, that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:8">52:8</A>&nbsp;The voice of thy watchmen! they lift up the voice, together do they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when Jehovah returneth to Zion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:9">52:9</A>&nbsp;Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem; for Jehovah hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:10">52:10</A>&nbsp;Jehovah hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:11">52:11</A>&nbsp;Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; cleanse yourselves, ye that bear the vessels of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:12">52:12</A>&nbsp;For ye shall not go out in haste, neither shall ye go by flight: for Jehovah will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rearward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:13">52:13</A>&nbsp;Behold, my servant shall deal wisely, he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:14">52:14</A>&nbsp;Like as many were astonished at thee (his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men),</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:15">52:15</A>&nbsp;so shall he sprinkle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they understand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:1">53:1</A>&nbsp;Who hath believed our message? and to whom hath the arm of Jehovah been revealed?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:2">53:2</A>&nbsp;For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:3">53:3</A>&nbsp;He was despised, and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and as one from whom men hide their face he was despised; and we esteemed him not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:4">53:4</A>&nbsp;Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:5">53:5</A>&nbsp;But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:6">53:6</A>&nbsp;All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and Jehovah hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:7">53:7</A>&nbsp;He was oppressed, yet when he was afflicted he opened not his mouth; as a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before its shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:8">53:8</A>&nbsp;By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who [among them] considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people to whom the stroke [was due]?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:9">53:9</A>&nbsp;And they made his grave with the wicked, and with a rich man in his death; although he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:10">53:10</A>&nbsp;Yet it pleased Jehovah to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see [his] seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:11">53:11</A>&nbsp;He shall see of the travail of his soul, [and] shall be satisfied: by the knowledge of himself shall my righteous servant justify many; and he shall bear their iniquities.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:12">53:12</A>&nbsp;Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out his soul unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors: yet he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:1">54:1</A>&nbsp;Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:2">54:2</A>&nbsp;Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations; spare not: lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:3">54:3</A>&nbsp;For thou shalt spread aboard on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall possess the nations, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:4">54:4</A>&nbsp;Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth; and the reproach of thy widowhood shalt thou remember no more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:5">54:5</A>&nbsp;For thy Maker is thy husband; Jehovah of hosts is his name: and the Holy One of Israel is thy Redeemer; the God of the whole earth shall he be called.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:6">54:6</A>&nbsp;For Jehovah hath called thee as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, even a wife of youth, when she is cast off, saith thy God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:7">54:7</A>&nbsp;For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:8">54:8</A>&nbsp;In overflowing wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting lovingkindness will I have mercy on thee, saith Jehovah thy Redeemer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:9">54:9</A>&nbsp;For this is [as] the waters of Noah unto me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I will not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:10">54:10</A>&nbsp;For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed; but my lovingkindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall my covenant of peace be removed, saith Jehovah that hath mercy on thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:11">54:11</A>&nbsp;O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will set thy stones in fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:12">54:12</A>&nbsp;And I will make thy pinnacles of rubies, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy border of precious stones.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:13">54:13</A>&nbsp;And all thy children shall be taught of Jehovah; and great shall be the peace of thy children.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:14">54:14</A>&nbsp;In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression, for thou shalt not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:15">54:15</A>&nbsp;Behold, they may gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall because of thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:16">54:16</A>&nbsp;Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the fire of coals, and bringeth forth a weapon for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:17">54:17</A>&nbsp;No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of Jehovah, and their righteousness which is of me, saith Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:1">55:1</A>&nbsp;Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:2">55:2</A>&nbsp;Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labor for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:3">55:3</A>&nbsp;Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear, and your soul shall live: and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:4">55:4</A>&nbsp;Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander to the peoples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:5">55:5</A>&nbsp;Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not; and a nation that knew not thee shall run unto thee, because of Jehovah thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:6">55:6</A>&nbsp;Seek ye Jehovah while he may be found; call ye upon him while he is near:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:7">55:7</A>&nbsp;let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto Jehovah, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:8">55:8</A>&nbsp;For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:9">55:9</A>&nbsp;For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:10">55:10</A>&nbsp;For as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, and giveth seed to the sower and bread to the eater;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:11">55:11</A>&nbsp;so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:12">55:12</A>&nbsp;For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing; and all the trees of the fields shall clap their hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:13">55:13</A>&nbsp;Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir-tree; and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle-tree: and it shall be to Jehovah for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:1">56:1</A>&nbsp;Thus saith Jehovah, Keep ye justice, and do righteousness; for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:2">56:2</A>&nbsp;Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that holdeth it fast; that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:3">56:3</A>&nbsp;Neither let the foreigner, that hath joined himself to Jehovah, speak, saying, Jehovah will surely separate me from his people; neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:4">56:4</A>&nbsp;For thus saith Jehovah of the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and hold fast my covenant:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:5">56:5</A>&nbsp;Unto them will I give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters; I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:6">56:6</A>&nbsp;Also the foreigners that join themselves to Jehovah, to minister unto him, and to love the name of Jehovah, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, and holdeth fast my covenant;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:7">56:7</A>&nbsp;even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:8">56:8</A>&nbsp;The Lord Jehovah, who gathereth the outcasts of Israel, saith, Yet will I gather [others] to him, besides his own that are gathered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:9">56:9</A>&nbsp;All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, [yea], all ye beasts in the forest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:10">56:10</A>&nbsp;His watchmen are blind, they are all without knowledge; they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:11">56:11</A>&nbsp;Yea, the dogs are greedy, they can never have enough; and these are shepherds that cannot understand: they have all turned to their own way, each one to his gain, from every quarter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:12">56:12</A>&nbsp;Come ye, [say they], I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to-morrow shall be as this day, [a day] great beyond measure.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:1">57:1</A>&nbsp;The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil [to come].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:2">57:2</A>&nbsp;He entereth into peace; they rest in their beds, each one that walketh in his uprightness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:3">57:3</A>&nbsp;But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the harlot.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:4">57:4</A>&nbsp;Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and put out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:5">57:5</A>&nbsp;ye that inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree; that slay the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:6">57:6</A>&nbsp;Among the smooth [stones] of the valley is thy portion; they, they are thy lot; even to them hast thou poured a drink-offering, thou hast offered an oblation. Shall I be appeased for these things?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:7">57:7</A>&nbsp;Upon a high and lofty mountain hast thou set thy bed; thither also wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:8">57:8</A>&nbsp;And behind the doors and the posts hast thou set up thy memorial: for thou hast uncovered [thyself] to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them: thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:9">57:9</A>&nbsp;And thou wentest to the king with oil, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thine ambassadors far off, and didst debase thyself even unto Sheol.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:10">57:10</A>&nbsp;Thou wast wearied with the length of thy way; yet saidst thou not, It is in vain: thou didst find a quickening of thy strength; therefore thou wast not faint.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:11">57:11</A>&nbsp;And of whom hast thou been afraid and in fear, that thou liest, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of long time, and thou fearest me not?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:12">57:12</A>&nbsp;I will declare thy righteousness; and as for thy works, they shall not profit thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:13">57:13</A>&nbsp;When thou criest, let them that thou hast gathered deliver thee; but the wind shall take them, a breath shall carry them all away: but he that taketh refuge in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:14">57:14</A>&nbsp;And he will say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:15">57:15</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:16">57:16</A>&nbsp;For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth; for the spirit would faint before me, and the souls that I have made.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:17">57:17</A>&nbsp;For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him; I hid [my face] and was wroth; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:18">57:18</A>&nbsp;I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:19">57:19</A>&nbsp;I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near, saith Jehovah; and I will heal him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:20">57:20</A>&nbsp;But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it cannot rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:21">57:21</A>&nbsp;There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:1">58:1</A>&nbsp;Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and declare unto my people their transgression, and to the house of Jacob their sins.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:2">58:2</A>&nbsp;Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways: as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near unto God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:3">58:3</A>&nbsp;Wherefore have we fasted, [say they], and thou seest not? [wherefore] have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find [your own] pleasure, and exact all your labors.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:4">58:4</A>&nbsp;Behold, ye fast for strife and contention, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye fast not this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:5">58:5</A>&nbsp;Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Jehovah?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:6">58:6</A>&nbsp;Is not this the fast that I have chosen: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:7">58:7</A>&nbsp;Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:8">58:8</A>&nbsp;Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy healing shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of Jehovah shall by thy rearward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:9">58:9</A>&nbsp;Then shalt thou call, and Jehovah will answer; thou shalt cry, and he will say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedly;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:10">58:10</A>&nbsp;and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul: then shall thy light rise in darkness, and thine obscurity be as the noonday;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:11">58:11</A>&nbsp;and Jehovah will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in dry places, and make strong thy bones; and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:12">58:12</A>&nbsp;And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places; thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:13">58:13</A>&nbsp;If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, [and] the holy of Jehovah honorable; and shalt honor it, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking [thine own] words:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:14">58:14</A>&nbsp;then shalt thou delight thyself in Jehovah; and I will make thee to ride upon the high places of the earth; and I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:1">59:1</A>&nbsp;Behold, Jehovah's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:2">59:2</A>&nbsp;but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, so that he will not hear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:3">59:3</A>&nbsp;For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue muttereth wickedness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:4">59:4</A>&nbsp;None sueth in righteousness, and none pleadeth in truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:5">59:5</A>&nbsp;They hatch adders' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth; and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:6">59:6</A>&nbsp;Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:7">59:7</A>&nbsp;Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation and destruction are in their paths.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:8">59:8</A>&nbsp;The way of peace they know not; and there is no justice in their goings: they have made them crooked paths; whosoever goeth therein doth not know peace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:9">59:9</A>&nbsp;Therefore is justice far from us, neither doth righteousness overtake us: we look for light, but, behold, darkness; for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:10">59:10</A>&nbsp;We grope for the wall like the blind; yea, we grope as they that have no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the twilight; among them that are lusty we are as dead men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:11">59:11</A>&nbsp;We roar all like bears, and moan sore like doves: we look for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:12">59:12</A>&nbsp;For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:13">59:13</A>&nbsp;transgressing and denying Jehovah, and turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:14">59:14</A>&nbsp;And justice is turned away backward, and righteousness standeth afar off; for truth is fallen in the street, and uprightness cannot enter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:15">59:15</A>&nbsp;Yea, truth is lacking; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey. And Jehovah saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:16">59:16</A>&nbsp;And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it upheld him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:17">59:17</A>&nbsp;And he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:18">59:18</A>&nbsp;According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompense.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:19">59:19</A>&nbsp;So shall they fear the name of Jehovah from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of Jehovah driveth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:20">59:20</A>&nbsp;And a Redeemer will come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:21">59:21</A>&nbsp;And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith Jehovah: my Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith Jehovah, from henceforth and for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:1">60:1</A>&nbsp;Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of Jehovah is risen upon thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:2">60:2</A>&nbsp;For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the peoples; but Jehovah will arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:3">60:3</A>&nbsp;And nations shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:4">60:4</A>&nbsp;Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: they all gather themselves together, they come to thee; thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be carried in the arms.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:5">60:5</A>&nbsp;Then thou shalt see and be radiant, and thy heart shall thrill and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be turned unto thee, the wealth of the nations shall come unto thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:6">60:6</A>&nbsp;The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall proclaim the praises of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:7">60:7</A>&nbsp;All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee; they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar; and I will glorify the house of my glory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:8">60:8</A>&nbsp;Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:9">60:9</A>&nbsp;Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, for the name of Jehovah thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:10">60:10</A>&nbsp;And foreigners shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favor have I had mercy on thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:11">60:11</A>&nbsp;Thy gates also shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the wealth of the nations, and their kings led captive.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:12">60:12</A>&nbsp;For that nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:13">60:13</A>&nbsp;The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir-tree, the pine, and the box-tree together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:14">60:14</A>&nbsp;And the sons of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee The city of Jehovah, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:15">60:15</A>&nbsp;Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man passed through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:16">60:16</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt also suck the milk of the nations, and shalt suck the breast of kings; and thou shalt know that I, Jehovah, am thy Saviour, and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:17">60:17</A>&nbsp;For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron. I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:18">60:18</A>&nbsp;Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, desolation nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:19">60:19</A>&nbsp;The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but Jehovah will be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:20">60:20</A>&nbsp;Thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself; for Jehovah will be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:21">60:21</A>&nbsp;Thy people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:22">60:22</A>&nbsp;The little one shall become a thousand, and the small one a strong nation; I, Jehovah, will hasten it in its time.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:1">61:1</A>&nbsp;The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me; because Jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening [of the prison] to them that are bound;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:2">61:2</A>&nbsp;to proclaim the year of Jehovah's favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:3">61:3</A>&nbsp;to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah, that he may be glorified.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:4">61:4</A>&nbsp;And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:5">61:5</A>&nbsp;And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vine-dressers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:6">61:6</A>&nbsp;But ye shall be named the priests of Jehovah; men shall call you the ministers of our God: ye shall eat the wealth of the nations, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:7">61:7</A>&nbsp;Instead of your shame [ye shall have] double; and instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess double; everlasting joy shall be unto them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:8">61:8</A>&nbsp;For I, Jehovah, love justice, I hate robbery with iniquity; and I will give them their recompense in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:9">61:9</A>&nbsp;And their seed shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples; all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which Jehovah hath blessed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:10">61:10</A>&nbsp;I will greatly rejoice in Jehovah, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with a garland, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:11">61:11</A>&nbsp;For as the earth bringeth forth its bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord Jehovah will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:1">62:1</A>&nbsp;For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until her righteousness go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a lamp that burneth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:2">62:2</A>&nbsp;And the nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory, and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah shall name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:3">62:3</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Jehovah, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:4">62:4</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah; for Jehovah delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:5">62:5</A>&nbsp;For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee; and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:6">62:6</A>&nbsp;I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem; they shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that are Jehovah's remembrancers, take ye no rest,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:7">62:7</A>&nbsp;and give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:8">62:8</A>&nbsp;Jehovah hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy grain to be food for thine enemies; and foreigners shall not drink thy new wine, for which thou hast labored:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:9">62:9</A>&nbsp;but they that have garnered it shall eat it, and praise Jehovah; and they that have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:10">62:10</A>&nbsp;Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up an ensign for the peoples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:11">62:11</A>&nbsp;Behold, Jehovah hath proclaimed unto the end of the earth, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:12">62:12</A>&nbsp;And they shall call them The holy people, The redeemed of Jehovah: and thou shalt be called Sought out, A city not forsaken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:1">63:1</A>&nbsp;Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, marching in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:2">63:2</A>&nbsp;Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winevat?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:3">63:3</A>&nbsp;I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples there was no man with me: yea, I trod them in mine anger, and trampled them in my wrath; and their lifeblood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all my raiment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:4">63:4</A>&nbsp;For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:5">63:5</A>&nbsp;And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my wrath, it upheld me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:6">63:6</A>&nbsp;And I trod down the peoples in mine anger, and made them drunk in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:7">63:7</A>&nbsp;I will make mention of the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah, [and] the praises of Jehovah, according to all that Jehovah hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:8">63:8</A>&nbsp;For he said, Surely, they are my people, children that will not deal falsely: so he was their Saviour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:9">63:9</A>&nbsp;In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:10">63:10</A>&nbsp;But they rebelled, and grieved his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, [and] himself fought against them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:11">63:11</A>&nbsp;Then he remembered the days of old, Moses [and] his people, [saying], Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit in the midst of them?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:12">63:12</A>&nbsp;that caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses? that divided the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:13">63:13</A>&nbsp;that led them through the depths, as a horse in the wilderness, so that they stumbled not?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:14">63:14</A>&nbsp;As the cattle that go down into the valley, the Spirit of Jehovah caused them to rest; so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:15">63:15</A>&nbsp;Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where are thy zeal and thy mighty acts? the yearning of thy heart and thy compassions are restrained toward me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:16">63:16</A>&nbsp;For thou art our Father, though Abraham knoweth us not, and Israel doth not acknowledge us: thou, O Jehovah, art our Father; our Redeemer from everlasting is thy name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:17">63:17</A>&nbsp;O Jehovah, why dost thou make us to err from thy ways, and hardenest our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:18">63:18</A>&nbsp;Thy holy people possessed [it] but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:19">63:19</A>&nbsp;We are become as they over whom thou never barest rule, as they that were not called by thy name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:1">64:1</A>&nbsp;Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might quake at thy presence,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:2">64:2</A>&nbsp;as when fire kindleth the brushwood, [and] the fire causeth the waters to boil; to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:3">64:3</A>&nbsp;When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains quaked at thy presence.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:4">64:4</A>&nbsp;For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen a God besides thee, who worketh for him that waiteth for him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:5">64:5</A>&nbsp;Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou wast wroth, and we sinned: in them [have we been] of long time; and shall we be saved?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:6">64:6</A>&nbsp;For we are all become as one that is unclean, and all our righteousnesses are as a polluted garment: and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:7">64:7</A>&nbsp;And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee; for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us by means of our iniquities.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:8">64:8</A>&nbsp;But now, O Jehovah, thou art our Father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:9">64:9</A>&nbsp;Be not wroth very sore, O Jehovah, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, look, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:10">64:10</A>&nbsp;Thy holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:11">64:11</A>&nbsp;Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant places are laid waste.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:12">64:12</A>&nbsp;Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O Jehovah? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:1">65:1</A>&nbsp;I am inquired of by them that asked not [for me]; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:2">65:2</A>&nbsp;I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, that walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:3">65:3</A>&nbsp;a people that provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense upon bricks;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:4">65:4</A>&nbsp;that sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places; that eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:5">65:5</A>&nbsp;that say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:6">65:6</A>&nbsp;Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, yea, I will recompense into their bosom,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:7">65:7</A>&nbsp;your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith Jehovah, that have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills; therefore will I first measure their work into their bosom.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:8">65:8</A>&nbsp;Thus saith Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sake, that I may not destroy them all.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:9">65:9</A>&nbsp;And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:10">65:10</A>&nbsp;And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:11">65:11</A>&nbsp;But ye that forsake Jehovah, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for Fortune, and that fill up mingled wine unto Destiny;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:12">65:12</A>&nbsp;I will destine you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but ye did that which was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delighted not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:13">65:13</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be put to shame;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:14">65:14</A>&nbsp;behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:15">65:15</A>&nbsp;And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen; and the Lord Jehovah will slay thee; and he will call his servants by another name:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:16">65:16</A>&nbsp;so that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:17">65:17</A>&nbsp;For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:18">65:18</A>&nbsp;But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:19">65:19</A>&nbsp;And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:20">65:20</A>&nbsp;There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days; for the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:21">65:21</A>&nbsp;And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:22">65:22</A>&nbsp;They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:23">65:23</A>&nbsp;They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:24">65:24</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:25">65:25</A>&nbsp;The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:1">66:1</A>&nbsp;Thus saith Jehovah, Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what manner of house will ye build unto me? and what place shall be my rest?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:2">66:2</A>&nbsp;For all these things hath my hand made, and [so] all these things came to be, saith Jehovah: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and that trembleth at my word.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:3">66:3</A>&nbsp;He that killeth an ox is as he that slayeth a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as he that breaketh a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, [as he that offereth] swine's blood; he that burneth frankincense, as he that blesseth an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:4">66:4</A>&nbsp;I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did that which was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delighted not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:5">66:5</A>&nbsp;Hear the word of Jehovah, ye that tremble at his word: Your brethren that hate you, that cast you out for my name's sake, have said, Let Jehovah be glorified, that we may see your joy; but it is they that shall be put to shame.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:6">66:6</A>&nbsp;A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of Jehovah that rendereth recompense to his enemies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:7">66:7</A>&nbsp;Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man-child.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:8">66:8</A>&nbsp;Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? shall a nation be brought forth at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:9">66:9</A>&nbsp;Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith Jehovah: shall I that cause to bring forth shut [the womb]? saith thy God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:10">66:10</A>&nbsp;Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn over her;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:11">66:11</A>&nbsp;that ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:12">66:12</A>&nbsp;For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream: and ye shall suck [thereof]; ye shall be borne upon the side, and shall be dandled upon the knees.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:13">66:13</A>&nbsp;As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:14">66:14</A>&nbsp;And ye shall see [it], and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass: and the hand of Jehovah shall be known toward his servants; and he will have indignation against his enemies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:15">66:15</A>&nbsp;For, behold, Jehovah will come with fire, and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind; to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:16">66:16</A>&nbsp;For by fire will Jehovah execute judgment, and by his sword, upon all flesh; and the slain of Jehovah shall be many.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:17">66:17</A>&nbsp;They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves [to go] unto the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, they shall come to an end together, saith Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:18">66:18</A>&nbsp;For I [know] their works and their thoughts: [the time] cometh, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and shall see my glory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:19">66:19</A>&nbsp;And I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:20">66:20</A>&nbsp;And they shall bring all your brethren out of all the nations for an oblation unto Jehovah, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith Jehovah, as the children of Israel bring their oblation in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:21">66:21</A>&nbsp;And of them also will I take for priests [and] for Levites, saith Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:22">66:22</A>&nbsp;For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith Jehovah, so shall your seed and your name remain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:23">66:23</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:24">66:24</A>&nbsp;And they shall go forth, and look upon the dead bodies of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh. </p>
