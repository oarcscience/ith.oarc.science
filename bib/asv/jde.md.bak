### American Standard Version: Jude

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and
brother of James, to them that are called, beloved in God the Father,
and kept for Jesus Christ:

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Mercy unto you and peace and love be
multiplied.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Beloved, while I was giving all diligence
to write unto you of our common salvation, I was constrained to write
unto you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once
for all delivered unto the saints.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> For there are certain men crept in privily,
\[even\] they who were of old written of beforehand unto this
condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into
lasciviousness, and denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Now I desire to put you in remembrance,
though ye know all things once for all, that the Lord, having saved a
people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed
not.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And angels that kept not their own
principality, but left their proper habitation, he hath kept in
everlasting bonds under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities
about them, having in like manner with these given themselves over to
fornication and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example,
suffering the punishment of eternal fire.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Yet in like manner these also in their
dreamings defile the flesh, and set at nought dominion, and rail at
dignities.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> But Michael the archangel, when contending
with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring
against him a railing judgment, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> But these rail at whatsoever things they
know not: and what they understand naturally, like the creatures without
reason, in these things are they destroyed.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> Woe unto them! For they went in the way
of Cain, and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire, and perished
in the gainsaying of Korah.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> These are they who are hidden rocks in
your love-feasts when they feast with you, shepherds that without fear
feed themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn
leaves without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Wild waves of the sea, foaming out their
own shame; wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness hath been
reserved forever.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> And to these also Enoch, the seventh from
Adam, prophesied, saying, Behold, the Lord came with ten thousands of
his holy ones,

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> to execute judgment upon all, and to
convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they
have ungodly wrought, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners
have spoken against him.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> These are murmurers, complainers, walking
after their lusts (and their mouth speaketh great swelling \[words\]),
showing respect of persons for the sake of advantage.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> But ye, beloved, remember ye the words
which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> That they said to you, In the last time
there shall be mockers, walking after their own ungodly lusts.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> These are they who make separations,
sensual, having not the Spirit.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> But ye, beloved, building up yourselves
on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> keep yourselves in the love of God,
looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> And on some have mercy, who are in doubt;

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> and some save, snatching them out of the
fire; and on some have mercy with fear; hating even the garment spotted
by the flesh.

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> Now unto him that is able to guard you
from stumbling, and to set you before the presence of his glory without
blemish in exceeding joy,

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> to the only God our Saviour, through
Jesus Christ our Lord, \[be\] glory, majesty, dominion and power, before
all time, and now, and for evermore. Amen.
