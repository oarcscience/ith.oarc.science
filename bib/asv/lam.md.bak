### American Standard Version: Lamentations

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> How doth the city sit solitary, that was
full of people! She is become as a widow, that was great among the
nations! She that was a princess among the provinces is become
tributary!

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> She weepeth sore in the night, and her
tears are on her cheeks; Among all her lovers she hath none to comfort
her: All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they are become
her enemies.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Judah is gone into captivity because of
affliction, and because of great servitude; She dwelleth among the
nations, she findeth no rest: All her persecutors overtook her within
the straits.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> The ways of Zion do mourn, because none
come to the solemn assembly; All her gates are desolate, her priests do
sigh: Her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Her adversaries are become the head, her
enemies prosper; For Jehovah hath afflicted her for the multitude of her
transgressions: Her young children are gone into captivity before the
adversary.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And from the daughter of Zion all her
majesty is departed: Her princes are become like harts that find no
pasture, And they are gone without strength before the pursuer.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> Jerusalem remembereth in the days of her
affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that were from
the days of old: When her people fell into the hand of the adversary,
and none did help her, The adversaries saw her, they did mock at her
desolations.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore
she is become as an unclean thing; All that honored her despise her,
because they have seen her nakedness: Yea, she sigheth, and turneth
backward.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Her filthiness was in her skirts; she
remembered not her latter end; Therefore is she come down wonderfully;
she hath no comforter: Behold, O Jehovah, my affliction; for the enemy
hath magnified himself.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> The adversary hath spread out his hand
upon all her pleasant things: For she hath seen that the nations are
entered into her sanctuary, Concerning whom thou didst command that they
should not enter into thine assembly.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> All her people sigh, they seek bread;
They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the soul: See,
O Jehovah, and behold; for I am become abject.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass
by? Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is
brought upon me, Wherewith Jehovah hath afflicted \[me\] in the day of
his fierce anger.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> From on high hath he sent fire into my
bones, and it prevaileth against them; He hath spread a net for my feet,
he hath turned me back: He hath made me desolate and faint all the day.

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> The yoke of my transgressions is bound by
his hand; They are knit together, they are come up upon my neck; he hath
made my strength to fail: The Lord hath delivered me into their hands,
against whom I am not able to stand.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> The Lord hath set at nought all my mighty
men in the midst of me; He hath called a solemn assembly against me to
crush my young men: The Lord hath trodden as in a winepress the virgin
daughter of Judah.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> For these things I weep; mine eye, mine
eye runneth down with water; Because the comforter that should refresh
my soul is far from me: My children are desolate, because the enemy hath
prevailed.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> Zion spreadeth forth her hands; there is
none to comfort her; Jehovah hath commanded concerning Jacob, that they
that are round about him should be his adversaries: Jerusalem is among
them as an unclean thing.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> Jehovah is righteous; for I have rebelled
against his commandment: Hear, I pray you, all ye peoples, and behold my
sorrow: My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> I called for my lovers, \[but\] they
deceived me: My priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city,
While they sought them food to refresh their souls.

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> Behold, O Jehovah; for I am in distress;
my heart is troubled; My heart is turned within me; for I have
grievously rebelled: Abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as
death.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> They have heard that I sigh; there is
none to comfort me; All mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are
glad that thou hast done it: Thou wilt bring the day that thou hast
proclaimed, and they shall be like unto me.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> Let all their wickedness come before
thee; And do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my
transgressions: For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> How hath the Lord covered the daughter of
Zion with a cloud in his anger! He hath cast down from heaven unto the
earth the beauty of Israel, And hath not remembered his footstool in the
day of his anger.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> The Lord hath swallowed up all the
habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: He hath thrown down in his
wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah; He hath brought them
down to the ground; he hath profaned the kingdom and the princes
thereof.

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> He hath cut off in fierce anger all the
horn of Israel; He hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy:
And he hath burned up Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round
about.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> He hath bent his bow like an enemy, he hath
stood with his right hand as an adversary, And hath slain all that were
pleasant to the eye: In the tent of the daughter of Zion he hath poured
out his wrath like fire.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> The Lord is become as an enemy, he hath
swallowed up Israel; He hath swallowed up all her palaces, he hath
destroyed his strongholds; And he hath multiplied in the daughter of
Judah mourning and lamentation.

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> And he hath violently taken away his
tabernacle, as if it were of a garden; he hath destroyed his place of
assembly: Jehovah hath caused solemn assembly and sabbath to be
forgotten in Zion, And hath despised in the indignation of his anger the
king and the priest.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath
abhorred his sanctuary; He hath given up into the hand of the enemy the
walls of her palaces: They have made a noise in the house of Jehovah, as
in the day of a solemn assembly.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Jehovah hath purposed to destroy the wall
of the daughter of Zion; He hath stretched out the line, he hath not
withdrawn his hand from destroying; And he hath made the rampart and
wall to lament; they languish together.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath
destroyed and broken her bars: Her king and her princes are among the
nations where the law is not; Yea, her prophets find no vision from
Jehovah.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> The elders of the daughter of Zion sit
upon the ground, they keep silence; They have cast up dust upon their
heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: The virgins of
Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Mine eyes do fail with tears, my heart is
troubled; My liver is poured upon the earth, because of the destruction
of the daughter of my people, Because the young children and the
sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> They say to their mothers, Where is grain
and wine? When they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city,
When their soul is poured out into their mothers' bosom.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> What shall I testify unto thee? what
shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I compare to
thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? For thy breach
is great like the sea: who can heal thee?

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> Thy prophets have seen for thee false and
foolish visions; And they have not uncovered thine iniquity, to bring
back thy captivity, But have seen for thee false oracles and causes of
banishment.

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> All that pass by clap their hands at
thee; They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem,
\[saying\], Is this the city that men called The perfection of beauty,
The joy of the whole earth?

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> All thine enemies have opened their mouth
wide against thee; They hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, We have
swallowed her up; Certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have
found, we have seen it.

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> Jehovah hath done that which he purposed;
he hath fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old; He hath
thrown down, and hath not pitied: And he hath caused the enemy to
rejoice over thee; he hath exalted the horn of thine adversaries.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> Their heart cried unto the Lord: O wall
of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night;
Give thyself no respite; let not the apple of thine eye cease.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> Arise, cry out in the night, at the
beginning of the watches; Pour out thy heart like water before the face
of the Lord: Lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young
children, that faint for hunger at the head of every street.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> See, O Jehovah, and behold to whom thou
hast done thus! Shall the women eat their fruit, the children that are
dandled in the hands? Shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the
sanctuary of the Lord?

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> The youth and the old man lie on the
ground in the streets; My virgins and my young men are fallen by the
sword: Thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast
slaughtered, \[and\] not pitied.

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> Thou hast called, as in the day of a
solemn assembly, my terrors on every side; And there was none that
escaped or remained in the day of Jehovah's anger: Those that I have
dandled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> I am the man that hath seen affliction by
the rod of his wrath.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> He hath led me and caused me to walk in
darkness, and not in light.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Surely against me he turneth his hand again
and again all the day.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he
hath broken my bones.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> He hath builded against me, and compassed
me with gall and travail.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as
those that have been long dead.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> He hath walled me about, that I cannot go
forth; he hath made my chain heavy.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Yea, when I cry, and call for help, he
shutteth out my prayer.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> He hath walled up my ways with hewn stone;
he hath made my paths crooked.

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> He is unto me as a bear lying in wait, as
a lion in secret places.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled
me in pieces; he hath made me desolate.

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> He hath bent his bow, and set me as a
mark for the arrow.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> He hath caused the shafts of his quiver
to enter into my reins.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> I am become a derision to all my people,
and their song all the day.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> He hath filled me with bitterness, he
hath sated me with wormwood.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> He hath also broken my teeth with gravel
stones; he hath covered me with ashes.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> And thou hast removed my soul far off
from peace; I forgat prosperity.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> And I said, My strength is perished, and
mine expectation from Jehovah.

<span id="an_3:19">3:19</span> Remember mine affliction and my misery,
the wormwood and the gall.

<span id="an_3:20">3:20</span> My soul hath them still in remembrance,
and is bowed down within me.

<span id="an_3:21">3:21</span> This I recall to my mind; therefore have
I hope.

<span id="an_3:22">3:22</span> \[It is of\] Jehovah's lovingkindnesses
that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.

<span id="an_3:23">3:23</span> They are new every morning; great is thy
faithfulness.

<span id="an_3:24">3:24</span> Jehovah is my portion, saith my soul;
therefore will I hope in him.

<span id="an_3:25">3:25</span> Jehovah is good unto them that wait for
him, to the soul that seeketh him.

<span id="an_3:26">3:26</span> It is good that a man should hope and
quietly wait for the salvation of Jehovah.

<span id="an_3:27">3:27</span> It is good for a man that he bear the
yoke in his youth.

<span id="an_3:28">3:28</span> Let him sit alone and keep silence,
because he hath laid it upon him.

<span id="an_3:29">3:29</span> Let him put his mouth in the dust, if so
be there may be hope.

<span id="an_3:30">3:30</span> Let him give his cheek to him that
smiteth him; let him be filled full with reproach.

<span id="an_3:31">3:31</span> For the Lord will not cast off for ever.

<span id="an_3:32">3:32</span> For though he cause grief, yet will he
have compassion according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.

<span id="an_3:33">3:33</span> For he doth not afflict willingly, nor
grieve the children of men.

<span id="an_3:34">3:34</span> To crush under foot all the prisoners of
the earth,

<span id="an_3:35">3:35</span> To turn aside the right of a man before
the face of the Most High,

<span id="an_3:36">3:36</span> To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord
approveth not.

<span id="an_3:37">3:37</span> Who is he that saith, and it cometh to
pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?

<span id="an_3:38">3:38</span> Out of the mouth of the Most High cometh
there not evil and good?

<span id="an_3:39">3:39</span> Wherefore doth a living man complain, a
man for the punishment of his sins?

<span id="an_3:40">3:40</span> Let us search and try our ways, and turn
again to Jehovah.

<span id="an_3:41">3:41</span> Let us lift up our heart with our hands
unto God in the heavens.

<span id="an_3:42">3:42</span> We have transgressed and have rebelled;
thou hast not pardoned.

<span id="an_3:43">3:43</span> Thou hast covered with anger and pursued
us; thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.

<span id="an_3:44">3:44</span> Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud,
so that no prayer can pass through.

<span id="an_3:45">3:45</span> Thou hast made us an off-scouring and
refuse in the midst of the peoples.

<span id="an_3:46">3:46</span> All our enemies have opened their mouth
wide against us.

<span id="an_3:47">3:47</span> Fear and the pit are come upon us,
devastation and destruction.

<span id="an_3:48">3:48</span> Mine eye runneth down with streams of
water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.

<span id="an_3:49">3:49</span> Mine eye poureth down, and ceaseth not,
without any intermission,

<span id="an_3:50">3:50</span> Till Jehovah look down, and behold from
heaven.

<span id="an_3:51">3:51</span> Mine eye affecteth my soul, because of
all the daughters of my city.

<span id="an_3:52">3:52</span> They have chased me sore like a bird,
they that are mine enemies without cause.

<span id="an_3:53">3:53</span> They have cut off my life in the dungeon,
and have cast a stone upon me.

<span id="an_3:54">3:54</span> Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am
cut off.

<span id="an_3:55">3:55</span> I called upon thy name, O Jehovah, out of
the lowest dungeon.

<span id="an_3:56">3:56</span> Thou heardest my voice; hide not thine
ear at my breathing, at my cry.

<span id="an_3:57">3:57</span> Thou drewest near in the day that I
called upon thee; thou saidst, Fear not.

<span id="an_3:58">3:58</span> O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of
my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.

<span id="an_3:59">3:59</span> O Jehovah, thou hast seen my wrong; judge
thou my cause.

<span id="an_3:60">3:60</span> Thou hast seen all their vengeance and
all their devices against me.

<span id="an_3:61">3:61</span> Thou hast heard their reproach, O
Jehovah, and all their devices against me,

<span id="an_3:62">3:62</span> The lips of those that rose up against
me, and their device against me all the day.

<span id="an_3:63">3:63</span> Behold thou their sitting down, and their
rising up; I am their song.

<span id="an_3:64">3:64</span> Thou wilt render unto them a recompense,
O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands.

<span id="an_3:65">3:65</span> Thou wilt give them hardness of heart,
thy curse unto them.

<span id="an_3:66">3:66</span> Thou wilt pursue them in anger, and
destroy them from under the heavens of Jehovah.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> How is the gold become dim! \[how\] is the
most pure gold changed! The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at
the head of every street.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> The precious sons of Zion, comparable to
fine gold, How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the
hands of the potter!

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> Even the jackals draw out the breast, they
give suck to their young ones: The daughter of my people is become
cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to
the roof of his mouth for thirst: The young children ask bread, and no
man breaketh it unto them.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> They that did feed delicately are desolate
in the streets: They that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> For the iniquity of the daughter of my
people is greater than the sin of Sodom, That was overthrown as in a
moment, and no hands were laid upon her.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> Her nobles were purer than snow, they were
whiter than milk; They were more ruddy in body than rubies, their
polishing was as of sapphire.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> Their visage is blacker than a coal; they
are not known in the streets: Their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is
withered, it is become like a stick.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> They that are slain with the sword are
better than they that are slain with hunger; For these pine away,
stricken through, for want of the fruits of the field.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> The hands of the pitiful women have
boiled their own children; They were their food in the destruction of
the daughter of my people.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> Jehovah hath accomplished his wrath, he
hath poured out his fierce anger; And he hath kindled a fire in Zion,
which hath devoured the foundations thereof.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> The kings of the earth believed not,
neither all the inhabitants of the world, That the adversary and the
enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> \[It is\] because of the sins of her
prophets, \[and\] the iniquities of her priests, That have shed the
blood of the just in the midst of her.

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> They wander as blind men in the streets,
they are polluted with blood, So that men cannot touch their garments.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> Depart ye, they cried unto them, Unclean!
depart, depart, touch not! When they fled away and wandered, men said
among the nations, They shall no more sojourn \[here\].

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> The anger of Jehovah hath scattered them;
he will no more regard them: They respected not the persons of the
priests, they favored not the elders.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> Our eyes do yet fail \[in looking\] for
our vain help: In our watching we have watched for a nation that could
not save.

<span id="an_4:18">4:18</span> They hunt our steps, so that we cannot go
in our streets: Our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is
come.

<span id="an_4:19">4:19</span> Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles
of the heavens: They chased us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us
in the wilderness.

<span id="an_4:20">4:20</span> The breath of our nostrils, the anointed
of Jehovah, was taken in their pits; Of whom we said, Under his shadow
we shall live among the nations.

<span id="an_4:21">4:21</span> Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom,
that dwellest in the land of Uz: The cup shall pass through unto thee
also; thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.

<span id="an_4:22">4:22</span> The punishment of thine iniquity is
accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into
captivity: He will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will
uncover thy sins.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Remember, O Jehovah, what is come upon us:
Behold, and see our reproach.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Our inheritance is turned unto strangers,
Our houses unto aliens.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> We are orphans and fatherless; Our mothers
are as widows.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> We have drunken our water for money; Our
wood is sold unto us.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> Our pursuers are upon our necks: We are
weary, and have no rest.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> We have given the hand to the Egyptians,
And to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> Our fathers sinned, and are not; And we
have borne their iniquities.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> Servants rule over us: There is none to
deliver us out of their hand.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> We get our bread at the peril of our lives,
Because of the sword of the wilderness.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> Our skin is black like an oven, Because
of the burning heat of famine.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> They ravished the women in Zion, The
virgins in the cities of Judah.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> Princes were hanged up by their hand: The
faces of elders were not honored.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> The young men bare the mill; And the
children stumbled under the wood.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> The elders have ceased from the gate, The
young men from their music.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> The joy of our heart is ceased; Our dance
is turned into mourning.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> The crown is fallen from our head: Woe
unto us! for we have sinned.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> For this our heart is faint; For these
things our eyes are dim;

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> For the mountain of Zion, which is
desolate: The foxes walk upon it.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> Thou, O Jehovah, abidest for ever; Thy
throne is from generation to generation.

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever,
\[And\] forsake us so long time?

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> Turn thou us unto thee, O Jehovah, and we
shall be turned; Renew our days as of old.

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> But thou hast utterly rejected us; Thou
art very wroth against us.
