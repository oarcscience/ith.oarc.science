### American Standard Version: Psalms

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> Blessed is the man that walketh not in the
counsel of the wicked, Nor standeth in the way of sinners, Nor sitteth
in the seat of scoffers:

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> But his delight is in the law of Jehovah;
And on his law doth he meditate day and night.

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> And he shall be like a tree planted by the
streams of water, That bringeth forth its fruit in its season, Whose
leaf also doth not wither; And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> The wicked are not so, But are like the
chaff which the wind driveth away.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the
judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> For Jehovah knoweth the way of the
righteous; But the way of the wicked shall perish.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> Why do the nations rage, And the peoples
meditate a vain thing?

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> The kings of the earth set themselves, And
the rulers take counsel together, Against Jehovah, and against his
anointed, \[saying\],

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> Let us break their bonds asunder, And cast
away their cords from us.

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh:
The Lord will have them in derision.

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Then will he speak unto them in his wrath,
And vex them in his sore displeasure:

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> Yet I have set my king Upon my holy hill of
Zion.

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> I will tell of the decree: Jehovah said
unto me, Thou art my son; This day have I begotten thee.

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Ask of me, and I will give \[thee\] the
nations for thine inheritance, And the uttermost parts of the earth for
thy possession.

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron;
Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> Now therefore be wise, O ye kings: Be
instructed, ye judges of the earth.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> Serve Jehovah with fear, And rejoice with
trembling.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye
perish in the way, For his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all
they that take refuge in him.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom
his son. Jehovah, how are mine adversaries increased! Many are they that
rise up against me.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> Many there are that say of my soul, There
is no help for him in God. Selah

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> But thou, O Jehovah, art a shield about me;
My glory and the lifter up of my head.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> I cry unto Jehovah with my voice, And he
answereth me out of his holy hill. Selah

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for
Jehovah sustaineth me.

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> I will not be afraid of ten thousands of
the people That have set themselves against me round about.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> Arise, O Jehovah; save me, O my God: For
thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; Thou hast broken
the teeth of the wicked.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah: Thy
blessing be upon thy people. Selah

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> For the Chief Musician; on stringed
instruments. A Psalm of David. Answer me when I call, O God of my
righteousness; Thou hast set me at large \[when I was\] in distress:
Have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory
be turned into dishonor? \[How long\] will ye love vanity, and seek
after falsehood? Selah

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> But know that Jehovah hath set apart for
himself him that is godly: Jehovah will hear when I call unto him.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Stand in awe, and sin not: Commune with
your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And
put your trust in Jehovah.

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> Many there are that say, Who will show us
\[any\] good? Jehovah, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon
us.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> Thou hast put gladness in my heart, More
than \[they have\] when their grain and their new wine are increased.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> In peace will I both lay me down and sleep;
For thou, Jehovah, alone makest me dwell in safety.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> For the Chief Musician; with the Nehiloth.
A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O Jehovah, Consider my
meditation.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King,
and my God; For unto thee do I pray.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> O Jehovah, in the morning shalt thou hear
my voice; In the morning will I order \[my prayer\] unto thee, and will
keep watch.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> For thou art not a God that hath pleasure
in wickedness: Evil shall not sojourn with thee.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> The arrogant shall not stand in thy sight:
Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> Thou wilt destroy them that speak lies:
Jehovah abhorreth the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> But as for me, in the abundance of thy
lovingkindness will I come into thy house: In thy fear will I worship
toward thy holy temple.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> Lead me, O Jehovah, in thy righteousness
because of mine enemies; Make thy way straight before my face.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> For there is no faithfulness in their
mouth; Their inward part is very wickedness; Their throat is an open
sepulchre; They flatter with their tongue.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> Hold them guilty, O God; Let them fall by
their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their
transgressions; For they have rebelled against thee.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> But let all those that take refuge in
thee rejoice, Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them:
Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> For thou wilt bless the righteous; O
Jehovah, thou wilt compass him with favor as with a shield.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> For the Chief Musician; on stringed
instruments, set to the Sheminith. A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, rebuke
me not in thine anger, Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.

<span id="an_6:2">6:2</span> Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; for I am
withered away: O Jehovah, heal me; for my bones are troubled.

<span id="an_6:3">6:3</span> My soul also is sore troubled: And thou, O
Jehovah, how long?

<span id="an_6:4">6:4</span> Return, O Jehovah, deliver my soul: Save me
for thy lovingkindness' sake.

<span id="an_6:5">6:5</span> For in death there is no remembrance of
thee: In Sheol who shall give thee thanks?

<span id="an_6:6">6:6</span> I am weary with my groaning; Every night
make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.

<span id="an_6:7">6:7</span> Mine eye wasteth away because of grief; It
waxeth old because of all mine adversaries.

<span id="an_6:8">6:8</span> Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity;
For Jehovah hath heard the voice of my weeping.

<span id="an_6:9">6:9</span> Jehovah hath heard my supplication; Jehovah
will receive my prayer.

<span id="an_6:10">6:10</span> All mine enemies shall be put to shame
and sore troubled: They shall turn back, they shall be put to shame
suddenly.

<span id="an_7:1">7:1</span> Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto
Jehova, concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite. O Jehovah my God, in
thee do I take refuge: Save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver
me,

<span id="an_7:2">7:2</span> Lest they tear my soul like a lion, Rending
it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.

<span id="an_7:3">7:3</span> O Jehovah my God, if I have done this; If
there be iniquity in my hands;

<span id="an_7:4">7:4</span> If I have rewarded evil unto him that was
at peace with me; (Yea, I have delivered him that without cause was mine
adversary;)

<span id="an_7:5">7:5</span> Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake
it; Yea, let him tread my life down to the earth, And lay my glory in
the dust. Selah

<span id="an_7:6">7:6</span> Arise, O Jehovah, in thine anger; Lift up
thyself against the rage of mine adversaries, And awake for me; thou
hast commanded judgment.

<span id="an_7:7">7:7</span> And let the congregation of the peoples
compass thee about; And over them return thou on high.

<span id="an_7:8">7:8</span> Jehovah ministereth judgment to the
peoples: Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and to mine
integrity that is in me.

<span id="an_7:9">7:9</span> O let the wickedness of the wicked come to
an end, but establish thou the righteous: For the righteous God trieth
the minds and hearts.

<span id="an_7:10">7:10</span> My shield is with God, Who saveth the
upright in heart.

<span id="an_7:11">7:11</span> God is a righteous judge, Yea, a God that
hath indignation every day.

<span id="an_7:12">7:12</span> If a man turn not, he will whet his
sword; He hath bent his bow, and made it ready.

<span id="an_7:13">7:13</span> He hath also prepared for him the
instruments of death; He maketh his arrows fiery \[shafts\].

<span id="an_7:14">7:14</span> Behold, he travaileth with iniquity; Yea,
he hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.

<span id="an_7:15">7:15</span> He hath made a pit, and digged it, And is
fallen into the ditch which he made.

<span id="an_7:16">7:16</span> His mischief shall return upon his own
head, And his violence shall come down upon his own pate.

<span id="an_7:17">7:17</span> I will give thanks unto Jehovah according
to his righteousness, And will sing praise to the name of Jehovah Most
High.

<span id="an_8:1">8:1</span> For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith.
A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all
the earth, Who hast set thy glory upon the heavens!

<span id="an_8:2">8:2</span> Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings
hast thou established strength, Because of thine adversaries, That thou
mightest still the enemy and the avenger.

<span id="an_8:3">8:3</span> When I consider thy heavens, the work of
thy fingers, The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;

<span id="an_8:4">8:4</span> What is man, that thou art mindful of him?
And the son of man, that thou visitest him?

<span id="an_8:5">8:5</span> For thou hast made him but little lower
than God, And crownest him with glory and honor.

<span id="an_8:6">8:6</span> Thou makest him to have dominion over the
works of thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet:

<span id="an_8:7">8:7</span> All sheep and oxen, Yea, and the beasts of
the field,

<span id="an_8:8">8:8</span> The birds of the heavens, and the fish of
the sea, Whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.

<span id="an_8:9">8:9</span> O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy
name in all the earth!

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> For the Chief Musician; set to Muthlabben.
A Psalm of David. I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart; I
will show forth all thy marvellous works.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> I will be glad and exult in thee; I will
sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> When mine enemies turn back, They stumble
and perish at thy presence.

<span id="an_9:4">9:4</span> For thou hast maintained my right and my
cause; Thou sittest in the throne judging righteously.

<span id="an_9:5">9:5</span> Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast
destroyed the wicked; Thou hast blotted out their name for ever and
ever.

<span id="an_9:6">9:6</span> The enemy are come to an end, they are
desolate for ever; And the cities which thou hast overthrown, The very
remembrance of them is perished.

<span id="an_9:7">9:7</span> But Jehovah sitteth \[as king\] for ever:
He hath prepared his throne for judgment;

<span id="an_9:8">9:8</span> And he will judge the world in
righteousness, He will minister judgment to the peoples in uprightness.

<span id="an_9:9">9:9</span> Jehovah also will be a high tower for the
oppressed, A high tower in times of trouble;

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> And they that know thy name will put
their trust in thee; For thou, Jehovah, hast not forsaken them that seek
thee.

<span id="an_9:11">9:11</span> Sing praises to Jehovah, who dwelleth in
Zion: Declare among the people his doings.

<span id="an_9:12">9:12</span> For he that maketh inquisition for blood
remembereth them; He forgetteth not the cry of the poor.

<span id="an_9:13">9:13</span> Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; Behold my
affliction \[which I suffer\] of them that hate me, Thou that liftest me
up from the gates of death;

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> That I may show forth all thy praise. In
the gates of the daughter of Zion I will rejoice in thy salvation.

<span id="an_9:15">9:15</span> The nations are sunk down in the pit that
they made: In the net which they hid is their own foot taken.

<span id="an_9:16">9:16</span> Jehovah hath made himself known, he hath
executed judgment: The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands.
Higgaion. Selah

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> The wicked shall be turned back unto
Sheol, Even all the nations that forget God.

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> For the needy shall not alway be
forgotten, Nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> Arise, O Jehovah; let not man prevail:
Let the nations be judged in thy sight.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> Put them in fear, O Jehovah: Let the
nations know themselves to be but men. Selah

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> Why standest thou afar off, O Jehovah?
Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> In the pride of the wicked the poor is
hotly pursued; Let them be taken in the devices that they have
conceived.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> For the wicked boasteth of his heart's
desire, And the covetous renounceth, \[yea\], contemneth Jehovah.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> The wicked, in the pride of his
countenance, \[saith\], He will not require \[it\]. All his thoughts
are, There is no God.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> His ways are firm at all times; Thy
judgments are far above out of his sight: As for all his adversaries, he
puffeth at them.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> He saith in his heart, I shall not be
moved; To all generations I shall not be in adversity.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> His mouth is full of cursing and deceit
and oppression: Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> He sitteth in the lurking-places of the
villages; In the secret places doth he murder the innocent; His eyes are
privily set against the helpless.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> He lurketh in secret as a lion in his
covert; He lieth in wait to catch the poor: He doth catch the poor, when
he draweth him in his net.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> He croucheth, he boweth down, And the
helpless fall by his strong ones.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> He saith in his heart, God hath
forgotten; He hideth his face; he will never see it.

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> Arise, O Jehovah; O God, lift up thy
hand: Forget not the poor.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God,
And say in his heart, Thou wilt not require \[it\]?

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> Thou hast seen \[it\]; for thou
beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: The helpless
committeth \[himself\] unto thee; Thou hast been the helper of the
fatherless.

<span id="an_10:15">10:15</span> Break thou the arm of the wicked; And
as for the evil man, seek out his wickedness till thou find none.

<span id="an_10:16">10:16</span> Jehovah is King for ever and ever: The
nations are perished out of his land.

<span id="an_10:17">10:17</span> Jehovah, thou hast heard the desire of
the meek: Thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to
hear;

<span id="an_10:18">10:18</span> To judge the fatherless and the
oppressed, That man who is of the earth may be terrible no more.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> For the Chief Musician. \[A Psalm\] of
David. In Jehovah do I take refuge: How say ye to my soul, Flee \[as\] a
bird to your mountain;

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> For, lo, the wicked bend the bow, They
make ready their arrow upon the string, That they may shoot in darkness
at the upright in heart;

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> If the foundations be destroyed, What can
the righteous do?

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> Jehovah is in his holy temple; Jehovah,
his throne is in heaven; His eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children
of men.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> Jehovah trieth the righteous; But the
wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> Upon the wicked he will rain snares; Fire
and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> For Jehovah is righteous; he loveth
righteousness: The upright shall behold his face.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> For the Chief Musician; set to the
Sheminith. A Psalm of David. Help, Jehovah; for the godly man ceaseth;
For the faithful fail from among the children of men.

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> They speak falsehood every one with his
neighbor: With flattering lip, and with a double heart, do they speak.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> Jehovah will cut off all flattering lips,
The tongue that speaketh great things;

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> Who have said, With our tongue will we
prevail; Our lips are our own: who is lord over us?

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> Because of the oppression of the poor,
because of the sighing of the needy, Now will I arise, saith Jehovah; I
will set him in the safety he panteth for.

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> The words of Jehovah are pure words; As
silver tried in a furnace on the earth, Purified seven times.

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> Thou wilt keep them, O Jehovah, Thou wilt
preserve them from this generation for ever.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> The wicked walk on every side, When
vileness is exalted among the sons of men.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.
How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou forget me for ever? How long wilt thou
hide thy face from me?

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> How long shall I take counsel in my soul,
Having sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall mine enemy be
exalted over me?

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> Consider \[and\] answer me, O Jehovah my
God: Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the \[sleep of\] death;

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed
against him; \[Lest\] mine adversaries rejoice when I am moved.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> But I have trusted in thy lovingkindness;
My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> I will sing unto Jehovah, Because he hath
dealt bountifully with me.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> For the Chief Musician. \[A Psalm\] of
David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are
corrupt, they have done abominable works; There is none that doeth good.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> Jehovah looked down from heaven upon the
children of men, To see if there were any that did understand, That did
seek after God.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> They are all gone aside; they are
together become filthy; There is none that doeth good, no, not one.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> Have all the workers of iniquity no
knowledge, Who eat up my people \[as\] they eat bread, And call not upon
Jehovah?

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> There were they in great fear; For God is
in the generation of the righteous.

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> Ye put to shame the counsel of the poor,
Because Jehovah is his refuge.

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come
out of Zion! When Jehovah bringeth back the captivity of his people,
Then shall Jacob rejoice, \[and\] Israel shall be glad.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> A Psalm of David. Jehovah, who shall
sojourn in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill?

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> He that walketh uprightly, and worketh
righteousness, And speaketh truth in his heart;

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> He that slandereth not with his tongue,
Nor doeth evil to his friend, Nor taketh up a reproach against his
neighbor;

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> In whose eyes a reprobate is despised,
But who honoreth them that fear Jehovah; He that sweareth to his own
hurt, and changeth not;

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> He that putteth not out his money to
interest, Nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these
things shall never be moved.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> Michtam of David. Preserve me, O God; for
in thee do I take refuge.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> \[O my soul\], thou hast said unto
Jehovah, Thou art my Lord: I have no good beyond thee.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> As for the saints that are in the earth,
They are the excellent in whom is all my delight.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> Their sorrows shall be multiplied that
give gifts for another \[god\]: Their drink-offerings of blood will I
not offer, Nor take their names upon my lips.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> Jehovah is the portion of mine
inheritance and of my cup: Thou maintainest my lot.

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant
places; Yea, I have a goodly heritage.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> I will bless Jehovah, who hath given me
counsel; Yea, my heart instructeth me in the night seasons.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> I have set Jehovah always before me:
Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory
rejoiceth; My flesh also shall dwell in safety.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> For thou wilt not leave my soul to
Sheol; Neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> Thou wilt show me the path of life: In
thy presence is fulness of joy; In thy right hand there are pleasures
for evermore.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> A Prayer of David. Hear the right, O
Jehovah, attend unto my cry; Give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out
of feigned lips.

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> Let my sentence come forth from thy
presence; Let thine eyes look upon equity.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast
visited me in the night; Thou hast tried me, and findest nothing; I am
purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> As for the works of men, by the word of
thy lips I have kept me from the ways of the violent.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> My steps have held fast to thy paths, My
feet have not slipped.

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> I have called upon thee, for thou wilt
answer me, O God: Incline thine ear unto me, \[and\] hear my speech.

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> Show thy marvellous lovingkindness, O
thou that savest by thy right hand them that take refuge \[in thee
\]From those that rise up \[against them\].

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> Keep me as the apple of the eye; Hide me
under the shadow of thy wings,

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> From the wicked that oppress me, My
deadly enemies, that compass me about.

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> They are inclosed in their own fat:
With their mouth they speak proudly.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> They have now compassed us in our
steps; They set their eyes to cast \[us\] down to the earth.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> He is like a lion that is greedy of his
prey, And as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> Arise, O Jehovah, Confront him, cast
him down: Deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword;

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> From men by thy hand, O Jehovah, From
men of the world, whose portion is in \[this\] life, And whose belly
thou fillest with thy treasure: They are satisfied with children, And
leave the rest of their substance to their babes.

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> As for me, I shall behold thy face in
righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with \[beholding\]
thy form.

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> For the Chief Musician. \[A Psalm\] of
David the servant of Jehovah, who spake unto Jehovah the words of this
song in the day that Jehovah delivered him from the hand of all his
enemies, and from the hand of Saul: and he said, I love thee, O Jehovah,
my strength.

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and
my deliverer; My God, my rock, in whom I will take refuge; My shield,
and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy
to be praised: So shall I be saved from mine enemies.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> The cords of death compassed me, And the
floods of ungodliness made me afraid.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> The cords of Sheol were round about me;
The snares of death came upon me.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> In my distress I called upon Jehovah, And
cried unto my God: He heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry
before him came into his ears.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> Then the earth shook and trembled; The
foundations also of the mountains quaked And were shaken, because he was
wroth.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> There went up a smoke out of his
nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> He bowed the heavens also, and came down;
And thick darkness was under his feet.

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly;
Yea, he soared upon the wings of the wind.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> He made darkness his hiding-place, his
pavilion round about him, Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> At the brightness before him his thick
clouds passed, Hailstones and coals of fire.

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> Jehovah also thundered in the heavens,
And the Most High uttered his voice, Hailstones and coals of fire.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> And he sent out his arrows, and
scattered them; Yea, lightnings manifold, and discomfited them.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> Then the channels of waters appeared,
And the foundations of the world were laid bare, At thy rebuke, O
Jehovah, At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> He sent from on high, he took me; He
drew me out of many waters.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> He delivered me from my strong enemy,
And from them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me.

<span id="an_18:18">18:18</span> They came upon me in the day of my
calamity; But Jehovah was my stay.

<span id="an_18:19">18:19</span> He brought me forth also into a large
place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me.

<span id="an_18:20">18:20</span> Jehovah hath rewarded me according to
my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands hath he
recompensed me.

<span id="an_18:21">18:21</span> For I have kept the ways of Jehovah,
And have not wickedly departed from my God.

<span id="an_18:22">18:22</span> For all his ordinances were before me,
And I put not away his statutes from me.

<span id="an_18:23">18:23</span> I was also perfect with him, And I kept
myself from mine iniquity.

<span id="an_18:24">18:24</span> Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me
according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands in
his eyesight.

<span id="an_18:25">18:25</span> With the merciful thou wilt show
thyself merciful; With the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect;

<span id="an_18:26">18:26</span> With the pure thou wilt show thyself
pure; And with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward.

<span id="an_18:27">18:27</span> For thou wilt save the afflicted
people; But the haughty eyes thou wilt bring down.

<span id="an_18:28">18:28</span> For thou wilt light my lamp: Jehovah my
God will lighten my darkness.

<span id="an_18:29">18:29</span> For by thee I run upon a troop; And by
my God do I leap over a wall.

<span id="an_18:30">18:30</span> As for God, his way is perfect: The
word of Jehovah is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge
in him.

<span id="an_18:31">18:31</span> For who is God, save Jehovah? And who
is a rock, besides our God,

<span id="an_18:32">18:32</span> The God that girdeth me with strength,
And maketh my way perfect?

<span id="an_18:33">18:33</span> He maketh my feet like hinds' \[feet\]:
And setteth me upon my high places.

<span id="an_18:34">18:34</span> He teacheth my hands to war; So that
mine arms do bend a bow of brass.

<span id="an_18:35">18:35</span> Thou hast also given me the shield of
thy salvation; And thy right hand hath holden me up, And thy gentleness
hath made me great.

<span id="an_18:36">18:36</span> Thou hast enlarged my steps under me,
And my feet have not slipped.

<span id="an_18:37">18:37</span> I will pursue mine enemies, and
overtake them; Neither will I turn again till they are consumed.

<span id="an_18:38">18:38</span> I will smite them through, so that they
shall not be able to rise: They shall fall under my feet.

<span id="an_18:39">18:39</span> For thou hast girded me with strength
unto the battle: Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against
me.

<span id="an_18:40">18:40</span> Thou hast also made mine enemies turn
their backs unto me, That I might cut off them that hate me.

<span id="an_18:41">18:41</span> They cried, but there was none to save;
Even unto Jehovah, but he answered them not.

<span id="an_18:42">18:42</span> Then did I beat them small as the dust
before the wind; I did cast them out as the mire of the streets.

<span id="an_18:43">18:43</span> Thou hast delivered me from the
strivings of the people; Thou hast made me the head of the nations: A
people whom I have not known shall serve me.

<span id="an_18:44">18:44</span> As soon as they hear of me they shall
obey me; The foreigners shall submit themselves unto me.

<span id="an_18:45">18:45</span> The foreigners shall fade away, And
shall come trembling out of their close places.

<span id="an_18:46">18:46</span> Jehovah liveth; and blessed be my rock;
And exalted be the God of my salvation,

<span id="an_18:47">18:47</span> Even the God that executeth vengeance
for me, And subdueth peoples under me.

<span id="an_18:48">18:48</span> He rescueth me from mine enemies; Yea,
thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; Thou deliverest
me from the violent man.

<span id="an_18:49">18:49</span> Therefore I will give thanks unto thee,
O Jehovah, among the nations, And will sing praises unto thy name.

<span id="an_18:50">18:50</span> Great deliverance giveth he to his
king, And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed, To David and to his
seed, for evermore.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.
The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament showeth his
handiwork.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> Day unto day uttereth speech, And night
unto night showeth knowledge.

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> There is no speech nor language; Their
voice is not heard.

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> Their line is gone out through all the
earth, And their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a
tabernacle for the sun,

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> Which is as a bridegroom coming out of
his chamber, And rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course.

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> His going forth is from the end of the
heavens, And his circuit unto the ends of it; And there is nothing hid
from the heat thereof.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring
the soul: The testimony of Jehovah is sure, making wise the simple.

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> The precepts of Jehovah are right,
rejoicing the heart: The commandment of Jehovah is pure, enlightening
the eyes.

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> The fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring
for ever: The ordinances of Jehovah are true, \[and\] righteous
altogether.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> More to be desired are they than gold,
yea, than much fine gold; Sweeter also than honey and the droppings of
the honeycomb.

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> Moreover by them is thy servant warned:
In keeping them there is great reward.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> Who can discern \[his\] errors? Clear
thou me from hidden \[faults\].

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> Keep back thy servant also from
presumptuous \[sins\]; Let them not have dominion over me: Then shall I
be upright, And I shall be clear from great transgression.

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> Let the words of my mouth and the
meditation of my heart Be acceptable in thy sight, O Jehovah, my rock,
and my redeemer.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.
Jehovah answer thee in the day of trouble; The name of the God of Jacob
set thee up on high;

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> Send thee help from the sanctuary, And
strengthen thee out of Zion;

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> Remember all thy offerings, And accept
thy burnt-sacrifice; Selah

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> Grant thee thy heart's desire, And fulfil
all thy counsel.

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> We will triumph in thy salvation, And in
the name of our God we will set up our banners: Jehovah fulfil all thy
petitions.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> Now know I that Jehovah saveth his
anointed; He will answer him from his holy heaven With the saving
strength of his right hand.

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> Some \[trust\] in chariots, and some in
horses; But we will make mention of the name of Jehovah our God.

<span id="an_20:8">20:8</span> They are bowed down and fallen; But we
are risen, and stand upright.

<span id="an_20:9">20:9</span> Save, Jehovah: Let the King answer us
when we call.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.
The king shall joy in thy strength, O Jehovah; And in thy salvation how
greatly shall he rejoice!

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> Thou hast given him his heart's desire,
And hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> For thou meetest him with the blessings
of goodness: Thou settest a crown of fine gold on his head.

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> He asked life of thee, thou gavest it
him, Even length of days for ever and ever.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> His glory is great in thy salvation:
Honor and majesty dost thou lay upon him.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> For thou makest him most blessed for
ever: Thou makest him glad with joy in thy presence.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> For the king trusteth in Jehovah; And
through the lovingkindness of the Most High he shall not be moved.

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> Thy hand will find out all thine enemies;
Thy right hand will find out those that hate thee.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> Thou wilt make them as a fiery furnace in
the time of thine anger: Jehovah will swallow them up in his wrath, And
the fire shall devour them.

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> Their fruit wilt thou destroy from the
earth, And their seed from among the children of men.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> For they intended evil against thee;
They conceived a device which they are not able to perform.

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> For thou wilt make them turn their
back; Thou wilt make ready with thy bowstrings against their face.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> Be thou exalted, O Jehovah, in thy
strength: So will we sing and praise thy power.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> For the Chief Musician; set to Aijaleth
hash-Shahar. A Psalm of David. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
me? \[Why art thou so\] far from helping me, \[and from\] the words of
my groaning?

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou
answerest not; And in the night season, and am not silent.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest
the praises of Israel.

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> Our fathers trusted in thee: They
trusted, and thou didst deliver them.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> They cried unto thee, and were delivered:
They trusted in thee, and were not put to shame.

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> But I am a worm, and no man; A reproach
of men, and despised of the people.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> All they that see me laugh me to scorn:
They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, \[saying\],

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> Commit \[thyself\] unto Jehovah; Let him
deliver him: Let him rescue him, seeing he delighteth in him.

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> But thou art he that took me out of the
womb; Thou didst make me trust \[when I was\] upon my mother's breasts.

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> I was cast upon thee from the womb;
Thou art my God since my mother bare me.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> Be not far from me; for trouble is
near; For there is none to help.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> Many bulls have compassed me; Strong
bulls of Bashan have beset me round.

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> They gape upon me with their mouth,
\[As\] a ravening and a roaring lion.

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> I am poured out like water, And all my
bones are out of joint: My heart is like wax; It is melted within me.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> My strength is dried up like a
potsherd; And my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; And thou hast brought me
into the dust of death.

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> For dogs have compassed me: A company
of evil-doers have inclosed me; They pierced my hands and my feet.

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> I may count all my bones; They look and
stare upon me.

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> They part my garments among them, And
upon my vesture do they cast lots.

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> But be not thou far off, O Jehovah: O
thou my succor, haste thee to help me.

<span id="an_22:20">22:20</span> Deliver my soul from the sword, My
darling from the power of the dog.

<span id="an_22:21">22:21</span> Save me from the lion's mouth; Yea,
from the horns of the wild-oxen thou hast answered me.

<span id="an_22:22">22:22</span> I will declare thy name unto my
brethren: In the midst of the assembly will I praise thee.

<span id="an_22:23">22:23</span> Ye that fear Jehovah, praise him; All
ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; And stand in awe of him, all ye the
seed of Israel.

<span id="an_22:24">22:24</span> For he hath not despised nor abhorred
the affliction of the afflicted; Neither hath he hid his face from him;
But when he cried unto him, he heard.

<span id="an_22:25">22:25</span> Of thee cometh my praise in the great
assembly: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.

<span id="an_22:26">22:26</span> The meek shall eat and be satisfied;
They shall praise Jehovah that seek after him: Let your heart live for
ever.

<span id="an_22:27">22:27</span> All the ends of the earth shall
remember and turn unto Jehovah; And all the kindreds of the nations
shall worship before thee.

<span id="an_22:28">22:28</span> For the kingdom is Jehovah's; And he is
the ruler over the nations.

<span id="an_22:29">22:29</span> All the fat ones of the earth shall eat
and worship: All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him,
Even he that cannot keep his soul alive.

<span id="an_22:30">22:30</span> A seed shall serve him; It shall be
told of the Lord unto the \[next\] generation.

<span id="an_22:31">22:31</span> They shall come and shall declare his
righteousness Unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done it.

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> A Psalm of David. Jehovah is my shepherd;
I shall not want.

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> He maketh me to lie down in green
pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> He restoreth my soul: He guideth me in
the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> Yea, thou I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; Thy rod
and thy staff, they comfort me.

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> Thou preparest a table before me in the
presence of mine enemies: Thou hast anointed my head with oil; My cup
runneth over.

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> Surely goodness and lovingkindness shall
follow me all the days of my life; And I shall dwell in the house of
Jehovah for ever.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> A Psalm of David. The earth is Jehovah's,
and the fulness thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein.

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> For he hath founded it upon the seas, And
established it upon the floods.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> Who shall ascend into the hill of
Jehovah? And who shall stand in his holy place?

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> He that hath clean hands, and a pure
heart; Who hath not lifted up his soul unto falsehood, And hath not
sworn deceitfully.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> He shall receive a blessing from Jehovah,
And righteousness from the God of his salvation.

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> This is the generation of them that seek
after him, That seek thy face, \[even\] Jacob. Selah

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> Lift up your heads, O ye gates; And be ye
lifted up, ye everlasting doors: And the King of glory will come in.

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> Who is the King of glory? Jehovah strong
and mighty, Jehovah mighty in battle.

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> Lift up your heads, O ye gates; Yea, lift
them up, ye everlasting doors: And the King of glory will come in.

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> Who is this King of glory? Jehovah of
hosts, He is the King of glory. Selah

<span id="an_25:1">25:1</span> \[A Psalm\] of David. Unto thee, O
Jehovah, do I lift up my soul.

<span id="an_25:2">25:2</span> O my God, in thee have I trusted, Let me
not be put to shame; Let not mine enemies triumph over me.

<span id="an_25:3">25:3</span> Yea, none that wait for thee shall be put
to shame: They shall be put to shame that deal treacherously without
cause.

<span id="an_25:4">25:4</span> Show me thy ways, O Jehovah; Teach me thy
paths.

<span id="an_25:5">25:5</span> Guide me in thy truth, and teach me; For
thou art the God of my salvation; For thee do I wait all the day.

<span id="an_25:6">25:6</span> Remember, O Jehovah, thy tender mercies
and thy lovingkindness; For they have been ever of old.

<span id="an_25:7">25:7</span> Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my
transgressions: According to thy lovingkindness remember thou me, For
thy goodness' sake, O Jehovah.

<span id="an_25:8">25:8</span> Good and upright is Jehovah: Therefore
will he instruct sinners in the way.

<span id="an_25:9">25:9</span> The meek will he guide in justice; And
the meek will he teach his way.

<span id="an_25:10">25:10</span> All the paths of Jehovah are
lovingkindness and truth Unto such as keep his covenant and his
testimonies.

<span id="an_25:11">25:11</span> For thy name's sake, O Jehovah, Pardon
mine iniquity, for it is great.

<span id="an_25:12">25:12</span> What man is he that feareth Jehovah?
Him shall he instruct in the way that he shall choose.

<span id="an_25:13">25:13</span> His soul shall dwell at ease; And his
seed shall inherit the land.

<span id="an_25:14">25:14</span> The friendship of Jehovah is with them
that fear him; And he will show them his covenant.

<span id="an_25:15">25:15</span> Mine eyes are ever toward Jehovah; For
he will pluck my feet out of the net.

<span id="an_25:16">25:16</span> Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon
me; For I am desolate and afflicted.

<span id="an_25:17">25:17</span> The troubles of my heart are enlarged:
Oh bring thou me out of my distresses.

<span id="an_25:18">25:18</span> Consider mine affliction and my
travail; And forgive all my sins.

<span id="an_25:19">25:19</span> Consider mine enemies, for they are
many; And they hate me with cruel hatred.

<span id="an_25:20">25:20</span> Oh keep my soul, and deliver me: Let me
not be put to shame, for I take refuge in thee.

<span id="an_25:21">25:21</span> Let integrity and uprightness preserve
me, For I wait for thee.

<span id="an_25:22">25:22</span> Redeem Israel, O God, Out all of his
troubles.

<span id="an_26:1">26:1</span> \[A Psalm\] of David. Judge me, O
Jehovah, for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in
Jehovah without wavering.

<span id="an_26:2">26:2</span> Examine me, O Jehovah, and prove me; Try
my heart and my mind.

<span id="an_26:3">26:3</span> For thy lovingkindness is before mine
eyes; And I have walked in thy truth.

<span id="an_26:4">26:4</span> I have not sat with men of falsehood;
Neither will I go in with dissemblers.

<span id="an_26:5">26:5</span> I hate the assembly of evil-doers, And
will not sit with the wicked.

<span id="an_26:6">26:6</span> I will wash my hands in innocency: So
will I compass thine altar, O Jehovah;

<span id="an_26:7">26:7</span> That I may make the voice of thanksgiving
to be heard, And tell of all thy wondrous works.

<span id="an_26:8">26:8</span> Jehovah, I love the habitation of thy
house, And the place where thy glory dwelleth.

<span id="an_26:9">26:9</span> Gather not my soul with sinners, Nor my
life with men of blood;

<span id="an_26:10">26:10</span> In whose hands is wickedness, And their
right hand is full of bribes.

<span id="an_26:11">26:11</span> But as for me, I will walk in mine
integrity: Redeem me, and be merciful unto me.

<span id="an_26:12">26:12</span> My foot standeth in an even place: In
the congregations will I bless Jehovah.

<span id="an_27:1">27:1</span> \[A Psalm\] of David. Jehovah is my light
and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? Jehovah is the strength of my life;
Of whom shall I be afraid?

<span id="an_27:2">27:2</span> When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my
flesh, \[Even\] mine adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.

<span id="an_27:3">27:3</span> Though a host should encamp against me,
My heart shall not fear: Though war should rise against me, Even then
will I be confident.

<span id="an_27:4">27:4</span> One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that
will I seek after; That I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days
of my life, To behold the beauty of Jehovah, And to inquire in his
temple.

<span id="an_27:5">27:5</span> For in the day of trouble he will keep me
secretly in his pavilion: In the covert of his tabernacle will he hide
me; He will lift me up upon a rock.

<span id="an_27:6">27:6</span> And now shall my head be lifted up above
mine enemies round about me. And I will offer in his tabernacle
sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto Jehovah.

<span id="an_27:7">27:7</span> Hear, O Jehovah, when I cry with my
voice: Have mercy also upon me, and answer me.

<span id="an_27:8">27:8</span> \[When thou saidst\], Seek ye my face; My
heart said unto thee, Thy face, Jehovah, will I seek.

<span id="an_27:9">27:9</span> Hide not thy face from me; Put not thy
servant away in anger: Thou hast been my help; Cast me not off, neither
forsake me, O God of my salvation.

<span id="an_27:10">27:10</span> When my father and my mother forsake
me, Then Jehovah will take me up.

<span id="an_27:11">27:11</span> Teach me thy way, O Jehovah; And lead
me in a plain path, Because of mine enemies.

<span id="an_27:12">27:12</span> Deliver me not over unto the will of
mine adversaries: For false witnesses are risen up against me, And such
as breathe out cruelty.

<span id="an_27:13">27:13</span> \[I had fainted\], unless I had
believed to see the goodness of Jehovah In the land of the living.

<span id="an_27:14">27:14</span> Wait for Jehovah: Be strong, and let
thy heart take courage; Yea, wait thou for Jehovah.

<span id="an_28:1">28:1</span> \[A Psalm\] of David. Unto thee, O
Jehovah, will I call: My rock, be not thou deaf unto me; Lest, if thou
be silent unto me, I become like them that go down into the pit.

<span id="an_28:2">28:2</span> Hear the voice of my supplications, when
I cry unto thee, When I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.

<span id="an_28:3">28:3</span> Draw me not away with the wicked, And
with the workers of iniquity; That speak peace with their neighbors, But
mischief is in their hearts.

<span id="an_28:4">28:4</span> Give them according to their work, and
according to the wickedness of their doings: Give them after the
operation of their hands; Render to them their desert.

<span id="an_28:5">28:5</span> Because they regard not the works of
Jehovah, Nor the operation of his hands, He will break them down and not
build them up.

<span id="an_28:6">28:6</span> Blessed be Jehovah, Because he hath heard
the voice of my supplications.

<span id="an_28:7">28:7</span> Jehovah is my strength and my shield; My
heart hath trusted in him, and I am helped: Therefore my heart greatly
rejoiceth; And with my song will I praise him.

<span id="an_28:8">28:8</span> Jehovah is their strength, And he is a
stronghold of salvation to his anointed.

<span id="an_28:9">28:9</span> Save thy people, and bless thine
inheritance: Be their shepherd also, and bear them up for ever.

<span id="an_29:1">29:1</span> A Psalm of David. Ascribe unto Jehovah, O
ye sons of the mighty, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength.

<span id="an_29:2">29:2</span> Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto
his name; Worship Jehovah in holy array.

<span id="an_29:3">29:3</span> The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters:
The God of glory thundereth, Even Jehovah upon many waters.

<span id="an_29:4">29:4</span> The voice of Jehovah is powerful; The
voice of Jehovah is full of majesty.

<span id="an_29:5">29:5</span> The voice of Jehovah breaketh the cedars;
Yea, Jehovah breaketh in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.

<span id="an_29:6">29:6</span> He maketh them also to skip like a calf;
Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild-ox.

<span id="an_29:7">29:7</span> The voice of Jehovah cleaveth the flames
of fire.

<span id="an_29:8">29:8</span> The voice of Jehovah shaketh the
wilderness; Jehovah shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.

<span id="an_29:9">29:9</span> The voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds to
calve, And strippeth the forests bare: And in his temple everything
saith, Glory.

<span id="an_29:10">29:10</span> Jehovah sat \[as King\] at the Flood;
Yea, Jehovah sitteth as King for ever.

<span id="an_29:11">29:11</span> Jehovah will give strength unto his
people; Jehovah will bless his people with peace.

<span id="an_30:1">30:1</span> A Psalm; a Song at the Dedication of the
House. \[A Psalm\] of David. I will extol thee, O Jehovah; for thou hast
raised me up, And hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.

<span id="an_30:2">30:2</span> O Jehovah my God, I cried unto thee, and
thou hast healed me.

<span id="an_30:3">30:3</span> O Jehovah, thou hast brought up my soul
from Sheol; Thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the
pit.

<span id="an_30:4">30:4</span> Sing praise unto Jehovah, O ye saints of
his, And give thanks to his holy memorial \[name\].

<span id="an_30:5">30:5</span> For his anger is but for a moment; His
favor is for a life-time: Weeping may tarry for the night, But joy
\[cometh\] in the morning.

<span id="an_30:6">30:6</span> As for me, I said in my prosperity, I
shall never be moved.

<span id="an_30:7">30:7</span> Thou, Jehovah, of thy favor hadst made my
mountain to stand strong: Thou didst hide thy face; I was troubled.

<span id="an_30:8">30:8</span> I cried to thee, O Jehovah; And unto
Jehovah I made supplication:

<span id="an_30:9">30:9</span> What profit is there in my blood, when I
go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy
truth?

<span id="an_30:10">30:10</span> Hear, O Jehovah, and have mercy upon
me: Jehovah, be thou my helper.

<span id="an_30:11">30:11</span> Thou hast turned for me my mourning
into dancing; Thou hast loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with
gladness;

<span id="an_30:12">30:12</span> To the end that \[my\] glory may sing
praise to thee, and not be silent. O Jehovah my God, I will give thanks
unto thee for ever.

<span id="an_31:1">31:1</span> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.
In thee, O Jehovah, do I take refuge; Let me never be put to shame:
Deliver me in thy righteousness.

<span id="an_31:2">31:2</span> Bow down thine ear unto me; deliver me
speedily: Be thou to me a strong rock, A house of defence to save me.

<span id="an_31:3">31:3</span> For thou art my rock and my fortress;
Therefore for thy name's sake lead me and guide me.

<span id="an_31:4">31:4</span> Pluck me out of the net that they have
laid privily for me; For thou art my stronghold.

<span id="an_31:5">31:5</span> Into thy hand I commend my spirit: Thou
hast redeemed me, O Jehovah, thou God of truth.

<span id="an_31:6">31:6</span> I hate them that regard lying vanities;
But I trust in Jehovah.

<span id="an_31:7">31:7</span> I will be glad and rejoice in thy
lovingkindness; For thou hast seen my affliction: Thou hast known my
soul in adversities;

<span id="an_31:8">31:8</span> And thou hast not shut me up into the
hand of the enemy; Thou hast set my feet in a large place.

<span id="an_31:9">31:9</span> Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah, for I am
in distress: Mine eye wasteth away with grief, \[yea\], my soul and my
body.

<span id="an_31:10">31:10</span> For my life is spent with sorrow, And
my years with sighing: My strength faileth because of mine iniquity, And
my bones are wasted away.

<span id="an_31:11">31:11</span> Because of all mine adversaries I am
become a reproach, Yea, unto my neighbors exceedingly, And a fear to
mine acquaintance: They that did see me without fled from me.

<span id="an_31:12">31:12</span> I am forgotten as a dead man out of
mind: I am like a broken vessel.

<span id="an_31:13">31:13</span> For I have heard the defaming of many,
Terror on every side: While they took counsel together against me, They
devised to take away my life.

<span id="an_31:14">31:14</span> But I trusted in thee, O Jehovah: I
said, Thou art my God.

<span id="an_31:15">31:15</span> My times are in thy hand: Deliver me
from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.

<span id="an_31:16">31:16</span> Make thy face to shine upon thy
servant: Save me in thy lovingkindness.

<span id="an_31:17">31:17</span> Let me not be put to shame, O Jehovah;
for I have called upon thee: Let the wicked be put to shame, let them be
silent in Sheol.

<span id="an_31:18">31:18</span> Let the lying lips be dumb, Which speak
against the righteous insolently, With pride and contempt.

<span id="an_31:19">31:19</span> Oh how great is thy goodness, Which
thou hast laid up for them that fear thee, Which thou hast wrought for
them that take refuge in thee, Before the sons of men!

<span id="an_31:20">31:20</span> In the covert of thy presence wilt thou
hide them from the plottings of man: Thou wilt keep them secretly in a
pavilion from the strife of tongues.

<span id="an_31:21">31:21</span> Blessed be Jehovah; For he hath showed
me his marvellous lovingkindness in a strong city.

<span id="an_31:22">31:22</span> As for me, I said in my haste, I am cut
off from before thine eyes: Nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my
supplications When I cried unto thee.

<span id="an_31:23">31:23</span> Oh love Jehovah, all ye his saints:
Jehovah preserveth the faithful, And plentifully rewardeth him that
dealeth proudly.

<span id="an_31:24">31:24</span> Be strong, and let your heart take
courage, All ye that hope in Jehovah.

<span id="an_32:1">32:1</span> \[A Psalm\] of David. Maschil. Blessed is
he whose transgression is forgiven, Whose sin is covered.

<span id="an_32:2">32:2</span> Blessed is the man unto whom Jehovah
imputeth not iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no guile.

<span id="an_32:3">32:3</span> When I kept silence, my bones wasted away
Through my groaning all the day long.

<span id="an_32:4">32:4</span> For day and night thy hand was heavy upon
me: My moisture was changed \[as\] with the drought of summer. Selah

<span id="an_32:5">32:5</span> I acknowledged my sin unto thee, And mine
iniquity did I not hide: I said, I will confess my transgressions unto
Jehovah; And thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah

<span id="an_32:6">32:6</span> For this let every one that is godly pray
unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: Surely when the great
waters overflow they shall not reach unto him.

<span id="an_32:7">32:7</span> Thou art my hiding-place; thou wilt
preserve me from trouble; Thou wilt compass me about with songs of
deliverance. Selah

<span id="an_32:8">32:8</span> I will instruct thee and teach thee in
the way which thou shalt go: I will counsel thee with mine eye upon
thee.

<span id="an_32:9">32:9</span> Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule,
which have no understanding; Whose trappings must be bit and bridle to
hold them in, \[Else\] they will not come near unto thee.

<span id="an_32:10">32:10</span> Many sorrows shall be to the wicked;
But he that trusteth in Jehovah, lovingkindness shall compass him about.

<span id="an_32:11">32:11</span> Be glad in Jehovah, and rejoice, ye
righteous; And shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.

<span id="an_33:1">33:1</span> Rejoice in Jehovah, O ye righteous:
Praise is comely for the upright.

<span id="an_33:2">33:2</span> Give thanks unto Jehovah with the harp:
Sing praises unto him with the psaltery of ten strings.

<span id="an_33:3">33:3</span> Sing unto him a new song; Play skilfully
with a loud noise.

<span id="an_33:4">33:4</span> For the word of Jehovah is right; And all
his work is \[done\] in faithfulness.

<span id="an_33:5">33:5</span> He loveth righteousness and justice: The
earth is full of the lovingkindness of Jehovah.

<span id="an_33:6">33:6</span> By the word of Jehovah were the heavens
made, And all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.

<span id="an_33:7">33:7</span> He gathereth the waters of the sea
together as a heap: He layeth up the deeps in store-houses.

<span id="an_33:8">33:8</span> Let all the earth fear Jehovah: Let all
the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.

<span id="an_33:9">33:9</span> For he spake, and it was done; He
commanded, and it stood fast.

<span id="an_33:10">33:10</span> Jehovah bringeth the counsel of the
nations to nought; He maketh the thoughts of the peoples to be of no
effect.

<span id="an_33:11">33:11</span> The counsel of Jehovah standeth fast
for ever, The thoughts of his heart to all generations.

<span id="an_33:12">33:12</span> Blessed is the nation whose God is
Jehovah, The people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.

<span id="an_33:13">33:13</span> Jehovah looketh from heaven; He
beholdeth all the sons of men;

<span id="an_33:14">33:14</span> From the place of his habitation he
looketh forth Upon all the inhabitants of the earth,

<span id="an_33:15">33:15</span> He that fashioneth the hearts of them
all, That considereth all their works.

<span id="an_33:16">33:16</span> There is no king saved by the multitude
of a host: A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.

<span id="an_33:17">33:17</span> A horse is a vain thing for safety;
Neither doth he deliver any by his great power.

<span id="an_33:18">33:18</span> Behold, the eye of Jehovah is upon them
that fear him, Upon them that hope in his lovingkindness;

<span id="an_33:19">33:19</span> To deliver their soul from death, And
to keep them alive in famine.

<span id="an_33:20">33:20</span> Our soul hath waited for Jehovah: He is
our help and our shield.

<span id="an_33:21">33:21</span> For our heart shall rejoice in him,
Because we have trusted in his holy name.

<span id="an_33:22">33:22</span> Let thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, be
upon us, According as we have hoped in thee.

<span id="an_34:1">34:1</span> A Psalm of David; when he changed his
behavior before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed. I will
bless Jehovah at all times: His praise shall continually be in my mouth.

<span id="an_34:2">34:2</span> My soul shall make her boast in Jehovah:
The meek shall hear thereof, and be glad.

<span id="an_34:3">34:3</span> Oh magnify Jehovah with me, And let us
exalt his name together.

<span id="an_34:4">34:4</span> I sought Jehovah, and he answered me, And
delivered me from all my fears.

<span id="an_34:5">34:5</span> They looked unto him, and were radiant;
And their faces shall never be confounded.

<span id="an_34:6">34:6</span> This poor man cried, and Jehovah heard
him, And saved him out of all his troubles.

<span id="an_34:7">34:7</span> The angel of Jehovah encampeth round
about them that fear him, And delivereth them.

<span id="an_34:8">34:8</span> Oh taste and see that Jehovah is good:
Blessed is the man that taketh refuge in him.

<span id="an_34:9">34:9</span> Oh fear Jehovah, ye his saints; For there
is no want to them that fear him.

<span id="an_34:10">34:10</span> The young lions do lack, and suffer
hunger; But they that seek Jehovah shall not want any good thing.

<span id="an_34:11">34:11</span> Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I
will teach you the fear of Jehovah.

<span id="an_34:12">34:12</span> What man is he that desireth life, And
loveth \[many\] days, that he may see good?

<span id="an_34:13">34:13</span> Keep thy tongue from evil, And thy lips
from speaking guile.

<span id="an_34:14">34:14</span> Depart from evil, and do good; Seek
peace, and pursue it.

<span id="an_34:15">34:15</span> The eyes of Jehovah are toward the
righteous, And his ears are \[open\] unto their cry.

<span id="an_34:16">34:16</span> The face of Jehovah is against them
that do evil, To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.

<span id="an_34:17">34:17</span> \[The righteous\] cried, and Jehovah
heard, And delivered them out of all their troubles.

<span id="an_34:18">34:18</span> Jehovah is nigh unto them that are of a
broken heart, And saveth such as are of a contrite spirit.

<span id="an_34:19">34:19</span> Many are the afflictions of the
righteous; But Jehovah delivereth him out of them all.

<span id="an_34:20">34:20</span> He keepeth all his bones: Not one of
them is broken.

<span id="an_34:21">34:21</span> Evil shall slay the wicked; And they
that hate the righteous shall be condemned.

<span id="an_34:22">34:22</span> Jehovah redeemeth the soul of his
servants; And none of them that take refuge in him shall be condemned.

<span id="an_35:1">35:1</span> \[A Psalm\] of David. Strive thou, O
Jehovah, with them that strive with me: Fight thou against them that
fight against me.

<span id="an_35:2">35:2</span> Take hold of shield and buckler, And
stand up for my help.

<span id="an_35:3">35:3</span> Draw out also the spear, and stop the way
against them that pursue me: Say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.

<span id="an_35:4">35:4</span> Let them be put to shame and brought to
dishonor that seek after my soul: Let them be turned back and confounded
that devise my hurt.

<span id="an_35:5">35:5</span> Let them be as chaff before the wind, And
the angel of Jehovah driving \[them\] on.

<span id="an_35:6">35:6</span> Let their way be dark and slippery, And
the angel of Jehovah pursuing them.

<span id="an_35:7">35:7</span> For without cause have they hid for me
their net \[in\] a pit; Without cause have they digged \[a pit\] for my
soul.

<span id="an_35:8">35:8</span> Let destruction come upon him unawares;
And let his net that he hath hid catch himself: With destruction let him
fall therein.

<span id="an_35:9">35:9</span> And my soul shall be joyful in Jehovah:
It shall rejoice in his salvation.

<span id="an_35:10">35:10</span> All my bones shall say, Jehovah, who is
like unto thee, Who deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for
him, Yea, the poor and the needy from him that robbeth him?

<span id="an_35:11">35:11</span> Unrighteous witnesses rise up; They ask
me of things that I know not.

<span id="an_35:12">35:12</span> They reward me evil for good, \[To\]
the bereaving of my soul.

<span id="an_35:13">35:13</span> But as for me, when they were sick, my
clothing was sackcloth: I afflicted my soul with fasting; And my prayer
returned into mine own bosom.

<span id="an_35:14">35:14</span> I behaved myself as though it had been
my friend or my brother: I bowed down mourning, as one that bewaileth
his mother.

<span id="an_35:15">35:15</span> But in mine adversity they rejoiced,
and gathered themselves together: The abjects gathered themselves
together against me, and I knew \[it\] not; They did tear me, and ceased
not:

<span id="an_35:16">35:16</span> Like the profane mockers in feasts,
They gnashed upon me with their teeth.

<span id="an_35:17">35:17</span> Lord, how long wilt thou look on?
Rescue my soul from their destructions, My darling from the lions.

<span id="an_35:18">35:18</span> I will give thee thanks in the great
assembly: I will praise thee among much people.

<span id="an_35:19">35:19</span> Let not them that are mine enemies
wrongfully rejoice over me; Neither let them wink with the eye that hate
me without a cause.

<span id="an_35:20">35:20</span> For they speak not peace; But they
devise deceitful words against them that are quiet in the land.

<span id="an_35:21">35:21</span> Yea, they opened their mouth wide
against me; They said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.

<span id="an_35:22">35:22</span> Thou hast seen it, O Jehovah; keep not
silence: O Lord, be not far from me.

<span id="an_35:23">35:23</span> Stir up thyself, and awake to the
justice \[due\] unto me, \[Even\] unto my cause, my God and my Lord.

<span id="an_35:24">35:24</span> Judge me, O Jehovah my God, according
to thy righteousness; And let them not rejoice over me.

<span id="an_35:25">35:25</span> Let them not say in their heart, Aha,
so would we have it: Let them not say, We have swallowed him up.

<span id="an_35:26">35:26</span> Let them be put to shame and confounded
together that rejoice at my hurt: Let them be clothed with shame and
dishonor that magnify themselves against me.

<span id="an_35:27">35:27</span> Let them shout for joy, and be glad,
that favor my righteous cause: Yea, let them say continually, Jehovah be
magnified, Who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.

<span id="an_35:28">35:28</span> And my tongue shall talk of thy
righteousness \[And\] of thy praise all the day long.

<span id="an_36:1">36:1</span> For the Chief Musician. \[A Psalm\] of
David the servant of Jehovah. The transgression of the wicked saith
within my heart, There is no fear of God before his eyes.

<span id="an_36:2">36:2</span> For he flattereth himself in his own
eyes, That his iniquity will not be found out and be hated.

<span id="an_36:3">36:3</span> The words of his mouth are iniquity and
deceit: He hath ceased to be wise \[and\] to do good.

<span id="an_36:4">36:4</span> He deviseth iniquity upon his bed; He
setteth himself in a way that is not good; He abhorreth not evil.

<span id="an_36:5">36:5</span> Thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, is in the
heavens; Thy faithfulness \[reacheth\] unto the skies.

<span id="an_36:6">36:6</span> Thy righteousness is like the mountains
of God; Thy judgments are a great deep: O Jehovah, thou preservest man
and beast.

<span id="an_36:7">36:7</span> How precious is thy lovingkindness, O
God! And the children of men take refuge under the shadow of thy wings.

<span id="an_36:8">36:8</span> They shall be abundantly satisfied with
the fatness of thy house; And thou wilt make them drink of the river of
thy pleasures.

<span id="an_36:9">36:9</span> For with thee is the fountain of life: In
thy light shall we see light.

<span id="an_36:10">36:10</span> Oh continue thy lovingkindness unto
them that know thee, And thy righteousness to the upright in heart.

<span id="an_36:11">36:11</span> Let not the foot of pride come against
me, And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.

<span id="an_36:12">36:12</span> There are the workers of iniquity
fallen: They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.

<span id="an_37:1">37:1</span> \[A Psalm\] of David. Fret not thyself
because of evil-doers, Neither be thou envious against them that work
unrighteousness.

<span id="an_37:2">37:2</span> For they shall soon be cut down like the
grass, And wither as the green herb.

<span id="an_37:3">37:3</span> Trust in Jehovah, and do good; Dwell in
the land, and feed on \[his\] faithfulness.

<span id="an_37:4">37:4</span> Delight thyself also in Jehovah; And he
will give thee the desires of thy heart.

<span id="an_37:5">37:5</span> Commit thy way unto Jehovah; Trust also
in him, and he will bring it to pass.

<span id="an_37:6">37:6</span> And he will make thy righteousness to go
forth as the light, And thy justice as the noon-day.

<span id="an_37:7">37:7</span> Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for
him: Fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, Because
of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.

<span id="an_37:8">37:8</span> Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: Fret
not thyself, \[it tendeth\] only to evil-doing.

<span id="an_37:9">37:9</span> For evil-doers shall be cut off; But
those that wait for Jehovah, they shall inherit the land.

<span id="an_37:10">37:10</span> For yet a little while, and the wicked
shall not be: Yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and he
shall not be.

<span id="an_37:11">37:11</span> But the meek shall inherit the land,
And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.

<span id="an_37:12">37:12</span> The wicked plotteth against the just,
And gnasheth upon him with his teeth.

<span id="an_37:13">37:13</span> The Lord will laugh at him; For he
seeth that his day is coming.

<span id="an_37:14">37:14</span> The wicked have drawn out the sword,
and have bent their bow, To cast down the poor and needy, To slay such
as are upright in the way.

<span id="an_37:15">37:15</span> Their sword shall enter into their own
heart, And their bows shall be broken.

<span id="an_37:16">37:16</span> Better is a little that the righteous
hath Than the abundance of many wicked.

<span id="an_37:17">37:17</span> For the arms of the wicked shall be
broken; But Jehovah upholdeth the righteous.

<span id="an_37:18">37:18</span> Jehovah knoweth the days of the
perfect; And their inheritance shall be for ever.

<span id="an_37:19">37:19</span> They shall not be put to shame in the
time of evil; And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.

<span id="an_37:20">37:20</span> But the wicked shall perish, And the
enemies of Jehovah shall be as the fat of lambs: They shall consume; In
smoke shall they consume away.

<span id="an_37:21">37:21</span> The wicked borroweth, and payeth not
again; But the righteous dealeth graciously, and giveth.

<span id="an_37:22">37:22</span> For such as are blessed of him shall
inherit the land; And they that are cursed of him shall be cut off.

<span id="an_37:23">37:23</span> A man's goings are established of
Jehovah; And he delighteth in his way.

<span id="an_37:24">37:24</span> Though he fall, he shall not be utterly
cast down; For Jehovah upholdeth him with his hand.

<span id="an_37:25">37:25</span> I have been young, and now am old; Yet
have I not seen the righteous forsaken, Nor his seed begging bread.

<span id="an_37:26">37:26</span> All the day long he dealeth graciously,
and lendeth; And his seed is blessed.

<span id="an_37:27">37:27</span> Depart from evil, and do good; And
dwell for evermore.

<span id="an_37:28">37:28</span> For Jehovah loveth justice, And
forsaketh not his saints; They are preserved for ever: But the seed of
the wicked shall be cut off.

<span id="an_37:29">37:29</span> The righteous shall inherit the land,
And dwell therein for ever.

<span id="an_37:30">37:30</span> The mouth of the righteous talketh of
wisdom, And his tongue speaketh justice.

<span id="an_37:31">37:31</span> The law of his God is in his heart;
None of his steps shall slide.

<span id="an_37:32">37:32</span> The wicked watcheth the righteous, And
seeketh to slay him.

<span id="an_37:33">37:33</span> Jehovah will not leave him in his hand,
Nor condemn him when he is judged.

<span id="an_37:34">37:34</span> Wait for Jehovah, and keep his way, And
he will exalt thee to inherit the land: When the wicked are cut off,
thou shalt see it.

<span id="an_37:35">37:35</span> I have seen the wicked in great power,
And spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.

<span id="an_37:36">37:36</span> But one passed by, and, lo, he was not:
Yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.

<span id="an_37:37">37:37</span> Mark the perfect man, and behold the
upright; For there is a \[happy\] end to the man of peace.

<span id="an_37:38">37:38</span> As for transgressors, they shall be
destroyed together; The end of the wicked shall be cut off.

<span id="an_37:39">37:39</span> But the salvation of the righteous is
of Jehovah; He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.

<span id="an_37:40">37:40</span> And Jehovah helpeth them, and rescueth
them; He rescueth them from the wicked, and saveth them, Because they
have taken refuge in him.

<span id="an_38:1">38:1</span> A Psalm of David, to bring to
remembrance. O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thy wrath; Neither chasten me
in thy hot displeasure.

<span id="an_38:2">38:2</span> For thine arrows stick fast in me, And
thy hand presseth me sore.

<span id="an_38:3">38:3</span> There is no soundness in my flesh because
of thine indignation; Neither is there any health in my bones because of
my sin.

<span id="an_38:4">38:4</span> For mine iniquities are gone over my
head: As a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.

<span id="an_38:5">38:5</span> My wounds are loathsome and corrupt,
Because of my foolishness.

<span id="an_38:6">38:6</span> I am pained and bowed down greatly; I go
mourning all the day long.

<span id="an_38:7">38:7</span> For my loins are filled with burning; And
there is no soundness in my flesh.

<span id="an_38:8">38:8</span> I am faint and sore bruised: I have
groaned by reason of the disquietness of my heart.

<span id="an_38:9">38:9</span> Lord, all my desire is before thee; And
my groaning is not hid from thee.

<span id="an_38:10">38:10</span> My heart throbbeth, my strength faileth
me: As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.

<span id="an_38:11">38:11</span> My lovers and my friends stand aloof
from my plague; And my kinsmen stand afar off.

<span id="an_38:12">38:12</span> They also that seek after my life lay
snares \[for me\]; And they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things,
And meditate deceits all the day long.

<span id="an_38:13">38:13</span> But I, as a deaf man, hear not; And I
am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.

<span id="an_38:14">38:14</span> Yea, I am as a man that heareth not,
And in whose mouth are no reproofs.

<span id="an_38:15">38:15</span> For in thee, O Jehovah, do I hope: Thou
wilt answer, O Lord my God.

<span id="an_38:16">38:16</span> For I said, Lest they rejoice over me:
When my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.

<span id="an_38:17">38:17</span> For I am ready to fall, And my sorrow
is continually before me.

<span id="an_38:18">38:18</span> For I will declare mine iniquity; I
will be sorry for my sin.

<span id="an_38:19">38:19</span> But mine enemies are lively, \[and\]
are strong; And they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.

<span id="an_38:20">38:20</span> They also that render evil for good Are
adversaries unto me, because I follow the thing that is good.

<span id="an_38:21">38:21</span> Forsake me not, O Jehovah: O my God, be
not far from me.

<span id="an_38:22">38:22</span> Make haste to help me, O Lord, my
salvation.

<span id="an_39:1">39:1</span> For the Chief Musician, Jeduthun. A Psalm
of David. I said, I will take heed to my ways, That I sin not with my
tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, While the wicked is before
me.

<span id="an_39:2">39:2</span> I was dumb with silence, I held my peace,
even from good; And my sorrow was stirred.

<span id="an_39:3">39:3</span> My heart was hot within me; While I was
musing the fire burned: \[Then\] spake I with my tongue:

<span id="an_39:4">39:4</span> Jehovah, make me to know mine end, And
the measure of my days, what it is; Let me know how frail I am.

<span id="an_39:5">39:5</span> Behold, thou hast made my days \[as\]
handbreadths; And my life-time is as nothing before thee: Surely every
man at his best estate is altogether vanity. Selah

<span id="an_39:6">39:6</span> Surely every man walketh in a vain show;
Surely they are disquieted in vain: He heapeth up \[riches\], and
knoweth not who shall gather them.

<span id="an_39:7">39:7</span> And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope
is in thee.

<span id="an_39:8">39:8</span> Deliver me from all my transgressions:
Make me not the reproach of the foolish.

<span id="an_39:9">39:9</span> I was dumb, I opened not my mouth;
Because thou didst it.

<span id="an_39:10">39:10</span> Remove thy stroke away from me: I am
consumed by the blow of thy hand.

<span id="an_39:11">39:11</span> When thou with rebukes dost correct man
for iniquity, Thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: Surely
every man is vanity. Selah

<span id="an_39:12">39:12</span> Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, and give ear
unto my cry; Hold not thy peace at my tears: For I am a stranger with
thee, A sojourner, as all my fathers were.

<span id="an_39:13">39:13</span> Oh spare me, that I may recover
strength, Before I go hence, and be no more.

<span id="an_40:1">40:1</span> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.
I waited patiently for Jehovah; And he inclined unto me, and heard my
cry.

<span id="an_40:2">40:2</span> He brought me up also out of a horrible
pit, out of the miry clay; And he set my feet upon a rock, and
established my goings.

<span id="an_40:3">40:3</span> And he hath put a new song in my mouth,
even praise unto our God: Many shall see it, and fear, And shall trust
in Jehovah.

<span id="an_40:4">40:4</span> Blessed is the man that maketh Jehovah
his trust, And respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

<span id="an_40:5">40:5</span> Many, O Jehovah my God, are the wonderful
works which thou hast done, And thy thoughts which are to us-ward; They
cannot be set in order unto thee; If I would declare and speak of them,
They are more than can be numbered.

<span id="an_40:6">40:6</span> Sacrifice and offering thou hast no
delight in; Mine ears hast thou opened: Burnt-offering and sin-offering
hast thou not required.

<span id="an_40:7">40:7</span> Then said I, Lo, I am come; In the roll
of the book it is written of me:

<span id="an_40:8">40:8</span> I delight to do thy will, O my God; Yea,
thy law is within my heart.

<span id="an_40:9">40:9</span> I have proclaimed glad tidings of
righteousness in the great assembly; Lo, I will not refrain my lips, O
Jehovah, thou knowest.

<span id="an_40:10">40:10</span> I have not hid thy righteousness within
my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation; I have not
concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great assembly.

<span id="an_40:11">40:11</span> Withhold not thou thy tender mercies
from me, O Jehovah; Let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually
preserve me.

<span id="an_40:12">40:12</span> For innumerable evils have compassed me
about; Mine iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look
up; They are more than the hairs of my head; And my heart hath failed
me.

<span id="an_40:13">40:13</span> Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me:
Make haste to help me, O Jehovah.

<span id="an_40:14">40:14</span> Let them be put to shame and confounded
together That seek after my soul to destroy it: Let them be turned
backward and brought to dishonor That delight in my hurt.

<span id="an_40:15">40:15</span> Let them be desolate by reason of their
shame That say unto me, Aha, aha.

<span id="an_40:16">40:16</span> Let all those that seek thee rejoice
and be glad in thee: Let such as love thy salvation say continually,
Jehovah be magnified.

<span id="an_40:17">40:17</span> But I am poor and needy; \[Yet\] the
Lord thinketh upon me: Thou art my help and my deliverer; Make no
tarrying, O my God.

<span id="an_41:1">41:1</span> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.
Blessed is he that considereth the poor: Jehovah will deliver him in the
day of evil.

<span id="an_41:2">41:2</span> Jehovah will preserve him, and keep him
alive, And he shall be blessed upon the earth; And deliver not thou him
unto the will of his enemies.

<span id="an_41:3">41:3</span> Jehovah will support him upon the couch
of languishing: Thou makest all his bed in his sickness.

<span id="an_41:4">41:4</span> I said, O Jehovah, have mercy upon me:
Heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.

<span id="an_41:5">41:5</span> Mine enemies speak evil against me,
\[saying\], When will he die, and his name perish?

<span id="an_41:6">41:6</span> And if he come to see \[me\], he speaketh
falsehood; His heart gathereth iniquity to itself: When he goeth abroad,
he telleth it.

<span id="an_41:7">41:7</span> All that hate me whisper together against
me; Against me do they devise my hurt.

<span id="an_41:8">41:8</span> An evil disease, \[say they\], cleaveth
fast unto him; And now that he lieth he shall rise up no more.

<span id="an_41:9">41:9</span> Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I
trusted, Who did eat of my bread, Hath lifted up his heel against me.

<span id="an_41:10">41:10</span> But thou, O Jehovah, have mercy upon
me, and raise me up, That I may requite them.

<span id="an_41:11">41:11</span> By this I know that thou delightest in
me, Because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.

<span id="an_41:12">41:12</span> And as for me, thou upholdest me in
mine integrity, And settest me before thy face for ever.

<span id="an_41:13">41:13</span> Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel,
From everlasting and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen. I

<span id="an_42:1">42:1</span> For the Chief Musician. Maschil of the
sons of Korah. As the hart panteth after the water brooks, So panteth my
soul after thee, O God.

<span id="an_42:2">42:2</span> My soul thirsteth for God, for the living
God: When shall I come and appear before God?

<span id="an_42:3">42:3</span> My tears have been my food day and night,
While they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?

<span id="an_42:4">42:4</span> These things I remember, and pour out my
soul within me, How I went with the throng, and led them to the house of
God, With the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping holyday.

<span id="an_42:5">42:5</span> Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And
\[why\] art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet
praise him \[For\] the help of his countenance.

<span id="an_42:6">42:6</span> O my God, my soul is cast down within me:
Therefore do I remember thee from the land of the Jordan, And the
Hermons, from the hill Mizar.

<span id="an_42:7">42:7</span> Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of
thy waterfalls: All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.

<span id="an_42:8">42:8</span> \[Yet\] Jehovah will command his
lovingkindness in the day-time; And in the night his song shall be with
me, \[Even\] a prayer unto the God of my life.

<span id="an_42:9">42:9</span> I will say unto God my rock, Why hast
thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the
enemy?

<span id="an_42:10">42:10</span> As with a sword in my bones, mine
adversaries reproach me, While they continually say unto me, Where is
thy God?

<span id="an_42:11">42:11</span> Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And
why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet
praise him, \[Who is\] the help of my countenance, and my God.

<span id="an_43:1">43:1</span> Judge me, O God, and plead my cause
against an ungodly nation: Oh deliver me from the deceitful and unjust
man.

<span id="an_43:2">43:2</span> For thou art the God of my strength; why
hast thou cast me off? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of
the enemy?

<span id="an_43:3">43:3</span> Oh send out thy light and thy truth; let
them lead me: Let them bring me unto thy holy hill, And to thy
tabernacles.

<span id="an_43:4">43:4</span> Then will I go unto the altar of God,
Unto God my exceeding joy; And upon the harp will I praise thee, O God,
my God.

<span id="an_43:5">43:5</span> Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And
why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet
praise him, \[Who is\] the help of my countenance, and my God.

<span id="an_44:1">44:1</span> For the Chief Musician. \[A Psalm\] of
the sons of Korah. Maschil. We have heard with our ears, O God, Our
fathers have told us, What work thou didst in their days, In the days of
old.

<span id="an_44:2">44:2</span> Thou didst drive out the nations with thy
hand; But them thou didst plant: Thou didst afflict the peoples; But
them thou didst spread abroad.

<span id="an_44:3">44:3</span> For they gat not the land in possession
by their own sword, Neither did their own arm save them; But thy right
hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, Because thou wast
favorable unto them.

<span id="an_44:4">44:4</span> Thou art my King, O God: Command
deliverance for Jacob.

<span id="an_44:5">44:5</span> Through thee will we push down our
adversaries: Through thy name will we tread them under that rise up
against us.

<span id="an_44:6">44:6</span> For I will not trust in my bow, Neither
shall my sword save me.

<span id="an_44:7">44:7</span> But thou hast saved us from our
adversaries, And hast put them to shame that hate us.

<span id="an_44:8">44:8</span> In God have we made our boast all the day
long, And we will give thanks unto thy name for ever. Selah

<span id="an_44:9">44:9</span> But now thou hast cast \[us\] off, and
brought us to dishonor, And goest not forth with our hosts.

<span id="an_44:10">44:10</span> Thou makest us to turn back from the
adversary; And they that hate us take spoil for themselves.

<span id="an_44:11">44:11</span> Thou hast made us like sheep
\[appointed\] for food, And hast scattered us among the nations.

<span id="an_44:12">44:12</span> Thou sellest thy people for nought, And
hast not increased \[thy wealth\] by their price.

<span id="an_44:13">44:13</span> Thou makest us a reproach to our
neighbors, A scoffing and a derision to them that are round about us.

<span id="an_44:14">44:14</span> Thou makest us a byword among the
nations, A shaking of the head among the peoples.

<span id="an_44:15">44:15</span> All the day long is my dishonor before
me, And the shame of my face hath covered me,

<span id="an_44:16">44:16</span> For the voice of him that reproacheth
and blasphemeth, By reason of the enemy and the avenger.

<span id="an_44:17">44:17</span> All this is come upon us; Yet have we
not forgotten thee, Neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.

<span id="an_44:18">44:18</span> Our heart is not turned back, Neither
have our steps declined from thy way,

<span id="an_44:19">44:19</span> That thou hast sore broken us in the
place of jackals, And covered us with the shadow of death.

<span id="an_44:20">44:20</span> If we have forgotten the name of our
God, Or spread forth our hands to a strange god;

<span id="an_44:21">44:21</span> Will not God search this out? For he
knoweth the secrets of the heart.

<span id="an_44:22">44:22</span> Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the
day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

<span id="an_44:23">44:23</span> Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord?
Arise, cast \[us\] not off for ever.

<span id="an_44:24">44:24</span> Wherefore hidest thou thy face, And
forgettest our affliction and our oppression?

<span id="an_44:25">44:25</span> For our soul is bowed down to the dust:
Our body cleaveth unto the earth.

<span id="an_44:26">44:26</span> Rise up for our help, And redeem us for
thy lovingkindness' sake.

<span id="an_45:1">45:1</span> For the Chief Musician; set to
Shoshannim. \[A Psalm\] of the sons of Korah. Maschil. A Song of loves.
My heart overfloweth with a goodly matter; I speak the things which I
have made touching the king: My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.

<span id="an_45:2">45:2</span> Thou art fairer than the children of men;
Grace is poured into thy lips: Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.

<span id="an_45:3">45:3</span> Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty
one, Thy glory and thy majesty.

<span id="an_45:4">45:4</span> And in thy majesty ride on prosperously,
Because of truth and meekness \[and\] righteousness: And thy right hand
shall teach thee terrible things.

<span id="an_45:5">45:5</span> Thine arrows are sharp; The peoples fall
under thee; \[They are\] in the heart of the king's enemies.

<span id="an_45:6">45:6</span> Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever:
A sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom.

<span id="an_45:7">45:7</span> Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated
wickedness: Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee With the oil of
gladness above thy fellows.

<span id="an_45:8">45:8</span> All thy garments \[smell of\] myrrh, and
aloes, \[and\] cassia; Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have
made thee glad.

<span id="an_45:9">45:9</span> Kings' daughters are among thy honorable
women: At thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir.

<span id="an_45:10">45:10</span> Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and
incline thine ear; Forget also thine own people, and thy father's house:

<span id="an_45:11">45:11</span> So will the king desire thy beauty; For
he is thy lord; and reverence thou him.

<span id="an_45:12">45:12</span> And the daughter of Tyre \[shall be
there\] with a gift; The rich among the people shall entreat thy favor.

<span id="an_45:13">45:13</span> The king's daughter within \[the
palace\] is all glorious: Her clothing is inwrought with gold.

<span id="an_45:14">45:14</span> She shall be led unto the king in
broidered work: The virgins her companions that follow her Shall be
brought unto thee.

<span id="an_45:15">45:15</span> With gladness and rejoicing shall they
be led: They shall enter into the king's palace.

<span id="an_45:16">45:16</span> Instead of thy fathers shall be thy
children, Whom thou shalt make princes in all the earth.

<span id="an_45:17">45:17</span> I will make thy name to be remembered
in all generations: Therefore shall the peoples give thee thanks for
ever and ever.

<span id="an_46:1">46:1</span> For the Chief Musician. \[A Psalm\] of
the sons of Korah; set to Alamoth. A Song. God is our refuge and
strength, A very present help in trouble.

<span id="an_46:2">46:2</span> Therefore will we not fear, though the
earth do change, And though the mountains be shaken into the heart of
the seas;

<span id="an_46:3">46:3</span> Though the waters thereof roar and be
troubled, Though the mountains tremble with the swelling thereof. Selah

<span id="an_46:4">46:4</span> There is a river, the streams whereof
make glad the city of God, The holy place of the tabernacles of the Most
High.

<span id="an_46:5">46:5</span> God is in the midst of her; she shall not
be moved: God will help her, and that right early.

<span id="an_46:6">46:6</span> The nations raged, the kingdoms were
moved: He uttered his voice, the earth melted.

<span id="an_46:7">46:7</span> Jehovah of hosts is with us; The God of
Jacob is our refuge. Selah

<span id="an_46:8">46:8</span> Come, behold the works of Jehovah, What
desolations he hath made in the earth.

<span id="an_46:9">46:9</span> He maketh wars to cease unto the end of
the earth; He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; He
burneth the chariots in the fire.

<span id="an_46:10">46:10</span> Be still, and know that I am God: I
will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.

<span id="an_46:11">46:11</span> Jehovah of hosts is with us; The God of
Jacob is our refuge. Selah

<span id="an_47:1">47:1</span> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the
sons of Korah. Oh clap your hands, all ye peoples; Shout unto God with
the voice of triumph.

<span id="an_47:2">47:2</span> For Jehovah Most High is terrible; He is
a great King over all the earth.

<span id="an_47:3">47:3</span> He subdueth peoples under us, And nations
under our feet.

<span id="an_47:4">47:4</span> He chooseth our inheritance for us, The
glory of Jacob whom he loved. Selah

<span id="an_47:5">47:5</span> God is gone up with a shout, Jehovah with
the sound of a trumpet.

<span id="an_47:6">47:6</span> Sing praise to God, sing praises: Sing
praises unto our King, sing praises.

<span id="an_47:7">47:7</span> For God is the King of all the earth:
Sing ye praises with understanding.

<span id="an_47:8">47:8</span> God reigneth over the nations: God
sitteth upon his holy throne.

<span id="an_47:9">47:9</span> The princes of the peoples are gathered
together \[To be\] the people of the God of Abraham: For the shields of
the earth belong unto God; He is greatly exalted.

<span id="an_48:1">48:1</span> A Song; a Psalm of the sons of Korah.
Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised, In the city of our God, in
his holy mountain.

<span id="an_48:2">48:2</span> Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the
whole earth, Is mount Zion, \[on\] the sides of the north, The city of
the great King.

<span id="an_48:3">48:3</span> God hath made himself known in her
palaces for a refuge.

<span id="an_48:4">48:4</span> For, lo, the kings assembled themselves,
They passed by together.

<span id="an_48:5">48:5</span> They saw it, then were they amazed; They
were dismayed, they hasted away.

<span id="an_48:6">48:6</span> Trembling took hold of them there, Pain,
as of a woman in travail.

<span id="an_48:7">48:7</span> With the east wind Thou breakest the
ships of Tarshish.

<span id="an_48:8">48:8</span> As we have heard, so have we seen In the
city of Jehovah of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it
for ever. Selah

<span id="an_48:9">48:9</span> We have thought on thy lovingkindness, O
God, In the midst of thy temple.

<span id="an_48:10">48:10</span> As is thy name, O God, So is thy praise
unto the ends of the earth: Thy right hand is full of righteousness.

<span id="an_48:11">48:11</span> Let mount Zion be glad, Let the
daughters of Judah rejoice, Because of thy judgments.

<span id="an_48:12">48:12</span> Walk about Zion, and go round about
her; Number the towers thereof;

<span id="an_48:13">48:13</span> Mark ye well her bulwarks; Consider her
palaces: That ye may tell it to the generation following.

<span id="an_48:14">48:14</span> For this God is our God for ever and
ever: He will be our guide \[even\] unto death.

<span id="an_49:1">49:1</span> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the
sons of Korah. Hear this, all ye peoples; Give ear, all ye inhabitants
of the world,

<span id="an_49:2">49:2</span> Both low and high, Rich and poor
together.

<span id="an_49:3">49:3</span> My mouth shall speak wisdom; And the
meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.

<span id="an_49:4">49:4</span> I will incline mine ear to a parable: I
will open my dark saying upon the harp.

<span id="an_49:5">49:5</span> Wherefore should I fear in the days of
evil, When iniquity at my heels compasseth me about?

<span id="an_49:6">49:6</span> They that trust in their wealth, And
boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;

<span id="an_49:7">49:7</span> None \[of them\] can by any means redeem
his brother, Nor give to God a ransom for him;

<span id="an_49:8">49:8</span> (For the redemption of their life is
costly, And it faileth for ever;)

<span id="an_49:9">49:9</span> That he should still live alway, That he
should not see corruption.

<span id="an_49:10">49:10</span> For he shall see it. Wise men die; The
fool and the brutish alike perish, And leave their wealth to others.

<span id="an_49:11">49:11</span> Their inward thought is, \[that\] their
houses \[shall continue\] for ever, \[And\] their dwelling-places to all
generations; They call their lands after their own names.

<span id="an_49:12">49:12</span> But man \[being\] in honor abideth not:
He is like the beasts that perish.

<span id="an_49:13">49:13</span> This their way is their folly: Yet
after them men approve their sayings. Selah

<span id="an_49:14">49:14</span> They are appointed as a flock for
Sheol; Death shall be their shepherd; And the upright shall have
dominion over them in the morning; And their beauty shall be for Sheol
to consume, That there be no habitation for it.

<span id="an_49:15">49:15</span> But God will redeem my soul from the
power of Sheol; For he will receive me. Selah

<span id="an_49:16">49:16</span> Be not thou afraid when one is made
rich, When the glory of his house is increased.

<span id="an_49:17">49:17</span> For when he dieth he shall carry
nothing away; His glory shall not descend after him.

<span id="an_49:18">49:18</span> Though while he lived he blessed his
soul (And men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself,)

<span id="an_49:19">49:19</span> He shall go to the generation of his
fathers; They shall never see the light.

<span id="an_49:20">49:20</span> Man that is in honor, and understandeth
not, Is like the beasts that perish.

<span id="an_50:1">50:1</span> A Psalm of Asaph. The Mighty One, God,
Jehovah, hath spoken, And called the earth from the rising of the sun
unto the going down thereof.

<span id="an_50:2">50:2</span> Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,
God hath shined forth.

<span id="an_50:3">50:3</span> Our God cometh, and doth not keep
silence: A fire devoureth before him, And it is very tempestuous round
about him.

<span id="an_50:4">50:4</span> He calleth to the heavens above, And to
the earth, that he may judge his people:

<span id="an_50:5">50:5</span> Gather my saints together unto me, Those
that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.

<span id="an_50:6">50:6</span> And the heavens shall declare his
righteousness; For God is judge himself. Selah

<span id="an_50:7">50:7</span> Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O
Israel, and I will testify unto thee: I am God, \[even\] thy God.

<span id="an_50:8">50:8</span> I will not reprove thee for thy
sacrifices; And thy burnt-offerings are continually before me.

<span id="an_50:9">50:9</span> I will take no bullock out of thy house,
Nor he-goats out of thy folds.

<span id="an_50:10">50:10</span> For every beast of the forest is mine,
And the cattle upon a thousand hills.

<span id="an_50:11">50:11</span> I know all the birds of the mountains;
And the wild beasts of the field are mine.

<span id="an_50:12">50:12</span> If I were hungry, I would not tell
thee; For the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.

<span id="an_50:13">50:13</span> Will I eat the flesh of bulls, Or drink
the blood of goats?

<span id="an_50:14">50:14</span> Offer unto God the sacrifice of
thanksgiving; And pay thy vows unto the Most High:

<span id="an_50:15">50:15</span> And call upon me in the day of trouble;
I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.

<span id="an_50:16">50:16</span> But unto the wicked God saith, What
hast thou to do to declare my statutes, And that thou hast taken my
covenant in thy mouth,

<span id="an_50:17">50:17</span> Seeing thou hatest instruction, And
castest my words behind thee?

<span id="an_50:18">50:18</span> When thou sawest a thief, thou
consentedst with him, And hast been partaker with adulterers.

<span id="an_50:19">50:19</span> Thou givest thy mouth to evil, And thy
tongue frameth deceit.

<span id="an_50:20">50:20</span> Thou sittest and speakest against thy
brother; Thou slanderest thine own mother's son.

<span id="an_50:21">50:21</span> These things hast thou done, and I kept
silence; Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thyself:
\[But\] I will reprove thee, and set \[them\] in order before thine
eyes.

<span id="an_50:22">50:22</span> Now consider this, ye that forget God,
Lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver:

<span id="an_50:23">50:23</span> Whoso offereth the sacrifice of
thanksgiving glorifieth me; And to him that ordereth his way \[aright\]
Will I show the salvation of God.

<span id="an_51:1">51:1</span> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David;
when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to
Bathsheba. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
According to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
transgressions.

<span id="an_51:2">51:2</span> Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity,
And cleanse me from my sin.

<span id="an_51:3">51:3</span> For I know my transgressions; And my sin
is ever before me.

<span id="an_51:4">51:4</span> Against thee, thee only, have I sinned,
And done that which is evil in thy sight; That thou mayest be justified
when thou speakest, And be clear when thou judgest.

<span id="an_51:5">51:5</span> Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity;
And in sin did my mother conceive me.

<span id="an_51:6">51:6</span> Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward
parts; And in the hidden part thou wilt make me to know wisdom.

<span id="an_51:7">51:7</span> Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be
clean: Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

<span id="an_51:8">51:8</span> Make me to hear joy and gladness, That
the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.

<span id="an_51:9">51:9</span> Hide thy face from my sins, And blot out
all mine iniquities.

<span id="an_51:10">51:10</span> Create in me a clean heart, O God; And
renew a right spirit within me.

<span id="an_51:11">51:11</span> Cast me not away from thy presence; And
take not thy holy Spirit from me.

<span id="an_51:12">51:12</span> Restore unto me the joy of thy
salvation; And uphold me with a willing spirit.

<span id="an_51:13">51:13</span> Then will I teach transgressors thy
ways; And sinners shall be converted unto thee.

<span id="an_51:14">51:14</span> Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God,
thou God of my salvation; \[And\] my tongue shall sing aloud of thy
righteousness.

<span id="an_51:15">51:15</span> O Lord, open thou my lips; And my mouth
shall show forth thy praise.

<span id="an_51:16">51:16</span> For thou delightest not in sacrifice;
else would I give it: Thou hast no pleasure in burnt-offering.

<span id="an_51:17">51:17</span> The sacrifices of God are a broken
spirit: A broken and contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

<span id="an_51:18">51:18</span> Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion:
Build thou the walls of Jerusalem.

<span id="an_51:19">51:19</span> Then will thou delight in the
sacrifices of righteousness, In burnt-offering and in whole
burnt-offering: Then will they offer bullocks upon thine altar.

<span id="an_52:1">52:1</span> For the Chief Musician. Maschil of David;
when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, David is
come to the house of Abimelech. Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O
mighty man? The lovingkindness of God \[endureth\] continually.

<span id="an_52:2">52:2</span> Thy tongue deviseth very wickedness, Like
a sharp razor, working deceitfully.

<span id="an_52:3">52:3</span> Thou lovest evil more than good, And
lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah

<span id="an_52:4">52:4</span> Thou lovest all devouring words, thou
deceitful tongue.

<span id="an_52:5">52:5</span> God will likewise destroy thee for ever;
He will take thee up, and pluck thee out of thy tent, And root thee out
of the land of the living. Selah

<span id="an_52:6">52:6</span> The righteous also shall see \[it\], and
fear, And shall laugh at him, \[saying\],

<span id="an_52:7">52:7</span> Lo, this is the man that made not God his
strength, But trusted in the abundance of his riches, And strengthened
himself in his wickedness.

<span id="an_52:8">52:8</span> But as for me, I am like a green
olive-tree in the house of God: I trust in the lovingkindness of God for
ever and ever.

<span id="an_52:9">52:9</span> I will give thee thanks for ever, because
thou hast done it; And I will hope in thy name, for it is good, in the
presence of thy saints.

<span id="an_53:1">53:1</span> For the Chief Musician; set to Mahalath.
Maschil of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.
Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity; There is none that
doeth good.

<span id="an_53:2">53:2</span> God looked down from heaven upon the
children of men, To see if there were any that did understand, That did
seek after God.

<span id="an_53:3">53:3</span> Every one of them is gone back; they are
together become filthy; There is none that doeth good, no, not one.

<span id="an_53:4">53:4</span> Have the workers of iniquity no
knowledge, Who eat up my people \[as\] they eat bread, And call not upon
God?

<span id="an_53:5">53:5</span> There were they in great fear, where no
fear was; For God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against
thee: Thou hast put them to shame, because of God hath rejected them.

<span id="an_53:6">53:6</span> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come
out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Then
shall Jacob rejoice, \[and\] Israel shall be glad.

<span id="an_54:1">54:1</span> For the Chief Musician; on stringed
instruments. Maschil of David; when the Ziphites came and said to Saul,
Doth not David hide himself with us? Save me, O God, by thy name, And
judge me in thy might.

<span id="an_54:2">54:2</span> Hear my prayer, O God; Give ear to the
words of my mouth.

<span id="an_54:3">54:3</span> For strangers are risen up against me,
And violent men have sought after my soul: They have not set God before
them. Selah

<span id="an_54:4">54:4</span> Behold, God is my helper: The Lord is of
them that uphold my soul.

<span id="an_54:5">54:5</span> He will requite the evil unto mine
enemies: Destroy thou them in thy truth.

<span id="an_54:6">54:6</span> With a freewill-offering will I sacrifice
unto thee: I will give thanks unto thy name, O Jehovah, for it is good.

<span id="an_54:7">54:7</span> For he hath delivered me out of all
trouble; And mine eye hath seen \[my desire\] upon mine enemies.

<span id="an_55:1">55:1</span> For the Chief Musician; on stringed
instruments. Maschil of David. Give ear to my prayer, O God; And hide
not thyself from my supplication.

<span id="an_55:2">55:2</span> Attend unto me, and answer me: I am
restless in my complaint, and moan,

<span id="an_55:3">55:3</span> Because of the voice of the enemy,
Because of the oppression of the wicked; For they cast iniquity upon me,
And in anger they persecute me.

<span id="an_55:4">55:4</span> My heart is sore pained within me: And
the terrors of death are fallen upon me.

<span id="an_55:5">55:5</span> Fearfulness and trembling are come upon
me, And horror hath overwhelmed me.

<span id="an_55:6">55:6</span> And I said, Oh that I had wings like a
dove! Then would I fly away, and be at rest.

<span id="an_55:7">55:7</span> Lo, then would I wander far off, I would
lodge in the wilderness. Selah

<span id="an_55:8">55:8</span> I would haste me to a shelter From the
stormy wind and tempest.

<span id="an_55:9">55:9</span> Destroy, O Lord, \[and\] divide their
tongue; For I have seen violence and strife in the city.

<span id="an_55:10">55:10</span> Day and night they go about it upon the
walls thereof: Iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it.

<span id="an_55:11">55:11</span> Wickedness is in the midst thereof:
Oppression and guile depart not from its streets.

<span id="an_55:12">55:12</span> For it was not an enemy that reproached
me; Then I could have borne it: Neither was it he that hated me that did
magnify himself against me; Then I would have hid myself from him:

<span id="an_55:13">55:13</span> But it was thou, a man mine equal, My
companion, and my familiar friend.

<span id="an_55:14">55:14</span> We took sweet counsel together; We
walked in the house of God with the throng.

<span id="an_55:15">55:15</span> Let death come suddenly upon them, Let
them go down alive into Sheol; For wickedness is in their dwelling, in
the midst of them.

<span id="an_55:16">55:16</span> As for me, I will call upon God; And
Jehovah will save me.

<span id="an_55:17">55:17</span> Evening, and morning, and at noonday,
will I complain, and moan; And he will hear my voice.

<span id="an_55:18">55:18</span> He hath redeemed my soul in peace from
the battle that was against me; For they were many \[that strove\] with
me.

<span id="an_55:19">55:19</span> God will hear, and answer them, Even he
that abideth of old, Selah \[The men\] who have no changes, And who fear
not God.

<span id="an_55:20">55:20</span> He hath put forth his hands against
such as were at peace with him: He hath profaned his covenant.

<span id="an_55:21">55:21</span> His mouth was smooth as butter, But his
heart was war: His words were softer than oil, Yet were they drawn
swords.

<span id="an_55:22">55:22</span> Cast thy burden upon Jehovah, and he
will sustain thee: He will never suffer the righteous to be moved.

<span id="an_55:23">55:23</span> But thou, O God, wilt bring them down
into the pit of destruction: Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not
live out half their days; But I will trust in thee.

<span id="an_56:1">56:1</span> For the Chief Musician; set to Jonath
elem rehokim. \[A Psalm\] of David. Michtam: when the Philistines took
him in Gath. Be merciful unto me, O God; for man would swallow me up:
All the day long he fighting oppresseth me.

<span id="an_56:2">56:2</span> Mine enemies would swallow me up all the
day long; For they are many that fight proudly against me.

<span id="an_56:3">56:3</span> What time I am afraid, I will put my
trust in thee.

<span id="an_56:4">56:4</span> In God (I will praise his word), In God
have I put my trust, I will not be afraid; What can flesh do unto me?

<span id="an_56:5">56:5</span> All the day long they wrest my words: All
their thoughts are against me for evil.

<span id="an_56:6">56:6</span> They gather themselves together, they
hide themselves, They mark my steps, Even as they have waited for my
soul.

<span id="an_56:7">56:7</span> Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger
cast down the peoples, O God.

<span id="an_56:8">56:8</span> Thou numberest my wanderings: Put thou my
tears into thy bottle; Are they not in thy book?

<span id="an_56:9">56:9</span> Then shall mine enemies turn back in the
day that I call: This I know, that God is for me.

<span id="an_56:10">56:10</span> In God (I will praise \[his\] word), In
Jehovah (I will praise \[his\] word),

<span id="an_56:11">56:11</span> In God have I put my trust, I will not
be afraid; What can man do unto me?

<span id="an_56:12">56:12</span> Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will
render thank-offerings unto thee.

<span id="an_56:13">56:13</span> For thou hast delivered my soul from
death: \[Hast thou\] not \[delivered\] my feet from falling, That I may
walk before God In the light of the living?

<span id="an_57:1">57:1</span> For the Chief Musician; \[set to\]
Al-tash-heth. \[A Psalm\] of David. Michtam; when he fled from Saul, in
the cave. Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me; For my soul
taketh refuge in thee: Yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I take
refuge, Until \[these\] calamities be overpast.

<span id="an_57:2">57:2</span> I will cry unto God Most High, Unto God
that performeth \[all things\] for me.

<span id="an_57:3">57:3</span> He will send from heaven, and save me,
\[When\] he that would swallow me up reproacheth; Selah God will send
forth his lovingkindness and his truth.

<span id="an_57:4">57:4</span> My soul is among lions; I lie among them
that are set on fire, Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and
arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword.

<span id="an_57:5">57:5</span> Be thou exalted, O God, above the
heavens; \[Let\] thy glory \[be\] above all the earth.

<span id="an_57:6">57:6</span> They have prepared a net for my steps; My
soul is bowed down: They have digged a pit before me; They are fallen
into the midst thereof themselves. Selah

<span id="an_57:7">57:7</span> My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is
fixed: I will sing, yea, I will sing praises.

<span id="an_57:8">57:8</span> Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and
harp: I myself will awake right early.

<span id="an_57:9">57:9</span> I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord,
among the peoples: I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.

<span id="an_57:10">57:10</span> For thy lovingkindness is great unto
the heavens, And thy truth unto the skies.

<span id="an_57:11">57:11</span> Be thou exalted, O God, above the
heavens; \[Let\] thy glory \[be\] above all the earth.

<span id="an_58:1">58:1</span> For the Chief Musician; \[set to\]
Al-tashheth. \[A Psalm\] of David. Michtam. Do ye indeed in silence
speak righteousness? Do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?

<span id="an_58:2">58:2</span> Nay, in heart ye work wickedness; Ye
weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth.

<span id="an_58:3">58:3</span> The wicked are estranged from the womb:
They go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.

<span id="an_58:4">58:4</span> Their poison is like the poison of a
serpent: \[They are\] like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear,

<span id="an_58:5">58:5</span> Which hearkeneth not to the voice of
charmers, Charming never so wisely.

<span id="an_58:6">58:6</span> Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth:
Break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Jehovah.

<span id="an_58:7">58:7</span> Let them melt away as water that runneth
apace: When he aimeth his arrows, let them be as though they were cut
off.

<span id="an_58:8">58:8</span> \[Let them be\] as a snail which melteth
and passeth away, \[Like\] the untimely birth of a woman, that hath not
seen the sun.

<span id="an_58:9">58:9</span> Before your pots can feel the thorns, He
will take them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.

<span id="an_58:10">58:10</span> The righteous shall rejoice when he
seeth the vengeance: He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked;

<span id="an_58:11">58:11</span> So that men shall say, Verily there is
a reward for the righteous: Verily there is a God that judgeth in the
earth.

<span id="an_59:1">59:1</span> For the Chief Musician; \[set to\]
Al-tashheth. \[A Psalm\] of David. Michtam; when Saul sent, and they
watched the house to kill him. Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God:
Set me on high from them that rise up against me.

<span id="an_59:2">59:2</span> Deliver me from the workers of iniquity,
And save me from the bloodthirsty men.

<span id="an_59:3">59:3</span> For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul;
The mighty gather themselves together against me: Not for my
transgression, nor for my sin, O Jehovah.

<span id="an_59:4">59:4</span> They run and prepare themselves without
\[my\] fault: Awake thou to help me, and behold.

<span id="an_59:5">59:5</span> Even thou, O Jehovah God of hosts, the
God of Israel, Arise to visit all the nations: Be not merciful to any
wicked transgressors. Selah

<span id="an_59:6">59:6</span> They return at evening, they howl like a
dog, And go round about the city.

<span id="an_59:7">59:7</span> Behold, they belch out with their mouth;
Swords are in their lips: For who, \[say they\], doth hear?

<span id="an_59:8">59:8</span> But thou, O Jehovah, wilt laugh at them;
Thou wilt have all the nations in derision.

<span id="an_59:9">59:9</span> \[Because of\] his strength I will give
heed unto thee; For God is my high tower.

<span id="an_59:10">59:10</span> My God with his lovingkindness will
meet me: God will let me see \[my desire\] upon mine enemies.

<span id="an_59:11">59:11</span> Slay them not, lest my people forget:
Scatter them by thy power, and bring them down, O Lord our shield.

<span id="an_59:12">59:12</span> \[For\] the sin of their mouth, \[and\]
the words of their lips, Let them even be taken in their pride, And for
cursing and lying which they speak.

<span id="an_59:13">59:13</span> Consume them in wrath, consume them, so
that they shall be no more: And let them know that God ruleth in Jacob,
Unto the ends of the earth. Selah

<span id="an_59:14">59:14</span> And at evening let them return, let
them howl like a dog, And go round about the city.

<span id="an_59:15">59:15</span> They shall wander up and down for food,
And tarry all night if they be not satisfied.

<span id="an_59:16">59:16</span> But I will sing of thy strength; Yea, I
will sing aloud of thy lovingkindness in the morning: For thou hast been
my high tower, And a refuge in the day of my distress.

<span id="an_59:17">59:17</span> Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing
praises: For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.

<span id="an_60:1">60:1</span> For the Chief Musician; \[set to\]
Shushan Eduth. Michtam of David, to teach; and when he strove with
Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and Joab returned, and smote of Edom
in the Valley of Salt twelve thousand. O God thou hast cast us off, thou
hast broken us down; Thou hast been angry; oh restore us again.

<span id="an_60:2">60:2</span> Thou hast made the land to tremble; thou
hast rent it: Heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.

<span id="an_60:3">60:3</span> Thou hast showed thy people hard things:
Thou hast made us to drink the wine of staggering.

<span id="an_60:4">60:4</span> Thou hast given a banner to them that
fear thee, That it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah

<span id="an_60:5">60:5</span> That thy beloved may be delivered, Save
with thy right hand, and answer us.

<span id="an_60:6">60:6</span> God hath spoken in his holiness: I will
exult; I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

<span id="an_60:7">60:7</span> Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine;
Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre.

<span id="an_60:8">60:8</span> Moab is my washpot; Upon Edom will I cast
my shoe: Philistia, shout thou because of me.

<span id="an_60:9">60:9</span> Who will bring me into the strong city?
Who hath led me unto Edom?

<span id="an_60:10">60:10</span> Hast not thou, O God, cast us off? And
thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts.

<span id="an_60:11">60:11</span> Give us help against the adversary; For
vain is the help of man.

<span id="an_60:12">60:12</span> Through God we shall do valiantly; For
he it is that will tread down our adversaries.

<span id="an_61:1">61:1</span> For the Chief Musician; on a stringed
instrument. \[A Psalm\] of David. Hear my cry, O God; Attend unto my
prayer.

<span id="an_61:2">61:2</span> From the end of the earth will I call
unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: Lead me to the rock that is
higher than I.

<span id="an_61:3">61:3</span> For thou hast been a refuge for me, A
strong tower from the enemy.

<span id="an_61:4">61:4</span> I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever:
I will take refuge in the covert of thy wings. Selah

<span id="an_61:5">61:5</span> For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: Thou
hast given \[me\] the heritage of those that fear thy name.

<span id="an_61:6">61:6</span> Thou wilt prolong the king's life; His
years shall be as many generations.

<span id="an_61:7">61:7</span> He shall abide before God for ever: Oh
prepare lovingkindness and truth, that they may preserve him.

<span id="an_61:8">61:8</span> So will I sing praise unto thy name for
ever, That I may daily perform my vows.

<span id="an_62:1">62:1</span> For the Chief Musician; after the manner
of Jeduthan. A Psalm of David. My soul waiteth in silence for God only:
From him \[cometh\] my salvation.

<span id="an_62:2">62:2</span> He only is my rock and my salvation: \[He
is\] my high tower; I shall not be greatly moved.

<span id="an_62:3">62:3</span> How long will ye set upon a man, That ye
may slay \[him\], all of you, Like a leaning wall, like a tottering
fence?

<span id="an_62:4">62:4</span> They only consult to thrust him down from
his dignity; They delight in lies; They bless with their mouth, but they
curse inwardly. Selah

<span id="an_62:5">62:5</span> My soul, wait thou in silence for God
only; For my expectation is from him.

<span id="an_62:6">62:6</span> He only is my rock and my salvation: \[He
is\] my high tower; I shall not be moved.

<span id="an_62:7">62:7</span> With God is my salvation and my glory:
The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.

<span id="an_62:8">62:8</span> Trust in him at all times, ye people;
Pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah

<span id="an_62:9">62:9</span> Surely men of low degree are vanity, and
men of high degree are a lie: In the balances they will go up; They are
together lighter than vanity.

<span id="an_62:10">62:10</span> Trust not in oppression, And become not
vain in robbery: If riches increase, set not your heart \[thereon\].

<span id="an_62:11">62:11</span> God hath spoken once, Twice have I
heard this, That power belongeth unto God.

<span id="an_62:12">62:12</span> Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth
lovingkindness; For thou renderest to every man according to his work.

<span id="an_63:1">63:1</span> A Psalm of David when he was in the
wilderness of Judah. O God, thou art my God; earnestly will I seek thee:
My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee, In a dry and
weary land, where no water is.

<span id="an_63:2">63:2</span> So have I looked upon thee in the
sanctuary, To see thy power and thy glory.

<span id="an_63:3">63:3</span> Because thy lovingkindness is better than
life, My lips shall praise thee.

<span id="an_63:4">63:4</span> So will I bless thee while I live: I will
lift up my hands in thy name.

<span id="an_63:5">63:5</span> My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow
and fatness; And my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips;

<span id="an_63:6">63:6</span> When I remember thee upon my bed, \[And\]
meditate on thee in the night-watches.

<span id="an_63:7">63:7</span> For thou hast been my help, And in the
shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.

<span id="an_63:8">63:8</span> My soul followeth hard after thee: Thy
right hand upholdeth me.

<span id="an_63:9">63:9</span> But those that seek my soul, to destroy
it, Shall go into the lower parts of the earth.

<span id="an_63:10">63:10</span> They shall be given over to the power
of the sword: They shall be a portion for foxes.

<span id="an_63:11">63:11</span> But the king shall rejoice in God:
Every one that sweareth by him shall glory; For the mouth of them that
speak lies shall be stopped.

<span id="an_64:1">64:1</span> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.
Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint: Preserve my life from fear of the
enemy.

<span id="an_64:2">64:2</span> Hide me from the secret counsel of
evil-doers, From the tumult of the workers of iniquity;

<span id="an_64:3">64:3</span> Who have whet their tongue like a sword,
And have aimed their arrows, even bitter words,

<span id="an_64:4">64:4</span> That they may shoot in secret places at
the perfect: Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.

<span id="an_64:5">64:5</span> They encourage themselves in an evil
purpose; They commune of laying snares privily; They say, Who will see
them?

<span id="an_64:6">64:6</span> They search out iniquities; We have
accomplished, \[say they\], a diligent search: And the inward thought
and the heart of every one is deep.

<span id="an_64:7">64:7</span> But God will shoot at them; With an arrow
suddenly shall they be wounded.

<span id="an_64:8">64:8</span> So they shall be made to stumble, their
own tongue being against them: All that see them shall wag the head.

<span id="an_64:9">64:9</span> And all men shall fear; And they shall
declare the work of God, And shall wisely consider of his doing.

<span id="an_64:10">64:10</span> The righteous shall be glad in Jehovah,
and shall take refuge in him; And all the upright in heart shall glory.

<span id="an_65:1">65:1</span> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm. A song
of David. Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion; And unto thee shall
the vow be performed.

<span id="an_65:2">65:2</span> O thou that hearest prayer, Unto thee
shall all flesh come.

<span id="an_65:3">65:3</span> Iniquities prevail against me: As for our
transgressions, thou wilt forgive them.

<span id="an_65:4">65:4</span> Blessed is the man whom thou choosest,
and causest to approach \[unto thee\], That he may dwell in thy courts:
We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, Thy holy temple.

<span id="an_65:5">65:5</span> By terrible things thou wilt answer us in
righteousness, Oh God of our salvation, Thou that art the confidence of
all the ends of the earth, And of them that are afar off upon the sea:

<span id="an_65:6">65:6</span> Who by his strength setteth fast the
mountains, Being girded about with might;

<span id="an_65:7">65:7</span> Who stilleth the roaring of the seas, The
roaring of their waves, And the tumult of the peoples.

<span id="an_65:8">65:8</span> They also that dwell in the uttermost
parts are afraid at thy tokens: Thou makest the outgoings of the morning
and evening to rejoice.

<span id="an_65:9">65:9</span> Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it,
Thou greatly enrichest it; The river of God is full of water: Thou
providest them grain, when thou hast so prepared the earth.

<span id="an_65:10">65:10</span> Thou waterest its furrows abundantly;
Thou settlest the ridges thereof: Thou makest it soft with showers; Thou
blessest the springing thereof.

<span id="an_65:11">65:11</span> Thou crownest the year with thy
goodness; And thy paths drop fatness.

<span id="an_65:12">65:12</span> They drop upon the pastures of the
wilderness; And the hills are girded with joy.

<span id="an_65:13">65:13</span> The pastures are clothed with flocks;
The valleys also are covered over with grain; They shout for joy, they
also sing.

<span id="an_66:1">66:1</span> For the Chief Musician. A song, a Psalm.
Make a joyful noise unto God, all the earth:

<span id="an_66:2">66:2</span> Sing forth the glory of his name: Make
his praise glorious.

<span id="an_66:3">66:3</span> Say unto God, How terrible are thy works!
Through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves
unto thee.

<span id="an_66:4">66:4</span> All the earth shall worship thee, And
shall sing unto thee; They shall sing to thy name. Selah

<span id="an_66:5">66:5</span> Come, and see the works of God; \[He is\]
terrible in his doing toward the children of men.

<span id="an_66:6">66:6</span> He turned the sea into dry land; They
went through the river on foot: There did we rejoice in him.

<span id="an_66:7">66:7</span> He ruleth by his might for ever; His eyes
observe the nations: Let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah

<span id="an_66:8">66:8</span> Oh bless our God, ye peoples, And make
the voice of his praise to be heard;

<span id="an_66:9">66:9</span> Who holdeth our soul in life, And
suffereth not our feet to be moved.

<span id="an_66:10">66:10</span> For thou, O God, hast proved us: Thou
hast tried us, as silver is tried.

<span id="an_66:11">66:11</span> Thou broughtest us into the net; Thou
layedst a sore burden upon our loins.

<span id="an_66:12">66:12</span> Thou didst cause men to ride over our
heads; We went through fire and through water; But thou broughtest us
out into a wealthy place.

<span id="an_66:13">66:13</span> I will come into thy house with
burnt-offerings; I will pay thee my vows,

<span id="an_66:14">66:14</span> Which my lips uttered, And my mouth
spake, when I was in distress.

<span id="an_66:15">66:15</span> I will offer unto thee burnt-offerings
of fatlings, With the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats.
Selah

<span id="an_66:16">66:16</span> Come, and hear, all ye that fear God,
And I will declare what he hath done for my soul.

<span id="an_66:17">66:17</span> I cried unto him with my mouth, And he
was extolled with my tongue.

<span id="an_66:18">66:18</span> If I regard iniquity in my heart, The
Lord will not hear:

<span id="an_66:19">66:19</span> But verily God hath heard; He hath
attended to the voice of my prayer.

<span id="an_66:20">66:20</span> Blessed be God, Who hath not turned
away my prayer, Nor his lovingkindness from me.

<span id="an_67:1">67:1</span> For the Chief Musician; on stringed
instruments. A Psalm, a song. God be merciful unto us, and bless us,
\[And\] cause his face to shine upon us; Selah

<span id="an_67:2">67:2</span> That thy way may be known upon earth, Thy
salvation among all nations.

<span id="an_67:3">67:3</span> Let the peoples praise thee, O God; Let
all the peoples praise thee.

<span id="an_67:4">67:4</span> Oh let the nations be glad and sing for
joy; For thou wilt judge the peoples with equity, And govern the nations
upon earth. Selah

<span id="an_67:5">67:5</span> Let the peoples praise thee, O God; Let
all the peoples praise thee.

<span id="an_67:6">67:6</span> The earth hath yielded its increase: God,
even our own God, will bless us.

<span id="an_67:7">67:7</span> God will bless us; And all the ends of
the earth shall fear him.

<span id="an_68:1">68:1</span> For the Chief Musician; A Psalm of David,
a song. Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered; Let them also that
hate him flee before him.

<span id="an_68:2">68:2</span> As smoke is driven away, so drive them
away: As wax melteth before the fire, So let the wicked perish at the
presence of God.

<span id="an_68:3">68:3</span> But let the righteous be glad; let them
exult before God: Yea, let them rejoice with gladness.

<span id="an_68:4">68:4</span> Sing unto God, sing praises to his name:
Cast up a highway for him that rideth through the deserts; His name is
Jehovah; and exult ye before him.

<span id="an_68:5">68:5</span> A father of the fatherless, and a judge
of the widows, Is God in his holy habitation.

<span id="an_68:6">68:6</span> God setteth the solitary in families: He
bringeth out the prisoners into prosperity; But the rebellious dwell in
a parched land.

<span id="an_68:7">68:7</span> O God, when thou wentest forth before thy
people, When thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah

<span id="an_68:8">68:8</span> The earth trembled, The heavens also
dropped \[rain\] at the presence of God: Yon Sinai \[trembled\] at the
presence of God, the God of Israel.

<span id="an_68:9">68:9</span> Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain,
Thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.

<span id="an_68:10">68:10</span> Thy congregation dwelt therein: Thou, O
God, didst prepare of thy goodness for the poor.

<span id="an_68:11">68:11</span> The Lord giveth the word: The women
that publish the tidings are a great host.

<span id="an_68:12">68:12</span> Kings of armies flee, they flee; And
she that tarrieth at home divideth the spoil.

<span id="an_68:13">68:13</span> When ye lie among the sheepfolds, \[It
is as\] the wings of a dove covered with silver, And her pinions with
yellow gold.

<span id="an_68:14">68:14</span> When the Almighty scattered kings
therein, \[It was as when\] it snoweth in Zalmon.

<span id="an_68:15">68:15</span> A mountain of God is the mountain of
Bashan; A high mountain is the mountain of Bashan.

<span id="an_68:16">68:16</span> Why look ye askance, ye high mountains,
At the mountain which God hath desired for his abode? Yea, Jehovah will
dwell \[in it\] for ever.

<span id="an_68:17">68:17</span> The chariots of God are twenty
thousand, even thousands upon thousands; The Lord is among them, \[as
in\] Sinai, in the sanctuary.

<span id="an_68:18">68:18</span> Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast
led away captives; Thou hast received gifts among men, Yea, \[among\]
the rebellious also, that Jehovah God might dwell \[with them\].

<span id="an_68:19">68:19</span> Blessed be the Lord, who daily beareth
our burden, Even the God who is our salvation. Selah

<span id="an_68:20">68:20</span> God is unto us a God of deliverances;
And unto Jehovah the Lord belongeth escape from death.

<span id="an_68:21">68:21</span> But God will smite through the head of
his enemies, The hairy scalp of such a one as goeth on still in his
guiltiness.

<span id="an_68:22">68:22</span> The Lord said, I will bring again from
Bashan, I will bring \[them\] again from the depths of the sea;

<span id="an_68:23">68:23</span> That thou mayest crush \[them\],
\[dipping\] thy foot in blood, That the tongue of thy dogs may have its
portion from \[thine\] enemies.

<span id="an_68:24">68:24</span> They have seen thy goings, O God, Even
the goings of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.

<span id="an_68:25">68:25</span> The singers went before, the minstrels
followed after, In the midst of the damsels playing with timbrels.

<span id="an_68:26">68:26</span> Bless ye God in the congregations, Even
the Lord, \[ye that are\] of the fountain of Israel.

<span id="an_68:27">68:27</span> There is little Benjamin their ruler,
The princes of Judah \[and\] their council, The princes of Zebulun, the
princes of Naphtali.

<span id="an_68:28">68:28</span> Thy God hath commanded thy strength:
Strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.

<span id="an_68:29">68:29</span> Because of thy temple at Jerusalem
Kings shall bring presents unto thee.

<span id="an_68:30">68:30</span> Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds, The
multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples, Trampling under
foot the pieces of silver: He hath scattered the peoples that delight in
war.

<span id="an_68:31">68:31</span> Princes shall come out of Egypt;
Ethiopia shall haste to stretch out her hands unto God.

<span id="an_68:32">68:32</span> Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the
earth; Oh sing praises unto the Lord; Selah

<span id="an_68:33">68:33</span> To him that rideth upon the heaven of
heavens, which are of old; Lo, he uttereth his voice, a mighty voice.

<span id="an_68:34">68:34</span> Ascribe ye strength unto God: His
excellency is over Israel, And his strength is in the skies.

<span id="an_68:35">68:35</span> O God, \[thou art\] terrible out of thy
holy places: The God of Israel, he giveth strength and power unto
\[his\] people. Blessed be God.

<span id="an_69:1">69:1</span> For the Chief Musician; set to Shoshanim.
\[A Psalm\] of David. Save me, O God; For the waters are come in unto my
soul.

<span id="an_69:2">69:2</span> I sink in deep mire, where there is no
standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.

<span id="an_69:3">69:3</span> I am weary with my crying; my throat is
dried: Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.

<span id="an_69:4">69:4</span> They that hate me without a cause are
more than the hairs of my head: They that would cut me off, being mine
enemies wrongfully, are mighty: That which I took not away I have to
restore.

<span id="an_69:5">69:5</span> O God, thou knowest my foolishness; And
my sins are not hid from thee.

<span id="an_69:6">69:6</span> Let not them that wait for thee be put to
shame through me, O Lord Jehovah of hosts: Let not those that seek thee
be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel.

<span id="an_69:7">69:7</span> Because for thy sake I have borne
reproach; Shame hath covered my face.

<span id="an_69:8">69:8</span> I am become a stranger unto my brethren,
And an alien unto my mother's children.

<span id="an_69:9">69:9</span> For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me
up; And the reproaches of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me.

<span id="an_69:10">69:10</span> When I wept, \[and chastened\] my soul
with fasting, That was to my reproach.

<span id="an_69:11">69:11</span> When I made sackcloth my clothing, I
became a byword unto them.

<span id="an_69:12">69:12</span> They that sit in the gate talk of me;
And \[I am\] the song of the drunkards.

<span id="an_69:13">69:13</span> But as for me, my prayer is unto thee,
O Jehovah, in an acceptable time: O God, in the abundance of thy
lovingkindness, Answer me in the truth of thy salvation.

<span id="an_69:14">69:14</span> Deliver me out of the mire, and let me
not sink: Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the
deep waters.

<span id="an_69:15">69:15</span> Let not the waterflood overwhelm me,
Neither let the deep shallow me up; And let not the pit shut its mouth
upon me.

<span id="an_69:16">69:16</span> Answer me, O Jehovah; for thy
lovingkindness is good: According to the multitude of thy tender mercies
turn thou unto me.

<span id="an_69:17">69:17</span> And hide not thy face from thy servant;
For I am in distress; answer me speedily.

<span id="an_69:18">69:18</span> Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it:
Ransom me because of mine enemies.

<span id="an_69:19">69:19</span> Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame,
and my dishonor: Mine adversaries are all before thee.

<span id="an_69:20">69:20</span> Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am
full of heaviness: And I looked for some to take pity, but there was
none; And for comforters, but I found none.

<span id="an_69:21">69:21</span> They gave me also gall for my food; And
in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.

<span id="an_69:22">69:22</span> Let their table before them become a
snare; And when they are in peace, \[let it become\] a trap.

<span id="an_69:23">69:23</span> Let their eyes be darkened, so that
they cannot see; And make their loins continually to shake.

<span id="an_69:24">69:24</span> Pour out thine indignation upon them,
And let the fierceness of thine anger overtake them.

<span id="an_69:25">69:25</span> Let their habitation be desolate; Let
none dwell in their tents.

<span id="an_69:26">69:26</span> For they persecute him whom thou hast
smitten; And they tell of the sorrow of those whom thou hast wounded.

<span id="an_69:27">69:27</span> Add iniquity unto their iniquity; And
let them not come into thy righteousness.

<span id="an_69:28">69:28</span> Let them be blotted out of the book of
life, And not be written with the righteous.

<span id="an_69:29">69:29</span> But I am poor and sorrowful: Let thy
salvation, O God, set me up on high.

<span id="an_69:30">69:30</span> I will praise the name of God with a
song, And will magnify him with thanksgiving.

<span id="an_69:31">69:31</span> And it will please Jehovah better than
an ox, \[Or\] a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.

<span id="an_69:32">69:32</span> The meek have seen it, and are glad: Ye
that seek after God, let your heart live.

<span id="an_69:33">69:33</span> For Jehovah heareth the needy, And
despiseth not his prisoners.

<span id="an_69:34">69:34</span> Let heaven and earth praise him, The
seas, and everything that moveth therein.

<span id="an_69:35">69:35</span> For God will save Zion, and build the
cities of Judah; And they shall abide there, and have it in possession.

<span id="an_69:36">69:36</span> The seed also of his servants shall
inherit it; And they that love his name shall dwell therein.

<span id="an_70:1">70:1</span> For the Chief Musician. \[A Psalm\] of
David; to bring to remembrance. \[Make haste\], O God, to deliver me;
Make haste to help me, O Jehovah.

<span id="an_70:2">70:2</span> Let them be put to shame and confounded
That seek after my soul: Let them be turned backward and brought to
dishonor That delight in my hurt.

<span id="an_70:3">70:3</span> Let them be turned back by reason of
their shame That say, Aha, aha.

<span id="an_70:4">70:4</span> Let all those that seek thee rejoice and
be glad in thee; And let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let
God be magnified.

<span id="an_70:5">70:5</span> But I am poor and needy; Make haste unto
me, O God: Thou art my help and my deliverer; O Jehovah, make no
tarrying.

<span id="an_71:1">71:1</span> In thee, O Jehovah, do I take refuge: Let
me never be put to shame.

<span id="an_71:2">71:2</span> Deliver me in thy righteousness, and
rescue me: Bow down thine ear unto me, and save me.

<span id="an_71:3">71:3</span> Be thou to me a rock of habitation,
whereunto I may continually resort: Thou hast given commandment to save
me; For thou art my rock and my fortress.

<span id="an_71:4">71:4</span> Rescue me, O my God, out of the hand of
the wicked, Out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

<span id="an_71:5">71:5</span> For thou art my hope, O Lord Jehovah:
\[Thou art\] my trust from my youth.

<span id="an_71:6">71:6</span> By thee have I been holden up from the
womb; Thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: My praise
shall be continually of thee.

<span id="an_71:7">71:7</span> I am as a wonder unto many; But thou art
my strong refuge.

<span id="an_71:8">71:8</span> My mouth shall be filled with thy praise,
And with thy honor all the day.

<span id="an_71:9">71:9</span> Cast me not off in the time of old age;
Forsake me not when my strength faileth.

<span id="an_71:10">71:10</span> For mine enemies speak concerning me;
And they that watch for my soul take counsel together,

<span id="an_71:11">71:11</span> Saying, God hath forsaken him: Pursue
and take him; for there is none to deliver.

<span id="an_71:12">71:12</span> O God, be not far from me; O my God,
make haste to help me.

<span id="an_71:13">71:13</span> Let them be put to shame \[and\]
consumed that are adversaries to my soul; Let them be covered with
reproach and dishonor that seek my hurt.

<span id="an_71:14">71:14</span> But I will hope continually, And will
praise thee yet more and more.

<span id="an_71:15">71:15</span> My mouth shall tell of thy
righteousness, \[And\] of thy salvation all the day; For I know not the
numbers \[thereof\].

<span id="an_71:16">71:16</span> I will come with the mighty acts of the
Lord Jehovah: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine
only.

<span id="an_71:17">71:17</span> O God, thou hast taught me from my
youth; And hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.

<span id="an_71:18">71:18</span> Yea, even when I am old and grayheaded,
O God, forsake me not, Until I have declared thy strength unto \[the
next\] generation, Thy might to every one that is to come.

<span id="an_71:19">71:19</span> Thy righteousness also, O God, is very
high; Thou who hast done great things, O God, who is like unto thee?

<span id="an_71:20">71:20</span> Thou, who hast showed us many and sore
troubles, Wilt quicken us again, And wilt bring us up again from the
depths of the earth.

<span id="an_71:21">71:21</span> Increase thou my greatness, And turn
again and comfort me.

<span id="an_71:22">71:22</span> I will also praise thee with the
psaltery, \[Even\] thy truth, O my God: Unto thee will I sing praises
with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.

<span id="an_71:23">71:23</span> My lips shall shout for joy when I sing
praises unto thee; And my soul, which thou hast redeemed.

<span id="an_71:24">71:24</span> My tongue also shall talk of thy
righteousness all the day long; For they are put to shame, for they are
confounded, that seek my hurt.

<span id="an_72:1">72:1</span> \[A Psalm\] of Solomon. Give the king thy
judgments, O God, And thy righteousness unto the king's son.

<span id="an_72:2">72:2</span> He will judge thy people with
righteousness, And thy poor with justice.

<span id="an_72:3">72:3</span> The mountains shall bring peace to the
people, And the hills, in righteousness.

<span id="an_72:4">72:4</span> He will judge the poor of the people, He
will save the children of the needy, And will break in pieces the
oppressor.

<span id="an_72:5">72:5</span> They shall fear thee while the sun
endureth, And so long as the moon, throughout all generations.

<span id="an_72:6">72:6</span> He will come down like rain upon the mown
grass, As showers that water the earth.

<span id="an_72:7">72:7</span> In his days shall the righteous flourish,
And abundance of peace, till the moon be no more.

<span id="an_72:8">72:8</span> He shall have dominion also from sea to
sea, And from the River unto the ends of the earth.

<span id="an_72:9">72:9</span> They that dwell in the wilderness shall
bow before him; And his enemies shall lick the dust.

<span id="an_72:10">72:10</span> The kings of Tarshish and of the isles
shall render tribute: The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

<span id="an_72:11">72:11</span> Yea, all kings shall fall down before
him; All nations shall serve him.

<span id="an_72:12">72:12</span> For he will deliver the needy when he
crieth, And the poor, that hath no helper.

<span id="an_72:13">72:13</span> He will have pity on the poor and
needy, And the souls of the needy he will save.

<span id="an_72:14">72:14</span> He will redeem their soul from
oppression and violence; And precious will their blood be in his sight:

<span id="an_72:15">72:15</span> And they shall live; and to him shall
be given of the gold of Sheba: And men shall pray for him continually;
They shall bless him all the day long.

<span id="an_72:16">72:16</span> There shall be abundance of grain in
the earth upon the top of the mountains; The fruit thereof shall shake
like Lebanon: And they of the city shall flourish like grass of the
earth.

<span id="an_72:17">72:17</span> His name shall endure for ever; His
name shall be continued as long as the sun: And men shall be blessed in
him; All nations shall call him happy.

<span id="an_72:18">72:18</span> Blessed be Jehovah God, the God of
Israel, Who only doeth wondrous things:

<span id="an_72:19">72:19</span> And blessed be his glorious name for
ever; And let the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen, and Amen.

<span id="an_72:20">72:20</span> The prayers of David the son of Jesse
are ended. BOOK III

<span id="an_73:1">73:1</span> A Psalm of Asaph. Surely God is good to
Israel, \[Even\] to such as are pure in heart.

<span id="an_73:2">73:2</span> But as for me, my feet were almost gone;
My steps had well nigh slipped.

<span id="an_73:3">73:3</span> For I was envious at the arrogant, When I
saw the prosperity of the wicked.

<span id="an_73:4">73:4</span> For there are no pangs in their death;
But their strength is firm.

<span id="an_73:5">73:5</span> They are not in trouble as \[other\] men;
Neither are they plagued like \[other\] men.

<span id="an_73:6">73:6</span> Therefore pride is as a chain about their
neck; Violence covereth them as a garment.

<span id="an_73:7">73:7</span> Their eyes stand out with fatness: They
have more than heart could wish.

<span id="an_73:8">73:8</span> They scoff, and in wickedness utter
oppression: They speak loftily.

<span id="an_73:9">73:9</span> They have set their mouth in the heavens,
And their tongue walketh through the earth.

<span id="an_73:10">73:10</span> Therefore his people return hither: And
waters of a full \[cup\] are drained by them.

<span id="an_73:11">73:11</span> And they say, How doth God know? And is
there knowledge in the Most High?

<span id="an_73:12">73:12</span> Behold, these are the wicked; And,
being alway at ease, they increase in riches.

<span id="an_73:13">73:13</span> Surely in vain have I cleansed my
heart, And washed my hands in innocency;

<span id="an_73:14">73:14</span> For all the day long have I been
plagued, And chastened every morning.

<span id="an_73:15">73:15</span> If I had said, I will speak thus;
Behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children.

<span id="an_73:16">73:16</span> When I thought how I might know this,
It was too painful for me;

<span id="an_73:17">73:17</span> Until I went into the sanctuary of God,
And considered their latter end.

<span id="an_73:18">73:18</span> Surely thou settest them in slippery
places: Thou castest them down to destruction.

<span id="an_73:19">73:19</span> How are they become a desolation in a
moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors.

<span id="an_73:20">73:20</span> As a dream when one awaketh, So, O
Lord, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image.

<span id="an_73:21">73:21</span> For my soul was grieved, And I was
pricked in my heart:

<span id="an_73:22">73:22</span> So brutish was I, and ignorant; I was
\[as\] a beast before thee.

<span id="an_73:23">73:23</span> Nevertheless I am continually with
thee: Thou hast holden my right hand.

<span id="an_73:24">73:24</span> Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel,
And afterward receive me to glory.

<span id="an_73:25">73:25</span> Whom have I in heaven \[but thee\]? And
there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.

<span id="an_73:26">73:26</span> My flesh and my heart faileth; \[But\]
God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever.

<span id="an_73:27">73:27</span> For, lo, they that are far from thee
shall perish: Thou hast destroyed all them that play the harlot,
\[departing\] from thee.

<span id="an_73:28">73:28</span> But it is good for me to draw near unto
God: I have made the Lord Jehovah my refuge, That I may tell of all thy
works.

<span id="an_74:1">74:1</span> Maschil of Asaph. O God, why hast thou
cast \[us\] off for ever? Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep
of thy pasture?

<span id="an_74:2">74:2</span> Remember thy congregation, which thou
hast gotten of old, Which thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of thine
inheritance; \[And\] mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.

<span id="an_74:3">74:3</span> Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual
ruins, All the evil that the enemy hath done in the sanctuary.

<span id="an_74:4">74:4</span> Thine adversaries have roared in the
midst of thine assembly; They have set up their ensigns for signs.

<span id="an_74:5">74:5</span> They seemed as men that lifted up Axes
upon a thicket of trees.

<span id="an_74:6">74:6</span> And now all the carved work thereof They
break down with hatchet and hammers.

<span id="an_74:7">74:7</span> They have set thy sanctuary on fire; They
have profaned the dwelling-place of thy name \[by casting it\] to the
ground.

<span id="an_74:8">74:8</span> They said in their heart, Let us make
havoc of them altogether: They have burned up all the synagogues of God
in the land.

<span id="an_74:9">74:9</span> We see not our signs: There is no more
any prophet; Neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.

<span id="an_74:10">74:10</span> How long, O God, shall the adversary
reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?

<span id="an_74:11">74:11</span> Why drawest thou back thy hand, even
thy right hand? \[Pluck it\] out of thy bosom \[and\] consume \[them\].

<span id="an_74:12">74:12</span> Yet God is my King of old, Working
salvation in the midst of the earth.

<span id="an_74:13">74:13</span> Thou didst divide the sea by thy
strength: Thou brakest the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.

<span id="an_74:14">74:14</span> Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in
pieces; Thou gavest him to be food to the people inhabiting the
wilderness.

<span id="an_74:15">74:15</span> Thou didst cleave fountain and flood:
Thou driedst up mighty rivers.

<span id="an_74:16">74:16</span> The day is thine, the night also is
thine: Thou hast prepared the light and the sun.

<span id="an_74:17">74:17</span> Thou hast set all the borders of the
earth: Thou hast made summer and winter.

<span id="an_74:18">74:18</span> Remember this, that the enemy hath
reproached, O Jehovah, And that a foolish people hath blasphemed thy
name.

<span id="an_74:19">74:19</span> Oh deliver not the soul of thy
turtle-dove unto the wild beast: Forget not the life of thy poor for
ever.

<span id="an_74:20">74:20</span> Have respect unto the covenant; For the
dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.

<span id="an_74:21">74:21</span> Oh let not the oppressed return
ashamed: Let the poor and needy praise thy name.

<span id="an_74:22">74:22</span> Arise, O God, plead thine own cause:
Remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee all the day.

<span id="an_74:23">74:23</span> Forget not the voice of thine
adversaries: The tumult of those that rise up against thee ascendeth
continually.

<span id="an_75:1">75:1</span> For the Chief Musician; \[set to\]
Al-tash-heth. A Psalm of Asaph; a song. We give thanks unto thee, O God;
We give thanks, for thy name is near: Men tell of thy wondrous works.

<span id="an_75:2">75:2</span> When I shall find the set time, I will
judge uprightly.

<span id="an_75:3">75:3</span> The earth and all the inhabitants thereof
are dissolved: I have set up the pillars of it. Selah

<span id="an_75:4">75:4</span> I said unto the arrogant, Deal not
arrogantly; And to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:

<span id="an_75:5">75:5</span> Lift not up your horn on high; Speak not
with a stiff neck.

<span id="an_75:6">75:6</span> For neither from the east, nor from the
west, Nor yet from the south, \[cometh\] lifting up.

<span id="an_75:7">75:7</span> But God is the judge: He putteth down
one, and lifteth up another.

<span id="an_75:8">75:8</span> For in the hand of Jehovah there is a
cup, and the wine foameth; It is full of mixture, and he poureth out of
the same: Surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall
drain them, and drink them.

<span id="an_75:9">75:9</span> But I will declare for ever, I will sing
praises to the God of Jacob.

<span id="an_75:10">75:10</span> All the horns of the wicked also will I
cut off; But the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.

<span id="an_76:1">76:1</span> For the Chief Musician; on stringed
instruments. A Psalm of Asaph, a song. In Judah is God known: His name
is great in Israel.

<span id="an_76:2">76:2</span> In Salem also is his tabernacle, And his
dwelling-place in Zion.

<span id="an_76:3">76:3</span> There he brake the arrows of the bow; The
shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah

<span id="an_76:4">76:4</span> Glorious art thou \[and\] excellent, From
the mountains of prey.

<span id="an_76:5">76:5</span> The stouthearted are made a spoil, They
have slept their sleep; And none of the men of might have found their
hands.

<span id="an_76:6">76:6</span> At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both
chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep.

<span id="an_76:7">76:7</span> Thou, even thou, art to be feared; And
who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?

<span id="an_76:8">76:8</span> Thou didst cause sentence to be heard
from heaven; The earth feared, and was still,

<span id="an_76:9">76:9</span> When God arose to judgment, To save all
the meek of the earth. Selah

<span id="an_76:10">76:10</span> Surely the wrath of man shall praise
thee: The residue of wrath shalt thou gird upon thee.

<span id="an_76:11">76:11</span> Vow, and pay unto Jehovah your God: Let
all that are round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be
feared.

<span id="an_76:12">76:12</span> He will cut off the spirit of princes:
He is terrible to the kings of the earth.

<span id="an_77:1">77:1</span> For the Chief Musician; after the manner
of Jeduthan. A Psalm of Asaph. I will cry unto God with my voice, Even
unto God with my voice; and he will give ear unto me.

<span id="an_77:2">77:2</span> In the day of my trouble I sought the
Lord: My hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not; My soul
refused to be comforted.

<span id="an_77:3">77:3</span> I remember God, and am disquieted: I
complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah

<span id="an_77:4">77:4</span> Thou holdest mine eyes watching: I am so
troubled that I cannot speak.

<span id="an_77:5">77:5</span> I have considered the days of old, The
years of ancient times.

<span id="an_77:6">77:6</span> I call to remembrance my song in the
night: I commune with mine own heart; And my spirit maketh diligent
search.

<span id="an_77:7">77:7</span> Will the Lord cast off for ever? And will
he be favorable no more?

<span id="an_77:8">77:8</span> Is his lovingkindness clean gone for
ever? Doth his promise fail for evermore?

<span id="an_77:9">77:9</span> Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath
he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah

<span id="an_77:10">77:10</span> And I said, This is my infirmity; \[But
I will remember\] the years of the right hand of the Most High.

<span id="an_77:11">77:11</span> I will make mention of the deeds of
Jehovah; For I will remember thy wonders of old.

<span id="an_77:12">77:12</span> I will meditate also upon all thy work,
And muse on thy doings.

<span id="an_77:13">77:13</span> Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary:
Who is a great god like unto God?

<span id="an_77:14">77:14</span> Thou art the God that doest wonders:
Thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples.

<span id="an_77:15">77:15</span> Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy
people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah

<span id="an_77:16">77:16</span> The waters saw thee, O God; The waters
saw thee, they were afraid: The depths also trembled.

<span id="an_77:17">77:17</span> The clouds poured out water; The skies
sent out a sound: Thine arrows also went abroad.

<span id="an_77:18">77:18</span> The voice of thy thunder was in the
whirlwind; The lightnings lightened the world: The earth trembled and
shook.

<span id="an_77:19">77:19</span> Thy way was in the sea, And thy paths
in the great waters, And thy footsteps were not known.

<span id="an_77:20">77:20</span> Thou leddest thy people like a flock,
By the hand of Moses and Aaron.

<span id="an_78:1">78:1</span> Maschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people,
to my law: Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.

<span id="an_78:2">78:2</span> I will open my mouth in a parable; I will
utter dark sayings of old,

<span id="an_78:3">78:3</span> Which we have heard and known, And our
fathers have told us.

<span id="an_78:4">78:4</span> We will not hide them from their
children, Telling to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, And
his strength, and his wondrous works that he hath done.

<span id="an_78:5">78:5</span> For he established a testimony in Jacob,
And appointed a law in Israel, Which he commanded our fathers, That they
should make them known to their children;

<span id="an_78:6">78:6</span> That the generation to come might know
\[them\], even the children that should be born; Who should arise and
tell \[them\] to their children,

<span id="an_78:7">78:7</span> That they might set their hope in God,
And not forget the works of God, But keep his commandments,

<span id="an_78:8">78:8</span> And might not be as their fathers, A
stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that set not their
heart aright, And whose spirit was not stedfast with God.

<span id="an_78:9">78:9</span> The children of Ephraim, being armed and
carrying bows, Turned back in the day of battle.

<span id="an_78:10">78:10</span> They kept not the covenant of God, And
refused to walk in his law;

<span id="an_78:11">78:11</span> And they forgat his doings, And his
wondrous works that he had showed them.

<span id="an_78:12">78:12</span> Marvellous things did he in the sight
of their fathers, In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

<span id="an_78:13">78:13</span> He clave the sea, and caused them to
pass through; And he made the waters to stand as a heap.

<span id="an_78:14">78:14</span> In the day-time also he led them with a
cloud, And all the night with a light of fire.

<span id="an_78:15">78:15</span> He clave rocks in the wilderness, And
gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.

<span id="an_78:16">78:16</span> He brought streams also out of the
rock, And caused waters to run down like rivers.

<span id="an_78:17">78:17</span> Yet went they on still to sin against
him, To rebel against the Most High in the desert.

<span id="an_78:18">78:18</span> And they tempted God in their heart By
asking food according to their desire.

<span id="an_78:19">78:19</span> Yea, they spake against God; They said,
Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?

<span id="an_78:20">78:20</span> Behold, he smote the rock, so that
waters gushed out, And streams overflowed; Can he give bread also? Will
he provide flesh for his people?

<span id="an_78:21">78:21</span> Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth;
And a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger also went up against
Israel;

<span id="an_78:22">78:22</span> Because they believed not in God, And
trusted not in his salvation.

<span id="an_78:23">78:23</span> Yet he commanded the skies above, And
opened the doors of heaven;

<span id="an_78:24">78:24</span> And he rained down manna upon them to
eat, And gave them food from heaven.

<span id="an_78:25">78:25</span> Man did eat the bread of the mighty: He
sent them food to the full.

<span id="an_78:26">78:26</span> He caused the east wind to blow in the
heavens; And by his power he guided the south wind.

<span id="an_78:27">78:27</span> He rained flesh also upon them as the
dust, And winged birds as the sand of the seas:

<span id="an_78:28">78:28</span> And he let it fall in the midst of
their camp, Round about their habitations.

<span id="an_78:29">78:29</span> So they did eat, and were well filled;
And he gave them their own desire.

<span id="an_78:30">78:30</span> They were not estranged from that which
they desired, Their food was yet in their mouths,

<span id="an_78:31">78:31</span> When the anger of God went up against
them, And slew of the fattest of them, And smote down the young men of
Israel.

<span id="an_78:32">78:32</span> For all this they sinned still, And
believed not in his wondrous works.

<span id="an_78:33">78:33</span> Therefore their days did he consume in
vanity, And their years in terror.

<span id="an_78:34">78:34</span> When he slew them, then they inquired
after him; And they returned and sought God earnestly.

<span id="an_78:35">78:35</span> And they remembered that God was their
rock, And the Most High God their redeemer.

<span id="an_78:36">78:36</span> But they flattered him with their
mouth, And lied unto him with their tongue.

<span id="an_78:37">78:37</span> For their heart was not right with him,
Neither were they faithful in his covenant.

<span id="an_78:38">78:38</span> But he, being merciful, forgave
\[their\] iniquity, and destroyed \[them\] not: Yea, many a time turned
he his anger away, And did not stir up all his wrath.

<span id="an_78:39">78:39</span> And he remembered that they were but
flesh, A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.

<span id="an_78:40">78:40</span> How oft did they rebel against him in
the wilderness, And grieve him in the desert!

<span id="an_78:41">78:41</span> And they turned again and tempted God,
And provoked the Holy One of Israel.

<span id="an_78:42">78:42</span> They remember not his hand, Nor the day
when he redeemed them from the adversary;

<span id="an_78:43">78:43</span> How he set his signs in Egypt, And his
wonders in the field of Zoan,

<span id="an_78:44">78:44</span> And turned their rivers into blood, And
their streams, so that they could not drink.

<span id="an_78:45">78:45</span> He sent among them swarms of flies,
which devoured them; And frogs, which destroyed them.

<span id="an_78:46">78:46</span> He gave also their increase unto the
caterpillar, And their labor unto the locust.

<span id="an_78:47">78:47</span> He destroyed their vines with hail, And
their sycomore-trees with frost.

<span id="an_78:48">78:48</span> He gave over their cattle also to the
hail, And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.

<span id="an_78:49">78:49</span> He cast upon them the fierceness of his
anger, Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, A band of angels of evil.

<span id="an_78:50">78:50</span> He made a path for his anger; He spared
not their soul from death, But gave their life over to the pestilence,

<span id="an_78:51">78:51</span> And smote all the first-born in Egypt,
The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.

<span id="an_78:52">78:52</span> But he led forth his own people like
sheep, And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.

<span id="an_78:53">78:53</span> And he led them safely, so that they
feared not; But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.

<span id="an_78:54">78:54</span> And he brought them to the border of
his sanctuary, To this mountain, which his right hand had gotten.

<span id="an_78:55">78:55</span> He drove out the nations also before
them, And allotted them for an inheritance by line, And made the tribes
of Israel to dwell in their tents.

<span id="an_78:56">78:56</span> Yet they tempted and rebelled against
the Most High God, And kept not his testimonies;

<span id="an_78:57">78:57</span> But turned back, and dealt
treacherously like their fathers: They were turned aside like a
deceitful bow.

<span id="an_78:58">78:58</span> For they provoked him to anger with
their high places, And moved him to jealousy with their graven images.

<span id="an_78:59">78:59</span> When God heard \[this\], he was wroth,
And greatly abhorred Israel;

<span id="an_78:60">78:60</span> So that he forsook the tabernacle of
Shiloh, The tent which he placed among men;

<span id="an_78:61">78:61</span> And delivered his strength into
captivity, And his glory into the adversary's hand.

<span id="an_78:62">78:62</span> He gave his people over also unto the
sword, And was wroth with his inheritance.

<span id="an_78:63">78:63</span> Fire devoured their young men; And
their virgins had no marriage-song.

<span id="an_78:64">78:64</span> Their priests fell by the sword; And
their widows made no lamentation.

<span id="an_78:65">78:65</span> Then the Lord awaked as one out of
sleep, Like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.

<span id="an_78:66">78:66</span> And he smote his adversaries backward:
He put them to a perpetual reproach.

<span id="an_78:67">78:67</span> Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph,
And chose not the tribe of Ephraim,

<span id="an_78:68">78:68</span> But chose the tribe of Judah, The mount
Zion which he loved.

<span id="an_78:69">78:69</span> And he built his sanctuary like the
heights, Like the earth which he hath established for ever.

<span id="an_78:70">78:70</span> He chose David also his servant, And
took him from the sheepfolds:

<span id="an_78:71">78:71</span> From following the ewes that have their
young he brought him, To be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel
his inheritance.

<span id="an_78:72">78:72</span> So he was their shepherd according to
the integrity of his heart, And guided them by the skilfulness of his
hands.

<span id="an_79:1">79:1</span> A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the nations are
come into thine inheritance; Thy holy temple have they defiled; They
have laid Jerusalem in heaps.

<span id="an_79:2">79:2</span> The dead bodies of thy servants have they
given to be food unto the birds of the heavens, The flesh of thy saints
unto the beasts of the earth.

<span id="an_79:3">79:3</span> Their blood have they shed like water
round about Jerusalem; And there was none to bury them.

<span id="an_79:4">79:4</span> We are become a reproach to our
neighbors, A scoffing and derision to them that are round about us.

<span id="an_79:5">79:5</span> How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou be angry
for ever? Shall thy jealousy burn like fire?

<span id="an_79:6">79:6</span> Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that
know thee not, And upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name.

<span id="an_79:7">79:7</span> For they have devoured Jacob, And laid
waste his habitation.

<span id="an_79:8">79:8</span> Remember not against us the iniquities of
our forefathers: Let thy tender mercies speedily meet us; For we are
brought very low.

<span id="an_79:9">79:9</span> Help us, O God of our salvation, for the
glory of thy name; And deliver us, and forgive our sins, for thy name's
sake.

<span id="an_79:10">79:10</span> Wherefore should the nations say, Where
is their God? Let the avenging of the blood of thy servants which is
shed Be known among the nations in our sight.

<span id="an_79:11">79:11</span> Let the sighing of the prisoner come
before thee: According to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those
that are appointed to death;

<span id="an_79:12">79:12</span> And render unto our neighbors sevenfold
into their bosom Their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O
Lord.

<span id="an_79:13">79:13</span> So we thy people and sheep of thy
pasture Will give thee thanks for ever: We will show forth thy praise to
all generations.

<span id="an_80:1">80:1</span> For the Chief Musician, set to Shoshanim
Eduth.. A Psalm of Asaph. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, Thou that
leadest Joseph like a flock; Thou that sittest \[above\] the cherubim,
shine forth.

<span id="an_80:2">80:2</span> Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh,
stir up thy might, And come to save us.

<span id="an_80:3">80:3</span> Turn us again, O God; And cause thy face
to shine, and we shall be saved.

<span id="an_80:4">80:4</span> O Jehovah God of hosts, How long wilt
thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?

<span id="an_80:5">80:5</span> Thou hast fed them with the bread of
tears, And given them tears to drink in large measure.

<span id="an_80:6">80:6</span> Thou makest us a strife unto our
neighbors; And our enemies laugh among themselves.

<span id="an_80:7">80:7</span> Turn us again, O God of hosts; And cause
thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.

<span id="an_80:8">80:8</span> Thou broughtest a vine out of Egypt: Thou
didst drive out the nations, and plantedst it.

<span id="an_80:9">80:9</span> Thou preparedst \[room\] before it, And
it took deep root, and filled the land.

<span id="an_80:10">80:10</span> The mountains were covered with the
shadow of it, And the boughs thereof were \[like\] cedars of God.

<span id="an_80:11">80:11</span> It sent out its branches unto the sea,
And its shoots unto the River.

<span id="an_80:12">80:12</span> Why hast thou broken down its walls, So
that all they that pass by the way do pluck it?

<span id="an_80:13">80:13</span> The boar out of the wood doth ravage
it, And the wild beasts of the field feed on it.

<span id="an_80:14">80:14</span> Turn again, we beseech thee, O God of
hosts: Look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine,

<span id="an_80:15">80:15</span> And the stock which thy right hand
planted, And the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.

<span id="an_80:16">80:16</span> It is burned with fire, it is cut down:
They perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.

<span id="an_80:17">80:17</span> Let thy hand be upon the man of thy
right hand, Upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.

<span id="an_80:18">80:18</span> So shall we not go back from thee:
Quicken thou us, and we will call upon thy name.

<span id="an_80:19">80:19</span> Turn us again, O Jehovah God of hosts;
Cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.

<span id="an_81:1">81:1</span> For the Chief Musician; set to the
Gittith. \[A Psalm\] of Asaph. Sing aloud unto God our strength: Make a
joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.

<span id="an_81:2">81:2</span> Raise a song, and bring hither the
timbrel, The pleasant harp with the psaltery.

<span id="an_81:3">81:3</span> Blow the trumpet at the new moon, At the
full moon, on our feast-day.

<span id="an_81:4">81:4</span> For it is a statute for Israel, An
ordinance of the God of Jacob.

<span id="an_81:5">81:5</span> He appointed it in Joseph for a
testimony, When he went out over the land of Egypt, \[Where\] I heard a
language that I knew not.

<span id="an_81:6">81:6</span> I removed his shoulder from the burden:
His hands were freed from the basket.

<span id="an_81:7">81:7</span> Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered
thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at
the waters of Meribah. Selah

<span id="an_81:8">81:8</span> Hear, O my people, and I will testify
unto thee: O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto me!

<span id="an_81:9">81:9</span> There shall no strange god be in thee;
Neither shalt thou worship any foreign god.

<span id="an_81:10">81:10</span> I am Jehovah thy God, Who brought thee
up out of the land of Egypt: Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.

<span id="an_81:11">81:11</span> But my people hearkened not to my
voice; And Israel would none of me.

<span id="an_81:12">81:12</span> So I let them go after the stubbornness
of their heart, That they might walk in their own counsels.

<span id="an_81:13">81:13</span> Oh that my people would hearken unto
me, That Israel would walk in my ways!

<span id="an_81:14">81:14</span> I would soon subdue their enemies, And
turn my hand against their adversaries.

<span id="an_81:15">81:15</span> The haters of Jehovah should submit
themselves unto him: But their time should endure for ever.

<span id="an_81:16">81:16</span> He would feed them also with the finest
of the wheat; And with honey out of the rock would I satisfy thee.

<span id="an_82:1">82:1</span> A Psalm of Asaph. God standeth in the
congregation of God; He judgeth among the gods.

<span id="an_82:2">82:2</span> How long will ye judge unjustly, And
respect the persons of the wicked? Selah

<span id="an_82:3">82:3</span> Judge the poor and fatherless: Do justice
to the afflicted and destitute.

<span id="an_82:4">82:4</span> Rescue the poor and needy: Deliver them
out of the hand of the wicked.

<span id="an_82:5">82:5</span> They know not, neither do they
understand; They walk to and fro in darkness: All the foundations of the
earth are shaken.

<span id="an_82:6">82:6</span> I said, Ye are gods, And all of you sons
of the Most High.

<span id="an_82:7">82:7</span> Nevertheless ye shall die like men, And
fall like one of the princes.

<span id="an_82:8">82:8</span> Arise, O God, judge the earth; For thou
shalt inherit all the nations.

<span id="an_83:1">83:1</span> A song. A Psalm of Asaph. O God, keep not
thou silence: Hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.

<span id="an_83:2">83:2</span> For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult; And
they that hate thee have lifted up the head.

<span id="an_83:3">83:3</span> Thy take crafty counsel against thy
people, And consult together against thy hidden ones.

<span id="an_83:4">83:4</span> They have said, Come, and let us cut them
off from being a nation; That the name of Israel may be no more in
remembrance.

<span id="an_83:5">83:5</span> For they have consulted together with one
consent; Against thee do they make a covenant:

<span id="an_83:6">83:6</span> The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites;
Moab, and the Hagarenes;

<span id="an_83:7">83:7</span> Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia
with the inhabitants of Tyre:

<span id="an_83:8">83:8</span> Assyria also is joined with them; They
have helped the children of Lot. Selah

<span id="an_83:9">83:9</span> Do thou unto them as unto Midian, As to
Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;

<span id="an_83:10">83:10</span> Who perished at Endor, Who became as
dung for the earth.

<span id="an_83:11">83:11</span> Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb;
Yea, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;

<span id="an_83:12">83:12</span> Who said, Let us take to ourselves in
possession The habitations of God.

<span id="an_83:13">83:13</span> O my God, make them like the whirling
dust; As stubble before the wind.

<span id="an_83:14">83:14</span> As the fire that burneth the forest,
And as the flame that setteth the mountains on fire,

<span id="an_83:15">83:15</span> So pursue them with thy tempest, And
terrify them with thy storm.

<span id="an_83:16">83:16</span> Fill their faces with confusion, That
they may seek thy name, O Jehovah.

<span id="an_83:17">83:17</span> Let them be put to shame and dismayed
for ever; Yea, let them be confounded and perish;

<span id="an_83:18">83:18</span> That they may know that thou alone,
whose name is Jehovah, Art the Most High over all the earth.

<span id="an_84:1">84:1</span> For the Chief Musician; set to the
Gittith. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. How amiable are thy tabernacles,
O Jehovah of hosts!

<span id="an_84:2">84:2</span> My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for
the courts of Jehovah; My heart and my flesh cry out unto the living
God.

<span id="an_84:3">84:3</span> Yea, the sparrow hath found her a house,
And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, Even
thine altars, O Jehovah of hosts, My King, and my God.

<span id="an_84:4">84:4</span> Blessed are they that dwell in thy house:
They will be still praising thee. Selah

<span id="an_84:5">84:5</span> Blessed is the man whose strength is in
thee; In whose heart are the highways \[to Zion\].

<span id="an_84:6">84:6</span> Passing through the valley of Weeping
they make it a place of springs; Yea, the early rain covereth it with
blessings.

<span id="an_84:7">84:7</span> They go from strength to strength; Every
one of them appeareth before God in Zion.

<span id="an_84:8">84:8</span> O Jehovah God of hosts, hear my prayer;
Give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah

<span id="an_84:9">84:9</span> Behold, O God our shield, And look upon
the face of thine anointed.

<span id="an_84:10">84:10</span> For a day in thy courts is better than
a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, Than to
dwell in the tents of wickedness.

<span id="an_84:11">84:11</span> For Jehovah God is a sun and a shield:
Jehovah will give grace and glory; No good thing will he withhold from
them that walk uprightly.

<span id="an_84:12">84:12</span> O Jehovah of hosts, Blessed is the man
that trusteth in thee.

<span id="an_85:1">85:1</span> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the
sons of Korah. Jehovah, thou hast been favorable unto thy land; Thou
hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.

<span id="an_85:2">85:2</span> Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy
people; Thou hast covered all their sin. Selah

<span id="an_85:3">85:3</span> Thou hast taken away all thy wrath; Thou
hast turned \[thyself\] from the fierceness of thine anger.

<span id="an_85:4">85:4</span> Turn us, O God of our salvation, And
cause thine indignation toward us to cease.

<span id="an_85:5">85:5</span> Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? Wilt
thou draw out thine anger to all generations?

<span id="an_85:6">85:6</span> Wilt thou not quicken us again, That thy
people may rejoice in thee?

<span id="an_85:7">85:7</span> Show us thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah,
And grant us thy salvation.

<span id="an_85:8">85:8</span> I will hear what God Jehovah will speak;
For he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: But let them
not turn again to folly.

<span id="an_85:9">85:9</span> Surely his salvation is nigh them that
fear him, That glory may dwell in our land.

<span id="an_85:10">85:10</span> Mercy and truth are met together;
Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.

<span id="an_85:11">85:11</span> Truth springeth out of the earth; And
righteousness hath looked down from heaven.

<span id="an_85:12">85:12</span> Yea, Jehovah will give that which is
good; And our land shall yield its increase.

<span id="an_85:13">85:13</span> Righteousness shall go before him, And
shall make his footsteps a way \[to walk in\].

<span id="an_86:1">86:1</span> A Prayer of David Bow down thine ear, O
Jehovah, and answer me; For I am poor and needy.

<span id="an_86:2">86:2</span> Preserve my soul; for I am godly: O thou
my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.

<span id="an_86:3">86:3</span> Be merciful unto me, O Lord; For unto
thee do I cry all the day long.

<span id="an_86:4">86:4</span> Rejoice the soul of thy servant; For unto
thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.

<span id="an_86:5">86:5</span> For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to
forgive, And abundant in lovingkindness unto all them that call upon
thee.

<span id="an_86:6">86:6</span> Give ear, O Jehovah, unto my prayer; And
hearken unto the voice of my supplications.

<span id="an_86:7">86:7</span> In the day of my trouble I will call upon
thee; For thou wilt answer me.

<span id="an_86:8">86:8</span> There is none like unto thee among the
gods, O Lord; Neither \[are there any works\] like unto thy works.

<span id="an_86:9">86:9</span> All nations whom thou hast made shall
come and worship before thee, O Lord; And they shall glorify thy name.

<span id="an_86:10">86:10</span> For thou art great, and doest wondrous
things: Thou art God alone.

<span id="an_86:11">86:11</span> Teach me thy way, O Jehovah; I will
walk in thy truth: Unite my heart to fear thy name.

<span id="an_86:12">86:12</span> I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with
my whole heart; And I will glorify thy name for evermore.

<span id="an_86:13">86:13</span> For great is thy lovingkindness toward
me; And thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.

<span id="an_86:14">86:14</span> O God, the proud are risen up against
me, And a company of violent men have sought after my soul, And have not
set thee before them.

<span id="an_86:15">86:15</span> But thou, O Lord, art a God merciful
and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth.

<span id="an_86:16">86:16</span> Oh turn unto me, and have mercy upon
me; Give thy strength unto thy servant, And save the son of thy
handmaid.

<span id="an_86:17">86:17</span> Show me a token for good, That they who
hate me may see it, and be put to shame, Because thou, Jehovah, hast
helped me, and comforted me.

<span id="an_87:1">87:1</span> A Psalm of the sons of Korah; a Song. His
foundation is in the holy mountains.

<span id="an_87:2">87:2</span> Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion More
than all the dwellings of Jacob.

<span id="an_87:3">87:3</span> Glorious things are spoken of thee, O
city of God. Selah

<span id="an_87:4">87:4</span> I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon
as among them that know me: Behold, Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia:
This one was born there.

<span id="an_87:5">87:5</span> Yea, of Zion it shall be said, This one
and that one was born in her; And the Most High himself will establish
her.

<span id="an_87:6">87:6</span> Jehovah will count, when he writeth up
the peoples, This one was born there. Selah

<span id="an_87:7">87:7</span> They that sing as well as they that dance
\[shall say\], All my fountains are in thee.

<span id="an_88:1">88:1</span> A Song, a Psalm of the sons of Korah; for
the Chief Musician; set to Mahalath Leannoth. Maschil of Heman the
Ezrahite. O Jehovah, the God of my salvation, I have cried day and night
before thee.

<span id="an_88:2">88:2</span> Let my prayer enter into thy presence;
Incline thine ear unto my cry.

<span id="an_88:3">88:3</span> For my soul is full of troubles, And my
life draweth nigh unto Sheol.

<span id="an_88:4">88:4</span> I am reckoned with them that go down into
the pit; I am as a man that hath no help,

<span id="an_88:5">88:5</span> Cast off among the dead, Like the slain
that lie in the grave, Whom thou rememberest no more, And they are cut
off from thy hand.

<span id="an_88:6">88:6</span> Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, In
dark places, in the deeps.

<span id="an_88:7">88:7</span> Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, And thou
hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah

<span id="an_88:8">88:8</span> Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from
me; Thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I
cannot come forth.

<span id="an_88:9">88:9</span> Mine eye wasteth away by reason of
affliction: I have called daily upon thee, O Jehovah; I have spread
forth my hands unto thee.

<span id="an_88:10">88:10</span> Wilt thou show wonders to the dead?
Shall they that are decreased arise and praise thee? Selah

<span id="an_88:11">88:11</span> Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in
the grave? Or thy faithfulness in Destruction?

<span id="an_88:12">88:12</span> Shall thy wonders be known in the dark?
And thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

<span id="an_88:13">88:13</span> But unto thee, O Jehovah, have I cried;
And in the morning shall my prayer come before thee.

<span id="an_88:14">88:14</span> Jehovah, why castest thou off my soul?
Why hidest thou thy face from me?

<span id="an_88:15">88:15</span> I am afflicted and ready to die from my
youth up: While I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.

<span id="an_88:16">88:16</span> Thy fierce wrath is gone over me; Thy
terrors have cut me off.

<span id="an_88:17">88:17</span> They came round about me like water all
the day long; They compassed me about together.

<span id="an_88:18">88:18</span> Lover and friend hast thou put far from
me, And mine acquaintance into darkness.

<span id="an_89:1">89:1</span> Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will
sing of the lovingkindness of Jehovah for ever: With my mouth will I
make known thy faithfulness to all generations.

<span id="an_89:2">89:2</span> For I have said, Mercy shall be built up
for ever; Thy faithfulness wilt thou establish in the very heavens.

<span id="an_89:3">89:3</span> I have made a covenant with my chosen, I
have sworn unto David my servant:

<span id="an_89:4">89:4</span> Thy seed will I establish for ever, And
build up thy throne to all generations. Selah

<span id="an_89:5">89:5</span> And the heavens shall praise thy wonders,
O Jehovah; Thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.

<span id="an_89:6">89:6</span> For who in the skies can be compared unto
Jehovah? Who among the sons of the mighty is like unto Jehovah,

<span id="an_89:7">89:7</span> A God very terrible in the council of the
holy ones, And to be feared above all them that are round about him?

<span id="an_89:8">89:8</span> O Jehovah God of hosts, Who is a mighty
one, like unto thee, O Jehovah? And thy faithfulness is round about
thee.

<span id="an_89:9">89:9</span> Thou rulest the pride of the sea: When
the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.

<span id="an_89:10">89:10</span> Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as
one that is slain; Thou hast scattered thine enemies with the arm of thy
strength.

<span id="an_89:11">89:11</span> The heavens are thine, the earth also
is thine: The world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.

<span id="an_89:12">89:12</span> The north and the south, thou hast
created them: Tabor and Hermon rejoice in thy name.

<span id="an_89:13">89:13</span> Thou hast a mighty arm; Strong is thy
hand, and high is thy right hand.

<span id="an_89:14">89:14</span> Righteousness and justice are the
foundation of thy throne: Lovingkindness and truth go before thy face.

<span id="an_89:15">89:15</span> Blessed is the people that know the
joyful sound: They walk, O Jehovah, in the light of thy countenance.

<span id="an_89:16">89:16</span> In thy name do they rejoice all the
day; And in thy righteousness are they exalted.

<span id="an_89:17">89:17</span> For thou art the glory of their
strength; And in thy favor our horn shall be exalted.

<span id="an_89:18">89:18</span> For our shield belongeth unto Jehovah;
And our king to the Holy One of Israel.

<span id="an_89:19">89:19</span> Then thou spakest in vision to thy
saints, And saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have
exalted one chosen out of the people.

<span id="an_89:20">89:20</span> I have found David my servant; With my
holy oil have I anointed him:

<span id="an_89:21">89:21</span> With whom my hand shall be established;
Mine arm also shall strengthen him.

<span id="an_89:22">89:22</span> The enemy shall not exact from him, Nor
the son of wickedness afflict him.

<span id="an_89:23">89:23</span> And I will beat down his adversaries
before him, And smite them that hate him.

<span id="an_89:24">89:24</span> But my faithfulness and my
lovingkindness shall be with him; And in my name shall his horn be
exalted.

<span id="an_89:25">89:25</span> I will set his hand also on the sea,
And his right hand on the rivers.

<span id="an_89:26">89:26</span> He shall cry unto me, Thou art my
Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.

<span id="an_89:27">89:27</span> I also will make him \[my\] first-born,
The highest of the kings of the earth.

<span id="an_89:28">89:28</span> My lovingkindness will I keep for him
for evermore; And my covenant shall stand fast with him.

<span id="an_89:29">89:29</span> His seed also will I make to endure for
ever, And his throne as the days of heaven.

<span id="an_89:30">89:30</span> If his children forsake my law, And
walk not in mine ordinances;

<span id="an_89:31">89:31</span> If they break my statutes, And keep not
my commandments;

<span id="an_89:32">89:32</span> Then will I visit their transgression
with the rod, And their iniquity with stripes.

<span id="an_89:33">89:33</span> But my lovingkindness will I not
utterly take from him, Nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.

<span id="an_89:34">89:34</span> My covenant will I not break, Nor alter
the thing that is gone out of my lips.

<span id="an_89:35">89:35</span> Once have I sworn by my holiness: I
will not lie unto David:

<span id="an_89:36">89:36</span> His seed shall endure for ever, And his
throne as the sun before me.

<span id="an_89:37">89:37</span> It shall be established for ever as the
moon, And \[as\] the faithful witness in the sky. Selah

<span id="an_89:38">89:38</span> But thou hast cast off and rejected,
Thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.

<span id="an_89:39">89:39</span> Thou hast abhorred the covenant of thy
servant: Thou hast profaned his crown \[by casting it\] to the ground.

<span id="an_89:40">89:40</span> Thou hast broken down all his hedges;
Thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin.

<span id="an_89:41">89:41</span> All that pass by the way rob him: He is
become a reproach to his neighbors.

<span id="an_89:42">89:42</span> Thou hast exalted the right hand of his
adversaries; Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.

<span id="an_89:43">89:43</span> Yea, thou turnest back the edge of his
sword, And hast not made him to stand in the battle.

<span id="an_89:44">89:44</span> Thou hast made his brightness to cease,
And cast his throne down to the ground.

<span id="an_89:45">89:45</span> The days of his youth hast thou
shortened: Thou hast covered him with shame. Selah

<span id="an_89:46">89:46</span> How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou hide
thyself for ever? \[How long\] shall thy wrath burn like fire?

<span id="an_89:47">89:47</span> Oh remember how short my time is: For
what vanity hast thou created all the children of men!

<span id="an_89:48">89:48</span> What man is he that shall live and not
see death, That shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah

<span id="an_89:49">89:49</span> Lord, where are thy former
lovingkindnesses, Which thou swarest unto David in thy faithfulness?

<span id="an_89:50">89:50</span> Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy
servants; How I do bear in my bosom \[the reproach of\] all the mighty
peoples,

<span id="an_89:51">89:51</span> Wherewith thine enemies have
reproached, O Jehovah, Wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of
thine anointed.

<span id="an_89:52">89:52</span> Blessed be Jehovah for evermore. Amen,
and Amen. BOOK IV

<span id="an_90:1">90:1</span> A Prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord,
thou hast been our dwelling-place In all generations.

<span id="an_90:2">90:2</span> Before the mountains were brought forth,
Or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, Even from everlasting
to everlasting, thou art God.

<span id="an_90:3">90:3</span> Thou turnest man to destruction, And
sayest, Return, ye children of men.

<span id="an_90:4">90:4</span> For a thousand years in thy sight Are but
as yesterday when it is past, And as a watch in the night.

<span id="an_90:5">90:5</span> Thou carriest them away as with a flood;
they are as a sleep: In the morning they are like grass which groweth
up.

<span id="an_90:6">90:6</span> In the morning it flourisheth, and
groweth up; In the evening it is cut down, and withereth.

<span id="an_90:7">90:7</span> For we are consumed in thine anger, And
in thy wrath are we troubled.

<span id="an_90:8">90:8</span> Thou hast set our iniquities before thee,
Our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.

<span id="an_90:9">90:9</span> For all our days are passed away in thy
wrath: We bring our years to an end as a sigh.

<span id="an_90:10">90:10</span> The days of our years are threescore
years and ten, Or even by reason of strength fourscore years; Yet is
their pride but labor and sorrow; For it is soon gone, and we fly away.

<span id="an_90:11">90:11</span> Who knoweth the power of thine anger,
And thy wrath according to the fear that is due unto thee?

<span id="an_90:12">90:12</span> So teach us to number our days, That we
may get us a heart of wisdom.

<span id="an_90:13">90:13</span> Return, O Jehovah; how long? And let it
repent thee concerning thy servants.

<span id="an_90:14">90:14</span> Oh satisfy us in the morning with thy
lovingkindness, That we may rejoice and be glad all our days.

<span id="an_90:15">90:15</span> Make us glad according to the days
wherein thou hast afflicted us, And the years wherein we have seen evil.

<span id="an_90:16">90:16</span> Let thy work appear unto thy servants,
And thy glory upon their children.

<span id="an_90:17">90:17</span> And let the favor of the Lord our God
be upon us; And establish thou the work of our hands upon us; Yea, the
work of our hands establish thou it.

<span id="an_91:1">91:1</span> He that dwelleth in the secret place of
the Most High Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

<span id="an_91:2">91:2</span> I will say of Jehovah, He is my refuge
and my fortress; My God, in whom I trust.

<span id="an_91:3">91:3</span> For he will deliver thee from the snare
of the fowler, And from the deadly pestilence.

<span id="an_91:4">91:4</span> He will cover thee with his pinions, And
under his wings shalt thou take refuge: His truth is a shield and a
buckler.

<span id="an_91:5">91:5</span> Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
by night, Nor for the arrow that flieth by day;

<span id="an_91:6">91:6</span> For the pestilence that walketh in
darkness, Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.

<span id="an_91:7">91:7</span> A thousand shall fall at thy side, And
ten thousand at thy right hand; \[But\] it shall not come nigh thee.

<span id="an_91:8">91:8</span> Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold,
And see the reward of the wicked.

<span id="an_91:9">91:9</span> For thou, O Jehovah, art my refuge! Thou
hast made the Most High thy habitation;

<span id="an_91:10">91:10</span> There shall no evil befall thee,
Neither shall any plague come nigh thy tent.

<span id="an_91:11">91:11</span> For he will give his angels charge over
thee, To keep thee in all thy ways.

<span id="an_91:12">91:12</span> They shall bear thee up in their hands,
Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.

<span id="an_91:13">91:13</span> Thou shalt tread upon the lion and
adder: The young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample under foot.

<span id="an_91:14">91:14</span> Because he hath set his love upon me,
therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath
known my name.

<span id="an_91:15">91:15</span> He shall call upon me, and I will
answer him; I will be with him in trouble: I will deliver him, and honor
him.

<span id="an_91:16">91:16</span> With long life will I satisfy him, And
show him my salvation.

<span id="an_92:1">92:1</span> A Psalm, a Song for the sabbath day. It
is a good thing to give thanks unto Jehovah, And to sing praises unto
thy name, O Most High;

<span id="an_92:2">92:2</span> To show forth thy lovingkindness in the
morning, And thy faithfulness every night,

<span id="an_92:3">92:3</span> With an instrument of ten strings, and
with the psaltery; With a solemn sound upon the harp.

<span id="an_92:4">92:4</span> For thou, Jehovah, hast made me glad
through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.

<span id="an_92:5">92:5</span> How great are thy works, O Jehovah! Thy
thoughts are very deep.

<span id="an_92:6">92:6</span> A brutish man knoweth not; Neither doth a
fool understand this:

<span id="an_92:7">92:7</span> When the wicked spring as the grass, And
when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; It is that they shall be
destroyed for ever.

<span id="an_92:8">92:8</span> But thou, O Jehovah, art on high for
evermore.

<span id="an_92:9">92:9</span> For, lo, thine enemies, O Jehovah, For,
lo, thine enemies shall perish; All the workers of iniquity shall be
scattered.

<span id="an_92:10">92:10</span> But my horn hast thou exalted like
\[the horn of\] the wild-ox: I am anointed with fresh oil.

<span id="an_92:11">92:11</span> Mine eye also hath seen \[my desire\]
on mine enemies, Mine ears have heard \[my desire\] of the evil-doers
that rise up against me.

<span id="an_92:12">92:12</span> The righteous shall flourish like the
palm-tree: He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.

<span id="an_92:13">92:13</span> They are planted in the house of
Jehovah; They shall flourish in the courts of our God.

<span id="an_92:14">92:14</span> They shall still bring forth fruit in
old age; They shall be full of sap and green:

<span id="an_92:15">92:15</span> To show that Jehovah is upright; He is
my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

<span id="an_93:1">93:1</span> Jehovah reigneth; he is clothed with
majesty; Jehovah is clothed with strength; he hath girded himself
therewith: The world also is established, that it cannot be moved.

<span id="an_93:2">93:2</span> Thy throne is established of old: Thou
art from everlasting.

<span id="an_93:3">93:3</span> The floods have lifted up, O Jehovah, The
floods have lifted up their voice; The floods lift up their waves.

<span id="an_93:4">93:4</span> Above the voices of many waters, The
mighty breakers of the sea, Jehovah on high is mighty.

<span id="an_93:5">93:5</span> Thy testimonies are very sure: Holiness
becometh thy house, O Jehovah, for evermore.

<span id="an_94:1">94:1</span> O Jehovah, thou God to whom vengeance
belongeth, Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth.

<span id="an_94:2">94:2</span> Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth:
Render to the proud \[their\] desert.

<span id="an_94:3">94:3</span> Jehovah, how long shall the wicked, How
long shall the wicked triumph?

<span id="an_94:4">94:4</span> They prate, they speak arrogantly: All
the workers of iniquity boast themselves.

<span id="an_94:5">94:5</span> They break in pieces thy people, O
Jehovah, And afflict thy heritage.

<span id="an_94:6">94:6</span> They slay the widow and the sojourner,
And murder the fatherless.

<span id="an_94:7">94:7</span> And they say, Jehovah will not see,
Neither will the God of Jacob consider.

<span id="an_94:8">94:8</span> Consider, ye brutish among the people;
And ye fools, when will ye be wise?

<span id="an_94:9">94:9</span> He that planted the ear, shall he not
hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see?

<span id="an_94:10">94:10</span> He that chastiseth the nations, shall
not he correct, \[Even\] he that teacheth man knowledge?

<span id="an_94:11">94:11</span> Jehovah knoweth the thoughts of man,
That they are vanity.

<span id="an_94:12">94:12</span> Blessed is the man whom thou
chastenest, O Jehovah, And teachest out of thy law;

<span id="an_94:13">94:13</span> That thou mayest give him rest from the
days of adversity, Until the pit be digged for the wicked.

<span id="an_94:14">94:14</span> For Jehovah will not cast off his
people, Neither will he forsake his inheritance.

<span id="an_94:15">94:15</span> For judgment shall return unto
righteousness; And all the upright in heart shall follow it.

<span id="an_94:16">94:16</span> Who will rise up for me against the
evil-doers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?

<span id="an_94:17">94:17</span> Unless Jehovah had been my help, My
soul had soon dwelt in silence.

<span id="an_94:18">94:18</span> When I said, My foot slippeth; Thy
lovingkindness, O Jehovah, held me up.

<span id="an_94:19">94:19</span> In the multitude of my thoughts within
me Thy comforts delight my soul.

<span id="an_94:20">94:20</span> Shall the throne of wickedness have
fellowship with thee, Which frameth mischief by statute?

<span id="an_94:21">94:21</span> They gather themselves together against
the soul of the righteous, And condemn the innocent blood.

<span id="an_94:22">94:22</span> But Jehovah hath been my high tower,
And my God the rock of my refuge.

<span id="an_94:23">94:23</span> And he hath brought upon them their own
iniquity, And will cut them off in their own wickedness; Jehovah our God
will cut them off.

<span id="an_95:1">95:1</span> Oh come, let us sing unto Jehovah; Let us
make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.

<span id="an_95:2">95:2</span> Let us come before his presence with
thanksgiving; Let us make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.

<span id="an_95:3">95:3</span> For Jehovah is a great God, And a great
King above all gods.

<span id="an_95:4">95:4</span> In his hand are the deep places of the
earth; The heights of the mountains are his also.

<span id="an_95:5">95:5</span> The sea is his, and he made it; And his
hands formed the dry land.

<span id="an_95:6">95:6</span> Oh come, let us worship and bow down; Let
us kneel before Jehovah our Maker:

<span id="an_95:7">95:7</span> For he is our God, And we are the people
of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To-day, oh that ye would hear
his voice!

<span id="an_95:8">95:8</span> Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, As
in the day of Massah in the wilderness;

<span id="an_95:9">95:9</span> When your fathers tempted me, Proved me,
and saw my work.

<span id="an_95:10">95:10</span> Forty years long was I grieved with
\[that\] generation, And said, It is a people that do err in their
heart, And they have not known my ways:

<span id="an_95:11">95:11</span> Wherefore I sware in my wrath, That
they should not enter into my rest.

<span id="an_96:1">96:1</span> Oh sing unto Jehovah a new song: Sing
unto Jehovah, all the earth.

<span id="an_96:2">96:2</span> Sing unto Jehovah, bless his name; Show
forth his salvation from day to day.

<span id="an_96:3">96:3</span> Declare his glory among the nations, His
marvellous works among all the peoples.

<span id="an_96:4">96:4</span> For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be
praised: He is to be feared above all gods.

<span id="an_96:5">96:5</span> For all the gods of the peoples are
idols; But Jehovah made the heavens.

<span id="an_96:6">96:6</span> Honor and majesty are before him:
Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.

<span id="an_96:7">96:7</span> Ascribe unto Jehovah, ye kindreds of the
peoples, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength.

<span id="an_96:8">96:8</span> Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto
his name: Bring an offering, and come into his courts.

<span id="an_96:9">96:9</span> Oh worship Jehovah in holy array: Tremble
before him, all the earth.

<span id="an_96:10">96:10</span> Say among the nations, Jehovah
reigneth: The world also is established that it cannot be moved: He will
judge the peoples with equity.

<span id="an_96:11">96:11</span> Let the heavens be glad, and let the
earth rejoice; Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;

<span id="an_96:12">96:12</span> Let the field exult, and all that is
therein; Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy

<span id="an_96:13">96:13</span> Before Jehovah; for he cometh, For he
cometh to judge the earth: He will judge the world with righteousness,
And the peoples with his truth.

<span id="an_97:1">97:1</span> Jehovah reigneth; let the earth rejoice;
Let the multitude of isles be glad.

<span id="an_97:2">97:2</span> Clouds and darkness are round about him:
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.

<span id="an_97:3">97:3</span> A fire goeth before him, And burneth up
his adversaries round about.

<span id="an_97:4">97:4</span> His lightnings lightened the world: The
earth saw, and trembled.

<span id="an_97:5">97:5</span> The mountains melted like wax at the
presence of Jehovah, At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

<span id="an_97:6">97:6</span> The heavens declare his righteousness,
And all the peoples have seen his glory.

<span id="an_97:7">97:7</span> Let all them be put to shame that serve
graven images, That boast themselves of idols: Worship him, all ye gods.

<span id="an_97:8">97:8</span> Zion heard and was glad, And the
daughters of Judah rejoiced, Because of thy judgments, O Jehovah.

<span id="an_97:9">97:9</span> For thou, Jehovah, art most high above
all the earth: Thou art exalted far above all gods.

<span id="an_97:10">97:10</span> O ye that love Jehovah, hate evil: He
preserveth the souls of his saints; He delivereth them out of the hand
of the wicked.

<span id="an_97:11">97:11</span> Light is sown for the righteous, And
gladness for the upright in heart.

<span id="an_97:12">97:12</span> Be glad in Jehovah, ye righteous; And
give thanks to his holy memorial \[name\].

<span id="an_98:1">98:1</span> A Psalm. Oh sing unto Jehovah a new song;
For he hath done marvellous things: His right hand, and his holy arm,
hath wrought salvation for him.

<span id="an_98:2">98:2</span> Jehovah hath made known his salvation:
His righteousness hath he openly showed in the sight of the nations.

<span id="an_98:3">98:3</span> He hath remembered his lovingkindness and
his faithfulness toward the house of Israel: All the ends of the earth
have seen the salvation of our God.

<span id="an_98:4">98:4</span> Make a joyful noise unto Jehovah, all the
earth: Break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises.

<span id="an_98:5">98:5</span> Sing praises unto Jehovah with the harp;
With the harp and the voice of melody.

<span id="an_98:6">98:6</span> With trumpets and sound of cornet Make a
joyful noise before the King, Jehovah.

<span id="an_98:7">98:7</span> Let the sea roar, and the fulness
thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein;

<span id="an_98:8">98:8</span> Let the floods clap their hands; Let the
hills sing for joy together

<span id="an_98:9">98:9</span> Before Jehovah; for he cometh to judge
the earth: He will judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples
with equity.

<span id="an_99:1">99:1</span> Jehovah reigneth; let the peoples
tremble: He sitteth \[above\] the cherubim; let the earth be moved.

<span id="an_99:2">99:2</span> Jehovah is great in Zion; And he is high
above all the peoples.

<span id="an_99:3">99:3</span> Let them praise thy great and terrible
name: Holy is he.

<span id="an_99:4">99:4</span> The king's strength also loveth justice;
Thou dost establish equity; Thou executest justice and righteousness in
Jacob.

<span id="an_99:5">99:5</span> Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And worship at
his footstool: Holy is he.

<span id="an_99:6">99:6</span> Moses and Aaron among his priests, And
Samuel among them that call upon his name; They called upon Jehovah, and
he answered them.

<span id="an_99:7">99:7</span> He spake unto them in the pillar of
cloud: They kept his testimonies, And the statute that he gave them.

<span id="an_99:8">99:8</span> Thou answeredst them, O Jehovah our God:
Thou wast a God that forgavest them, Though thou tookest vengeance of
their doings.

<span id="an_99:9">99:9</span> Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And worship at
his holy hill; For Jehovah our God is holy.

<span id="an_100:1">100:1</span> A Psalm of thanksgiving. Make a joyful
noise unto Jehovah, all ye lands.

<span id="an_100:2">100:2</span> Serve Jehovah with gladness: Come
before his presence with singing.

<span id="an_100:3">100:3</span> Know ye that Jehovah, he is God: It is
he that hath made us, and we are his; We are his people, and the sheep
of his pasture.

<span id="an_100:4">100:4</span> Enter into his gates with thanksgiving,
And into his courts with praise: Give thanks unto him, and bless his
name.

<span id="an_100:5">100:5</span> For Jehovah is good; his lovingkindness
\[endureth\] for ever, And his faithfulness unto all generations.

<span id="an_101:1">101:1</span> A Psalm of David. I will sing of
lovingkindness and justice: Unto thee, O Jehovah, will I sing praises.

<span id="an_101:2">101:2</span> I will behave myself wisely in a
perfect way: Oh when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house
with a perfect heart.

<span id="an_101:3">101:3</span> I will set no base thing before mine
eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; It shall not cleave unto
me.

<span id="an_101:4">101:4</span> A perverse heart shall depart from me:
I will know no evil thing.

<span id="an_101:5">101:5</span> Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor,
him will I destroy: Him that hath a high look and a proud heart will I
not suffer.

<span id="an_101:6">101:6</span> Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of
the land, that they may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect way,
he shall minister unto me.

<span id="an_101:7">101:7</span> He that worketh deceit shall not dwell
within my house: He that speaketh falsehood shall not be established
before mine eyes.

<span id="an_101:8">101:8</span> Morning by morning will I destroy all
the wicked of the land; To cut off all the workers of iniquity from the
city of Jehovah.

<span id="an_102:1">102:1</span> A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is
overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before Jehovah. Hear my
prayer, O Jehovah, And let my cry come unto thee.

<span id="an_102:2">102:2</span> Hide not thy face from me in the day of
my distress: Incline thine ear unto me; In the day when I call answer me
speedily.

<span id="an_102:3">102:3</span> For my days consume away like smoke,
And my bones are burned as a firebrand.

<span id="an_102:4">102:4</span> My heart is smitten like grass, and
withered; For I forget to eat my bread.

<span id="an_102:5">102:5</span> By reason of the voice of my groaning
My bones cleave to my flesh.

<span id="an_102:6">102:6</span> I am like a pelican of the wilderness;
I am become as an owl of the waste places.

<span id="an_102:7">102:7</span> I watch, and am become like a sparrow
That is alone upon the house-top.

<span id="an_102:8">102:8</span> Mine enemies reproach me all the day;
They that are mad against me do curse by me.

<span id="an_102:9">102:9</span> For I have eaten ashes like bread, And
mingled my drink with weeping,

<span id="an_102:10">102:10</span> Because of thine indignation and thy
wrath: For thou hast taken me up, and cast me away.

<span id="an_102:11">102:11</span> My days are like a shadow that
declineth; And I am withered like grass.

<span id="an_102:12">102:12</span> But thou, O Jehovah, wilt abide for
ever; And thy memorial \[name\] unto all generations.

<span id="an_102:13">102:13</span> Thou wilt arise, and have mercy upon
Zion; For it is time to have pity upon her, Yea, the set time is come.

<span id="an_102:14">102:14</span> For thy servants take pleasure in her
stones, And have pity upon her dust.

<span id="an_102:15">102:15</span> So the nations shall fear the name of
Jehovah, And all the kings of the earth thy glory.

<span id="an_102:16">102:16</span> For Jehovah hath built up Zion; He
hath appeared in his glory.

<span id="an_102:17">102:17</span> He hath regarded the prayer of the
destitute, And hath not despised their prayer.

<span id="an_102:18">102:18</span> This shall be written for the
generation to come; And a people which shall be created shall praise
Jehovah.

<span id="an_102:19">102:19</span> For he hath looked down from the
height of his sanctuary; From heaven did Jehovah behold the earth;

<span id="an_102:20">102:20</span> To hear the sighing of the prisoner;
To loose those that are appointed to death;

<span id="an_102:21">102:21</span> That men may declare the name of
Jehovah in Zion, And his praise in Jerusalem;

<span id="an_102:22">102:22</span> When the peoples are gathered
together, And the kingdoms, to serve Jehovah.

<span id="an_102:23">102:23</span> He weakened my strength in the way;
He shortened my days.

<span id="an_102:24">102:24</span> I said, O my God, take me not away in
the midst of my days: Thy years are throughout all generations.

<span id="an_102:25">102:25</span> Of old didst thou lay the foundation
of the earth; And the heavens are the work of thy hands.

<span id="an_102:26">102:26</span> They shall perish, but thou shalt
endure; Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; As a vesture
shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:

<span id="an_102:27">102:27</span> But thou art the same, And thy years
shall have no end.

<span id="an_102:28">102:28</span> The children of thy servants shall
continue, And their seed shall be established before thee.

<span id="an_103:1">103:1</span> \[A Psalm\] of David. Bless Jehovah, O
my soul; And all that is within me, \[bless\] his holy name.

<span id="an_103:2">103:2</span> Bless Jehovah, O my soul, And forget
not all his benefits:

<span id="an_103:3">103:3</span> Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; Who
healeth all thy diseases;

<span id="an_103:4">103:4</span> Who redeemeth thy life from
destruction; Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;

<span id="an_103:5">103:5</span> Who satisfieth thy desire with good
things, \[So that\] thy youth is renewed like the eagle.

<span id="an_103:6">103:6</span> Jehovah executeth righteous acts, And
judgments for all that are oppressed.

<span id="an_103:7">103:7</span> He made known his ways unto Moses, His
doings unto the children of Israel.

<span id="an_103:8">103:8</span> Jehovah is merciful and gracious, Slow
to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness.

<span id="an_103:9">103:9</span> He will not always chide; Neither will
he keep \[his anger\] for ever.

<span id="an_103:10">103:10</span> He hath not dealt with us after our
sins, Nor rewarded us after our iniquities.

<span id="an_103:11">103:11</span> For as the heavens are high above the
earth, So great is his lovingkindness toward them that fear him.

<span id="an_103:12">103:12</span> As far as the east is from the west,
So far hath he removed our transgressions from us.

<span id="an_103:13">103:13</span> Like as a father pitieth his
children, So Jehovah pitieth them that fear him.

<span id="an_103:14">103:14</span> For he knoweth our frame; He
remembereth that we are dust.

<span id="an_103:15">103:15</span> As for man, his days are as grass; As
a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.

<span id="an_103:16">103:16</span> For the wind passeth over it, and it
is gone; And the place thereof shall know it no more.

<span id="an_103:17">103:17</span> But the lovingkindness of Jehovah is
from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, And his
righteousness unto children's children;

<span id="an_103:18">103:18</span> To such as keep his covenant, And to
those that remember his precepts to do them.

<span id="an_103:19">103:19</span> Jehovah hath established his throne
in the heavens; And his kingdom ruleth over all.

<span id="an_103:20">103:20</span> Bless Jehovah, ye his angels, That
are mighty in strength, that fulfil his word, Hearkening unto the voice
of his word.

<span id="an_103:21">103:21</span> Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts, Ye
ministers of his, that do his pleasure.

<span id="an_103:22">103:22</span> Bless Jehovah, all ye his works, In
all places of his dominion: Bless Jehovah, O my soul.

<span id="an_104:1">104:1</span> Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my
God, thou art very great; Thou art clothed with honor and majesty:

<span id="an_104:2">104:2</span> Who coverest thyself with light as with
a garment; Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain;

<span id="an_104:3">104:3</span> Who layeth the beams of his chambers in
the waters; Who maketh the clouds his chariot; Who walketh upon the
wings of the wind;

<span id="an_104:4">104:4</span> Who maketh winds his messengers; Flames
of fire his ministers;

<span id="an_104:5">104:5</span> Who laid the foundations of the earth,
That it should not be moved for ever.

<span id="an_104:6">104:6</span> Thou coveredst it with the deep as with
a vesture; The waters stood above the mountains.

<span id="an_104:7">104:7</span> At thy rebuke they fled; At the voice
of thy thunder they hasted away

<span id="an_104:8">104:8</span> (The mountains rose, the valleys sank
down) Unto the place which thou hadst founded for them.

<span id="an_104:9">104:9</span> Thou hast set a bound that they may not
pass over; That they turn not again to cover the earth.

<span id="an_104:10">104:10</span> He sendeth forth springs into the
valleys; They run among the mountains;

<span id="an_104:11">104:11</span> They give drink to every beast of the
field; The wild asses quench their thirst.

<span id="an_104:12">104:12</span> By them the birds of the heavens have
their habitation; They sing among the branches.

<span id="an_104:13">104:13</span> He watereth the mountains from his
chambers: The earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.

<span id="an_104:14">104:14</span> He causeth the grass to grow for the
cattle, And herb for the service of man; That he may bring forth food
out of the earth,

<span id="an_104:15">104:15</span> And wine that maketh glad the heart
of man, \[And\] oil to make his face to shine, And bread that
strengtheneth man's heart.

<span id="an_104:16">104:16</span> The trees of Jehovah are filled
\[with moisture\], The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;

<span id="an_104:17">104:17</span> Where the birds make their nests: As
for the stork, the fir-trees are her house.

<span id="an_104:18">104:18</span> The high mountains are for the wild
goats; The rocks are a refuge for the conies.

<span id="an_104:19">104:19</span> He appointed the moon for seasons:
The sun knoweth his going down.

<span id="an_104:20">104:20</span> Thou makest darkness, and it is
night, Wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth.

<span id="an_104:21">104:21</span> The young lions roar after their
prey, And seek their food from God.

<span id="an_104:22">104:22</span> The sun ariseth, they get them away,
And lay them down in their dens.

<span id="an_104:23">104:23</span> Man goeth forth unto his work And to
his labor until the evening.

<span id="an_104:24">104:24</span> O Jehovah, how manifold are thy
works! In wisdom hast thou made them all: The earth is full of thy
riches.

<span id="an_104:25">104:25</span> Yonder is the sea, great and wide,
Wherein are things creeping innumerable, Both small and great beasts.

<span id="an_104:26">104:26</span> There go the ships; There is
leviathan, whom thou hast formed to play therein.

<span id="an_104:27">104:27</span> These wait all for thee, That thou
mayest give them their food in due season.

<span id="an_104:28">104:28</span> Thou givest unto them, they gather;
Thou openest thy hand, they are satisfied with good.

<span id="an_104:29">104:29</span> Thou hidest thy face, they are
troubled; Thou takest away their breath, they die, And return to their
dust.

<span id="an_104:30">104:30</span> Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they
are created; And thou renewest the face of the ground.

<span id="an_104:31">104:31</span> Let the glory of Jehovah endure for
ever; Let Jehovah rejoice in his works:

<span id="an_104:32">104:32</span> Who looketh on the earth, and it
trembleth; He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.

<span id="an_104:33">104:33</span> I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I
live: I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.

<span id="an_104:34">104:34</span> Let thy meditation be sweet unto him:
I will rejoice in Jehovah.

<span id="an_104:35">104:35</span> Let sinners be consumed out of the
earth. And let the wicked be no more. Bless Jehovah, O my soul. Praise
ye Jehovah.

<span id="an_105:1">105:1</span> Oh give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon
his name; Make known among the peoples his doings.

<span id="an_105:2">105:2</span> Sing unto him, sing praises unto him;
Talk ye of all his marvelous works.

<span id="an_105:3">105:3</span> Glory ye in his holy name: Let the
heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.

<span id="an_105:4">105:4</span> Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek
his face evermore.

<span id="an_105:5">105:5</span> Remember his marvellous works that he
hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,

<span id="an_105:6">105:6</span> O ye seed of Abraham his servant, Ye
children of Jacob, his chosen ones.

<span id="an_105:7">105:7</span> He is Jehovah our God: His judgments
are in all the earth.

<span id="an_105:8">105:8</span> He hath remembered his covenant for
ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,

<span id="an_105:9">105:9</span> \[The covenant\] which he made with
Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac,

<span id="an_105:10">105:10</span> And confirmed the same unto Jacob for
a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant,

<span id="an_105:11">105:11</span> Saying, Unto thee will I give the
land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;

<span id="an_105:12">105:12</span> When they were but a few men in
number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it.

<span id="an_105:13">105:13</span> And they went about from nation to
nation, From one kingdom to another people.

<span id="an_105:14">105:14</span> He suffered no man to do them wrong;
Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,

<span id="an_105:15">105:15</span> \[Saying\], Touch not mine anointed
ones, And do my prophets no harm.

<span id="an_105:16">105:16</span> And he called for a famine upon the
land; He brake the whole staff of bread.

<span id="an_105:17">105:17</span> He sent a man before them; Joseph was
sold for a servant:

<span id="an_105:18">105:18</span> His feet they hurt with fetters: He
was laid in \[chains of\] iron,

<span id="an_105:19">105:19</span> Until the time that his word came to
pass, The word of Jehovah tried him.

<span id="an_105:20">105:20</span> The king sent and loosed him; Even
the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.

<span id="an_105:21">105:21</span> He made him lord of his house, And
ruler of all his substance;

<span id="an_105:22">105:22</span> To bind his princes at his pleasure,
And teach his elders wisdom.

<span id="an_105:23">105:23</span> Israel also came into Egypt; And
Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.

<span id="an_105:24">105:24</span> And he increased his people greatly,
And made them stronger than their adversaries.

<span id="an_105:25">105:25</span> He turned their heart to hate his
people, To deal subtly with his servants.

<span id="an_105:26">105:26</span> He sent Moses his servant, \[And\]
Aaron whom he had chosen.

<span id="an_105:27">105:27</span> They set among them his signs, And
wonders in the land of Ham.

<span id="an_105:28">105:28</span> He sent darkness, and made it dark;
And they rebelled not against his words.

<span id="an_105:29">105:29</span> He turned their waters into blood,
And slew their fish.

<span id="an_105:30">105:30</span> Their land swarmed with frogs In the
chambers of their kings.

<span id="an_105:31">105:31</span> He spake, and there came swarms of
flies, And lice in all their borders.

<span id="an_105:32">105:32</span> He gave them hail for rain, \[And\]
flaming fire in their land.

<span id="an_105:33">105:33</span> He smote their vines also and their
fig-trees, And brake the trees of their borders.

<span id="an_105:34">105:34</span> He spake, and the locust came, And
the grasshopper, and that without number,

<span id="an_105:35">105:35</span> And did eat up every herb in their
land, And did eat up the fruit of their ground.

<span id="an_105:36">105:36</span> He smote also all the first-born in
their land, The chief of all their strength.

<span id="an_105:37">105:37</span> And he brought them forth with silver
and gold; And there was not one feeble person among his tribes.

<span id="an_105:38">105:38</span> Egypt was glad when they departed;
For the fear of them had fallen upon them.

<span id="an_105:39">105:39</span> He spread a cloud for a covering, And
fire to give light in the night.

<span id="an_105:40">105:40</span> They asked, and he brought quails,
And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.

<span id="an_105:41">105:41</span> He opened the rock, and waters gushed
out; They ran in the dry places \[like\] a river.

<span id="an_105:42">105:42</span> For he remembered his holy word,
\[And\] Abraham his servant.

<span id="an_105:43">105:43</span> And he brought forth his people with
joy, \[And\] his chosen with singing.

<span id="an_105:44">105:44</span> And he gave them the lands of the
nations; And they took the labor of the peoples in possession:

<span id="an_105:45">105:45</span> That they might keep his statutes,
And observe his laws. Praise ye Jehovah.

<span id="an_106:1">106:1</span> Praise ye Jehovah. Oh give thanks unto
Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] forever.

<span id="an_106:2">106:2</span> Who can utter the mighty acts of
Jehovah, Or show forth all his praise?

<span id="an_106:3">106:3</span> Blessed are they that keep justice, And
he that doeth righteousness at all times.

<span id="an_106:4">106:4</span> Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor
that thou bearest unto thy people; Oh visit me with thy salvation,

<span id="an_106:5">106:5</span> That I may see the prosperity of thy
chosen, That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, That I may
glory with thine inheritance.

<span id="an_106:6">106:6</span> We have sinned with our fathers, We
have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.

<span id="an_106:7">106:7</span> Our fathers understood not thy wonders
in Egypt; They remembered not the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses, But
were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.

<span id="an_106:8">106:8</span> Nevertheless he saved them for his
name's sake, That he might make his mighty power to be known.

<span id="an_106:9">106:9</span> He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was
dried up: So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.

<span id="an_106:10">106:10</span> And he saved them from the hand of
him that hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

<span id="an_106:11">106:11</span> And the waters covered their
adversaries; There was not one of them left.

<span id="an_106:12">106:12</span> Then believed they his words; They
sang his praise.

<span id="an_106:13">106:13</span> They soon forgat his works; They
waited not for his counsel,

<span id="an_106:14">106:14</span> But lusted exceedingly in the
wilderness, And tempted God in the desert.

<span id="an_106:15">106:15</span> And he gave them their request, But
sent leanness into their soul.

<span id="an_106:16">106:16</span> They envied Moses also in the camp,
\[And\] Aaron the saint of Jehovah.

<span id="an_106:17">106:17</span> The earth opened and swallowed up
Dathan, And covered the company of Abiram.

<span id="an_106:18">106:18</span> And a fire was kindled in their
company; The flame burned up the wicked.

<span id="an_106:19">106:19</span> They made a calf in Horeb, And
worshipped a molten image.

<span id="an_106:20">106:20</span> Thus they changed their glory For the
likeness of an ox that eateth grass.

<span id="an_106:21">106:21</span> They forgat God their Saviour, Who
had done great things in Egypt,

<span id="an_106:22">106:22</span> Wondrous works in the land of Ham,
\[And\] terrible things by the Red Sea.

<span id="an_106:23">106:23</span> Therefore he said that he would
destroy them, Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach,
To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy \[them\].

<span id="an_106:24">106:24</span> Yea, they despised the pleasant land,
They believed not his word,

<span id="an_106:25">106:25</span> But murmured in their tents, And
hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah.

<span id="an_106:26">106:26</span> Therefore he sware unto them, That he
would overthrow them in the wilderness,

<span id="an_106:27">106:27</span> And that he would overthrow their
seed among the nations, And scatter them in the lands.

<span id="an_106:28">106:28</span> They joined themselves also unto
Baal-peor, And ate the sacrifices of the dead.

<span id="an_106:29">106:29</span> Thus they provoked him to anger with
their doings; And the plague brake in upon them.

<span id="an_106:30">106:30</span> Then stood up Phinehas, and executed
judgment; And so the plague was stayed.

<span id="an_106:31">106:31</span> And that was reckoned unto him for
righteousness, Unto all generations for evermore.

<span id="an_106:32">106:32</span> They angered him also at the waters
of Meribah, So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;

<span id="an_106:33">106:33</span> Because they were rebellious against
his spirit, And he spake unadvisedly with his lips.

<span id="an_106:34">106:34</span> They did not destroy the peoples, As
Jehovah commanded them,

<span id="an_106:35">106:35</span> But mingled themselves with the
nations, And learned their works,

<span id="an_106:36">106:36</span> And served their idols, Which became
a snare unto them.

<span id="an_106:37">106:37</span> Yea, they sacrificed their sons and
their daughters unto demons,

<span id="an_106:38">106:38</span> And shed innocent blood, Even the
blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they sacrificed unto
the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood.

<span id="an_106:39">106:39</span> Thus were they defiled with their
works, And played the harlot in their doings.

<span id="an_106:40">106:40</span> Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah
kindled against his people, And he abhorred his inheritance.

<span id="an_106:41">106:41</span> And he gave them into the hand of the
nations; And they that hated them ruled over them.

<span id="an_106:42">106:42</span> Their enemies also oppressed them,
And they were brought into subjection under their hand.

<span id="an_106:43">106:43</span> Many times did he deliver them; But
they were rebellious in their counsel, And were brought low in their
iniquity.

<span id="an_106:44">106:44</span> Nevertheless he regarded their
distress, When he heard their cry:

<span id="an_106:45">106:45</span> And he remembered for them his
covenant, And repented according to the multitude of his
lovingkindnesses.

<span id="an_106:46">106:46</span> He made them also to be pitied Of all
those that carried them captive.

<span id="an_106:47">106:47</span> Save us, O Jehovah our God, And
gather us from among the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And
to triumph in thy praise.

<span id="an_106:48">106:48</span> Blessed be Jehovah, the God of
Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people
say, Amen. Praise ye Jehovah. BOOK V

<span id="an_107:1">107:1</span> O give thanks unto Jehovah; For he is
good; For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_107:2">107:2</span> Let the redeemed of Jehovah say \[so\],
Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary,

<span id="an_107:3">107:3</span> And gathered out of the lands, From the
east and from the west, From the north and from the south.

<span id="an_107:4">107:4</span> They wandered in the wilderness in a
desert way; They found no city of habitation.

<span id="an_107:5">107:5</span> Hungry and thirsty, Their soul fainted
in them.

<span id="an_107:6">107:6</span> Then they cried unto Jehovah in their
trouble, And he delivered them out of their distresses,

<span id="an_107:7">107:7</span> He led them also by a straight way,
That they might go to a city of habitation.

<span id="an_107:8">107:8</span> Oh that men would praise Jehovah for
his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!

<span id="an_107:9">107:9</span> For he satisfieth the longing soul, And
the hungry soul he filleth with good.

<span id="an_107:10">107:10</span> Such as sat in darkness and in the
shadow of death, Being bound in affliction and iron,

<span id="an_107:11">107:11</span> Because they rebelled against the
words of God, And contemned the counsel of the Most High:

<span id="an_107:12">107:12</span> Therefore he brought down their heart
with labor; They fell down, and there was none to help.

<span id="an_107:13">107:13</span> Then they cried unto Jehovah in their
trouble, And he saved them out of their distresses.

<span id="an_107:14">107:14</span> He brought them out of darkness and
the shadow of death, And brake their bonds in sunder.

<span id="an_107:15">107:15</span> Oh that men would praise Jehovah for
his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!

<span id="an_107:16">107:16</span> For he hath broken the gates of
brass, And cut the bars of iron in sunder.

<span id="an_107:17">107:17</span> Fools because of their transgression,
And because of their iniquities, are afflicted.

<span id="an_107:18">107:18</span> Their soul abhorreth all manner of
food; And they draw near unto the gates of death.

<span id="an_107:19">107:19</span> Then they cry unto Jehovah in their
trouble, And he saveth them out of their distresses.

<span id="an_107:20">107:20</span> He sendeth his word, and healeth
them, And delivereth \[them\] from their destructions.

<span id="an_107:21">107:21</span> Oh that men would praise Jehovah for
his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!

<span id="an_107:22">107:22</span> And let them offer the sacrifices of
thanksgiving, And declare his works with singing.

<span id="an_107:23">107:23</span> They that go down to the sea in
ships, That do business in great waters;

<span id="an_107:24">107:24</span> These see the works of Jehovah, And
his wonders in the deep.

<span id="an_107:25">107:25</span> For he commandeth, and raiseth the
stormy wind, Which lifteth up the waves thereof.

<span id="an_107:26">107:26</span> They mount up to the heavens, they go
down again to the depths: Their soul melteth away because of trouble.

<span id="an_107:27">107:27</span> They reel to and fro, and stagger
like a drunken man, And are at their wits' end.

<span id="an_107:28">107:28</span> Then they cry unto Jehovah in their
trouble, And he bringeth them out of their distresses.

<span id="an_107:29">107:29</span> He maketh the storm a calm, So that
the waves thereof are still.

<span id="an_107:30">107:30</span> Then are they glad because they are
quiet; So he bringeth them unto their desired haven.

<span id="an_107:31">107:31</span> Oh that men would praise Jehovah for
his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!

<span id="an_107:32">107:32</span> Let them exalt him also in the
assembly of the people, And praise him in the seat of the elders.

<span id="an_107:33">107:33</span> He turneth rivers into a wilderness,
And watersprings into a thirsty ground;

<span id="an_107:34">107:34</span> A fruitful land into a salt desert,
For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.

<span id="an_107:35">107:35</span> He turneth a wilderness into a pool
of water, And a dry land into watersprings.

<span id="an_107:36">107:36</span> And there he maketh the hungry to
dwell, That they may prepare a city of habitation,

<span id="an_107:37">107:37</span> And sow fields, and plant vineyards,
And get them fruits of increase.

<span id="an_107:38">107:38</span> He blesseth them also, so that they
are multiplied greatly; And he suffereth not their cattle to decrease.

<span id="an_107:39">107:39</span> Again, they are diminished and bowed
down Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.

<span id="an_107:40">107:40</span> He poureth contempt upon princes, And
causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.

<span id="an_107:41">107:41</span> Yet setteth he the needy on high from
affliction, And maketh \[him\] families like a flock.

<span id="an_107:42">107:42</span> The upright shall see it, and be
glad; And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.

<span id="an_107:43">107:43</span> Whoso is wise will give heed to these
things; And they will consider the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah.

<span id="an_108:1">108:1</span> A Song, A Psalm of David. My heart is
fixed, O God; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory.

<span id="an_108:2">108:2</span> Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will
awake right early.

<span id="an_108:3">108:3</span> I will give thanks unto thee, O
Jehovah, among the peoples; And I will sing praises unto thee among the
nations.

<span id="an_108:4">108:4</span> For thy lovingkindness is great above
the heavens; And thy truth \[reacheth\] unto the skies.

<span id="an_108:5">108:5</span> Be thou exalted, O God, above the
heavens, And thy glory above all the earth.

<span id="an_108:6">108:6</span> That thy beloved may be delivered, Save
with thy right hand, and answer us.

<span id="an_108:7">108:7</span> God hath spoken in his holiness: I will
exult; I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

<span id="an_108:8">108:8</span> Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine;
Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre.

<span id="an_108:9">108:9</span> Moab is my washpot; Upon Edom will I
cast my shoe; Over Philistia will I shout.

<span id="an_108:10">108:10</span> Who will bring me into the fortified
city? Who hath led me unto Edom?

<span id="an_108:11">108:11</span> Hast not thou cast us off, O God? And
thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts.

<span id="an_108:12">108:12</span> Give us help against the adversary;
For vain is the help of man.

<span id="an_108:13">108:13</span> Through God we shall do valiantly:
For he it is that will tread down our adversaries.

<span id="an_109:1">109:1</span> For the Chief Musicion. A Psalm of
David. Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;

<span id="an_109:2">109:2</span> For the mouth of the wicked and the
mouth of deceit have they opened against me: They have spoken unto me
with a lying tongue.

<span id="an_109:3">109:3</span> They have compassed me about also with
words of hatred, And fought against me without a cause.

<span id="an_109:4">109:4</span> For my love they are my adversaries:
But I \[give myself unto\] prayer.

<span id="an_109:5">109:5</span> And they have rewarded me evil for
good, And hatred for my love.

<span id="an_109:6">109:6</span> Set thou a wicked man over him; And let
an adversary stand at his right hand.

<span id="an_109:7">109:7</span> When he is judged, let him come forth
guilty; And let his prayer be turned into sin.

<span id="an_109:8">109:8</span> Let his days be few; \[And\] let
another take his office.

<span id="an_109:9">109:9</span> Let his children be fatherless, And his
wife a widow.

<span id="an_109:10">109:10</span> Let his children be vagabonds, and
beg; And let them seek \[their bread\] out of their desolate places.

<span id="an_109:11">109:11</span> Let the extortioner catch all that he
hath; And let strangers make spoil of his labor.

<span id="an_109:12">109:12</span> Let there be none to extend kindness
unto him; Neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless
children.

<span id="an_109:13">109:13</span> Let his posterity be cut off; In the
generation following let their name be blotted out.

<span id="an_109:14">109:14</span> Let the iniquity of his fathers be
remembered with Jehovah; And let not the sin of his mother be blotted
out.

<span id="an_109:15">109:15</span> Let them be before Jehovah
continually, That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth;

<span id="an_109:16">109:16</span> Because he remembered not to show
kindness, But persecuted the poor and needy man, And the broken in
heart, to slay \[them\].

<span id="an_109:17">109:17</span> Yea, he loved cursing, and it came
unto him; And he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him.

<span id="an_109:18">109:18</span> He clothed himself also with cursing
as with his garment, And it came into his inward parts like water, And
like oil into his bones.

<span id="an_109:19">109:19</span> Let it be unto him as the raiment
wherewith he covereth himself, And for the girdle wherewith he is girded
continually.

<span id="an_109:20">109:20</span> This is the reward of mine
adversaries from Jehovah, And of them that speak evil against my soul.

<span id="an_109:21">109:21</span> But deal thou with me, O Jehovah the
Lord, for thy name's sake: Because thy lovingkindness is good, deliver
thou me;

<span id="an_109:22">109:22</span> For I am poor and needy, And my heart
is wounded within me.

<span id="an_109:23">109:23</span> I am gone like the shadow when it
declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.

<span id="an_109:24">109:24</span> My knees are weak through fasting;
And my flesh faileth of fatness.

<span id="an_109:25">109:25</span> I am become also a reproach unto
them: When they see me, they shake their head.

<span id="an_109:26">109:26</span> Help me, O Jehovah my God; Oh save me
according to thy lovingkindness:

<span id="an_109:27">109:27</span> That they may know that this is thy
hand; \[That\] thou, Jehovah, hast done it.

<span id="an_109:28">109:28</span> Let them curse, but bless thou: When
they arise, they shall be put to shame, But thy servant shall rejoice.

<span id="an_109:29">109:29</span> Let mine adversaries be clothed with
dishonor, And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a
robe.

<span id="an_109:30">109:30</span> I will give great thanks unto Jehovah
with my mouth; Yea, I will praise him among the multitude.

<span id="an_109:31">109:31</span> For he will stand at the right hand
of the needy, To save him from them that judge his soul.

<span id="an_110:1">110:1</span> A Psalm of David. Jehovah saith unto my
Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, Until I make thine enemies thy
footstool.

<span id="an_110:2">110:2</span> Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy
strength out of Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.

<span id="an_110:3">110:3</span> Thy people offer themselves willingly
In the day of thy power, in holy array: Out of the womb of the morning
Thou hast the dew of thy youth.

<span id="an_110:4">110:4</span> Jehovah hath sworn, and will not
repent: Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek.

<span id="an_110:5">110:5</span> The Lord at thy right hand Will strike
through kings in the day of his wrath.

<span id="an_110:6">110:6</span> He will judge among the nations, He
will fill \[the places\] with dead bodies; He will strike through the
head in many countries.

<span id="an_110:7">110:7</span> He will drink of the brook in the way:
Therefore will he lift up the head.

<span id="an_111:1">111:1</span> Praise ye Jehovah. I will give thanks
unto Jehovah with my whole heart, In the council of the upright, and in
the congregation.

<span id="an_111:2">111:2</span> The works of Jehovah are great, Sought
out of all them that have pleasure therein.

<span id="an_111:3">111:3</span> His work is honor and majesty; And his
righteousness endureth for ever.

<span id="an_111:4">111:4</span> He hath made his wonderful works to be
remembered: Jehovah is gracious and merciful.

<span id="an_111:5">111:5</span> He hath given food unto them that fear
him: He will ever be mindful of his covenant.

<span id="an_111:6">111:6</span> He hath showed his people the power of
his works, In giving them the heritage of the nations.

<span id="an_111:7">111:7</span> The works of his hands are truth and
justice; All his precepts are sure.

<span id="an_111:8">111:8</span> They are established for ever and ever;
They are done in truth and uprightness.

<span id="an_111:9">111:9</span> He hath sent redemption unto his
people; He hath commanded his covenant for ever: Holy and reverend is
his name.

<span id="an_111:10">111:10</span> The fear of Jehovah is the beginning
of wisdom; A good understanding have all they that do \[his
commandments\]: His praise endureth for ever.

<span id="an_112:1">112:1</span> Praise ye Jehovah. Blessed is the man
that feareth Jehovah, That delighteth greatly in his commandments.

<span id="an_112:2">112:2</span> His seed shall be mighty upon earth:
The generation of the upright shall be blessed.

<span id="an_112:3">112:3</span> Wealth and riches are in his house; And
his righteousness endureth for ever.

<span id="an_112:4">112:4</span> Unto the upright there ariseth light in
the darkness: \[He is\] gracious, and merciful, and righteous.

<span id="an_112:5">112:5</span> Well is it with the man that dealeth
graciously and lendeth; He shall maintain his cause in judgment.

<span id="an_112:6">112:6</span> For he shall never be moved; The
righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance.

<span id="an_112:7">112:7</span> He shall not be afraid of evil tidings:
His heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah.

<span id="an_112:8">112:8</span> His heart is established, he shall not
be afraid, Until he see \[his desire\] upon his adversaries.

<span id="an_112:9">112:9</span> He hath dispersed, he hath given to the
needy; His righteousness endureth for ever: His horn shall be exalted
with honor.

<span id="an_112:10">112:10</span> The wicked shall see it, and be
grieved; He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: The desire of the
wicked shall perish.

<span id="an_113:1">113:1</span> Praise ye Jehovah. Praise, O ye
servants of Jehovah, Praise the name of Jehovah.

<span id="an_113:2">113:2</span> Blessed be the name of Jehovah From
this time forth and for evermore.

<span id="an_113:3">113:3</span> From the rising of the sun unto the
going down of the same Jehovah's name is to be praised.

<span id="an_113:4">113:4</span> Jehovah is high above all nations, And
his glory above the heavens.

<span id="an_113:5">113:5</span> Who is like unto Jehovah our God, That
hath his seat on high,

<span id="an_113:6">113:6</span> That humbleth himself to behold \[The
things that are\] in heaven and in the earth?

<span id="an_113:7">113:7</span> He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,
And lifteth up the needy from the dunghill;

<span id="an_113:8">113:8</span> That he may set him with princes, Even
with the princes of his people.

<span id="an_113:9">113:9</span> He maketh the barren woman to keep
house, \[And to be\] a joyful mother of children. Praise ye Jehovah.

<span id="an_114:1">114:1</span> When Israel went forth out of Egypt,
The house of Jacob from a people of strange language;

<span id="an_114:2">114:2</span> Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his
dominion.

<span id="an_114:3">114:3</span> The sea saw it, and fled; The Jordan
was driven back.

<span id="an_114:4">114:4</span> The mountains skipped like rams, The
little hills like lambs.

<span id="an_114:5">114:5</span> What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou
fleest? Thou Jordan, that thou turnest back?

<span id="an_114:6">114:6</span> Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams;
Ye little hills, like lambs?

<span id="an_114:7">114:7</span> Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of
the Lord, At the presence of the God of Jacob,

<span id="an_114:8">114:8</span> Who turned the rock into a pool of
water, The flint into a fountain of waters.

<span id="an_115:1">115:1</span> Not unto us, O Jehovah, not unto us,
But unto thy name give glory, For thy lovingkindness, and for thy
truth's sake.

<span id="an_115:2">115:2</span> Wherefore should the nations say, Where
is now their God?

<span id="an_115:3">115:3</span> But our God is in the heavens: He hath
done whatsoever he pleased.

<span id="an_115:4">115:4</span> Their idols are silver and gold, The
work of men's hands.

<span id="an_115:5">115:5</span> They have mouths, but they speak not;
Eyes have they, but they see not;

<span id="an_115:6">115:6</span> They have ears, but they hear not;
Noses have they, but they smell not;

<span id="an_115:7">115:7</span> They have hands, but they handle not;
Feet have they, but they walk not; Neither speak they through their
throat.

<span id="an_115:8">115:8</span> They that make them shall be like unto
them; Yea, every one that trusteth in them.

<span id="an_115:9">115:9</span> O Israel, trust thou in Jehovah: He is
their help and their shield.

<span id="an_115:10">115:10</span> O house of Aaron, trust ye in
Jehovah: He is their help and their shield.

<span id="an_115:11">115:11</span> Ye that fear Jehovah, trust in
Jehovah: He is their help and their shield.

<span id="an_115:12">115:12</span> Jehovah hath been mindful of us; he
will bless \[us\]: He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the
house of Aaron.

<span id="an_115:13">115:13</span> He will bless them that fear Jehovah,
Both small and great.

<span id="an_115:14">115:14</span> Jehovah increase you more and more,
You and your children.

<span id="an_115:15">115:15</span> Blessed are ye of Jehovah, Who made
heaven and earth.

<span id="an_115:16">115:16</span> The heavens are the heavens of
Jehovah; But the earth hath he given to the children of men.

<span id="an_115:17">115:17</span> The dead praise not Jehovah, Neither
any that go down into silence;

<span id="an_115:18">115:18</span> But we will bless Jehovah From this
time forth and for evermore. Praise ye Jehovah.

<span id="an_116:1">116:1</span> I love Jehovah, because he heareth My
voice and my supplications.

<span id="an_116:2">116:2</span> Because he hath inclined his ear unto
me, Therefore will I call \[upon him\] as long as I live.

<span id="an_116:3">116:3</span> The cords of death compassed me, And
the pains of Sheol gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.

<span id="an_116:4">116:4</span> Then called I upon the name of Jehovah:
O Jehovah, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.

<span id="an_116:5">116:5</span> Gracious is Jehovah, and righteous;
Yea, our God is merciful.

<span id="an_116:6">116:6</span> Jehovah preserveth the simple: I was
brought low, and he saved me.

<span id="an_116:7">116:7</span> Return unto thy rest, O my soul; For
Jehovah hath dealt bountifully with thee.

<span id="an_116:8">116:8</span> For thou hast delivered my soul from
death, Mine eyes from tears, \[And\] my feet from falling.

<span id="an_116:9">116:9</span> I will walk before Jehovah In the land
of the living.

<span id="an_116:10">116:10</span> I believe, for I will speak: I was
greatly afflicted:

<span id="an_116:11">116:11</span> I said in my haste, All men are
liars.

<span id="an_116:12">116:12</span> What shall I render unto Jehovah For
all his benefits toward me?

<span id="an_116:13">116:13</span> I will take the cup of salvation, And
call upon the name of Jehovah.

<span id="an_116:14">116:14</span> I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, Yea,
in the presence of all his people.

<span id="an_116:15">116:15</span> Precious in the sight of Jehovah Is
the death of his saints.

<span id="an_116:16">116:16</span> O Jehovah, truly I am thy servant: I
am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid; Thou hast loosed my bonds.

<span id="an_116:17">116:17</span> I will offer to thee the sacrifice of
thanksgiving, And will call upon the name of Jehovah.

<span id="an_116:18">116:18</span> I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, Yea,
in the presence of all his people,

<span id="an_116:19">116:19</span> In the courts of Jehovah's house, In
the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye Jehovah.

<span id="an_117:1">117:1</span> O praise Jehovah, all ye nations; Laud
him, all ye peoples.

<span id="an_117:2">117:2</span> For his lovingkindness is great toward
us; And the truth of Jehovah \[endureth\] for ever. Praise ye Jehovah.

<span id="an_118:1">118:1</span> Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is
good; For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_118:2">118:2</span> Let Israel now say, That his
lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_118:3">118:3</span> Let the house of Aaron now say, That
his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_118:4">118:4</span> Let them now that fear Jehovah say,
That his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_118:5">118:5</span> Out of my distress I called upon
Jehovah: Jehovah answered me \[and set me\] in a large place.

<span id="an_118:6">118:6</span> Jehovah is on my side; I will not fear:
What can man do unto me?

<span id="an_118:7">118:7</span> Jehovah is on my side among them that
help me: Therefore shall I see \[my desire\] upon them that hate me.

<span id="an_118:8">118:8</span> It is better to take refuge in Jehovah
Than to put confidence in man.

<span id="an_118:9">118:9</span> It is better to take refuge in Jehovah
Than to put confidence in princes.

<span id="an_118:10">118:10</span> All nations compassed me about: In
the name of Jehovah I will cut them off.

<span id="an_118:11">118:11</span> They compassed me about; yea, they
compassed me about: In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off.

<span id="an_118:12">118:12</span> They compassed me about like bees;
They are quenched as the fire of thorns: In the name of Jehovah I will
cut them off.

<span id="an_118:13">118:13</span> Thou didst thrust sore at me that I
might fall; But Jehovah helped me.

<span id="an_118:14">118:14</span> Jehovah is my strength and song; And
he is become my salvation.

<span id="an_118:15">118:15</span> The voice of rejoicing and salvation
is in the tents of the righteous: The right hand of Jehovah doeth
valiantly.

<span id="an_118:16">118:16</span> The right hand of Jehovah is exalted:
The right hand of Jehovah doeth valiantly.

<span id="an_118:17">118:17</span> I shall not die, but live, And
declare the works of Jehovah.

<span id="an_118:18">118:18</span> Jehovah hath chastened me sore; But
he hath not given me over unto death.

<span id="an_118:19">118:19</span> Open to me the gates of
righteousness: I will enter into them, I will give thanks unto Jehovah.

<span id="an_118:20">118:20</span> This is the gate of Jehovah; The
righteous shall enter into it.

<span id="an_118:21">118:21</span> I will give thanks unto thee; for
thou hast answered me, And art become my salvation.

<span id="an_118:22">118:22</span> The stone which the builders rejected
Is become the head of the corner.

<span id="an_118:23">118:23</span> This is Jehovah's doing; It is
marvellous in our eyes.

<span id="an_118:24">118:24</span> This is the day which Jehovah hath
made; We will rejoice and be glad in it.

<span id="an_118:25">118:25</span> Save now, we beseech thee, O Jehovah:
O Jehovah, we beseech thee, send now prosperity.

<span id="an_118:26">118:26</span> Blessed be he that cometh in the name
of Jehovah: We have blessed you out of the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_118:27">118:27</span> Jehovah is God, and he hath given us
light: Bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.

<span id="an_118:28">118:28</span> Thou art my God, and I will give
thanks unto thee: Thou art my God, I will exalt thee.

<span id="an_118:29">118:29</span> Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he
is good; For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_119:1">119:1</span> ALEPH. Blessed are they that are
perfect in the way, Who walk in the law of Jehovah.

<span id="an_119:2">119:2</span> Blessed are they that keep his
testimonies, That seek him with the whole heart.

<span id="an_119:3">119:3</span> Yea, they do no unrighteousness; They
walk in his ways.

<span id="an_119:4">119:4</span> Thou hast commanded \[us\] thy
precepts, That we should observe them diligently.

<span id="an_119:5">119:5</span> Oh that my ways were established To
observe thy statutes!

<span id="an_119:6">119:6</span> Then shall I not be put to shame, When
I have respect unto all thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:7">119:7</span> I will give thanks unto thee with
uprightness of heart, When I learn thy righteous judgments.

<span id="an_119:8">119:8</span> I will observe thy statutes: Oh forsake
me not utterly. BETH.

<span id="an_119:9">119:9</span> Wherewith shall a young man cleanse his
way? By taking heed \[thereto\] according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:10">119:10</span> With my whole heart have I sought
thee: Oh let me not wander from thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:11">119:11</span> Thy word have I laid up in my heart,
That I might not sin against thee.

<span id="an_119:12">119:12</span> Blessed art thou, O Jehovah: Teach me
thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:13">119:13</span> With my lips have I declared All the
ordinances of thy mouth.

<span id="an_119:14">119:14</span> I have rejoiced in the way of thy
testimonies, As much as in all riches.

<span id="an_119:15">119:15</span> I will meditate on thy precepts, And
have respect unto thy ways.

<span id="an_119:16">119:16</span> I will delight myself in thy
statutes: I will not forget thy word. GIMEL.

<span id="an_119:17">119:17</span> Deal bountifully with thy servant,
that I may live; So will I observe thy word.

<span id="an_119:18">119:18</span> Open thou mine eyes, that I may
behold Wondrous things out of thy law.

<span id="an_119:19">119:19</span> I am a sojourner in the earth: Hide
not thy commandments from me.

<span id="an_119:20">119:20</span> My soul breaketh for the longing That
it hath unto thine ordinances at all times.

<span id="an_119:21">119:21</span> Thou hast rebuked the proud that are
cursed, That do wander from thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:22">119:22</span> Take away from me reproach and
contempt; For I have kept thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:23">119:23</span> Princes also sat and talked against
me; \[But\] thy servant did meditate on thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:24">119:24</span> Thy testimonies also are my delight
\[And\] my counsellors. DALETH.

<span id="an_119:25">119:25</span> My soul cleaveth unto the dust:
Quicken thou me according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:26">119:26</span> I declared my ways, and thou
answeredst me: Teach me thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:27">119:27</span> Make me to understand the way of thy
precepts: So shall I meditate on thy wondrous works.

<span id="an_119:28">119:28</span> My soul melteth for heaviness:
Strengthen thou me according unto thy word.

<span id="an_119:29">119:29</span> Remove from me the way of falsehood;
And grant me thy law graciously.

<span id="an_119:30">119:30</span> I have chosen the way of
faithfulness: Thine ordinances have I set \[before me\].

<span id="an_119:31">119:31</span> I cleave unto thy testimonies: O
Jehovah, put me not to shame.

<span id="an_119:32">119:32</span> I will run the way of thy
commandments, When thou shalt enlarge my heart. HE.

<span id="an_119:33">119:33</span> Teach me, O Jehovah, the way of thy
statutes; And I shall keep it unto the end.

<span id="an_119:34">119:34</span> Give me understanding, and I shall
keep thy law; Yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.

<span id="an_119:35">119:35</span> Make me to go in the path of thy
commandments; For therein do I delight.

<span id="an_119:36">119:36</span> Incline my heart unto thy
testimonies, And not to covetousness.

<span id="an_119:37">119:37</span> Turn away mine eyes from beholding
vanity, And quicken me in thy ways.

<span id="an_119:38">119:38</span> Confirm unto thy servant thy word,
Which \[is in order\] unto the fear of thee.

<span id="an_119:39">119:39</span> Turn away my reproach whereof I am
afraid; For thine ordinances are good.

<span id="an_119:40">119:40</span> Behold, I have longed after thy
precepts: Quicken me in thy righteousness. VAV.

<span id="an_119:41">119:41</span> Let thy lovingkindnesses also come
unto me, O Jehovah, Even thy salvation, according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:42">119:42</span> So shall I have an answer for him
that reproacheth me; For I trust in thy word.

<span id="an_119:43">119:43</span> And take not the word of truth
utterly out of my mouth; For I have hoped in thine ordinances.

<span id="an_119:44">119:44</span> So shall I observe thy law
continually For ever and ever.

<span id="an_119:45">119:45</span> And I shall walk at liberty; For I
have sought thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:46">119:46</span> I will also speak of thy testimonies
before kings, And shall not be put to shame.

<span id="an_119:47">119:47</span> And I will delight myself in thy
commandments, Which I have loved.

<span id="an_119:48">119:48</span> I will lift up my hands also unto thy
commandments, which I have loved; And I will meditate on thy statutes.
ZAYIN.

<span id="an_119:49">119:49</span> Remember the word unto thy servant,
Because thou hast made me to hope.

<span id="an_119:50">119:50</span> This is my comfort in my affliction;
For thy word hath quickened me.

<span id="an_119:51">119:51</span> The proud have had me greatly in
derision: \[Yet\] have I not swerved from thy law.

<span id="an_119:52">119:52</span> I have remembered thine ordinances of
old, O Jehovah, And have comforted myself.

<span id="an_119:53">119:53</span> Hot indignation hath taken hold upon
me, Because of the wicked that forsake thy law.

<span id="an_119:54">119:54</span> Thy statutes have been my songs In
the house of my pilgrimage.

<span id="an_119:55">119:55</span> I have remembered thy name, O
Jehovah, in the night, And have observed thy law.

<span id="an_119:56">119:56</span> This I have had, Because I have kept
thy precepts. HHETH.

<span id="an_119:57">119:57</span> Jehovah is my portion: I have said
that I would observe thy words.

<span id="an_119:58">119:58</span> I entreated thy favor with my whole
heart: Be merciful unto me according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:59">119:59</span> I thought on my ways, And turned my
feet unto thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:60">119:60</span> I made haste, and delayed not, To
observe thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:61">119:61</span> The cords of the wicked have wrapped
me round; \[But\] I have not forgotten thy law.

<span id="an_119:62">119:62</span> At midnight I will rise to give
thanks unto thee Because of thy righteous ordinances.

<span id="an_119:63">119:63</span> I am a companion of all them that
fear thee, And of them that observe thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:64">119:64</span> The earth, O Jehovah, is full of thy
lovingkindness: Teach me thy statutes. TETH.

servant, O Jehovah, according unto thy word.

For I have believed in thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:67">119:67</span> Before I was afflicted I went astray;
But now I observe thy word.

<span id="an_119:68">119:68</span> Thou art good, and doest good; Teach
me thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:69">119:69</span> The proud have forged a lie against
me: With my whole heart will I keep thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:70">119:70</span> Their heart is as fat as grease; But
I delight in thy law.

<span id="an_119:71">119:71</span> It is good for me that I have been
afflicted; That I may learn thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:72">119:72</span> The law of thy mouth is better unto
me Than thousands of gold and silver. YODH.

<span id="an_119:73">119:73</span> Thy hands have made me and fashioned
me: Give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:74">119:74</span> They that fear thee shall see me and
be glad, Because I have hoped in thy word.

<span id="an_119:75">119:75</span> I know, O Jehovah, that thy judgments
are righteous, And that in faithfulness thou hast afflicted me.

<span id="an_119:76">119:76</span> Let, I pray thee, thy lovingkindness
be for my comfort, According to thy word unto thy servant.

<span id="an_119:77">119:77</span> Let thy tender mercies come unto me,
that I may live; For thy law is my delight.

<span id="an_119:78">119:78</span> Let the proud be put to shame; For
they have overthrown me wrongfully: \[But\] I will meditate on thy
precepts.

<span id="an_119:79">119:79</span> Let those that fear thee turn unto
me; And they shall know thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:80">119:80</span> Let my heart be perfect in thy
statutes, That I be not put to shame. KAPH.

<span id="an_119:81">119:81</span> My soul fainteth for thy salvation;
\[But\] I hope in thy word.

<span id="an_119:82">119:82</span> Mine eyes fail for thy word, While I
say, When wilt thou comfort me?

<span id="an_119:83">119:83</span> For I am become like a wine-skin in
the smoke; Yet do I not forget thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:84">119:84</span> How many are the days of thy servant?
When wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?

<span id="an_119:85">119:85</span> The proud have digged pits for me,
Who are not according to thy law.

<span id="an_119:86">119:86</span> All thy commandments are faithful:
They persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.

<span id="an_119:87">119:87</span> They had almost consumed me upon
earth; But I forsook not thy precepts. LAMEDH.

<span id="an_119:88">119:88</span> Quicken me after thy lovingkindness;
So shall I observe the testimony of thy mouth.

<span id="an_119:89">119:89</span> For ever, O Jehovah, Thy word is
settled in heaven.

<span id="an_119:90">119:90</span> Thy faithfulness is unto all
generations: Thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.

evil way, That I might observe thy word.

<span id="an_119:102">119:102</span> I have not turned aside from thine
ordinances; For thou hast taught me.

<span id="an_119:103">119:103</span> How sweet are thy words unto my
taste! \[Yea, sweeter\] than honey to my mouth!

understanding: Therefore I hate every false way. NUN.

freewill-offerings of my mouth, O Jehovah, And teach me thine
ordinances.

heritage for ever; For they are the rejoicing of my heart.

thy statutes For ever, even unto the end. SAMEKH.

<span id="an_119:113">119:113</span> I hate them that are of a double
mind; But thy law do I love.

<span id="an_119:114">119:114</span> Thou art my hiding-place and my
shield: I hope in thy word.

<span id="an_119:115">119:115</span> Depart from me, ye evil-doers, That
I may keep the commandments of my God.

<span id="an_119:116">119:116</span> Uphold me according unto thy word,
that I may live; And let me not be ashamed of my hope.

<span id="an_119:117">119:117</span> Hold thou me up, and I shall be
safe, And shall have respect unto thy statutes continually.

<span id="an_119:118">119:118</span> Thou hast set at nought all them
that err from thy statutes; For their deceit is falsehood.

<span id="an_119:119">119:119</span> Thou puttest away all the wicked of
the earth like dross: Therefore I love thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:120">119:120</span> My flesh trembleth for fear of
thee; And I am afraid of thy judgments. AYIN.

<span id="an_119:121">119:121</span> I have done justice and
righteousness: Leave me not to mine oppressors.

<span id="an_119:122">119:122</span> Be surety for thy servant for good:
Let not the proud oppress me.

<span id="an_119:123">119:123</span> Mine eyes fail for thy salvation,
And for thy righteous word.

<span id="an_119:124">119:124</span> Deal with thy servant according
unto thy lovingkindness, And teach me thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:125">119:125</span> I am thy servant; give me
understanding, That I may know thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:126">119:126</span> It is time for Jehovah to work;
\[For\] they have made void thy law.

<span id="an_119:127">119:127</span> Therefore I love thy commandments
Above gold, yea, above fine gold.

<span id="an_119:128">119:128</span> Therefore I esteem all \[thy\]
precepts concerning all \[things\] to be right; \[And\] I hate every
false way. PE.

<span id="an_119:129">119:129</span> Thy testimonies are wonderful;
Therefore doth my soul keep them.

<span id="an_119:130">119:130</span> The opening of thy words giveth
light; It giveth understanding unto the simple.

<span id="an_119:131">119:131</span> I opened wide my mouth, and panted;
For I longed for thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:132">119:132</span> Turn thee unto me, and have mercy
upon me, As thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.

<span id="an_119:133">119:133</span> Establish my footsteps in thy word;
And let not any iniquity have dominion over me.

<span id="an_119:134">119:134</span> Redeem me from the oppression of
man: So will I observe thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:135">119:135</span> Make thy face to shine upon thy
servant; And teach me thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:136">119:136</span> Streams of water run down mine
eyes, Because they observe not thy law. TSADHE.

<span id="an_119:137">119:137</span> Righteous art thou, O Jehovah, And
upright are thy judgments.

<span id="an_119:138">119:138</span> Thou hast commanded thy testimonies
in righteousness And very faithfulness.

<span id="an_119:139">119:139</span> My zeal hath consumed me, Because
mine adversaries have forgotten thy words.

<span id="an_119:140">119:140</span> Thy word is very pure; Therefore
thy servant loveth it.

<span id="an_119:141">119:141</span> I am small and despised; \[Yet\] do
I not forget thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:142">119:142</span> Thy righteousness is an everlasting
righteousness, And thy law is truth.

<span id="an_119:143">119:143</span> Trouble and anguish have taken hold
on me; \[Yet\] thy commandments are my delight.

<span id="an_119:144">119:144</span> Thy testimonies are righteous for
ever: Give me understanding, and I shall live. QOPH.

<span id="an_119:145">119:145</span> I have called with my whole heart;
answer me, O Jehovah: I will keep thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:146">119:146</span> I have called unto thee; save me,
And I shall observe thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:147">119:147</span> I anticipated the dawning of the
morning, and cried: I hoped in thy words.

<span id="an_119:148">119:148</span> Mine eyes anticipated the
night-watches, That I might meditate on thy word.

<span id="an_119:149">119:149</span> Hear my voice according unto thy
lovingkindness: Quicken me, O Jehovah, according to thine ordinances.

<span id="an_119:150">119:150</span> They draw nigh that follow after
wickedness; They are far from thy law.

<span id="an_119:151">119:151</span> Thou art nigh, O Jehovah; And all
thy commandments are truth.

<span id="an_119:152">119:152</span> Of old have I known from thy
testimonies, That thou hast founded them for ever. RESH.

<span id="an_119:153">119:153</span> Consider mine affliction, and
deliver me; For I do not forget thy law.

<span id="an_119:154">119:154</span> Plead thou my cause, and redeem me:
Quicken me according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:155">119:155</span> Salvation is far from the wicked;
For they seek not thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:156">119:156</span> Great are thy tender mercies, O
Jehovah: Quicken me according to thine ordinances.

<span id="an_119:157">119:157</span> Many are my persecutors and mine
adversaries; \[Yet\] have I not swerved from thy testimonies.

<span id="an_119:158">119:158</span> I beheld the treacherous, and was
grieved, Because they observe not thy word.

<span id="an_119:159">119:159</span> Consider how I love thy precepts:
Quicken me, O Jehovah, according to thy lovingkindness.

<span id="an_119:160">119:160</span> The sum of thy word is truth; And
every one of thy righteous ordinances \[endureth\] for ever. SHIN.

<span id="an_119:161">119:161</span> Princes have persecuted me without
a cause; But my heart standeth in awe of thy words.

<span id="an_119:162">119:162</span> I rejoice at thy word, As one that
findeth great spoil.

<span id="an_119:163">119:163</span> I hate and abhor falsehood; \[But\]
thy law do I love.

<span id="an_119:164">119:164</span> Seven times a day do I praise thee,
Because of thy righteous ordinances.

<span id="an_119:165">119:165</span> Great peace have they that love thy
law; And they have no occasion of stumbling.

<span id="an_119:166">119:166</span> I have hoped for thy salvation, O
Jehovah, And have done thy commandments.

<span id="an_119:167">119:167</span> My soul hath observed thy
testimonies; And I love them exceedingly.

<span id="an_119:168">119:168</span> I have observed thy precepts and
thy testimonies; For all my ways are before thee. TAV.

<span id="an_119:169">119:169</span> Let my cry come near before thee, O
Jehovah: Give me understanding according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:170">119:170</span> Let my supplication come before
thee: Deliver me according to thy word.

<span id="an_119:171">119:171</span> Let my lips utter praise; For thou
teachest me thy statutes.

<span id="an_119:172">119:172</span> Let my tongue sing of thy word; For
all thy commandments are righteousness.

<span id="an_119:173">119:173</span> Let thy hand be ready to help me;
For I have chosen thy precepts.

<span id="an_119:174">119:174</span> I have longed for thy salvation, O
Jehovah; And thy law is my delight.

<span id="an_119:175">119:175</span> Let my soul live, and it shall
praise thee; And let thine ordinances help me.

<span id="an_119:176">119:176</span> I have gone astray like a lost
sheep; Seek thy servant; For I do not forget thy commandments.

<span id="an_120:1">120:1</span> A Song of Ascents. In my distress I
cried unto Jehovah, And he answered me.

<span id="an_120:2">120:2</span> Deliver my soul, O Jehovah, from lying
lips, \[And\] from a deceitful tongue.

<span id="an_120:3">120:3</span> What shall be given unto thee, and what
shall be done more unto thee, Thou deceitful tongue?

<span id="an_120:4">120:4</span> Sharp arrows of the mighty, With coals
of juniper.

<span id="an_120:5">120:5</span> Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech,
That I dwell among the tents of Kedar!

<span id="an_120:6">120:6</span> My soul hath long had her dwelling With
him that hateth peace.

<span id="an_120:7">120:7</span> I am \[for\] peace: But when I speak,
they are for war.

<span id="an_121:1">121:1</span> A Song of Ascents. I will lift up mine
eyes unto the mountains: From whence shall my help come?

<span id="an_121:2">121:2</span> My help \[cometh\] from Jehovah, Who
made heaven and earth.

<span id="an_121:3">121:3</span> He will not suffer thy foot to be
moved: He that keepeth thee will not slumber.

<span id="an_121:4">121:4</span> Behold, he that keepeth Israel Will
neither slumber nor sleep.

<span id="an_121:5">121:5</span> Jehovah is thy keeper: Jehovah is thy
shade upon thy right hand.

<span id="an_121:6">121:6</span> The sun shall not smite thee by day,
Nor the moon by night.

<span id="an_121:7">121:7</span> Jehovah will keep thee from all evil;
He will keep thy soul.

<span id="an_121:8">121:8</span> Jehovah will keep thy going out and thy
coming in From this time forth and for evermore.

<span id="an_122:1">122:1</span> A Song of Ascents; of David. I was glad
when they said unto me, Let us go unto the house of Jehovah.

<span id="an_122:2">122:2</span> Our feet are standing Within thy gates,
O Jerusalem,

<span id="an_122:3">122:3</span> Jerusalem, that art builded As a city
that is compact together;

<span id="an_122:4">122:4</span> Whither the tribes go up, even the
tribes of Jehovah, \[For\] an ordinance for Israel, To give thanks unto
the name of Jehovah.

<span id="an_122:5">122:5</span> For there are set thrones for judgment,
The thrones of the house of David.

<span id="an_122:6">122:6</span> Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: They
shall prosper that love thee.

<span id="an_122:7">122:7</span> Peace be within thy walls, And
prosperity within thy palaces.

<span id="an_122:8">122:8</span> For my brethren and companions' sakes,
I will now say, Peace be within thee.

<span id="an_122:9">122:9</span> For the sake of the house of Jehovah
our God I will seek thy good.

<span id="an_123:1">123:1</span> A Song of Ascents. Unto thee do I lift
up mine eyes, O thou that sittest in the heavens.

<span id="an_123:2">123:2</span> Behold, as the eyes of servants
\[look\] unto the hand of their master, As the eyes of a maid unto the
hand of her mistress; So our eyes \[look\] unto Jehovah our God, Until
he have mercy upon us.

<span id="an_123:3">123:3</span> Have mercy upon us, O Jehovah, have
mercy upon us; For we are exceedingly filled with contempt.

<span id="an_123:4">123:4</span> Our soul is exceedingly filled With the
scoffing of those that are at ease, And with the contempt of the proud.

<span id="an_124:1">124:1</span> A Song of Ascents; of David. If it had
not been Jehovah who was on our side, Let Israel now say,

<span id="an_124:2">124:2</span> If it had not been Jehovah who was on
our side, When men rose up against us;

<span id="an_124:3">124:3</span> Then they had swallowed us up alive,
When their wrath was kindled against us;

<span id="an_124:4">124:4</span> Then the waters had overwhelmed us, The
stream had gone over our soul;

<span id="an_124:5">124:5</span> Then the proud waters had gone over our
soul.

<span id="an_124:6">124:6</span> Blessed be Jehovah, Who hath not given
us as a prey to their teeth.

<span id="an_124:7">124:7</span> Our soul is escaped as a bird out of
the snare of the fowlers: The snare is broken, and we are escaped.

<span id="an_124:8">124:8</span> Our help is in the name of Jehovah, Who
made heaven and earth.

<span id="an_125:1">125:1</span> A Song of Ascents. They that trust in
Jehovah Are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abideth for ever.

<span id="an_125:2">125:2</span> As the mountains are round about
Jerusalem, So Jehovah is round about his people From this time forth and
for evermore.

<span id="an_125:3">125:3</span> For the sceptre of wickedness shall not
rest upon the lot of the righteous; That the righteous put not forth
their hands unto iniquity.

<span id="an_125:4">125:4</span> Do good, O Jehovah, unto those that are
good, And to them that are upright in their hearts.

<span id="an_125:5">125:5</span> But as for such as turn aside unto
their crooked ways, Jehovah will lead them forth with the workers of
iniquity. Peace be upon Israel.

<span id="an_126:1">126:1</span> A Song of Ascents. When Jehovah brought
back those that returned to Zion, We were like unto them that dream.

<span id="an_126:2">126:2</span> Then was our mouth filled with
laughter, And our tongue with singing: Then said they among the nations,
Jehovah hath done great things for them.

<span id="an_126:3">126:3</span> Jehovah hath done great things for us,
\[Whereof\] we are glad.

<span id="an_126:4">126:4</span> Turn again our captivity, O Jehovah, As
the streams in the South.

<span id="an_126:5">126:5</span> They that sow in tears shall reap in
joy.

<span id="an_126:6">126:6</span> He that goeth forth and weepeth,
bearing seed for sowing, Shall doubtless come again with joy, bringing
his sheaves \[with him\].

<span id="an_127:1">127:1</span> A Song of Ascents; of Solomon. Except
Jehovah build the house, They labor in vain that build it: Except
Jehovah keep the city, The watchman waketh but in vain.

<span id="an_127:2">127:2</span> It is vain for you to rise up early, To
take rest late, To eat the bread of toil; \[For\] so he giveth unto his
beloved sleep.

<span id="an_127:3">127:3</span> Lo, children are a heritage of Jehovah;
\[And\] the fruit of the womb is \[his\] reward.

<span id="an_127:4">127:4</span> As arrows in the hand of a mighty man,
So are the children of youth.

<span id="an_127:5">127:5</span> Happy is the man that hath his quiver
full of them: They shall not be put to shame, When they speak with their
enemies in the gate.

<span id="an_128:1">128:1</span> A Song of Ascents. Blessed is every one
that feareth Jehovah, That walketh in his ways.

<span id="an_128:2">128:2</span> For thou shalt eat the labor of thy
hands: Happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.

<span id="an_128:3">128:3</span> Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine,
In the innermost parts of thy house; Thy children like olive plants,
Round about thy table.

<span id="an_128:4">128:4</span> Behold, thus shall the man be blessed
That feareth Jehovah.

<span id="an_128:5">128:5</span> Jehovah bless thee out of Zion: And see
thou the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.

<span id="an_128:6">128:6</span> Yea, see thou thy children's children.
Peace be upon Israel.

<span id="an_129:1">129:1</span> A Song of Ascents. Many a time have
they afflicted me from my youth up, Let Israel now say,

<span id="an_129:2">129:2</span> Many a time have they afflicted me from
my youth up: Yet they have not prevailed against me.

<span id="an_129:3">129:3</span> The plowers plowed upon my back; They
made long their furrows.

<span id="an_129:4">129:4</span> Jehovah is righteous: He hath cut
asunder the cords of the wicked.

<span id="an_129:5">129:5</span> Let them be put to shame and turned
backward, All they that hate Zion.

<span id="an_129:6">129:6</span> Let them be as the grass upon the
housetops, Which withereth before it groweth up;

<span id="an_129:7">129:7</span> Wherewith the reaper filleth not his
hand, Nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.

<span id="an_129:8">129:8</span> Neither do they that go by say, The
blessing of Jehovah be upon you; We bless you in the name of Jehovah.

<span id="an_130:1">130:1</span> A Song of Ascents. Out of the depths
have I cried unto thee, O Jehovah.

<span id="an_130:2">130:2</span> Lord, hear my voice: Let thine ears be
attentive To the voice of my supplications.

<span id="an_130:3">130:3</span> If thou, Jehovah, shouldest mark
iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?

<span id="an_130:4">130:4</span> But there is forgiveness with thee,
That thou mayest be feared.

<span id="an_130:5">130:5</span> I wait for Jehovah, my soul doth wait,
And in his word do I hope.

<span id="an_130:6">130:6</span> My soul \[waiteth\] for the Lord More
than watchmen \[wait\] for the morning; \[Yea, more than\] watchmen for
the morning.

<span id="an_130:7">130:7</span> O Israel, hope in Jehovah; For with
Jehovah there is lovingkindness, And with him is plenteous redemption.

<span id="an_130:8">130:8</span> And he will redeem Israel From all his
iniquities.

<span id="an_131:1">131:1</span> A Song of Ascents; of David. Jehovah,
my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; Neither do I exercise
myself in great matters, Or in things too wonderful for me.

<span id="an_131:2">131:2</span> Surely I have stilled and quieted my
soul; Like a weaned child with his mother, Like a weaned child is my
soul within me.

<span id="an_131:3">131:3</span> O Israel, hope in Jehovah From this
time forth and for evermore.

<span id="an_132:1">132:1</span> A Song of Ascents. Jehovah, remember
for David All his affliction;

<span id="an_132:2">132:2</span> How he sware unto Jehovah, And vowed
unto the Mighty One of Jacob:

<span id="an_132:3">132:3</span> Surely I will not come into the
tabernacle of my house, Nor go up into my bed;

<span id="an_132:4">132:4</span> I will not give sleep to mine eyes, Or
slumber to mine eyelids;

<span id="an_132:5">132:5</span> Until I find out a place for Jehovah, A
tabernacle for the Mighty One of Jacob.

<span id="an_132:6">132:6</span> Lo, we heard of it in Ephrathah: We
found it in the field of the wood.

<span id="an_132:7">132:7</span> We will go into his tabernacles; We
will worship at his footstool.

<span id="an_132:8">132:8</span> Arise, O Jehovah, into thy
resting-place; Thou, and the ark of thy strength.

<span id="an_132:9">132:9</span> Let thy priest be clothed with
righteousness; And let thy saints shout for joy.

<span id="an_132:10">132:10</span> For thy servant David's sake Turn not
away the face of thine anointed.

<span id="an_132:11">132:11</span> Jehovah hath sworn unto David in
truth; He will not turn from it: Of the fruit of thy body will I set
upon thy throne.

<span id="an_132:12">132:12</span> If thy children will keep my covenant
And my testimony that I shall teach them, Their children also shall sit
upon thy throne for evermore.

<span id="an_132:13">132:13</span> For Jehovah hath chosen Zion; He hath
desired it for his habitation.

<span id="an_132:14">132:14</span> This is my resting-place for ever:
Here will I dwell; for I have desired it.

<span id="an_132:15">132:15</span> I will abundantly bless her
provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.

<span id="an_132:16">132:16</span> Her priests also will I clothe with
salvation; And her saints shall shout aloud for joy.

<span id="an_132:17">132:17</span> There will I make the horn of David
to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.

<span id="an_132:18">132:18</span> His enemies will I clothe with shame;
But upon himself shall his crown flourish.

<span id="an_133:1">133:1</span> A Song of Ascents; of David. Behold,
how good and how pleasant it is For brethren to dwell together in unity!

<span id="an_133:2">133:2</span> It is like the precious oil upon the
head, That ran down upon the beard, Even Aaron's beard; That came down
upon the skirt of his garments;

<span id="an_133:3">133:3</span> Like the dew of Hermon, That cometh
down upon the mountains of Zion: For there Jehovah commanded the
blessing, Even life for evermore.

<span id="an_134:1">134:1</span> A Song of Ascents. Behold, bless ye
Jehovah, all ye servants of Jehovah, That by night stand in the house of
Jehovah.

<span id="an_134:2">134:2</span> Lift up your hands to the sanctuary,
And bless ye Jehovah.

<span id="an_134:3">134:3</span> Jehovah bless thee out of Zion; Even he
that made heaven and earth.

<span id="an_135:1">135:1</span> Praise ye Jehovah. Praise ye the name
of Jehovah; Praise \[him\], O ye servants of Jehovah,

<span id="an_135:2">135:2</span> Ye that stand in the house of Jehovah,
In the courts of the house of our God.

<span id="an_135:3">135:3</span> Praise ye Jehovah; for Jehovah is good:
Sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.

<span id="an_135:4">135:4</span> For Jehovah hath chosen Jacob unto
himself, \[And\] Israel for his own possession.

<span id="an_135:5">135:5</span> For I know that Jehovah is great, And
that our Lord is above all gods.

<span id="an_135:6">135:6</span> Whatsoever Jehovah pleased, that hath
he done, In heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps;

<span id="an_135:7">135:7</span> Who causeth the vapors to ascend from
the ends of the earth; Who maketh lightnings for the rain; Who bringeth
forth the wind out of his treasuries;

<span id="an_135:8">135:8</span> Who smote the first-born of Egypt, Both
of man and beast;

<span id="an_135:9">135:9</span> Who sent signs and wonders into the
midst of thee, O Egypt, Upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants;

<span id="an_135:10">135:10</span> Who smote many nations, And slew
mighty kings,

<span id="an_135:11">135:11</span> Sihon king of the Amorites, And Og
king of Bashan, And all the kingdoms of Canaan,

<span id="an_135:12">135:12</span> And gave their land for a heritage, A
heritage unto Israel his people.

<span id="an_135:13">135:13</span> Thy name, O Jehovah, \[endureth\] for
ever; Thy memorial \[name\], O Jehovah, throughout all generations.

<span id="an_135:14">135:14</span> For Jehovah will judge his people,
And repent himself concerning his servants.

<span id="an_135:15">135:15</span> The idols of the nations are silver
and gold, The work of men's hands.

<span id="an_135:16">135:16</span> They have mouths, but they speak not;
Eyes have they, but they see not;

<span id="an_135:17">135:17</span> They have ears, but they hear not;
Neither is there any breath in their mouths.

<span id="an_135:18">135:18</span> They that make them shall be like
unto them; Yea, every one that trusteth in them.

<span id="an_135:19">135:19</span> O house of Israel, bless ye Jehovah:
O house of Aaron, bless ye Jehovah:

<span id="an_135:20">135:20</span> O house of Levi, bless ye Jehovah: Ye
that fear Jehovah, bless ye Jehovah.

<span id="an_135:21">135:21</span> Blessed be Jehovah out of Zion, Who
dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye Jehovah.

<span id="an_136:1">136:1</span> Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is
good; For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_136:2">136:2</span> Oh give thanks unto the God of gods;
For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_136:3">136:3</span> Oh give thanks unto the Lord of lords;
For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever:

<span id="an_136:4">136:4</span> To him who alone doeth great wonders;
For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever:

<span id="an_136:5">136:5</span> To him that by understanding made the
heavens; For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever:

<span id="an_136:6">136:6</span> To him that spread forth the earth
above the waters; For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever:

<span id="an_136:7">136:7</span> To him that made great lights; For his
lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever:

<span id="an_136:8">136:8</span> The sun to rule by day; For his
lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever;

<span id="an_136:9">136:9</span> The moon and stars to rule by night;
For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever:

<span id="an_136:10">136:10</span> To him that smote Egypt in their
first-born; For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever;

<span id="an_136:11">136:11</span> And brought out Israel from among
them; For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever;

<span id="an_136:12">136:12</span> With a strong hand, and with an
outstretched arm; For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever:

<span id="an_136:13">136:13</span> To him that divided the Red Sea in
sunder; For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever;

<span id="an_136:14">136:14</span> And made Israel to pass through the
midst of it; For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever;

<span id="an_136:15">136:15</span> But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in
the Red Sea; For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever:

<span id="an_136:16">136:16</span> To him that led his people through
the wilderness; For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever:

<span id="an_136:17">136:17</span> To him that smote great kings; For
his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever;

<span id="an_136:18">136:18</span> And slew famous kings; For his
lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever:

<span id="an_136:19">136:19</span> Sihon king of the Amorites; For his
lovingkindness \[endureth\] forever;

<span id="an_136:20">136:20</span> And Og king of Bashan; For his
lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever;

<span id="an_136:21">136:21</span> And gave their land for a heritage;
For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever;

<span id="an_136:22">136:22</span> Even a heritage unto Israel his
servant; For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever:

<span id="an_136:23">136:23</span> Who remembered us in our low estate;
For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever;

<span id="an_136:24">136:24</span> And hath delivered us from our
adversaries; For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever:

<span id="an_136:25">136:25</span> Who giveth food to all flesh; For his
lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_136:26">136:26</span> Oh give thanks unto the God of
heaven; For his lovingkindness \[endureth\] for ever.

<span id="an_137:1">137:1</span> By the rivers of Babylon, There we sat
down, yea, we wept, When we remembered Zion.

<span id="an_137:2">137:2</span> Upon the willows in the midst thereof
We hanged up our harps.

<span id="an_137:3">137:3</span> For there they that led us captive
required of us songs, And they that wasted us \[required of us\] mirth,
\[saying\], Sing us one of the songs of Zion.

<span id="an_137:4">137:4</span> How shall we sing Jehovah's song In a
foreign land?

<span id="an_137:5">137:5</span> If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, Let my
right hand forget \[her skill\].

<span id="an_137:6">137:6</span> Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my
mouth, If I remember thee not; If I prefer not Jerusalem Above my chief
joy.

<span id="an_137:7">137:7</span> Remember, O Jehovah, against the
children of Edom The day of Jerusalem; Who said, Rase it, rase it, Even
to the foundation thereof.

<span id="an_137:8">137:8</span> O daughter of Babylon, that art to be
destroyed, Happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee As thou hast served
us.

<span id="an_137:9">137:9</span> Happy shall he be, that taketh and
dasheth thy little ones Against the rock.

<span id="an_138:1">138:1</span> A \[Psalm\] of David. I will give thee
thanks with my whole heart: Before the gods will I sing praises unto
thee.

<span id="an_138:2">138:2</span> I will worship toward thy holy temple,
And give thanks unto thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth:
For thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.

<span id="an_138:3">138:3</span> In the day that I called thou
answeredst me, Thou didst encourage me with strength in my soul.

<span id="an_138:4">138:4</span> All the kings of the earth shall give
thee thanks, O Jehovah, For they have heard the words of thy mouth.

<span id="an_138:5">138:5</span> Yea, they shall sing of the ways of
Jehovah; For great is the glory of Jehovah.

<span id="an_138:6">138:6</span> For though Jehovah is high, yet hath he
respect unto the lowly; But the haughty he knoweth from afar.

<span id="an_138:7">138:7</span> Though I walk in the midst of trouble,
thou wilt revive me; Thou wilt stretch forth thy hand against the wrath
of mine enemies, And thy right hand will save me.

<span id="an_138:8">138:8</span> Jehovah will perfect that which
concerneth me: Thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, \[endureth\] for ever;
Forsake not the works of thine own hands.

<span id="an_139:1">139:1</span> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of
David. O Jehovah, thou hast searched me, and known \[me\].

<span id="an_139:2">139:2</span> Thou knowest my downsitting and mine
uprising; Thou understandest my thought afar off.

<span id="an_139:3">139:3</span> Thou searchest out my path and my lying
down, And art acquainted with all my ways.

<span id="an_139:4">139:4</span> For there is not a word in my tongue,
But, lo, O Jehovah, thou knowest it altogether.

<span id="an_139:5">139:5</span> Thou hast beset me behind and before,
And laid thy hand upon me.

<span id="an_139:6">139:6</span> \[Such\] knowledge is too wonderful for
me; It is high, I cannot attain unto it.

<span id="an_139:7">139:7</span> Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? Or
whither shall I flee from thy presence?

<span id="an_139:8">139:8</span> If I ascend up into heaven, thou art
there: If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou art there.

<span id="an_139:9">139:9</span> If I take the wings of the morning, And
dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;

<span id="an_139:10">139:10</span> Even there shall thy hand lead me,
And thy right hand shall hold me.

<span id="an_139:11">139:11</span> If I say, Surely the darkness shall
overwhelm me, And the light about me shall be night;

<span id="an_139:12">139:12</span> Even the darkness hideth not from
thee, But the night shineth as the day: The darkness and the light are
both alike \[to thee\].

<span id="an_139:13">139:13</span> For thou didst form my inward parts:
Thou didst cover me in my mother's womb.

<span id="an_139:14">139:14</span> I will give thanks unto thee; for I
am fearfully and wonderfully made: Wonderful are thy works; And that my
soul knoweth right well.

<span id="an_139:15">139:15</span> My frame was not hidden from thee,
When I was made in secret, \[And\] curiously wrought in the lowest parts
of the earth.

<span id="an_139:16">139:16</span> Thine eyes did see mine unformed
substance; And in thy book they were all written, \[Even\] the days that
were ordained \[for me\], When as yet there was none of them.

<span id="an_139:17">139:17</span> How precious also are thy thoughts
unto me, O God! How great is the sum of them!

<span id="an_139:18">139:18</span> If I should count them, they are more
in number than the sand: When I awake, I am still with thee.

<span id="an_139:19">139:19</span> Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O
God: Depart from me therefore, ye bloodthirsty men.

<span id="an_139:20">139:20</span> For they speak against thee wickedly,
And thine enemies take \[thy name\] in vain.

<span id="an_139:21">139:21</span> Do not I hate them, O Jehovah, that
hate thee? And am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?

<span id="an_139:22">139:22</span> I hate them with perfect hatred: They
are become mine enemies.

<span id="an_139:23">139:23</span> Search me, O God, and know my heart:
Try me, and know my thoughts;

<span id="an_139:24">139:24</span> And see if there be any wicked way in
me, And lead me in the way everlasting.

<span id="an_140:1">140:1</span> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of
David. Deliver me, O Jehovah, from the evil man; Preserve me from the
violent man:

<span id="an_140:2">140:2</span> Who devise mischiefs in their heart;
Continually do they gather themselves together for war.

<span id="an_140:3">140:3</span> They have sharpened their tongue like a
serpent; Adders' poison is under their lips. Selah

<span id="an_140:4">140:4</span> Keep me, O Jehovah, from the hands of
the wicked; Preserve me from the violent man: Who have purposed to
thrust aside my steps.

<span id="an_140:5">140:5</span> The proud have hid a snare for me, and
cords; They have spread a net by the wayside; They have set gins for me.
Selah

<span id="an_140:6">140:6</span> I said unto Jehovah, Thou art my God:
Give ear unto the voice of my supplications, O Jehovah.

<span id="an_140:7">140:7</span> O Jehovah the Lord, the strength of my
salvation, Thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.

<span id="an_140:8">140:8</span> Grant not, O Jehovah, the desires of
the wicked; Further not his evil device, \[lest\] they exalt themselves.
Selah

<span id="an_140:9">140:9</span> As for the head of those that compass
me about, Let the mischief of their own lips cover them.

<span id="an_140:10">140:10</span> Let burning coals fall upon them: Let
them be cast into the fire, Into deep pits, whence they shall not rise.

<span id="an_140:11">140:11</span> An evil speaker shall not be
established in the earth: Evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow
him.

<span id="an_140:12">140:12</span> I know that Jehovah will maintain the
cause of the afflicted, And justice for the needy.

<span id="an_140:13">140:13</span> Surely the righteous shall give
thanks unto thy name: The upright shall dwell in thy presence.

<span id="an_141:1">141:1</span> A Psalm of David. Jehovah, I have
called upon thee; make haste unto me: Give ear unto my voice, when I
call unto thee.

<span id="an_141:2">141:2</span> Let my prayer be set forth as incense
before thee; The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.

<span id="an_141:3">141:3</span> Set a watch, O Jehovah, before my
mouth; Keep the door of my lips.

<span id="an_141:4">141:4</span> Incline not my heart to any evil thing,
To practise deeds of wickedness With men that work iniquity: And let me
not eat of their dainties.

<span id="an_141:5">141:5</span> Let the righteous smite me, \[it shall
be\] a kindness; And let him reprove me, \[it shall be as\] oil upon the
head; Let not my head refuse it: For even in their wickedness shall my
prayer continue.

<span id="an_141:6">141:6</span> Their judges are thrown down by the
sides of the rock; And they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.

<span id="an_141:7">141:7</span> As when one ploweth and cleaveth the
earth, Our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.

<span id="an_141:8">141:8</span> For mine eyes are unto thee, O Jehovah
the Lord: In thee do I take refuge; leave not my soul destitute.

<span id="an_141:9">141:9</span> Keep me from the snare which they have
laid for me, And from the gins of the workers of iniquity.

<span id="an_141:10">141:10</span> Let the wicked fall into their own
nets, Whilst that I withal escape.

<span id="an_142:1">142:1</span> Maschil of David, when he was in the
cave; a Prayer. I cry with my voice unto Jehovah; With my voice unto
Jehovah do I make supplication.

<span id="an_142:2">142:2</span> I pour out my complaint before him; I
show before him my trouble.

<span id="an_142:3">142:3</span> When my spirit was overwhelmed within
me, Thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walk Have they hidden a
snare for me.

<span id="an_142:4">142:4</span> Look on \[my\] right hand, and see; For
there is no man that knoweth me: Refuge hath failed me; No man careth
for my soul.

<span id="an_142:5">142:5</span> I cried unto thee, O Jehovah; I said,
Thou art my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.

<span id="an_142:6">142:6</span> Attend unto my cry; For I am brought
very low: Deliver me from my persecutors; For they are stronger than I.

<span id="an_142:7">142:7</span> Bring my soul out of prison, That I may
give thanks unto thy name: The righteous shall compass me about; For
thou wilt deal bountifully with me.

<span id="an_143:1">143:1</span> A Psalm of David. Hear my prayer, O
Jehovah; give ear to my supplications: In thy faithfulness answer me,
\[and\] in thy righteousness.

<span id="an_143:2">143:2</span> And enter not into judgment with thy
servant; For in thy sight no man living is righteous.

<span id="an_143:3">143:3</span> For the enemy hath persecuted my soul;
He hath smitten my life down to the ground: He hath made me to dwell in
dark places, as those that have been long dead.

<span id="an_143:4">143:4</span> Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed
within me; My heart within me is desolate.

<span id="an_143:5">143:5</span> I remember the days of old; I meditate
on all thy doings; I muse on the work of thy hands.

<span id="an_143:6">143:6</span> I spread forth my hands unto thee: My
soul \[thirsteth\] after thee, as a weary land. Selah

<span id="an_143:7">143:7</span> Make haste to answer me, O Jehovah; my
spirit faileth: Hide not thy face from me, Lest I become like them that
go down into the pit.

<span id="an_143:8">143:8</span> Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in
the morning; For in thee do I trust: Cause me to know the way wherein I
should walk; For I lift up my soul unto thee.

<span id="an_143:9">143:9</span> Deliver me, O Jehovah, from mine
enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.

<span id="an_143:10">143:10</span> Teach me to do thy will; For thou art
my God: Thy Spirit is good; Lead me in the land of uprightness.

<span id="an_143:11">143:11</span> Quicken me, O Jehovah, for thy name's
sake: In thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.

<span id="an_143:12">143:12</span> And in thy lovingkindness cut off
mine enemies, And destroy all them that afflict my soul; For I am thy
servant.

<span id="an_144:1">144:1</span> \[A Psalm\] of David. Blessed be
Jehovah my rock, Who teacheth my hands to war, \[And\] my fingers to
fight:

<span id="an_144:2">144:2</span> My lovingkindness, and my fortress, My
high tower, and my deliverer; My shield, and he in whom I take refuge;
Who subdueth my people under me.

<span id="an_144:3">144:3</span> Jehovah, what is man, that thou takest
knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that thou makest account of him?

<span id="an_144:4">144:4</span> Man is like to vanity: His days are as
a shadow that passeth away.

<span id="an_144:5">144:5</span> Bow thy heavens, O Jehovah, and come
down: Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.

<span id="an_144:6">144:6</span> Cast forth lightning, and scatter them;
Send out thine arrows, and discomfit them.

<span id="an_144:7">144:7</span> Stretch forth thy hand from above;
Rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, Out of the hand of
aliens;

<span id="an_144:8">144:8</span> Whose mouth speaketh deceit, And whose
right hand is a right hand of falsehood.

<span id="an_144:9">144:9</span> I will sing a new song unto thee, O
God: Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.

<span id="an_144:10">144:10</span> Thou art he that giveth salvation
unto kings; Who rescueth David his servant from the hurtful sword.

<span id="an_144:11">144:11</span> Rescue me, and deliver me out of the
hand of aliens, Whose mouth speaketh deceit, And whose right hand is a
right hand of falsehood.

<span id="an_144:12">144:12</span> When our sons shall be as plants
grown up in their youth, And our daughters as corner-stones hewn after
the fashion of a palace;

<span id="an_144:13">144:13</span> \[When\] our garners are full,
affording all manner of store, \[And\] our sheep bring forth thousands
and ten thousands in our fields;

<span id="an_144:14">144:14</span> \[When\] our oxen are well laden;
\[When there is\] no breaking in, and no going forth, And no outcry in
our streets:

<span id="an_144:15">144:15</span> Happy is the people that is in such a
case; \[Yea\], happy is the people whose God is Jehovah.

<span id="an_145:1">145:1</span> \[A\] \[Psalm\] \[of\] praise; of
David. I will extol thee, my God, O King; And I will bless thy name for
ever and ever.

<span id="an_145:2">145:2</span> Every day will I bless thee; And I will
praise thy name for ever and ever.

<span id="an_145:3">145:3</span> Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be
praised; And his greatness is unsearchable.

<span id="an_145:4">145:4</span> One generation shall laud thy works to
another, And shall declare thy mighty acts.

<span id="an_145:5">145:5</span> Of the glorious majesty of thine honor,
And of thy wondrous works, will I meditate.

<span id="an_145:6">145:6</span> And men shall speak of the might of thy
terrible acts; And I will declare thy greatness.

<span id="an_145:7">145:7</span> They shall utter the memory of thy
great goodness, And shall sing of thy righteousness.

<span id="an_145:8">145:8</span> Jehovah is gracious, and merciful; Slow
to anger, and of great lovingkindness.

<span id="an_145:9">145:9</span> Jehovah is good to all; And his tender
mercies are over all his works.

<span id="an_145:10">145:10</span> All thy works shall give thanks unto
thee, O Jehovah; And thy saints shall bless thee.

<span id="an_145:11">145:11</span> They shall speak of the glory of thy
kingdom, And talk of thy power;

<span id="an_145:12">145:12</span> To make known to the sons of men his
mighty acts, And the glory of the majesty of his kingdom.

<span id="an_145:13">145:13</span> Thy kingdom is an everlasting
kingdom, And thy dominion \[endureth\] throughout all generations.

<span id="an_145:14">145:14</span> Jehovah upholdeth all that fall, And
raiseth up all those that are bowed down.

<span id="an_145:15">145:15</span> The eyes of all wait for thee; And
thou givest them their food in due season.

<span id="an_145:16">145:16</span> Thou openest thy hand, And satisfiest
the desire of every living thing.

<span id="an_145:17">145:17</span> Jehovah is righteous in all his ways,
And gracious in all his works.

<span id="an_145:18">145:18</span> Jehovah is nigh unto all them that
call upon him, To all that call upon him in truth.

<span id="an_145:19">145:19</span> He will fulfil the desire of them
that fear him; He also will hear their cry and will save them.

<span id="an_145:20">145:20</span> Jehovah preserveth all them that love
him; But all the wicked will he destroy.

<span id="an_145:21">145:21</span> My mouth shall speak the praise of
Jehovah; And let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.

<span id="an_146:1">146:1</span> Praise ye Jehovah. Praise Jehovah, O my
soul.

<span id="an_146:2">146:2</span> While I live will I praise Jehovah: I
will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.

<span id="an_146:3">146:3</span> Put not your trust in princes, Nor in
the son of man, in whom there is no help.

<span id="an_146:4">146:4</span> His breath goeth forth, he returneth to
his earth; In that very day his thoughts perish.

<span id="an_146:5">146:5</span> Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob
for his help, Whose hope is in Jehovah his God:

<span id="an_146:6">146:6</span> Who made heaven and earth, The sea, and
all that in them is; Who keepeth truth for ever;

<span id="an_146:7">146:7</span> Who executeth justice for the
oppressed; Who giveth food to the hungry. Jehovah looseth the prisoners;

<span id="an_146:8">146:8</span> Jehovah openeth \[the eyes of\] the
blind; Jehovah raiseth up them that are bowed down; Jehovah loveth the
righteous;

<span id="an_146:9">146:9</span> Jehovah preserveth the sojourners; He
upholdeth the fatherless and widow; But the way of the wicked he turneth
upside down.

<span id="an_146:10">146:10</span> Jehovah will reign for ever, Thy God,
O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye Jehovah.

<span id="an_147:1">147:1</span> Praise ye Jehovah; For it is good to
sing praises unto our God; For it is pleasant, \[and\] praise is comely.

<span id="an_147:2">147:2</span> Jehovah doth build up Jerusalem; He
gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.

<span id="an_147:3">147:3</span> He healeth the broken in heart, And
bindeth up their wounds.

<span id="an_147:4">147:4</span> He counteth the number of the stars; He

the wicked down to the ground.

<span id="an_147:7">147:7</span> Sing unto Jehovah with thanksgiving;
Sing praises upon the harp unto our God,

Who prepareth rain for the earth, Who maketh grass to grow upon the
mountains.

<span id="an_147:9">147:9</span> He giveth to the beast his food,
\[And\] to the young ravens which cry.

<span id="an_147:10">147:10</span> He delighteth not in the strength of
the horse: He taketh no pleasure in the legs of a man.

<span id="an_147:11">147:11</span> Jehovah taketh pleasure in them that
fear him, In those that hope in his lovingkindness.

<span id="an_147:12">147:12</span> Praise Jehovah, O Jerusalem; Praise

<span id="an_147:15">147:15</span> He sendeth out his commandment upon
earth; His word runneth very swiftly.

<span id="an_147:16">147:16</span> He giveth snow like wool; He
scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes.

<span id="an_147:17">147:17</span> He casteth forth his ice like
morsels: Who can stand before his cold?

<span id="an_147:18">147:18</span> He sendeth out his word, and melteth
them: He causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.

<span id="an_147:19">147:19</span> He showeth his word unto Jacob, His
statutes and his ordinances unto Israel.

<span id="an_147:20">147:20</span> He hath not dealt so with any nation;

wind, fulfilling his word;

<span id="an_148:9">148:9</span> Mountains and all hills; Fruitful trees
and all cedars;

<span id="an_148:10">148:10</span> Beasts and all cattle; Creeping
things and flying birds;

<span id="an_148:11">148:11</span> Kings of the earth and all peoples;
Princes and all judges of the earth;

For his name alone is exalted; His glory is above the earth and the
heavens.

sing for joy upon their beds.

<span id="an_149:6">149:6</span> \[Let\] the high praises of God \[be\]
in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand;

<span id="an_149:7">149:7</span> To execute vengeance upon the nations,
And punishments upon the peoples;

<span id="an_149:8">149:8</span> To bind their kings with chains, And
their nobles with fetters of iron;

<span id="an_149:9">149:9</span> To execute upon them the judgment
written: This honor have all his saints. Praise ye Jehovah.
