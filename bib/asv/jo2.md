### American Standard Version: 2 John

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> The elder unto the elect lady and her
children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all they that
know the truth;

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> for the truth's sake which abideth in us,
and it shall be with us for ever:

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Grace, mercy, peace shall be with us, from
God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth
and love.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> I rejoice greatly that I have found
\[certain\] of thy children walking in truth, even as we received
commandment from the Father.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though
I wrote to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the
beginning, that we love one another.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> And this is love, that we should walk after
his commandments. This is the commandment, even as ye heard from the
beginning, that ye should walk in it.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> For many deceivers are gone forth into the
world, \[even\] they that confess not that Jesus Christ cometh in the
flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> Look to yourselves, that ye lose not the
things which we have wrought, but that ye receive a full reward.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> Whosoever goeth onward and abideth not in
the teaching of Christ, hath not God: he that abideth in the teaching,
the same hath both the Father and the Son.

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> If any one cometh unto you, and bringeth
not this teaching, receive him not into \[your\] house, and give him no
greeting:

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> for he that giveth him greeting partaketh
in his evil works.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Having many things to write unto you, I
would not \[write them\] with paper and ink: but I hope to come unto
you, and to speak face to face, that your joy may be made full.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> The children of thine elect sister salute
thee.
