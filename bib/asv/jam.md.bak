### American Standard Version: James

<span id="an_1:1">1:1</span> James, a servant of God and of the Lord
Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are of the Dispersion,
greeting.

<span id="an_1:2">1:2</span> Count it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall
into manifold temptations;

<span id="an_1:3">1:3</span> Knowing that the proving of your faith
worketh patience.

<span id="an_1:4">1:4</span> And let patience have \[its\] perfect work,
that ye may be perfect and entire, lacking in nothing.

<span id="an_1:5">1:5</span> But if any of you lacketh wisdom, let him
ask of God, who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall
be given him.

<span id="an_1:6">1:6</span> But let him ask in faith, nothing doubting:
for he that doubteth is like the surge of the sea driven by the wind and
tossed.

<span id="an_1:7">1:7</span> For let not that man think that he shall
receive anything of the Lord;

<span id="an_1:8">1:8</span> a doubleminded man, unstable in all his
ways.

<span id="an_1:9">1:9</span> But let the brother of low degree glory in
his high estate:

<span id="an_1:10">1:10</span> and the rich, in that he is made low:
because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.

<span id="an_1:11">1:11</span> For the sun ariseth with the scorching
wind, and withereth the grass: and the flower thereof falleth, and the
grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade
away in his goings.

<span id="an_1:12">1:12</span> Blessed is the man that endureth
temptation; for when he hath been approved, he shall receive the crown
of life, which \[the Lord\] promised to them that love him.

<span id="an_1:13">1:13</span> Let no man say when he is tempted, I am
tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself
tempteth no man:

<span id="an_1:14">1:14</span> but each man is tempted, when he is drawn
away by his own lust, and enticed.

<span id="an_1:15">1:15</span> Then the lust, when it hath conceived,
beareth sin: and the sin, when it is fullgrown, bringeth forth death.

<span id="an_1:16">1:16</span> Be not deceived, my beloved brethren.

<span id="an_1:17">1:17</span> Every good gift and every perfect gift is
from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no
variation, neither shadow that is cast by turning.

<span id="an_1:18">1:18</span> Of his own will he brought us forth by
the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his
creatures.

<span id="an_1:19">1:19</span> Ye know \[this\], my beloved brethren.
But let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:

<span id="an_1:20">1:20</span> for the wrath of man worketh not the
righteousness of God.

<span id="an_1:21">1:21</span> Wherefore putting away all filthiness and
overflowing of wickedness, receive with meekness the implanted word,
which is able to save your souls.

<span id="an_1:22">1:22</span> But be ye doers of the word, and not
hearers only, deluding your own selves.

<span id="an_1:23">1:23</span> For if any one is a hearer of the word
and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a
mirror:

<span id="an_1:24">1:24</span> for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away,
and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.

<span id="an_1:25">1:25</span> But he that looketh into the perfect law,
the \[law\] of liberty, and \[so\] continueth, being not a hearer that
forgetteth but a doer that worketh, this man shall be blessed in his
doing.

<span id="an_1:26">1:26</span> If any man thinketh himself to be
religious, while he bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his heart,
this man's religion is vain.

<span id="an_1:27">1:27</span> Pure religion and undefiled before our
God and Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their
affliction, \[and\] to keep oneself unspotted from the world.

<span id="an_2:1">2:1</span> My brethren, hold not the faith of our Lord
Jesus Christ, \[the Lord\] of glory, with respect of persons.

<span id="an_2:2">2:2</span> For if there come into your synagogue a man
with a gold ring, in fine clothing, and there come in also a poor man in
vile clothing;

<span id="an_2:3">2:3</span> and ye have regard to him that weareth the
fine clothing, and say, Sit thou here in a good place; and ye say to the
poor man, Stand thou there, or sit under my footstool;

<span id="an_2:4">2:4</span> Do ye not make distinctions among
yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?

<span id="an_2:5">2:5</span> Hearken, my beloved brethren; did not God
choose them that are poor as to the world \[to be\] rich in faith, and
heirs of the kingdom which he promised to them that love him?

<span id="an_2:6">2:6</span> But ye have dishonored the poor man. Do not
the rich oppress you, and themselves drag you before the judgment-seats?

<span id="an_2:7">2:7</span> Do not they blaspheme the honorable name by
which ye are called?

<span id="an_2:8">2:8</span> Howbeit if ye fulfil the royal law,
according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye
do well:

<span id="an_2:9">2:9</span> but if ye have respect of persons, ye
commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.

<span id="an_2:10">2:10</span> For whosoever shall keep the whole law,
and yet stumble in one \[point\], he is become guilty of all.

<span id="an_2:11">2:11</span> For he that said, Do not commit adultery,
said also, Do not kill. Now if thou dost not commit adultery, but
killest, thou art become a transgressor of the law.

<span id="an_2:12">2:12</span> So speak ye, and so do, as men that are
to be judged by a law of liberty.

<span id="an_2:13">2:13</span> For judgment \[is\] without mercy to him
that hath showed no mercy: mercy glorieth against judgment.

<span id="an_2:14">2:14</span> What doth it profit, my brethren, if a
man say he hath faith, but have not works? can that faith save him?

<span id="an_2:15">2:15</span> If a brother or sister be naked and in
lack of daily food,

<span id="an_2:16">2:16</span> and one of you say unto them, Go in
peace, be ye warmed and filled; and yet ye give them not the things
needful to the body; what doth it profit?

<span id="an_2:17">2:17</span> Even so faith, if it have not works, is
dead in itself.

<span id="an_2:18">2:18</span> Yea, a man will say, Thou hast faith, and
I have works: show me thy faith apart from \[thy\] works, and I by my
works will show thee \[my\] faith.

<span id="an_2:19">2:19</span> Thou believest that God is one; thou
doest well: the demons also believe, and shudder.

<span id="an_2:20">2:20</span> But wilt thou know, O vain man, that
faith apart from works is barren?

<span id="an_2:21">2:21</span> Was not Abraham our father justified by
works, in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?

<span id="an_2:22">2:22</span> Thou seest that faith wrought with his
works, and by works was faith made perfect;

<span id="an_2:23">2:23</span> and the scripture was fulfilled which
saith, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for
righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.

<span id="an_2:24">2:24</span> Ye see that by works a man is justified,
and not only by faith.

<span id="an_2:25">2:25</span> And in like manner was not also Rahab the
harlot justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent
them out another way?

<span id="an_2:26">2:26</span> For as the body apart from the spirit is
dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.

<span id="an_3:1">3:1</span> Be not many \[of you\] teachers, my
brethren, knowing that we shall receive heavier judgment.

<span id="an_3:2">3:2</span> For in many things we all stumble. If any
stumbleth not in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the
whole body also.

<span id="an_3:3">3:3</span> Now if we put the horses' bridles into
their mouths that they may obey us, we turn about their whole body also.

<span id="an_3:4">3:4</span> Behold, the ships also, though they are so
great and are driven by rough winds, are yet turned about by a very
small rudder, whither the impulse of the steersman willeth.

<span id="an_3:5">3:5</span> So the tongue also is a little member, and
boasteth great things. Behold, how much wood is kindled by how small a
fire!

<span id="an_3:6">3:6</span> And the tongue is a fire: the world of
iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defileth the whole body,
and setteth on fire the wheel of nature, and is set on fire by hell.

<span id="an_3:7">3:7</span> For every kind of beasts and birds, of
creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by
mankind.

<span id="an_3:8">3:8</span> But the tongue can no man tame; \[it is\] a
restless evil, \[it is\] full of deadly poison.

<span id="an_3:9">3:9</span> Therewith bless we the Lord and Father; and
therewith curse we men, who are made after the likeness of God:

<span id="an_3:10">3:10</span> out of the same mouth cometh forth
blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.

<span id="an_3:11">3:11</span> Doth the fountain send forth from the
same opening sweet \[water\] and bitter?

<span id="an_3:12">3:12</span> Can a fig tree, my brethren, yield
olives, or a vine figs? Neither \[can\] salt water yield sweet.

<span id="an_3:13">3:13</span> Who is wise and understanding among you?
let him show by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom.

<span id="an_3:14">3:14</span> But if ye have bitter jealousy and
faction in your heart, glory not and lie not against the truth.

<span id="an_3:15">3:15</span> This wisdom is not \[a wisdom\] that
cometh down from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.

<span id="an_3:16">3:16</span> For where jealousy and faction are, there
is confusion and every vile deed.

<span id="an_3:17">3:17</span> But the wisdom that is from above is
first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy
and good fruits, without variance, without hypocrisy.

<span id="an_3:18">3:18</span> And the fruit of righteousness is sown in
peace for them that make peace.

<span id="an_4:1">4:1</span> Whence \[come\] wars and whence \[come\]
fightings among you? \[come they\] not hence, \[even\] of your pleasures
that war in your members?

<span id="an_4:2">4:2</span> Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and covet,
and cannot obtain: ye fight and war; ye have not, because ye ask not.

<span id="an_4:3">4:3</span> Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask
amiss, that ye may spend \[it\] in your pleasures.

<span id="an_4:4">4:4</span> Ye adulteresses, know ye not that the
friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore would be
a friend of the world maketh himself an enemy of God.

<span id="an_4:5">4:5</span> Or think ye that the scripture speaketh in
vain? Doth the spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying?

<span id="an_4:6">4:6</span> But he giveth more grace. Wherefore \[the
scripture\] saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the
humble.

<span id="an_4:7">4:7</span> Be subject therefore unto God; but resist
the devil, and he will flee from you.

<span id="an_4:8">4:8</span> Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to
you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye
doubleminded.

<span id="an_4:9">4:9</span> Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your
laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.

<span id="an_4:10">4:10</span> Humble yourselves in the sight of the
Lord, and he shall exalt you.

<span id="an_4:11">4:11</span> Speak not one against another, brethren.
He that speaketh against a brother, or judgeth his brother, speaketh
against the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judgest the law, thou
art not a doer of the law, but a judge.

<span id="an_4:12">4:12</span> One \[only\] is the lawgiver and judge,
\[even\] he who is able to save and to destroy: but who art thou that
judgest thy neighbor?

<span id="an_4:13">4:13</span> Come now, ye that say, To-day or
to-morrow we will go into this city, and spend a year there, and trade,
and get gain:

<span id="an_4:14">4:14</span> whereas ye know not what shall be on the
morrow. What is your life? For ye are a vapor, that appeareth for a
little time, and then vanisheth away.

<span id="an_4:15">4:15</span> For that ye ought to say, If the Lord
will, we shall both live, and do this or that.

<span id="an_4:16">4:16</span> But now ye glory in your vauntings: all
such glorying is evil.

<span id="an_4:17">4:17</span> To him therefore that knoweth to do good,
and doeth it not, to him it is sin.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Come now, ye rich, weep and howl for your
miseries that are coming upon you.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> Your riches are corrupted, and your
garments are moth-eaten.

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> Your gold and your silver are rusted; and
their rust shall be for a testimony against you, and shall eat your
flesh as fire. Ye have laid up your treasure in the last days.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> Behold, the hire of the laborers who mowed
your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth out: and the
cries of them that reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of
Sabaoth.

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> Ye have lived delicately on the earth, and
taken your pleasure; ye have nourished your hearts in a day of
slaughter.

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> Ye have condemned, ye have killed the
righteous \[one\]; he doth not resist you.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> Be patient therefore, brethren, until the
coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious
fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receive the early
and latter rain.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> Be ye also patient; establish your hearts:
for the coming of the Lord is at hand.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> Murmur not, brethren, one against another,
that ye be not judged: behold, the judge standeth before the doors.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> Take, brethren, for an example of
suffering and of patience, the prophets who spake in the name of the
Lord.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> Behold, we call them blessed that
endured: ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of
the Lord, how that the Lord is full of pity, and merciful.

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> But above all things, my brethren, swear
not, neither by the heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath: but
let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay; that ye fall not under judgment.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> Is any among you suffering? Let him pray.
Is any cheerful? Let him sing praise.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> Is any among you sick? Let him call for
the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with
oil in the name of the Lord:

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> and the prayer of faith shall save him
that is sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed
sins, it shall be forgiven him.

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> Confess therefore your sins one to
another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The
supplication of a righteous man availeth much in its working.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> Elijah was a man of like passions with
us, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain; and it rained not on
the earth for three years and six months.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> And he prayed again; and the heaven gave
rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> My brethren, if any among you err from
the truth, and one convert him;

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> let him know, that he who converteth a
sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall
cover a multitude of sins.
